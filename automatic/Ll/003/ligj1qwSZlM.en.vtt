00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
for that there's only really 5

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.080 
for that there's only really 5
megapixels<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:32.030> shots<00:02:32.300> it<00:02:32.540> takes<00:02:34.030> sort<00:02:35.030> of

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
megapixels the shots it takes sort of

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.090 
megapixels the shots it takes sort of
like<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.300> video<00:02:35.480> cam<00:02:35.690> or<00:02:35.900> pretty<00:02:36.790> in<00:02:37.790> general

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
like the video cam or pretty in general

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:48.559 
like the video cam or pretty in general
let<00:02:40.100> me<00:02:40.220> show<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.459> here

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.430 

and<00:02:49.569> once<00:02:49.750> again<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:49.960> don't<00:02:50.050> know<00:02:50.200> why<00:02:50.380> this

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
and once again I don't know why this

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.620 
and once again I don't know why this
this<00:02:51.069> function<00:02:51.490> is<00:02:51.580> separate<00:02:51.910> from<00:02:51.940> me<00:02:52.330> where

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
this function is separate from me where

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.190 
this function is separate from me where
I<00:02:52.660> really<00:02:53.530> think<00:02:53.650> it's<00:02:53.830> all<00:02:54.990> be<00:02:55.990> together<00:02:56.260> like

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
I really think it's all be together like

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.080 
I really think it's all be together like
this<00:02:59.200> could<00:02:59.410> be<00:02:59.500> striked<00:02:59.770> out<00:02:59.970> photos<00:03:00.970> could

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
this could be striked out photos could

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.690 
this could be striked out photos could
have<00:03:01.150> been<00:03:01.240> from<00:03:01.450> there<00:03:01.630> but<00:03:02.340> it's<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.430> UI<00:03:03.610> a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
have been from there but it's a UI a

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.870 
have been from there but it's a UI a
decision<00:03:04.209> on<00:03:05.940> my<00:03:06.940> most<00:03:07.209> part<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:09.490> only<00:03:09.730> thing

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
decision on my most part the only thing

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.080 
decision on my most part the only thing
is<00:03:10.090> for<00:03:10.690> example<00:03:10.990> here<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.560> loads<00:03:12.070> up<00:03:12.340> default

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
is for example here it loads up default

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.590 
is for example here it loads up default
is<00:03:13.240> to<00:03:13.270> load<00:03:13.570> up<00:03:13.720> every<00:03:14.350> damn<00:03:15.420> picture<00:03:16.420> you've

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
got even if you choose a folder next

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.150 
got even if you choose a folder next
time<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.959> choose<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.410> custom<00:03:23.590> folder<00:03:24.040> or

youtube or something like that you it's
just<00:06:03.620> fine

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:05.969 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:11.409 

I<00:06:07.610> think<00:06:08.610> there's<00:06:08.729> anything<00:06:08.969> else<00:06:09.089> to<00:06:09.239> go<00:06:09.689> over

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
I think there's anything else to go over

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.379 
I think there's anything else to go over
yeah<00:06:12.419> once<00:06:13.169> again<00:06:13.289> you<00:06:13.589> know<00:06:13.649> I<00:06:14.389> suppose

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
yeah once again you know I suppose

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:18.139 
yeah once again you know I suppose
that's<00:06:15.539> it<00:06:15.779> I<00:06:16.529> won't<00:06:17.219> really<00:06:17.339> go<00:06:17.549> into<00:06:17.669> the

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:18.149 
that's it I won't really go into the

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:21.019 
that's it I won't really go into the
mitt<00:06:18.329> of<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:18.599> OB<00:06:19.289> maps<00:06:19.529> to<00:06:20.489> plead<00:06:20.639> bare<00:06:20.789> bones

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
mitt of the OB maps to plead bare bones

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:22.729 
mitt of the OB maps to plead bare bones
like<00:06:21.269> I<00:06:21.360> said<00:06:21.539> there's<00:06:21.839> no<00:06:21.929> integration<00:06:22.409> with

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:22.739 
like I said there's no integration with

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:24.889 
like I said there's no integration with
the<00:06:22.919> rest<00:06:23.159> of<00:06:23.249> the<00:06:23.369> software<00:06:23.669> as<00:06:24.389> far<00:06:24.659> as<00:06:24.749> that

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:24.899 
the rest of the software as far as that

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:30.529 
the rest of the software as far as that
goes<00:06:25.909> so<00:06:28.579> there's<00:06:29.579> not<00:06:29.669> much<00:06:29.909> that<00:06:29.939> except<00:06:30.509> for

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
goes so there's not much that except for

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:32.899 
goes so there's not much that except for
you<00:06:30.809> know<00:06:30.929> we<00:06:31.799> routing<00:06:32.129> and<00:06:32.279> maybe<00:06:32.429> finding<00:06:32.819> a

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
you know we routing and maybe finding a

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:36.109 
you know we routing and maybe finding a
few<00:06:33.059> places<00:06:33.269> i<00:06:34.369> have<00:06:35.369> had<00:06:35.549> trouble<00:06:35.759> trying<00:06:36.089> to

00:06:36.109 --> 00:06:36.119 
few places i have had trouble trying to

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:38.629 
few places i have had trouble trying to
use<00:06:36.299> google<00:06:36.449> maps<00:06:36.749> in<00:06:37.139> here<00:06:37.319> but<00:06:37.639> it's

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 
use google maps in here but it's

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:40.489 
use google maps in here but it's
probably<00:06:38.879> just<00:06:39.029> me<00:06:39.179> at<00:06:39.299> one<00:06:39.449> else<00:06:39.659> has<00:06:39.839> seems

00:06:40.489 --> 00:06:40.499 
probably just me at one else has seems

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:45.769 
probably just me at one else has seems
to<00:06:40.649> work<00:06:40.799> fine<00:06:41.009> i<00:06:41.279> guess<00:06:44.360> there's<00:06:45.360> really<00:06:45.419> not

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:45.779 
to work fine i guess there's really not

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:50.359 
to work fine i guess there's really not
much<00:06:45.959> else<00:06:46.199> to<00:06:46.319> this<00:06:46.739> phone<00:06:47.489> per<00:06:47.789> se<00:06:49.279> you<00:06:50.279> know
