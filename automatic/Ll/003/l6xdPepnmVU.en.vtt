00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 so welcome here to one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.319
 Another round of trouble in my wants and 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.179
 probably notices this a bit 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.309
 other recordings and comment 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.080
 I said this recording after like 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.660
 a little comment but only from 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.119
 minecraft stop and you two see her 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.560
 small clips clips of trouble man im 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.060
 background and indeed looks at 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.730
 both clubs if the states have me 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.350
 bad strater entered trade that 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.460
 one stops a traders activated one has 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.470
 then in any case later will be in 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.880
 I have this round twice in these 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.309
 I took them together 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.540
 have cut activated because I stop 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.739
 from a very nice person a few 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.570
 been given passports but I have 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.930
 thought come on then activated the one 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.100
 know which in recordings and yes have 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.600
 I then made simply block 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.700
 get more beautiful line is 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.110
 that and yes you can see now in the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.110
 very first recording not yet so 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.879
 I'll just say the bad thing now 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.260
 but that a little bit that me 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.910
 but a bit very upset and so 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.180
 we now see that I hold all times 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.680
 keep drumming entertain if it does 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.899
 the time has arrived where has been established 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.629
 Trader in Germany is and so is the duo 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.220
 suddenly yes yes i try people too 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.470
 kill and you just killed random 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.060
 you will indeed look the same do not know whether 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.710
 that already works or so I know 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.670
 just could not be good right now 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.990
 So you have now definitely 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.950
 seen that I have tried one 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.140
 to kill a person 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.310
 yes but then suddenly people 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.080
 besides that , I'm right 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.090
 attack yes and then suddenly 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.650
 people then in the chats a break craft 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.659
 is trader and that she is in the dead 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.970
 so yes what was driving me at the moment ? 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.439
 right on if I could 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.090
 I would like to avoid it when I am 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.520
 I'm honest because I'm honest 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.619
 trader best cost so what and lee people 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.549
 who bought me this wallpaper yes 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.650
 of course have money for it 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.090
 of course and have to be very 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.430
 pity that if you really have this 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.780
 say trade up is free outputs if 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.159
 I just go when you just 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.460
 really killed the whole separation 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.409
 becomes 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.360
 So I 've tried now, I think 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.909
 20 times with michi so with my michael 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.200
 p a round tram 1 wants to record 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.700
 a pretty good round, too 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.920
 maybe five to ten minutes is fine 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.000
 and I would have two minutes or so 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.290
 was the last shot I had 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 I was also killed directly 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.899
 I admit, maybe I'm in the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.610
 really too much too 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.590
 reckless and always just soethe 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.729
 People quickly because I think so 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.560
 Come on, I'm trader, I want it now 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.239
 Just what can be synonymous give 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.550
 At the same time I might too yes 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.620
 fierce but now anyway 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.420
 looks like this is a person and 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.540
 apparently no one stood up either 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.100
 the map here at a will or no that 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.570
 was by block or one on the map 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.280
 but you can see even now when said 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.680
 that wants people in the urban 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.570
 break creates is trader and so and yes 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.740
 I've been killed a car and that 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.840
 everything just always has two 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.770
 minutes or so I take a recording 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.240
 I really believe now too 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.280
 Twentieth or so tried without 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.130
 to pick up the trample naturally 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.210
 Time does not work 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.800
 Probably tried in any case 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.510
 but again if I keep coming back 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.200
 get killed and that's how it is 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.760
 no goal 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.430
 for that comes hunger games or what 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.840
 other and yes I just hate that 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.490
 you always get killed so i would 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.030
 Let's see how they video us next 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.030
 until then
