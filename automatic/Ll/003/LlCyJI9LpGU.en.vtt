so<00:00:00.420> you<00:00:00.510> were<00:00:00.780> wanting<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.290> make<00:00:01.680> some<00:00:02.010> shoes

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
so you were wanting to make some shoes

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.090 
so you were wanting to make some shoes
that<00:00:02.399> lit<00:00:02.909> up<00:00:03.060> whenever<00:00:03.270> you<00:00:03.480> walk<00:00:04.100> whenever

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
that lit up whenever you walk whenever

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.839 
that lit up whenever you walk whenever
you<00:00:05.310> jog<00:00:05.870> whatever<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:07.140> slow<00:00:07.500> step<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.220> then

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
you jog whatever you slow step and then

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.459 
you jog whatever you slow step and then
go<00:00:08.970> into<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.210> shuffle<00:00:09.690> or<00:00:09.809> whatever<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.260> want

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
go into a shuffle or whatever you want

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.290 
go into a shuffle or whatever you want
to<00:00:10.559> do<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.920> mean<00:00:11.340> these<00:00:11.460> things<00:00:11.519> really<00:00:11.969> good

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
to do I mean these things really good

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.089 
to do I mean these things really good
for<00:00:12.540> anything<00:00:12.809> anytime<00:00:13.290> anywhere<00:00:13.500> any<00:00:14.009> place

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
for anything anytime anywhere any place

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.490 
for anything anytime anywhere any place
you<00:00:15.059> just<00:00:15.089> got<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.570> do<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.080> need<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.260> pair

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
you just got to do it so you need a pair

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.830 
you just got to do it so you need a pair
of<00:00:16.529> shoes<00:00:16.800> obviously<00:00:17.789> then<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.510> need<00:00:18.660> some

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
of shoes obviously then you need some

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.170 
of shoes obviously then you need some
LEDs<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.619> flexible<00:00:20.070> kind<00:00:20.279> are<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> best<00:00:20.939> that

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
LEDs the flexible kind are the best that

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.910 
LEDs the flexible kind are the best that
come<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:21.449> adhesive<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> back<00:00:22.260> they<00:00:22.890> have

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
come with adhesive on the back they have

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.259 
come with adhesive on the back they have
a<00:00:23.010> red<00:00:23.279> green<00:00:23.789> blue<00:00:24.330> RGB<00:00:25.789> circuits<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:26.910> them<00:00:27.090> so

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
a red green blue RGB circuits on them so

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.970 
a red green blue RGB circuits on them so
you<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.539> get<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> billion<00:00:28.349> different<00:00:28.650> colors

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
you can get a billion different colors

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.290 
you can get a billion different colors
and<00:00:29.599> all<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.779> need<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.619> switch<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.090> need

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
and all you need is a switch so you need

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.910 
and all you need is a switch so you need
power<00:00:33.510> obviously<00:00:33.809> non<00:00:34.410> vult<00:00:34.649> with<00:00:34.890> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
power obviously non vult with a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.130 
power obviously non vult with a
connector<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.059> then<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.690> switch<00:00:36.930> we're

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
connector and then for that switch we're

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.410 
connector and then for that switch we're
going<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> use<00:00:37.590> pen<00:00:38.280> top<00:00:38.550> with<00:00:39.090> these<00:00:39.239> nice

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
going to use pen top with these nice

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.520 
going to use pen top with these nice
little<00:00:39.629> radial<00:00:40.079> slots<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:41.149> take<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.530> get

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
little radial slots on it take that get

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.580 
little radial slots on it take that get
some<00:00:43.739> copper<00:00:44.430> balls<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.090> you're<00:00:46.050> pretty<00:00:46.469> much

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
some copper balls and you're pretty much

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.889 
some copper balls and you're pretty much
set<00:00:46.950> now<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.670> use<00:00:47.879> blue<00:00:48.239> electrical<00:00:48.750> tape

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
set now you use blue electrical tape

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.110 
set now you use blue electrical tape
because<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> shoes<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:49.680> blue<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
because the shoes are blue so for the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.790 
because the shoes are blue so for the
switch<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.660> think<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:51.989> need<00:00:52.140> cartoon<00:00:52.590> diagram

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
switch I think we need cartoon diagram

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.700 
switch I think we need cartoon diagram
time<00:00:53.430> we'll<00:00:54.000> take<00:00:54.180> our<00:00:54.390> wires<00:00:54.629> from<00:00:54.899> our<00:00:55.079> RGB<00:00:55.440> s

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
time we'll take our wires from our RGB s

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.590 
time we'll take our wires from our RGB s
and<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.250> ground<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.760> we'll<00:00:56.910> take<00:00:57.059> them<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
and the ground and we'll take them and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.639 
and the ground and we'll take them and
we'll<00:00:57.660> put<00:00:57.840> them<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.079> containment<00:00:58.469> unit

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
we'll put them in a containment unit

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.229 
we'll put them in a containment unit
which<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> pen<00:00:59.430> then<00:00:59.910> we'll<00:01:00.000> put<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
which is the pen then we'll put the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.240 
which is the pen then we'll put the
copper<00:01:00.539> balls<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> pen<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:01.980> those

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
copper balls in the pen and as those

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.070 
copper balls in the pen and as those
move<00:01:02.460> down<00:01:02.789> they'll<00:01:03.359> end<00:01:03.510> up<00:01:03.570> bridging<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
move down they'll end up bridging the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.690 
move down they'll end up bridging the
connection<00:01:04.530> between<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.949> ground<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.549> each

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
connection between the ground and each

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.810 
connection between the ground and each
of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> RGB<00:01:06.840> LEDs<00:01:07.500> which<00:01:08.159> will<00:01:08.310> allow<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
of the RGB LEDs which will allow it to

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.730 
of the RGB LEDs which will allow it to
light<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.150> green<00:01:09.600> or<00:01:09.630> red<00:01:10.020> or<00:01:10.200> blue<00:01:10.590> or

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
light up green or red or blue or

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.219 
light up green or red or blue or
whatever<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.150> move<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.990> balls

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
whatever and then as you move the balls

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.929 
whatever and then as you move the balls
will<00:01:13.439> move<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.950> inside<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.610> you'll<00:01:14.820> get

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
will move all the inside and you'll get

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.570 
will move all the inside and you'll get
different<00:01:15.330> setups<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.409> first<00:01:16.650> take<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> shoes

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
different setups so first take the shoes

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.399 
different setups so first take the shoes
clean<00:01:18.210> them<00:01:18.360> off<00:01:18.479> give<00:01:18.840> them<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> good<00:01:19.140> scrub

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
clean them off give them a good scrub

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.600 
clean them off give them a good scrub
you<00:01:19.560> don't<00:01:19.710> know<00:01:19.770> what<00:01:19.860> kind<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.009> grinds<00:01:20.310> been

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
you don't know what kind of grinds been

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.800 
you don't know what kind of grinds been
on<00:01:20.729> those<00:01:20.880> things<00:01:21.150> especially<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.630> go

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
on those things especially if you go

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.929 
on those things especially if you go
into<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> men's<00:01:22.229> room<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.759> take<00:01:23.759> tear

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
into the men's room this take tear

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.530 
into the men's room this take tear
strips<00:01:24.689> pull<00:01:25.560> off<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.860> backing<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.580> start

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
strips pull off the backing and start

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.210 
strips pull off the backing and start
putting<00:01:27.720> them<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:27.990> put<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.470> wires<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
putting them on put the wires on the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.780 
putting them on put the wires on the
inside<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:30.210> your<00:01:30.990> your<00:01:31.439> foot<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.610> wire

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
inside of your your foot so you can wire

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.609 
inside of your your foot so you can wire
them<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.060> nice<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.299> clean<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.869> these<00:01:34.470> are

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
them up nice and clean and these are

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.350 
them up nice and clean and these are
usually<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.040> pressure-sensitive<00:01:35.640> adhesives

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
usually a pressure-sensitive adhesives

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940 
usually a pressure-sensitive adhesives
so<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.900> need<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.140> squeeze<00:01:37.350> them<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.710> get<00:01:37.860> them

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
so you need to squeeze them to get them

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.460 
so you need to squeeze them to get them
to<00:01:38.070> set<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.450> follow<00:01:39.659> them<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:39.960> you'll<00:01:40.290> see

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
to set you can follow them up you'll see

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.410 
to set you can follow them up you'll see
that<00:01:40.560> they<00:01:40.740> go<00:01:40.890> up<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.250> kind<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.759> ran<00:01:41.939> mine<00:01:42.150> under

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
that they go up I kind of ran mine under

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.179 
that they go up I kind of ran mine under
the<00:01:42.540> laces<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> little<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.409> had<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> wires

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the laces a little and had the wires

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.920 
the laces a little and had the wires
exposed<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.850> could<00:01:45.090> probably<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.720> off

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
exposed you could probably do this off

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.480 
exposed you could probably do this off
the<00:01:46.259> shoe<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.680> then<00:01:46.860> put<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.250> shoe

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the shoe and then put it on the shoe

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.609 
the shoe and then put it on the shoe
later<00:01:47.729> but<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.000> did<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> shoe<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.470> let<00:01:49.560> me

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
later but I did it on the shoe so let me

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.130 
later but I did it on the shoe so let me
do<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.770> quick<00:01:49.950> test<00:01:50.220> get<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:50.909> battery<00:01:51.240> connect

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
do a quick test get your battery connect

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.889 
do a quick test get your battery connect
the<00:01:52.229> positive<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> black<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.729> then<00:01:54.600> go

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
the positive to the black and then go

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.480 
the positive to the black and then go
ahead<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.320> take<00:01:55.500> your<00:01:55.710> ground<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.310> touch

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
ahead and take your ground and touch

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.039 
ahead and take your ground and touch
everything<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.060> close<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.509> circuit<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
everything to close the circuit and

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.389 
everything to close the circuit and
you'll<00:01:58.140> see<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.530> different<00:01:58.829> colors<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.280> can

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
you'll see the different colors you can

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.499 
you'll see the different colors you can
get<00:01:59.840> you<00:02:00.840> could<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.350> color<00:02:01.560> if<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.860> wanted

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
get you could do one color if you wanted

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.840 
get you could do one color if you wanted
so<00:02:03.509> now<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:03.689> take<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.140> pen<00:02:04.350> tap<00:02:04.649> cap<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.700> we're

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
so now we take that pen tap cap so we're

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.709 
so now we take that pen tap cap so we're
going<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.000> what<00:02:06.119> we're<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.390> make<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.689> a

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
going to what we're going to make is a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.869 
going to what we're going to make is a
tilt<00:02:07.110> switch<00:02:07.399> you're<00:02:08.399> going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> fit<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
tilt switch you're going to fit the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.910 
tilt switch you're going to fit the
wires<00:02:09.090> inside<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.050> slots<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.619> you'll<00:02:10.709> see

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
wires inside the slots and you'll see

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.229 
wires inside the slots and you'll see
how<00:02:11.069> they<00:02:11.250> come<00:02:11.489> through<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:11.879> just<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
how they come through it's just the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.710 
how they come through it's just the
perfect<00:02:12.420> size

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
perfect size

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.300 
perfect size
so<00:02:15.720> now<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.930> we've<00:02:16.170> taken<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.590> RGB<00:02:16.980> and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
so now that we've taken the RGB and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.420 
so now that we've taken the RGB and
we've<00:02:17.430> glued<00:02:18.420> those<00:02:18.720> in<00:02:18.960> now<00:02:19.890> I'll<00:02:20.070> go<00:02:20.250> and

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
we've glued those in now I'll go and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.490 
we've glued those in now I'll go and
take<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.910> ground<00:02:21.180> off<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.960> battery<00:02:22.140> lead

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
take the ground off of the battery lead

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.650 
take the ground off of the battery lead
so<00:02:23.490> now<00:02:23.580> we<00:02:23.640> have<00:02:23.850> that<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.300> can<00:02:24.450> see

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
so now we have that in you can see

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.180 
so now we have that in you can see
through<00:02:24.990> because<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.500> kind<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.770> translucent

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
through because it's kind of translucent

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.940 
through because it's kind of translucent
a<00:02:26.610> little<00:02:27.150> bit<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.510> wire<00:02:28.230> sticking<00:02:28.590> in

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
a little bit of that wire sticking in

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.170 
a little bit of that wire sticking in
we'll<00:02:29.820> see<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:30.060> from<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.300> front<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:32.670> from<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
we'll see it from the front so from the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.270 
we'll see it from the front so from the
top<00:02:33.390> now<00:02:33.600> looking<00:02:34.260> inside<00:02:34.560> you'll<00:02:34.800> see<00:02:34.860> on

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
top now looking inside you'll see on

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.550 
top now looking inside you'll see on
each<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.880> little<00:02:36.030> quadrants<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:37.200> none<00:02:37.530> of

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
each of the little quadrants and none of

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.970 
each of the little quadrants and none of
the<00:02:37.710> wires<00:02:37.860> are<00:02:38.130> connected<00:02:39.230> fill<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.380> with<00:02:40.560> the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
the wires are connected fill it with the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.410 
the wires are connected fill it with the
copper<00:02:41.310> balls<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:44.340> now<00:02:44.580> you've<00:02:44.820> got<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.060> close

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
copper balls and now you've got a close

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.449 
copper balls and now you've got a close
connection<00:02:45.890> whenever<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.040> move<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.400> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
connection whenever you move in the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.370 
connection whenever you move in the
balls<00:02:47.640> move<00:02:47.820> away<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.270> opens<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.720> closed<00:02:49.080> the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
balls move away it opens it closed the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.290 
balls move away it opens it closed the
open<00:02:49.470> closed<00:02:49.920> open<00:02:50.430> closed<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:51.060> get<00:02:51.209> the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
open closed open closed you get the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.920 
open closed open closed you get the
picture<00:02:52.160> put<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.250> battery<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:54.030> test<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.810> out

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
picture put the battery and test it out

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.870 
picture put the battery and test it out
I<00:02:55.200> just<00:02:55.380> used<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:56.010> little<00:02:56.130> bit<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.550> pen<00:02:56.730> to

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
I just used a little bit of the pen to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.710 
I just used a little bit of the pen to
close<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.390> thing<00:02:57.930> temporarily<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.730> since<00:03:00.600> it

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
close the thing temporarily and since it

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.380 
close the thing temporarily and since it
works<00:03:00.930> we'll<00:03:01.380> go<00:03:01.530> ahead<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.920> move<00:03:02.190> forward<00:03:02.390> so

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
works we'll go ahead and move forward so

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.690 
works we'll go ahead and move forward so
I<00:03:03.450> wanted<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.840> just<00:03:03.930> test<00:03:04.320> how<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.530> do<00:03:04.770> this<00:03:04.950> so

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
I wanted to just test how to do this so

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.540 
I wanted to just test how to do this so
the<00:03:06.300> best<00:03:06.450> way<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.660> found<00:03:07.080> was<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.590> take<00:03:08.310> the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
the best way I found was to take the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.300 
the best way I found was to take the
switch<00:03:08.820> tape<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:09.990> battery<00:03:10.440> then<00:03:11.010> put

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
switch tape it to the battery then put

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.610 
switch tape it to the battery then put
that<00:03:11.459> whole<00:03:11.700> mess<00:03:12.090> inside<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.200> zip<00:03:13.410> tie

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
that whole mess inside of a zip tie

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.160 
that whole mess inside of a zip tie
which<00:03:14.190> zip<00:03:14.459> tied<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.120> little<00:03:15.480> loop<00:03:15.930> on

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
which zip tied to that little loop on

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.780 
which zip tied to that little loop on
the<00:03:16.320> tongue<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.770> shoe<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.280> laces<00:03:17.640> go

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
the tongue of a shoe that the laces go

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.520 
the tongue of a shoe that the laces go
through<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.480> then<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:18.989> allows<00:03:19.170> everything

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
through and then that allows everything

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.250 
through and then that allows everything
to<00:03:19.650> be<00:03:19.769> held<00:03:19.980> in<00:03:20.100> place<00:03:20.220> really<00:03:20.610> well<00:03:20.930> then<00:03:21.930> for

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
to be held in place really well then for
