to get to the point where you've seen a
significant<00:05:41.080> achievement<00:05:41.260> and<00:05:41.890> then<00:05:41.950> you

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
significant achievement and then you

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.000 
significant achievement and then you
have<00:05:42.250> to<00:05:42.400> stop<00:05:42.610> because<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.740> funding

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
have to stop because the the funding

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.670 
have to stop because the the funding
isn't<00:05:45.250> there<00:05:45.400> anymore<00:05:46.200> but<00:05:47.200> because<00:05:47.500> of<00:05:47.530> the

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
isn't there anymore but because of the

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.920 
isn't there anymore but because of the
progress<00:05:48.010> we've<00:05:48.220> made<00:05:48.250> were<00:05:49.120> encouraged<00:05:49.630> that

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
progress we've made were encouraged that

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.750 
progress we've made were encouraged that
we'll<00:05:50.530> be<00:05:50.710> able<00:05:50.800> to<00:05:50.920> continue<00:05:51.250> this<00:05:51.550> research

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
we'll be able to continue this research

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.940 
we'll be able to continue this research
and<00:05:52.120> make<00:05:52.270> those<00:05:52.480> next<00:05:52.870> steps<00:05:53.650> that<00:05:53.860> are

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
and make those next steps that are

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.710 
and make those next steps that are

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
necessary and protecting this

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.840 
necessary and protecting this
environment<00:05:56.230> is<00:05:56.770> what<00:05:57.040> we<00:05:57.160> really<00:05:57.340> want<00:05:57.610> to<00:05:57.670> do

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
environment is what we really want to do

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.290 
environment is what we really want to do
and<00:05:58.120> we<00:05:58.600> believe<00:05:58.900> that<00:05:59.910> culturing<00:06:00.910> these<00:06:01.060> fish

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
and we believe that culturing these fish

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.840 
and we believe that culturing these fish
is<00:06:01.540> one<00:06:01.720> way<00:06:01.870> to<00:06:01.930> help<00:06:02.380> preserve<00:06:03.280> the<00:06:03.460> coral

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
is one way to help preserve the coral
