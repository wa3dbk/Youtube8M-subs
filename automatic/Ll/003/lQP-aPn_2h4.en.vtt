00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.100
 hi sound to your teacher of 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.300
 I propose a dish to visual food 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.219
 colorful perfect for carnival 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.330
 but that would be worth bringing in 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.760
 table all year 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.280
 the dish that I will show you and dub le fas 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.750
 may be a colored outline but 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.830
 the opportunity can become a first 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.929
 spectacular 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:33.610
 we see the green beans ingredients 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:38.239
 zucchini onions carrots red cabbage 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.489
 colored peppers and an aubergine for the 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.360
 harlequin hat the tools 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.480
 needed are a kitchen knife a 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.420
 ospe lucchino tip to julienne or in 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.010
 alternatively a vegetable line we start a 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.230
 prepare the vegetables 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.809
 then wash and clean green beans 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.160
 cut them in half 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:02.469
 cut the red cabbage with a knife 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.469
 from kitchen in very thin slices 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.420
 do the same thing for the peppers and 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.299
 used in all the colors to give 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.220
 cheer the plate with the julien cut 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:18.820
 cut the carrot strips and 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:20.440
 possibly even the zucchini now 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.180
 blanch the green beans 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.130
 this operation allows some way 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.229
 to saturate the natural color of the 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.869
 vegetables the vegetables this way 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.060
 they acquire vivid and brilliant colors that 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.710
 transmit freshness and gluttony to 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.619
 flat to achieve this result 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.780
 you have to follow two simple steps e 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.090
 First you have to soak the vegetables 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.880
 in boiling salted water 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.220
 after a few minutes of cooking usually 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.100
 a couple for the green beans in this case 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.619
 at least five need to create one 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.210
 thermal shock by dipping the vegetables in 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.070
 water and ice 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.470
 this fixed temperature change i 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.630
 pigments and chlorophyll in vegetables 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.240
 that take on even more vivid colors 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.190
 also stopping the ice cooking 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.569
 maintains crunchiness and properties 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.210
 nutritive of vegetables 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.829
 I thought of decorating it further 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.810
 this vegetable dish with a hat 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:14.290
 of harlequin clipped in a slice of 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.709
 aubergine shaped hat by hand 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.959
 free 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.230
 using the I hope I chino as if it were one 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.230
 pencil 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.690
 cook this shape on one side only 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.290
 a non-stick pan for ten 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.360
 of minutes in focus not too high year 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:54.880
 we give some strands of vegetables one for 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:57.550
 type and let's go to the plate 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.890
 the salad in the middle of the plate if used 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.739
 a vein gret seasoned and stir the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.450
 vegetables before serving otherwise 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.239
 add the seasoning directly 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.250
 in the dish decorated with the knots of 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.250
 vegetables and eggplant hat 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.790
 the harlequin salad is ready if 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.219
 prefer and serve it as a cooked side dish 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.870
 you can skip all of them for a few minutes 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:31.400
 the vegetables in a pan with a drop 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.689
 of oil, salt and pepper or with soy sauce 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.120
 an interesting alternative is to 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:39.209
 use sauteed vegetables as a condiment 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.549
 for a first of noodles choose 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.069
 of colored tagliatelle boil them in 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.780
 boiling salted water and add it in 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.900
 pan when I'm still al dente 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.349
 skip for a few minutes on the plate and 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.349
 served 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.650
 this is our proposal for a healthy and 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.150
 tasty carnival dish suitable though 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.579
 at any time of the year 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.469
 especially if you customize the recipe 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.819
 according to seasonal vegetables and 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:07.680

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.689

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.060
 we wait with our visual proposals
