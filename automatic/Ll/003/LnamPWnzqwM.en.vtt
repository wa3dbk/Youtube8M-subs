00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.730 
a few minutes where the sky is really
glowing<00:02:05.030> where<00:02:05.359> it<00:02:05.539> was<00:02:05.659> purple<00:02:06.109> or<00:02:06.229> blue<00:02:06.530> and

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
glowing where it was purple or blue and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.800 
glowing where it was purple or blue and
it's<00:02:06.859> glowing<00:02:07.159> in<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:07.520> background<00:02:07.999> and<00:02:08.210> the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
it's glowing in the background and the

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.719 
it's glowing in the background and the
ambient<00:02:09.440> exposure<00:02:09.619> of<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.220> fire<00:02:10.460> is

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
ambient exposure of the fire is

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.210 
ambient exposure of the fire is
comparable<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.990> ambient<00:02:12.560> exposure<00:02:12.740> of

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
comparable to the ambient exposure of

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.410 
comparable to the ambient exposure of
the<00:02:13.370> sky<00:02:13.580> in<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.880> background

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
the sky in the background

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.110 
the sky in the background
so<00:02:14.960> oftentimes<00:02:15.410> I'll<00:02:15.800> spend<00:02:16.069> time<00:02:16.340> composing

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
so oftentimes I'll spend time composing

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.780 
so oftentimes I'll spend time composing
and<00:02:17.600> practicing<00:02:18.230> my<00:02:18.260> shot<00:02:18.650> checking<00:02:19.130> my<00:02:19.280> focus

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
and practicing my shot checking my focus

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.480 
and practicing my shot checking my focus
looking<00:02:20.780> for<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.050> best<00:02:21.230> composition<00:02:21.740> while

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
looking for the best composition while

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.940 
looking for the best composition while
the<00:02:22.640> lights<00:02:22.850> not<00:02:23.090> perfect<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.810> then<00:02:24.440> as<00:02:24.590> we<00:02:24.770> go

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
the lights not perfect and then as we go

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.980 
the lights not perfect and then as we go
into<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:25.340> sweet<00:02:25.730> spot<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.120> zone<00:02:26.660> that

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
into that sweet spot that zone that

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.870 
into that sweet spot that zone that
sometimes<00:02:27.440> it's<00:02:27.620> only<00:02:27.770> five<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.340> ten<00:02:28.520> minutes

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
sometimes it's only five to ten minutes

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.640 
sometimes it's only five to ten minutes
where<00:02:29.390> everything<00:02:29.840> comes<00:02:30.020> together<00:02:30.290> the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
where everything comes together the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.860 
where everything comes together the
ambient<00:02:31.190> exposure<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.300> sky<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:32.600> just

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
ambient exposure of the sky is just

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.050 
ambient exposure of the sky is just
right<00:02:33.440> that's<00:02:33.980> when<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.459> make<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.879> best

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
right that's when you make the best

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.570 
right that's when you make the best
photographs<00:02:35.500> now<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.590> beauty<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.099> shooting

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
photographs now the beauty of shooting

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.800 
photographs now the beauty of shooting
around<00:02:37.760> two<00:02:37.849> campfires<00:02:38.299> you<00:02:38.480> don't

around two campfires you don't

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.990 
around two campfires you don't
eat<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:38.930> lot<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.290> equipment<00:02:39.560> I'm<00:02:40.220> using<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.819> Nikon

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
fast lenses because I'm going to be

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.470 
fast lenses because I'm going to be
shooting<00:02:48.739> in<00:02:49.010> low-light<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.730> have<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:49.970> 50

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
shooting in low-light so I have a 50

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.479 
millimeter 1.4 that's kind of my go-to
lens<00:02:53.540> if<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.930> want<00:02:54.170> wide<00:02:54.440> all<00:02:54.739> oftentimes<00:02:55.250> go<00:02:55.430> to

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
lens if I want wide all oftentimes go to

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.080 
lens if I want wide all oftentimes go to
the<00:02:55.670> 24<00:02:56.269> millimeter<00:02:56.590> 1.4<00:02:57.590> Nick<00:02:57.860> or<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:58.280> if<00:02:58.970> I'm

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
go to the 85 1 4 I don't use a tripod

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.220 
go to the 85 1 4 I don't use a tripod
the<00:03:04.160> truth<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.550> in<00:03:04.730> my<00:03:04.910> belief<00:03:05.330> system<00:03:05.840> when

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
the truth is in my belief system when

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.900 
the truth is in my belief system when
you're<00:03:06.380> on<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.530> tripod<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.310> lessens<00:03:07.760> your

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
you're on a tripod it lessens your

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.690 
you're on a tripod it lessens your
creativity<00:03:08.450> by<00:03:09.110> almost<00:03:09.380> 50%<00:03:09.860> you<00:03:10.340> need<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:10.610> be

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
creativity by almost 50% you need to be

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.059 
creativity by almost 50% you need to be
able<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.880> move<00:03:11.120> around<00:03:11.360> fluidly<00:03:12.170> move<00:03:12.680> quickly

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
able to move around fluidly move quickly

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.190 
able to move around fluidly move quickly
make<00:03:13.430> minor<00:03:13.730> adjustments<00:03:13.940> right<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.780> left<00:03:14.959> up

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
make minor adjustments right and left up

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.050 
make minor adjustments right and left up
and<00:03:15.350> down<00:03:15.560> because<00:03:16.160> it's<00:03:16.430> sometimes<00:03:16.640> just

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
and down because it's sometimes just

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.550 
and down because it's sometimes just
that<00:03:17.209> minor<00:03:17.450> adjustment<00:03:18.140> that's<00:03:18.350> the

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
that minor adjustment that's the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.770 
that minor adjustment that's the
difference<00:03:18.950> between<00:03:19.130> a<00:03:19.549> good<00:03:20.150> photo<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.720> a

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
great photo and of course we're always

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.880 
great photo and of course we're always
trying<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.030> go<00:03:23.180> for<00:03:23.420> great<00:03:23.660> photos<00:03:24.080> don't<00:03:24.739> be

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
trying to go for great photos don't be

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.520 
trying to go for great photos don't be

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
bursts of images to make there sure that

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.759 
bursts of images to make there sure that
some<00:03:32.180> were<00:03:32.330> in<00:03:32.480> that<00:03:32.599> sequence<00:03:33.080> of<00:03:33.230> images<00:03:33.380> I

about just shooting lots of frames and

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.620 
about just shooting lots of frames and
really<00:04:01.280> checking<00:04:01.700> your<00:04:01.819> focus<00:04:02.209> it's<00:04:02.390> hard

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.580 
sometimes when you're shooting through
the<00:04:04.130> firelight<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:05.600> see<00:04:05.810> if<00:04:05.930> you're<00:04:06.079> in<00:04:06.260> focus

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
or if the autofocus is catching the fire

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.120 
or if the autofocus is catching the fire
so<00:04:11.420> sometimes<00:04:11.840> I'll<00:04:11.989> switch<00:04:12.260> into<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.590> manual

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130
