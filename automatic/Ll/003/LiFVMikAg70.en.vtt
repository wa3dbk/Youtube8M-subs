proper brushing techniques the first
technique<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> horizontal<00:00:27.390> technique<00:00:29.150> it

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
technique is the horizontal technique it

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.849 
technique is the horizontal technique it
is<00:00:30.210> done<00:00:30.539> by<00:00:30.750> moving<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.170> brush<00:00:31.320> back<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
is done by moving the brush back and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.260 
is done by moving the brush back and
forth<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.520> teeth<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> scrubbing

the Stillman method is the bass method
this<00:01:34.010> is<00:01:34.190> used<00:01:34.430> for<00:01:34.640> people<00:01:34.940> with<00:01:35.120> continuous

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
this is used for people with continuous

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.050 
this is used for people with continuous
receding<00:01:36.110> gums<00:01:36.290> this<00:01:37.070> method<00:01:37.460> is<00:01:37.550> identical

receding gums this method is identical

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.940 
receding gums this method is identical
to<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.270> Stillman<00:01:38.690> method<00:01:39.050> except<00:01:39.530> for<00:01:39.710> one

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
to the Stillman method except for one

instead of placing the bristles on top

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.250 
instead of placing the bristles on top
you<00:01:46.580> want<00:01:46.760> to<00:01:46.880> gently<00:01:47.120> insert<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.870> bristles

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
you want to gently insert the bristles

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.200 
you want to gently insert the bristles
of<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.440> brush<00:01:48.680> underneath<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.400> gums<00:01:49.610> the
