it's a little bit different so I'm gonna
head<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.689> open<00:01:42.750> up<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> advanced<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.590> are

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
head and open up the advanced that are

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.520 
head and open up the advanced that are
this<00:01:45.030> has<00:01:45.360> layers<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.200> over<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:46.380> on

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
this has layers you can see over here on

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.039 
this has layers you can see over here on
the<00:01:46.680> ride<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.189> different<00:01:47.549> layers<00:01:48.049> that

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the ride you have different layers that

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.080 
the ride you have different layers that
you<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.320> go<00:01:49.439> back<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.649> re<00:01:49.979> edit<00:01:50.310> or<00:01:50.460> adjust

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
you can go back and re edit or adjust

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.560 
you can go back and re edit or adjust
and<00:01:51.270> change<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.750> layers<00:01:52.700> later<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.360> I'm<00:01:54.540> going

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and change the layers later so I'm going

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.410 
and change the layers later so I'm going
to<00:01:54.750> show<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.960> how<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.820> by<00:01:56.820> adding<00:01:57.060> an

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
to show you how to do that by adding an

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.080 
to show you how to do that by adding an
image<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> layer<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.350> at<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> top<00:01:59.340> menu<00:01:59.759> go

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
image as a layer so at the top menu go

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.080 
image as a layer so at the top menu go
to<00:02:00.119> layer<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.009> then<00:02:02.009> we're<00:02:02.159> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> go<00:02:02.430> open

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
to layer and then we're going to go open

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.740 
to layer and then we're going to go open
image<00:02:03.600> as<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> layer<00:02:05.000> by<00:02:06.000> doing<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.299> I'm<00:02:06.600> gonna

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
image as a layer by doing this I'm gonna

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.749 
image as a layer by doing this I'm gonna
bring<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.049> same<00:02:07.259> managed<00:02:07.560> by<00:02:08.280> doing<00:02:08.610> this

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
bring in the same managed by doing this

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.430 
bring in the same managed by doing this
though<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:09.720> go<00:02:09.989> over<00:02:10.170> here

image much like the other ones rotated

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.690 
image much like the other ones rotated
and<00:02:46.739> get<00:02:47.519> it<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.819> position<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.360> want
