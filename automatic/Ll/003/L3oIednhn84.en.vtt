00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
simple so easy I can't believe that I

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.600 
simple so easy I can't believe that I
couldn't<00:03:54.390> figure<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.660> out<00:03:54.810> I'm<00:03:55.050> just<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.770> don't

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
couldn't figure it out I'm just I don't
know<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.380> I<00:03:58.380> actually<00:03:59.340> made<00:03:59.760> this<00:03:59.970> sentiment

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
know and I actually made this sentiment

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.300 
know and I actually made this sentiment
to<00:04:00.810> go<00:04:00.930> with<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.590> just<00:04:02.540> use<00:04:03.540> paper<00:04:03.810> smooches

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
to go with it I just use paper smooches

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.210 
to go with it I just use paper smooches
sentiment<00:04:05.310> stamps<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:07.470> put<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.740> whoohoo<00:04:07.920> way

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
sentiment stamps to put the whoohoo way

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.260 
sentiment stamps to put the whoohoo way
to<00:04:08.280> go<00:04:09.770> just<00:04:10.770> on<00:04:10.920> some<00:04:11.190> white<00:04:11.400> cardstock<00:04:11.790> and

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.510 
to go just on some white cardstock and
then<00:04:12.360> I've<00:04:12.590> scored<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.770> at<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.040> end<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.430> I

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
then I've scored it at the end that I

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.630 
then I've scored it at the end that I
folded<00:04:14.940> it<00:04:15.060> over<00:04:15.210> and<00:04:15.680> then<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.770> glued<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.310> can

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
folded it over and then I glued it can

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.060 
folded it over and then I glued it can
you<00:04:17.760> see<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:20.010> then<00:04:20.670> I<00:04:20.790> glued<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.330> piece<00:04:21.360> of

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
you see that and then I glued a piece of

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.000 
you see that and then I glued a piece of
right<00:04:23.070> glued<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.400> toothpick<00:04:24.470> inside<00:04:25.470> there<00:04:26.690> so

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
right glued a toothpick inside there so

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.850 
right glued a toothpick inside there so
yeah<00:04:29.010> that's<00:04:29.250> really<00:04:29.430> simple<00:04:29.730> and<00:04:30.540> then<00:04:31.290> I'm

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
yeah that's really simple and then I'm

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.740 
yeah that's really simple and then I'm
just<00:04:32.010> going<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.460> actually<00:04:33.450> I<00:04:33.480> should<00:04:33.720> probably

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
just going to actually I should probably

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.480 
just going to actually I should probably
