00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Zack look 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.110
 knows what can happen unforeseen Claudia von Bowman from the 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.329
 Aachen coal has been 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:13.169
 here is no longer mined for over ten years 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.159
 the pumps were turned off without replacement 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:19.489
 Some time later, the first houses had to be demolished 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.479
 the old town hall in Wassenberg is hardly to save 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.770
 the former mining operator has been responsible for years 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.679
 until the Federal Supreme Court confirmed 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.679
 Turning off the pumps is the cause of the problems 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.130
 in the case of the old town hall at least 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.650
 but many other houses are fast too 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.650
 for example, that of Karl Biegel 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.360
 For years, cracks have been pulling through the apartment 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.650
 presumably the home must be complete with swimming pool and dentist practice 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.050
 be demolished 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.750
 This time, Frau von Borrmann is attracting engineer Peter Immekus 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.940
 By turning off the pumps underground, the mine water is in the mines 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.740
 slowly increased 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.160
 probably life and sound layers are swollen and push up 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.700
 the horses 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.500
 as soon as pressure comes from below 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.480
 sometimes even severe damage arising as in the on Raser 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.060
 because it was easier because it was not reported that's why they too 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.470
 typically because no one expects but usually still task one of 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 Charity almost always occur 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.479
 the exercises have been known for a long time 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.500
 but little research 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.580
 give an appraisal for the Aachener area encore 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.070
 that there are no consequences to be feared there 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.250
 Warber the ground reacted differently 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.840
 a warning for the Ruhr area 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.840
 when will the pumps be shut down there? 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.979
 the investigations are underway 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.100
 contentwise find matters financial matter 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.610
 because at some point Wittmann's water can not pay any more customers run 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.189
 and that's the reason I'm going to predict 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.920
 also try at least ten parts and when turned off 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:20.409
 Economic slowdown in the Ruhrgebiet renaturieren and what you get out of the 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.440
 As soon as he arrives he is led away from the previous Kandeler 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.630
 you will not have that later, that's why ours will be 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.720
 Politics not realized with ten to 20 years after the end of the last one 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.720
 Albums here in the Notwist were just not anymore
