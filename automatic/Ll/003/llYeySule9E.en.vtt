00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Good morning, everyone, I'm a forum 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.410
 they distribute play the modern warfare 2 in 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.389
 the same historical search session 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.200
 you have already uploaded style search items 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.030
 one or two seriously two high rise and harry 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.500
 reid and that of sub bases surely the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.850
 I will leave here downstairs not because 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.289
 up to today's videos always 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.090
 always up I put the annotation of the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.769
 videos of today in case if not the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.869
 you have seen you have lost it because 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.090
 you know that your post is from youtube 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.369
 they always put you in the last video that 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.929
 it has gone up so you put the same in 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.189
 youtube at 8 in the evening at eight 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.170
 in the afternoon visionary mind is this 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.660
 video and not the reduce the one that will start 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.239
 upload that has gone back up or the or the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.430
 road to walk that is about to end 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.629
 when I say I say pointed points since 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.090
 already finished what has already finished 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.579
 already finished there and I have it in gold 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.410
 they already raised a gameplay of ya gold and 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.030
 attentive to tomorrow's video only one hundred 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.610
 I say that to the broken one tomorrow 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.020
 obviously today I bring you a game 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.879
 to search and destroy as I tell you of the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.250
 same session and today is the best game 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.960
 of seeking to destroy that I have taken from 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.570
 the session that is yours is a game 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.770
 pretty decent 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.960
 we won by beating we won 40 or 41 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.490
 I'm not entirely sure I think I think 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.130
 that was 40 but I'm not entirely sure 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.680
 and it's a wall we do not go a game but 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.630
 in plan b is devastating because when 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.580
 there are two players well connected and two 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.890
 players who are or who are quite 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.840
 veterans in this the color ten ideas I 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.390
 same because I've been playing the call of 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.130
 3 duty dual color 24 or revolver that 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.509
 It takes a lot of hours played to call 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.110
 of duty if someone knows about the 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.610
 biotypes is the pussy is the good then two 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.289
 very good players as I tell you and 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.430
 good because it works better for me 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.910
 basically good 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.220
 because I play a lot more flush than 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.840
 the first part the first round I 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.970
 they say or let me put the bomb to me like this 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.160
 I play more defensively and you can then 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.240
 in plan rasear and kill enough and good 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.430
 for the truth that does not turn out quite well 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.050
 I end up killing the only time 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.670
 that I die in the whole game is the 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.259
 first round because good the truth that 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.880
 had a bit of sniper failure 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.200
 up there on the mountain to finally 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.729
 killed good in the problem because 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.980
 in the end we end up winning the game 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.960
 it's the round forgiveness 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.340
 and all great good and planted the bomb already 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.590
 I put the bomb and killed one with the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.970
 residuals that are a gun cucumber a 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.160
 high school cucumber and planted the pump 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.600
 bolt it seems that everything is great I do not know 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.120
 how many took and the round ends because 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.740
 he kills another voucher we take 4 1 2 1 the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.350
 connection a tremendous I am host 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.730
 obviously the best as always 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.730
 I repeat it is better to have a host 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.420
 of 20 of 50 mb or that have a host of 20 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.280
 megas because it gives you better connection to 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.860
 all not only for the one who is host 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.510
 well finally Diego left the program 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.160
 now the bomb let me rasear in plan 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.470
 beasts and we already do a 30 and already 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.840
 we defend better and with good then that 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.099
 we can win 40 and the game is passed 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.230
 fast demand and I was getting it right 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.299
 I was telling him nothing to ask if 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.920
 I get more points so I can see if 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.140
 I can get a gameplay game 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.480
 so leave me so they cheated and 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.970
 well he planted the uncle paper 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.890
 try to try to defend the bomb and I 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.400
 by ras and a little bit the escac and ticos 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.810
 I'm lucky there because they stun me and 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.579
 fired a burst of fame if it ended him 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.069
 killing a tremendous luck but ojito 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.510
 ojito to the luck that I have I do not know if it is 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.250
 in this round or in the next round 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.840
 I think it is now that there is a 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.750
 sniper there that I just killed him 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.760
 a burst of fame and there's look there was a 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.610
 uncle, I do not know what the hell I was doing with a 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.930
 shield doing the subnormal and good 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.920
 I'm lucky because if not if not 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.420
 comes to have the shield leads to have 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.640
 another weapon because it kills me fixed but 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.590
 let's go fine and good then here 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.110
 we are lucky that he killed him and 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.760
 is only one player who is one and 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.620
 and they almost take it from me but they take it from me 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.210
 please give him a death the 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.080
 also pussy that to him 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.760
 Well, if they could not kill me, but good 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.860
 it is found host the marker function 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.690
 good luck in there please good luck 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.980
 but hey, I 'm going to give him my ass 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.640
 from behind tail rangers worth there's no 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.430
 problem 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.060
 well then 30 change of side and 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.330
 I really think that this is the last 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.830
 round that I get pretty good is not 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.990
 I think I get to the predictor 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.570
 I carry the answer egg that already 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.880
 for the last active round the two 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.770
 active the radar the wow and active after 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.510
 response therefore they are blind and 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.550
 we know where each one is 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.690
 because luckily none of the four 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.490
 none of the three who are playing 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.710
 because I had cold blood so no 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.570
 kind of problem you see that double low by 

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.250
 part of me pretty good and only remains 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.540
 one and here I 'm already talking to fa 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.800
 because I think I was seeing him 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.540
 saying is there in the background I say by 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.220
 leave it to me with the predictor and 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.080
 finished rounding the gameplay now 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.760
 is that he does not know very well and always 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.890
 two players play on Skype or two 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.150
 well-connected players come out 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.950
 games so the truth is that look at the 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.510
 enemies were four at the beginning then 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.550
 it was one then entered another and at the end 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.080
 there are only two the bad lose of the 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.300
 players nothing happens but still 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.040
 look for a 10-1 marker that is 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.810
 quite pretty in the very 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.430
 liked this video will give life favorites 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.230
 Also, if you want more, look to destroy 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.780
 so with a live dual or something 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.070
 tell me and let's see if we can do it 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.460
 just a greeting and until next time 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.460
 goodbye
