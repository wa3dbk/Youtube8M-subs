00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
you let's start with the basics the way

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.999 
you let's start with the basics the way
it<00:01:17.460> looks<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> way<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.090> sounds<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:19.170> did<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.830> get

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
it looks the way it sounds I did not get

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.160 
it looks the way it sounds I did not get
hands-on<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.700> can't<00:01:21.000> attest<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.900> way<00:01:22.020> it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
hands-on so I can't attest to the way it

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.840 
hands-on so I can't attest to the way it
feels<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.650> do<00:01:22.740> know<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.430> not<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
feels but I do know that it is not the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.600 
feels but I do know that it is not the
same<00:01:24.060> engine<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.960> dice<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.890> frostbite

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
same engine that dice and frostbite

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.510 
same engine that dice and frostbite
we're<00:01:27.060> using<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:28.110> battle<00:01:28.590> free<00:01:28.829> battlefield

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
we're using for battle free battlefield

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.740 
we're using for battle free battlefield
god<00:01:29.820> I'm<00:01:29.939> going<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.090> get<00:01:30.240> those<00:01:30.360> mixed<00:01:30.540> up

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
god I'm going to get those mixed up

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.450 
god I'm going to get those mixed up
battlefield<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> different<00:01:32.280> engine

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
battlefield so it is a different engine

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.230 
battlefield so it is a different engine
now<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.939> biggest<00:01:33.479> part<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.240> what

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
now the biggest part of that is what

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.700 
now the biggest part of that is what
does<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.479> look<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.110> how<00:01:37.140> does<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.380> sound

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
does it look like and how does it sound

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.789 
does it look like and how does it sound
so<00:01:38.130> they<00:01:38.939> did<00:01:39.270> bread<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> little<00:01:40.200> bit<00:01:40.590> about

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
so they did bread a little bit about

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.069 
so they did bread a little bit about
having<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> first<00:01:41.850> game<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.479> development<00:01:42.659> for

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
having the first game in development for

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.490 
having the first game in development for
Doby<00:01:43.829> at<00:01:44.040> most<00:01:44.549> which<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.119> new<00:01:45.299> 3d<00:01:46.170> sound

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
Doby at most which is the new 3d sound

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.100 
Doby at most which is the new 3d sound
think<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.369> saran<00:01:47.759> or<00:01:47.909> 5.1<00:01:48.689> Dolby

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
think of it as like saran or 5.1 Dolby

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.280 
think of it as like saran or 5.1 Dolby
5.1<00:01:49.140> digital<00:01:49.860> but<00:01:50.340> upgraded<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.060> they<00:01:51.930> played

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
5.1 digital but upgraded so they played

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.289 
5.1 digital but upgraded so they played
side<00:01:52.649> by<00:01:52.680> side<00:01:53.009> audio<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.640> us<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.000> could

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
side by side audio for us so we could

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.510 
side by side audio for us so we could
kind<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.930> compare<00:01:55.380> them<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.829> yeah<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.189> sounds

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
kind of compare them and yeah it sounds

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.950 
kind of compare them and yeah it sounds

that a minute the reason I feel it looks

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.250 
that a minute the reason I feel it looks
so<00:03:18.160> good<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:19.000> reason<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.990> sound

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
so good and the reason that the sound

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.590 
so good and the reason that the sound
sound<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:20.770> crisp<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.310> authentic<00:03:22.150> is<00:03:22.240> because

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
sound so crisp and authentic is because

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.930 
sound so crisp and authentic is because
they<00:03:23.170> actually<00:03:23.740> they<00:03:24.070> being<00:03:24.340> diced<00:03:24.640> got

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.010 
that's the actual prop that they use but
they<00:03:50.920> 3d<00:03:51.460> mapped<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:51.970> rendered<00:03:52.540> it<00:03:52.660> out<00:03:52.780> in

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
they 3d mapped it and rendered it out in

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.170 
they 3d mapped it and rendered it out in
the<00:03:53.050> game<00:03:53.380> itself<00:03:53.740> so<00:03:53.890> they<00:03:54.460> did<00:03:54.670> show<00:03:54.880> up<00:03:55.000> some

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
the game itself so they did show up some

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.320 
the game itself so they did show up some
some<00:03:55.750> close-up<00:03:56.550> models<00:03:57.550> character<00:03:58.030> models

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
some close-up models character models

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.900 
some close-up models character models
and<00:03:58.570> plane<00:03:59.440> models<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.040> such<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.520> it<00:04:00.760> looks

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
and plane models and such and it looks

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.970 
and plane models and such and it looks
great<00:04:01.000> it's<00:04:01.720> getting<00:04:02.290> really<00:04:02.440> hard<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:02.800> tell

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
great it's getting really hard to tell

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.040 
great it's getting really hard to tell
when<00:04:03.190> you're<00:04:03.310> just<00:04:03.520> being<00:04:03.730> shown<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.060> stock

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
when you're just being shown a stock

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.410 
when you're just being shown a stock
character<00:04:05.620> model<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.220> they're<00:04:06.640> standing<00:04:07.300> in

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
character model and they're standing in

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.720 
character model and they're standing in
a<00:04:07.480> white<00:04:07.690> background<00:04:07.930> but<00:04:08.560> I<00:04:08.860> will<00:04:09.280> say<00:04:09.490> it

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
a white background but I will say it

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.570 
a white background but I will say it
does<00:04:09.970> look<00:04:10.210> quite<00:04:10.390> good<00:04:10.450> so<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:12.070> special

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
does look quite good so the special

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.640 
does look quite good so the special
effects<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.180> explosions<00:04:13.900> etc<00:04:14.050> you<00:04:14.620> know

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
effects the explosions etc you know

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.200 
effects the explosions etc you know
everybody's<00:04:15.370> gotten<00:04:15.640> pretty<00:04:15.820> good<00:04:15.880> at<00:04:16.000> those

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.210 
everybody's gotten pretty good at those

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.470 
everybody's gotten pretty good at those
I<00:04:16.510> do<00:04:17.020> feel<00:04:17.500> like<00:04:17.799> it<00:04:18.010> it<00:04:18.489> adds<00:04:18.880> something<00:04:19.299> to

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
I do feel like it it adds something to

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.230 
I do feel like it it adds something to
the<00:04:19.570> game<00:04:19.900> because<00:04:20.350> you<00:04:20.470> realize<00:04:20.950> that<00:04:21.240> you

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
the game because you realize that you

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.480 
the game because you realize that you
realize<00:04:22.660> that<00:04:22.690> every<00:04:23.080> single<00:04:23.590> star<00:04:23.979> wars<00:04:24.220> has

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
realize that every single star wars has

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.800 
realize that every single star wars has
been<00:04:24.850> working

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
been working

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.310 
been working
on<00:04:25.930> older<00:04:26.650> versions<00:04:27.160> of<00:04:27.970> VFX<00:04:28.510> and<00:04:28.840> older

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
on older versions of VFX and older

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.680 
on older versions of VFX and older
versions<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:30.010> computing<00:04:30.880> I<00:04:31.060> know<00:04:31.180> this<00:04:31.450> sounds

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
versions of computing I know this sounds

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.840 
versions of computing I know this sounds
kind<00:04:31.990> of<00:04:32.050> weird<00:04:32.110> but<00:04:32.440> I<00:04:33.130> feel<00:04:33.460> like<00:04:33.490> since

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
kind of weird but I feel like since

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.120 
kind of weird but I feel like since
we've<00:04:34.120> stepped<00:04:34.480> up<00:04:34.690> in<00:04:34.870> quality<00:04:35.320> in<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:35.950> last

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
we've stepped up in quality in the last

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.270 
we've stepped up in quality in the last
decade<00:04:36.669> or<00:04:36.880> so<00:04:37.200> quite<00:04:38.200> a<00:04:38.230> bit<00:04:38.290> actually<00:04:38.440> the

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
decade or so quite a bit actually the

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.580 
decade or so quite a bit actually the
ability<00:04:39.700> to<00:04:39.820> kind<00:04:39.970> of<00:04:40.120> put<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.570> in<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:41.260> Star

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
ability to kind of put you in the Star

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.980 
ability to kind of put you in the Star
Wars<00:04:41.800> films<00:04:41.980> with<00:04:42.940> that<00:04:43.180> graphical<00:04:43.810> power

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
Wars films with that graphical power

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.560 
Wars films with that graphical power
with<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.440> sound<00:04:44.740> effects<00:04:45.070> is<00:04:45.250> way<00:04:45.820> easier<00:04:46.300> now

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
with the sound effects is way easier now

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.150 
with the sound effects is way easier now
than<00:04:46.600> it<00:04:46.930> would<00:04:47.110> have<00:04:47.139> been<00:04:47.350> with<00:04:47.620> battlefront

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
than it would have been with battlefront

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.550 
than it would have been with battlefront
to<00:04:48.370> like<00:04:48.790> look<00:04:49.240> at<00:04:49.360> this<00:04:49.510> you<00:04:49.750> clearly<00:04:50.260> know

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
to like look at this you clearly know

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.950 
to like look at this you clearly know
you're<00:04:50.800> not<00:04:50.950> playing<00:04:51.430> in<00:04:51.700> the<00:04:52.030> game<00:04:52.210> but<00:04:52.660> I

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
promise it looks a lot better with the

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.629 
promise it looks a lot better with the
release<00:04:56.530> trailer<00:04:56.770> that<00:04:57.040> you<00:04:57.130> guys<00:04:57.280> saw<00:04:57.460> so

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
let's move on into gameplay I'm sorry I

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.170 
let's move on into gameplay I'm sorry I
spent<00:04:59.830> that<00:04:59.950> much<00:05:00.070> time<00:05:00.100> on<00:05:00.400> graphics<00:05:00.820> and

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
spent that much time on graphics and

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.670 
spent that much time on graphics and
sound<00:05:01.479> but<00:05:01.720> I<00:05:01.900> thought<00:05:02.169> that<00:05:02.320> was<00:05:02.410> really<00:05:02.590> cool

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
sound but I thought that was really cool

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
that they got access to the vaults of

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.170 
that they got access to the vaults of
Lucas<00:05:04.990> Films<00:05:05.260> vaults<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.710> all<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:05.950> jazz

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180

there's<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.300> huge<00:05:07.660> part<00:05:07.990> of<00:05:08.050> this<00:05:08.200> game<00:05:08.500> that

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
there's a huge part of this game that

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.310 
there's a huge part of this game that
nobody<00:05:09.160> ever<00:05:09.340> really<00:05:09.790> talks<00:05:10.210> about<00:05:10.389> if<00:05:11.139> you

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
nobody ever really talks about if you

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.750 
nobody ever really talks about if you
didn't<00:05:11.620> play<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:12.130> it's<00:05:12.250> the<00:05:12.370> ability<00:05:12.520> to

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
didn't play and it's the ability to

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.370 
didn't play and it's the ability to
switch<00:05:12.970> from<00:05:13.210> first<00:05:13.479> to<00:05:13.660> third<00:05:13.690> and<00:05:14.110> third<00:05:14.260> the

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
switch from first to third and third the

first person respectively a lot of

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.460 
first person respectively a lot of
people<00:05:16.360> were<00:05:16.450> worried<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:16.900> dice<00:05:17.110> was<00:05:17.320> going

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
people were worried the dice was going

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.110 
people were worried the dice was going
to<00:05:17.530> change<00:05:17.740> that<00:05:17.889> up<00:05:18.130> because<00:05:18.310> it's<00:05:18.970> not

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
to change that up because it's not

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.390 
to change that up because it's not
typical<00:05:19.330> in<00:05:19.630> games<00:05:19.870> now<00:05:20.110> I'm<00:05:20.680> happy<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.250> say

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
typical in games now I'm happy to say

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.950 
typical in games now I'm happy to say
that<00:05:21.430> they<00:05:21.639> left<00:05:21.850> it<00:05:22.000> in<00:05:22.120> you<00:05:22.270> can<00:05:22.450> freely

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
that they left it in you can freely

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.780 
that they left it in you can freely
switch<00:05:23.410> between<00:05:23.620> first<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.310> third<00:05:24.400> person

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
switch between first and third person

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.409 
switch between first and third person
whenever<00:05:25.690> you<00:05:25.960> want<00:05:26.370> you<00:05:27.370> know<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.880> overlay

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
whenever you want you know the overlay

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.719 
whenever you want you know the overlay
in<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.810> reticles<00:05:29.350> and<00:05:29.680> all<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:30.100> GUI<00:05:30.669> is

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
in the reticles and all the GUI is

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.969 
in the reticles and all the GUI is
probably<00:05:31.300> still<00:05:31.630> in<00:05:31.870> alpha<00:05:32.080> oh<00:05:32.560> it's<00:05:32.830> not

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
probably still in alpha oh it's not

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.260 
probably still in alpha oh it's not
probably<00:05:33.190> it<00:05:33.370> is<00:05:33.400> it's<00:05:33.700> probably<00:05:33.880> going<00:05:34.180> to

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
probably it is it's probably going to

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.450 
probably it is it's probably going to
change<00:05:34.630> but<00:05:35.140> it<00:05:35.260> does<00:05:35.470> look<00:05:35.500> very<00:05:35.830> similar<00:05:36.280> to

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
change but it does look very similar to

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.400 
change but it does look very similar to
this<00:05:36.700> a<00:05:36.760> little<00:05:37.030> bit<00:05:37.270> kind<00:05:37.479> of<00:05:37.690> Arkady<00:05:38.289> a
