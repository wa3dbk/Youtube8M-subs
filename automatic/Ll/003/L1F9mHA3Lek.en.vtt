00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.700 
watching me and believe it or not this
was<00:02:06.530> not<00:02:06.920> that<00:02:07.130> easy<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:07.579> make<00:02:07.990> it<00:02:08.990> wasn't<00:02:09.530> hard

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
was not that easy to make it wasn't hard

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.760 
was not that easy to make it wasn't hard
but<00:02:10.250> it<00:02:10.369> just<00:02:10.520> took<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.759> little<00:02:10.850> while<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.770> I

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
but it just took a little while and I

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.920 
but it just took a little while and I
kind<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.790> wanted<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.090> talk<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.510> guys<00:02:14.540> today

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
kind of wanted to talk to you guys today

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.930 
kind of wanted to talk to you guys today
about<00:02:15.319> games<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:16.160> what<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.490> takes<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.910> make

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
about games and what it takes to make

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.360 
about games and what it takes to make
games<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:18.049> if<00:02:18.170> you're<00:02:18.290> interested<00:02:18.530> in<00:02:18.950> making

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
games so if you're interested in making

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.940 
games so if you're interested in making
games<00:02:19.670> basically<00:02:20.599> there's<00:02:21.349> three<00:02:21.830> different

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
games basically there's three different

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.399 
games basically there's three different
aspects<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.760> making<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.120> game<00:02:24.190> there's<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:27.200> art

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
aspects to making a game there's the art

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.140 
aspects to making a game there's the art
aspect<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:28.340> have<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.580> be<00:02:28.670> kind<00:02:28.879> of<00:02:29.030> good<00:02:29.120> at

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
aspect so you have to be kind of good at

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.880 
aspect so you have to be kind of good at
our<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.480> doesn't<00:02:29.720> know<00:02:29.780> what<00:02:29.900> you're<00:02:30.019> doing<00:02:30.290> it

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
our it doesn't know what you're doing it

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.410 
our it doesn't know what you're doing it
all<00:02:31.989> right<00:02:32.989> there<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.170> go<00:02:33.940> it's<00:02:34.940> hard<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.239> talk

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
all right there you go it's hard to talk

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.759 
all right there you go it's hard to talk
and<00:02:35.720> do<00:02:35.810> this<00:02:35.959> at<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.170> same<00:02:36.379> time<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.650> know

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
and do this at the same time you know

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.380 
and do this at the same time you know
that<00:02:36.890> sounds<00:02:37.099> silly<00:02:37.220> but<00:02:37.430> it's<00:02:37.580> true<00:02:37.790> there's

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
that sounds silly but it's true there's

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.360 
that sounds silly but it's true there's
the<00:02:38.599> narratives<00:02:39.170> part<00:02:39.590> of<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.769> game<00:02:39.980> which<00:02:40.340> is

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
the narratives part of a game which is

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.369 
the narratives part of a game which is
basically<00:02:40.939> the<00:02:41.180> story<00:02:41.450> line<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:41.780> writing<00:02:42.290> the

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
basically the story line and writing the

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.770 
basically the story line and writing the
story<00:02:42.650> for<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.890> game<00:02:43.069> and<00:02:43.540> there<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.750> the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
story for the game and there is the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.750 
story for the game and there is the
programming<00:02:45.769> which<00:02:46.010> is<00:02:46.129> what<00:02:46.280> I'm<00:02:46.400> better<00:02:46.610> at

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
programming which is what I'm better at

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.280 
programming which is what I'm better at
I'm<00:02:46.879> better<00:02:47.120> at<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.330> programming<00:02:47.840> stuff<00:02:48.049> as

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
I'm better at the programming stuff as

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.309 
I'm better at the programming stuff as
you<00:02:48.950> can<00:02:49.099> see<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.489> art<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.849> a<00:02:49.879> little<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:51.260> looks

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
you can see the art is a little it looks

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.350 
you can see the art is a little it looks
doesn't<00:02:51.950> look<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.280> good<00:02:52.580> that's<00:02:53.030> because

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
doesn't look that good that's because

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.089 
doesn't look that good that's because
obviously<00:02:53.689> I'm<00:02:54.080> not<00:02:54.110> good<00:02:54.409> with<00:02:54.439> the<00:02:54.620> art<00:02:54.830> side

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
obviously I'm not good with the art side

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.729 
obviously I'm not good with the art side
I<00:02:55.370> just<00:02:56.120> stole<00:02:56.299> a<00:02:56.360> couple<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.810> sprites<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.409> I'm

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
I just stole a couple of sprites and I'm

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.809 
I just stole a couple of sprites and I'm
using<00:02:58.129> them<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:59.739> you<00:03:00.739> have<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.159> kind<00:03:01.580> of<00:03:01.700> be

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
using them so you have to kind of be

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.369 
using them so you have to kind of be
well<00:03:02.030> around<00:03:02.239> in<00:03:02.480> between<00:03:02.810> those<00:03:02.959> three<00:03:03.140> areas

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
well around in between those three areas

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.259 
well around in between those three areas
that<00:03:04.189> doesn't<00:03:04.489> necessarily<00:03:04.610> mean<00:03:05.150> you're

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
that doesn't necessarily mean you're

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.119 
that doesn't necessarily mean you're
here<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.480> work<00:03:05.689> in<00:03:05.840> art<00:03:06.049> but<00:03:06.439> it<00:03:06.620> means<00:03:06.799> that

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
here to work in art but it means that

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.350 
here to work in art but it means that
you<00:03:07.220> need<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.519> kind<00:03:07.819> of<00:03:07.879> know<00:03:08.030> what<00:03:08.239> you're

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
you need to kind of know what you're

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.479 
you need to kind of know what you're
doing<00:03:08.599> with<00:03:08.720> art<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.200> not<00:03:10.040> just<00:03:10.220> go<00:03:10.340> and

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
doing with art and not just go and

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.520 
doing with art and not just go and
blindly<00:03:10.849> and<00:03:11.060> use<00:03:11.209> paint<00:03:11.510> for<00:03:11.840> everything<00:03:14.530> as

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
blindly and use paint for everything as

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.080 
blindly and use paint for everything as
you<00:03:15.860> can<00:03:15.980> see<00:03:16.189> here<00:03:16.370> this<00:03:16.519> is<00:03:16.579> getting<00:03:17.000> a

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
you can see here this is getting a

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.399 
you can see here this is getting a
little<00:03:17.120> difficult<00:03:17.780> for<00:03:17.810> me<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.170> I'm<00:03:18.260> going<00:03:18.379> to

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
little difficult for me so I'm going to

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.770 
little difficult for me so I'm going to
go<00:03:18.500> ahead<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.739> use<00:03:19.099> my<00:03:19.280> specialty<00:03:19.970> i<00:03:20.000> made<00:03:20.510> to

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
go ahead and use my specialty i made to

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.860 
go ahead and use my specialty i made to
make<00:03:20.989> me<00:03:21.140> skip<00:03:21.379> a<00:03:21.409> level<00:03:21.739> so<00:03:22.430> there<00:03:23.209> we<00:03:23.329> go<00:03:23.360> that

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
make me skip a level so there we go that

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.020 
make me skip a level so there we go that
was<00:03:24.049> a<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:25.280> wasn't<00:03:25.459> that<00:03:25.519> hard<00:03:25.579> I<00:03:25.849> just

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
was a that wasn't that hard I just

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.789 
was a that wasn't that hard I just
didn't<00:03:26.269> feel<00:03:26.299> like<00:03:26.420> doing<00:03:26.629> it<00:03:26.870> that's<00:03:27.019> all<00:03:27.140> but

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
didn't feel like doing it that's all but

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.350 
didn't feel like doing it that's all but
anyways<00:03:28.159> yes<00:03:29.620> okay

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
anyways yes okay

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.600 
anyways yes okay
Christ<00:03:32.020> what<00:03:32.860> is<00:03:32.890> going<00:03:33.280> on<00:03:33.400> okay<00:03:35.460> all<00:03:36.460> right

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
Christ what is going on okay all right

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.430 
Christ what is going on okay all right
we're<00:03:36.730> going<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:36.910> do<00:03:37.030> this<00:03:37.150> if<00:03:37.690> it<00:03:37.990> takes<00:03:38.320> us

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
we're going to do this if it takes us

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.890 
we're going to do this if it takes us
all<00:03:38.620> day<00:03:38.770> there<00:03:39.580> we<00:03:39.670> go<00:03:39.760> alright<00:03:40.540> so<00:03:40.780> this

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
all day there we go alright so this

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.480 
all day there we go alright so this
level<00:03:41.260> obviously<00:03:41.380> just<00:03:41.830> looked<00:03:41.980> at<00:03:42.100> hard<00:03:42.310> it's

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
level obviously just looked at hard it's

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.860 
level obviously just looked at hard it's
actually<00:03:42.760> because<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:43.000> forgot<00:03:43.300> to<00:03:43.390> finish<00:03:43.600> this

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
actually because I forgot to finish this

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.530 
actually because I forgot to finish this
level<00:03:44.110> but<00:03:45.070> that's<00:03:45.610> another<00:03:45.850> thing<00:03:46.120> when<00:03:46.450> you

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
level but that's another thing when you

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.700 
level but that's another thing when you
make<00:03:46.690> games<00:03:46.900> it's<00:03:47.080> going<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.290> take<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.650> very

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
make games it's going to take you a very

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.200 
make games it's going to take you a very
long<00:03:47.920> time<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.310> probably<00:03:48.610> already<00:03:48.790> said<00:03:49.030> that

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
long time I probably already said that

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.670 
long time I probably already said that
but<00:03:49.420> that's<00:03:49.630> okay<00:03:49.900> because<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.380> needs<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.620> be

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
but that's okay because it needs to be

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.560 
but that's okay because it needs to be
emphasized<00:03:51.160> because<00:03:51.580> you're<00:03:52.150> not<00:03:52.300> going<00:03:52.480> to

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
emphasized because you're not going to

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.390 
emphasized because you're not going to
sit<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:53.230> game<00:03:53.470> took<00:03:53.650> me<00:03:53.830> probably<00:03:54.040> about

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
sit this game took me probably about

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.180 
sit this game took me probably about
this<00:03:55.060> is<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.210> simple<00:03:55.450> game<00:03:55.660> note<00:03:56.080> that<00:03:56.290> it's<00:03:56.830> not

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
this is a simple game note that it's not

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.680 
this is a simple game note that it's not
that<00:03:57.250> hard<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.550> make<00:03:57.730> this<00:03:58.000> game<00:03:58.360> took<00:03:58.540> me

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
that hard to make this game took me

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.300 
that hard to make this game took me
probably<00:03:58.959> about<00:03:59.290> a<00:04:00.010> week<00:04:01.770> just<00:04:02.770> because<00:04:02.920> I<00:04:03.190> was

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
probably about a week just because I was

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.680 
probably about a week just because I was
working<00:04:03.640> with<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.910> different<00:04:04.209> levels<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:04.600> I

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
working with the different levels and I

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.180 
working with the different levels and I
have<00:04:04.840> like<00:04:05.020> 14<00:04:05.470> different<00:04:05.590> levels<00:04:05.980> of<00:04:06.070> you

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
have like 14 different levels of you

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.910 
have like 14 different levels of you
believe<00:04:06.490> i'm<00:04:06.910> going<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.150> skip<00:04:07.300> this<00:04:07.450> one<00:04:07.920> this

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
believe i'm going to skip this one this

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.229 
believe i'm going to skip this one this
level<00:04:09.130> is<00:04:09.250> when<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.459> got<00:04:09.610> a<00:04:09.640> little<00:04:09.730> bit<00:04:09.940> bored

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
level is when I got a little bit bored

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.520 
level is when I got a little bit bored
and<00:04:10.360> I<00:04:10.390> wasn't<00:04:10.540> really<00:04:10.690> sure<00:04:10.810> what<00:04:10.989> to<00:04:11.080> do<00:04:11.200> so

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
and I wasn't really sure what to do so

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.590 
and I wasn't really sure what to do so
this<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:11.830> this<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.430> an<00:04:12.520> example<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:13.090> video<00:04:13.390> game

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
this is this is an example of video game

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.600 
this is this is an example of video game
developers<00:04:14.350> block<00:04:14.620> right<00:04:14.920> here<00:04:14.950> guys<00:04:15.280> and

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
developers block right here guys and

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.229 
developers block right here guys and
we're<00:04:16.390> going<00:04:16.540> to<00:04:16.570> make<00:04:16.930> it<00:04:17.230> there<00:04:17.470> we<00:04:17.560> go<00:04:18.239> this

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
we're going to make it there we go this

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.200 
we're going to make it there we go this
level<00:04:19.480> is<00:04:19.720> quite<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:20.109> hard<00:04:20.739> one<00:04:20.980> but<00:04:21.910> as<00:04:22.060> you

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
level is quite the hard one but as you

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.050 
level is quite the hard one but as you
can<00:04:22.330> see<00:04:22.540> I'm<00:04:22.690> trying<00:04:22.930> to<00:04:23.590> when<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:24.550> develop

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
can see I'm trying to when I develop

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.150 
can see I'm trying to when I develop
this<00:04:25.150> game<00:04:25.390> I<00:04:25.419> was<00:04:25.630> trying<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:25.930> make<00:04:26.140> it<00:04:26.320> so<00:04:26.590> it

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
this game I was trying to make it so it

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.980 
this game I was trying to make it so it
starts<00:04:27.490> out<00:04:27.580> simple<00:04:27.790> and<00:04:28.270> gets<00:04:28.450> harder<00:04:28.840> and

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
starts out simple and gets harder and

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.659 
starts out simple and gets harder and
then<00:04:29.050> eventually<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:30.010> will<00:04:30.070> introduce<00:04:30.370> new

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
then eventually it will introduce new

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.610 
then eventually it will introduce new
things<00:04:30.880> like<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.240> keys<00:04:31.510> that<00:04:31.900> that's<00:04:32.230> a<00:04:32.410> new

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
things like the keys that that's a new

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.100 
things like the keys that that's a new
thing<00:04:32.650> going<00:04:33.130> on<00:04:33.220> so<00:04:35.970> okay<00:04:36.970> there<00:04:37.210> go<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.600> had<00:04:38.020> to

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
thing going on so okay there go I had to

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.399 
thing going on so okay there go I had to
concentrate<00:04:38.530> when<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.830> do<00:04:38.919> this<00:04:39.130> but

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:42.409 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.269 

they're<00:04:43.039> go<00:04:43.159> I<00:04:43.189> did<00:04:43.429> it<00:04:43.550> okay<00:04:44.679> so<00:04:45.679> anyways<00:04:46.099> if

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:46.279 
they're go I did it okay so anyways if

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:48.149 
they're go I did it okay so anyways if
you're<00:04:46.399> interested<00:04:46.909> in<00:04:47.059> a<00:04:47.149> video<00:04:47.389> game<00:04:47.449> design

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
you're interested in a video game design

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.989 
you're interested in a video game design
let's<00:04:49.159> just<00:04:49.249> say<00:04:49.489> you're<00:04:49.610> interested<00:04:49.969> in

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:49.999 
let's just say you're interested in

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.570 
let's just say you're interested in
becoming<00:04:50.089> a<00:04:50.419> game<00:04:50.599> designer<00:04:50.899> I<00:04:51.580> would

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
becoming a game designer I would

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.749 
becoming a game designer I would
recommend<00:04:52.939> game<00:04:53.719> maker<00:04:53.959> to<00:04:54.169> start<00:04:54.409> off<00:04:54.529> on

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
recommend game maker to start off on

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.949 
recommend game maker to start off on
that's<00:04:55.759> just<00:04:55.969> the<00:04:56.059> that<00:04:56.479> would<00:04:56.659> be<00:04:56.779> my

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:56.959 
that's just the that would be my

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:59.649 
that's just the that would be my
recommendation<00:04:57.459> because<00:04:58.459> this<00:04:58.969> is<00:04:59.149> it's<00:04:59.479> not

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
recommendation because this is it's not

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.299 
recommendation because this is it's not
that<00:04:59.809> hard<00:04:59.959> to<00:05:00.050> learn<00:05:00.229> you<00:05:00.919> don't<00:05:01.099> have<00:05:01.189> to

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:01.309 
that hard to learn you don't have to

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:03.929 
that hard to learn you don't have to
learn<00:05:01.429> any<00:05:01.639> special<00:05:02.119> programming<00:05:02.539> languages

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:03.939 
learn any special programming languages

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:07.089 
learn any special programming languages
you<00:05:04.939> can<00:05:05.389> find<00:05:05.659> it<00:05:05.959> tutorials<00:05:06.469> online<00:05:06.679> really

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
you can find it tutorials online really

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:14.079 
you can find it tutorials online really
easily<00:05:07.429> and<00:05:11.919> after<00:05:12.919> that<00:05:12.949> it<00:05:13.369> can<00:05:13.580> let's<00:05:13.879> say

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:14.089 
easily and after that it can let's say

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:16.089 
easily and after that it can let's say
right<00:05:15.079> now<00:05:15.199> I'm<00:05:15.349> actually<00:05:15.499> learning<00:05:15.800> how<00:05:16.039> to

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
right now I'm actually learning how to

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.850 
right now I'm actually learning how to

I'm just using the free version for now
but<00:05:26.029> let's<00:05:26.239> say<00:05:26.449> you<00:05:26.479> want<00:05:27.229> to<00:05:27.349> make<00:05:27.769> a<00:05:27.800> game

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
but let's say you want to make a game

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:30.549 
but let's say you want to make a game
with<00:05:28.399> that<00:05:28.610> there's<00:05:29.539> tutorials<00:05:30.019> online<00:05:30.169> it's

00:05:30.549 --> 00:05:30.559 
with that there's tutorials online it's

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:32.619 
with that there's tutorials online it's
a<00:05:30.619> bit<00:05:30.829> more<00:05:31.099> um<00:05:31.339> harder<00:05:32.119> to<00:05:32.239> learn<00:05:32.360> because

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:32.629 
a bit more um harder to learn because

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:34.809 
a bit more um harder to learn because
you<00:05:33.079> are<00:05:33.229> indeed<00:05:33.589> learning<00:05:34.069> programming

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
you are indeed learning programming

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.659 
you are indeed learning programming
languages<00:05:35.239> like<00:05:35.419> c<00:05:35.779> and<00:05:36.050> java<00:05:36.229> script<00:05:36.469> and<00:05:37.309> all

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
languages like c and java script and all

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:38.979 
languages like c and java script and all
that<00:05:37.819> crazy<00:05:38.149> stuff<00:05:38.209> that<00:05:38.419> you<00:05:38.539> probably<00:05:38.749> don't

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:38.989 
that crazy stuff that you probably don't

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:44.919 
that crazy stuff that you probably don't
know<00:05:39.079> about<00:05:40.119> but<00:05:41.119> yes<00:05:43.539> so<00:05:44.539> you<00:05:44.599> need<00:05:44.809> to<00:05:44.869> learn

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:44.929 
know about but yes so you need to learn

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:46.269 
know about but yes so you need to learn
all<00:05:45.079> that<00:05:45.139> Union<00:05:45.649> to<00:05:45.800> learn<00:05:45.919> how<00:05:45.979> to<00:05:46.099> make

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:46.279 
all that Union to learn how to make

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.249 
all that Union to learn how to make
models<00:05:46.699> with<00:05:46.849> blender<00:05:47.240> and<00:05:47.539> port<00:05:47.869> them<00:05:48.050> into

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
models with blender and port them into

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.429 
models with blender and port them into
unity<00:05:48.619> and<00:05:49.959> there's<00:05:50.959> a<00:05:51.019> bunch<00:05:51.229> of<00:05:51.319> different

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:51.439 
unity and there's a bunch of different

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:52.629 
unity and there's a bunch of different
things<00:05:51.769> you<00:05:51.889> need<00:05:52.069> to<00:05:52.099> learn<00:05:52.279> about<00:05:52.429> and

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
things you need to learn about and

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.399 
things you need to learn about and
usually<00:05:53.029> I<00:05:53.300> just<00:05:53.389> visited<00:05:53.990> a<00:05:54.079> college

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409 
usually I just visited a college

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.219 
usually I just visited a college
recently<00:05:54.800> on<00:05:54.919> game<00:05:55.159> design<00:05:55.279> and<00:05:56.229> they're

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
recently on game design and they're

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:58.659 
recently on game design and they're
gonna<00:05:57.319> teach<00:05:57.619> us<00:05:57.649> how<00:05:57.800> to<00:05:57.919> use<00:05:58.069> unity<00:05:58.459> so<00:05:58.639> I

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
gonna teach us how to use unity so I

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.519 
gonna teach us how to use unity so I
went<00:05:58.969> ahead<00:05:59.059> and<00:05:59.269> I<00:05:59.569> mean<00:05:59.839> I'm<00:05:59.990> a<00:06:00.079> junior<00:06:00.289> now

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:00.529 
went ahead and I mean I'm a junior now

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:02.829 
went ahead and I mean I'm a junior now
so<00:06:00.709> I<00:06:00.740> have<00:06:00.949> one<00:06:01.669> more<00:06:01.699> semester<00:06:01.999> for<00:06:02.689> my

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:02.839 
so I have one more semester for my

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:04.179 
so I have one more semester for my
senior<00:06:03.169> year<00:06:03.199> and<00:06:03.409> then<00:06:03.529> I'll<00:06:03.619> probably

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:04.189 
senior year and then I'll probably

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:06.879 
senior year and then I'll probably
either<00:06:04.459> get<00:06:04.699> a<00:06:04.729> job<00:06:04.789> or<00:06:04.969> go<00:06:05.149> to<00:06:05.240> college<00:06:05.539> and<00:06:05.889> I

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
either get a job or go to college and I

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:08.829 
either get a job or go to college and I
downloaded<00:06:07.249> unity<00:06:07.699> and<00:06:07.849> I'm<00:06:08.599> actually

00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:08.839 
downloaded unity and I'm actually

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.689 
downloaded unity and I'm actually
learning<00:06:09.529> a<00:06:09.889> couple<00:06:10.219> of<00:06:10.279> things<00:06:10.429> about<00:06:10.490> myself

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:10.699 
learning a couple of things about myself

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:12.790 
learning a couple of things about myself
just<00:06:11.149> you<00:06:11.239> know<00:06:11.360> experimenting<00:06:12.259> with<00:06:12.319> it<00:06:12.559> and

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
just you know experimenting with it and

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.369 
just you know experimenting with it and
it's<00:06:13.429> possible<00:06:14.119> to<00:06:14.509> make<00:06:14.659> a<00:06:14.689> game<00:06:15.019> you<00:06:15.229> don't

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:15.379 
it's possible to make a game you don't

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:17.109 
it's possible to make a game you don't
need<00:06:15.499> to<00:06:15.589> be<00:06:15.679> some<00:06:15.860> kind<00:06:15.949> of<00:06:16.069> super<00:06:16.550> genius<00:06:16.909> i

00:06:17.109 --> 00:06:17.119 
need to be some kind of super genius i

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:18.309 
need to be some kind of super genius i
mean<00:06:17.149> you<00:06:17.329> need<00:06:17.449> to<00:06:17.569> know<00:06:17.689> some<00:06:17.989> things<00:06:18.019> that

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 
mean you need to know some things that

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.259 
mean you need to know some things that
are<00:06:18.409> pretty<00:06:18.619> hard<00:06:18.860> to<00:06:18.949> understand<00:06:19.369> but<00:06:19.550> you

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:20.269 
are pretty hard to understand but you

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:21.939 
are pretty hard to understand but you
can<00:06:20.509> make<00:06:20.659> a<00:06:20.689> game<00:06:20.959> if<00:06:21.110> you<00:06:21.229> really<00:06:21.409> want<00:06:21.589> to<00:06:21.679> i

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
can make a game if you really want to i

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:23.529 
can make a game if you really want to i
made<00:06:22.279> this<00:06:22.399> game<00:06:22.639> right<00:06:22.789> here<00:06:22.849> I<00:06:23.119> made<00:06:23.360> this

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
made this game right here I made this

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.629 
made this game right here I made this
entire<00:06:23.989> game<00:06:24.169> it's<00:06:24.499> not<00:06:24.589> that<00:06:24.649> hard<00:06:24.919> it's

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
entire game it's not that hard it's

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.389 
entire game it's not that hard it's
pretty<00:06:26.029> easy<00:06:26.149> actually<00:06:26.419> I<00:06:26.839> even<00:06:27.739> recruited

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:28.399 
pretty easy actually I even recruited

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:31.329 
pretty easy actually I even recruited
pac-man<00:06:28.939> and<00:06:29.149> breakthrough<00:06:29.689> and<00:06:29.929> pong<00:06:30.349> it's

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:31.339 
pac-man and breakthrough and pong it's

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:33.549 
pac-man and breakthrough and pong it's
just<00:06:31.639> I<00:06:31.879> mean<00:06:31.909> if<00:06:32.479> you<00:06:32.599> have<00:06:32.779> guides<00:06:33.079> it's<00:06:33.469> a

00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:33.559 
just I mean if you have guides it's a

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.719 
just I mean if you have guides it's a
lot<00:06:33.709> easier<00:06:33.739> which<00:06:34.159> is<00:06:34.279> what<00:06:34.399> I<00:06:34.429> have<00:06:34.699> but

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
lot easier which is what I have but

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.170 
lot easier which is what I have but
if<00:06:35.969> you<00:06:36.710> want<00:06:37.710> to<00:06:37.800> make<00:06:37.919> a<00:06:37.949> game<00:06:38.189> go<00:06:38.759> ahead<00:06:38.969> you

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
if you want to make a game go ahead you

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.170 
if you want to make a game go ahead you
don't<00:06:39.360> need<00:06:39.509> to<00:06:40.460> this<00:06:41.460> game<00:06:41.699> is<00:06:41.789> pissing<00:06:42.150> me

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
don't need to this game is pissing me

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.119 
don't need to this game is pissing me
off<00:06:42.300> I<00:06:42.719> made<00:06:43.139> this<00:06:43.229> level<00:06:43.499> on<00:06:43.559> in<00:06:43.680> a<00:06:43.710> repeat<00:06:44.009> it

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:44.129 
off I made this level on in a repeat it

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:45.049 
off I made this level on in a repeat it
so<00:06:44.249> I'm<00:06:44.339> just<00:06:44.430> going<00:06:44.580> to<00:06:44.669> skip<00:06:44.849> to<00:06:44.939> the<00:06:45.029> next

00:06:45.049 --> 00:06:45.059 
so I'm just going to skip to the next

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:46.939 
so I'm just going to skip to the next
level<00:06:45.479> this<00:06:45.870> is<00:06:46.020> basically<00:06:46.409> one<00:06:46.620> of<00:06:46.650> the<00:06:46.800> last

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
level this is basically one of the last

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.269 
level this is basically one of the last
levels<00:06:47.279> by<00:06:47.370> the<00:06:47.400> way<00:06:47.550> but<00:06:48.029> anyways<00:06:49.249> so<00:06:50.249> yeah

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:50.279

00:06:54.049 --> 00:06:54.059 
can watch me play the rest of this game

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:55.309 
can watch me play the rest of this game
I<00:06:54.389> mean<00:06:54.599> if<00:06:54.719> you<00:06:54.809> want<00:06:54.960> to<00:06:54.990> know<00:06:55.110> anything

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.540 
I mean if you want to know anything
about<00:06:55.469> game<00:06:55.800> design<00:06:55.949> i've<00:06:56.249> kind<00:06:56.460> of<00:06:56.490> been

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
about game design i've kind of been

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.010 
about game design i've kind of been
researching<00:06:56.999> it<00:06:57.240> for<00:06:57.270> the<00:06:57.449> past<00:06:57.569> couple<00:06:57.839> of

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
researching it for the past couple of

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.019 
researching it for the past couple of
days<00:06:58.259> and<00:06:58.499> i've<00:06:59.370> been<00:06:59.520> looking<00:06:59.699> at<00:06:59.999> some

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:00.029 
days and i've been looking at some

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:03.290 
days and i've been looking at some
things<00:07:00.599> online<00:07:00.919> about<00:07:01.919> game<00:07:02.279> design<00:07:02.460> like<00:07:03.150> if

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
things online about game design like if

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.939 
things online about game design like if
you<00:07:03.449> want<00:07:03.569> to<00:07:03.719> say<00:07:03.870> like<00:07:04.110> let's<00:07:04.589> say<00:07:04.680> you're<00:07:04.919> in

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
there are programming degrees and there

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.700
