00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.880
 already already monsters without such gods 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.710
 tones like you did because then how 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.950
 see the car you can pull away the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.870
 departure when we get behind the wheel 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.690
 almost all of us are certain of ours 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.970
 ability we know how to drive well but it is 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.070
 really so we hold the correctly 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.380
 hands on the steering wheel or hold it but on 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.660
 change because it makes the difference 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.760
 habits lead us to underestimate i 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.369
 therefore you risk making mistakes of which there are 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.020
 we only notice in some circumstances 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.239
 for example when we need to speed up 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.270
 a maneuver for a sudden obstacle 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.340
 here we lose all skill and danger 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.360
 traffic accident increases so 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.149
 exponential 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.110
 according to the data istat in 2011 in 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:53.120
 piedmont there were 12,950 claims 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.960
 with injuries to people 18 thousand 300 injured 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.489
 297 dead 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.840
 it is not the fault of the road of the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.340
 weather conditions or 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.020
 unexpected 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.879
 in most cases the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.739
 driver loses control of the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.420
 vehicle avoid an obstacle and asks for one 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.580
 great technique because you have to 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.070
 being concentrated must divide the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.500
 street with all having little space then 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.600
 it's not so easy at 50 per hour avoiding 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.729
 a sudden child who ran away but a 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.560
 obstacle really becomes necessary to have 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.150
 a great technique and it's not easy 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.270
 that's why people when they come 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.590
 here they realize they tend to say but 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.700
 I don't know how to drive isn't that we don't know 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.770
 drive must be just more 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.509
 aware of the risks are based precisely 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.880
 on the awareness of their own 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.829
 capacity of own limits the courses of 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.650
 safe driving that teach you to act in 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.420
 every situation and many are those who 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.189
 feel the need to learn to 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.140
 deal better with your vehicle 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.130
 with the road I am quite on the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.799
 street and consequently 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.979
 I don't want to understand the possible causes of 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.909
 danger that can be found along the 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:58.119
 street she made her daughter do 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.460
 course because it is a security even for 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.970
 her because she travels every day on 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.200
 street then for work and everything is 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.060
 safer 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.519
 the Piedmont region has long been offering to the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.680
 fourth-fifth graders courses 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.349
 of safe driving and there are so many i 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.239
 novice drivers who decide to compete 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.549
 with the difficulties of the road on the track 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.160
 therefore in full safety and having fun 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.140
 learn all the secrets of the steering wheel at 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.930
 regional road safety center 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.390
 technologies of susa plus the technologies 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.910
 advanced simulate behavior 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.400
 of the car in various circumstances to 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.220
 example the hydraulic platform reproduces it 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.680
 heeling back the resins that 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.540
 reduce adherence show strengths 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.880
 acting on the car in a curve 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.700
 wet ice in the presence of that 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.980
 water veil with charm the king and if i 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.620
 walls of water teach how to brake and 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.190
 avoiding an obstacle is the classic slalom 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.600
 a reveals the use of the technique visit where 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.280
 we do not see series capodimonte 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.859
 interact then you learn even not 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.420
 italics ensures that you use the display case well 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.250
 visual because the eyes had to go 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.660
 hands and us if we can react in 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.120
 correct way we also say interact 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.859
 with the vehicle and consequently is reduced 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.420
 also speed and life is achieved 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:14.260
 the obstacle 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.599
 learned to go slower and look 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.670
 also good around other cars 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:22.330
 he had to work at the same time 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.849
 with the brake and steering that normally 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.610
 but I heard he does a think or brake or 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.680
 steering instead mark us as needed 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.390
 do it all at once if it happens to you 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.690
 an obstacle to have decided can 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.310
 to avoid 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.350
 during the course we also learn 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.780
 how much can you hurt just 8 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.060
 kilometers per hour and how to behave 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.970
 in the event of a serious accident but 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.880
 above all we learn what attention it is 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.950
 the key word for safe driving 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.570
 we will have to be careful how 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.470
 we drive because it is a more managerial system 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.470
 we are always the car
