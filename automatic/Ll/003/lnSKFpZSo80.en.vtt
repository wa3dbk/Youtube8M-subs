little Christmas lights I drilled a hole

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.040 
little Christmas lights I drilled a hole
in<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.410> back<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.010> put<00:02:09.880> them<00:02:10.090> in<00:02:12.750> it's<00:02:13.750> pretty

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
in the back and put them in it's pretty

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.510 
in the back and put them in it's pretty
awesome<00:02:14.230> if<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:14.650> take<00:02:14.860> your<00:02:14.980> time<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.250> do<00:02:15.490> it

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
awesome if you take your time and do it

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.100 
awesome if you take your time and do it
right<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.900> does<00:02:17.080> take<00:02:17.320> time<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.620> build<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.100> box

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
right it does take time to build the box

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.020 
right it does take time to build the box
and<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.530> does<00:02:20.709> take<00:02:20.980> time<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.550> figure<00:02:21.700> out<00:02:21.910> the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
and it does take time to figure out the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.750 
and it does take time to figure out the
light<00:02:22.209> sequence<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:23.980> it's<00:02:24.130> well<00:02:24.310> worth<00:02:24.340> the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
light sequence but it's well worth the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.290 
light sequence but it's well worth the
work<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.300> it's<00:02:26.170> really<00:02:26.260> pretty<00:02:26.650> awesome<00:02:27.300> if

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
work and it's really pretty awesome if

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.820 
work and it's really pretty awesome if
you<00:02:28.360> could<00:02:28.450> see<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.870> live<00:02:29.110> it'd<00:02:29.440> be<00:02:29.620> even

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
you could see it live it'd be even

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.360 
you could see it live it'd be even
better<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:31.810> can<00:02:31.840> change<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:33.040> different

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
better you can change the different

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.550 
better you can change the different
settings<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:35.910> different<00:02:36.910> speeds

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:53.220 

I<00:02:39.730> flip<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:41.000> switch

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.380 

I'll<00:02:54.230> set<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:55.010> camera<00:02:55.190> down<00:02:55.340> again<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:55.970> put

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
I'll set the camera down again and put

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.730 
I'll set the camera down again and put
the<00:02:56.480> cover<00:02:56.660> back<00:02:56.780> on<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.380> can<00:02:57.500> see<00:02:57.650> it

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
the cover back on it so you can see it

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:27.650 
the cover back on it so you can see it
again

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.540 

okay<00:03:28.410> here<00:03:28.980> are<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.370> prints

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.200 

you<00:03:33.420> can<00:03:33.600> see<00:03:33.810> how<00:03:34.050> they've<00:03:34.230> been<00:03:35.210> sectioned

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
you can see how they've been sectioned

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.560 
you can see how they've been sectioned
and<00:03:36.360> trimmed<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.880> put<00:03:38.880> together<00:03:39.000> with<00:03:39.330> tape

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
and trimmed and put together with tape

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.270 
and trimmed and put together with tape
the<00:03:39.870> tape<00:03:40.080> will<00:03:40.380> disappear<00:03:40.920> you<00:03:41.040> won't<00:03:41.190> even

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
the tape will disappear you won't even

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.200 
the tape will disappear you won't even
see<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.730> tape<00:03:44.390> okay<00:03:45.390> this<00:03:45.900> is<00:03:46.080> six<00:03:46.350> sections

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
see the tape okay this is six sections

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.560 
see the tape okay this is six sections
then<00:03:49.970> we<00:03:50.970> have<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.180> piece<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.570> transparent

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
then we have a piece of transparent

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.310 
then we have a piece of transparent
Plexiglas<00:03:54.570> but<00:03:54.840> it's<00:03:54.990> not<00:03:55.110> really

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
Plexiglas but it's not really

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.200 
Plexiglas but it's not really
transparent<00:03:55.890> it's<00:03:55.980> kind<00:03:56.190> of<00:03:56.250> shaded<00:03:56.760> it's<00:03:57.090> a

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
transparent it's kind of shaded it's a

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.730 
transparent it's kind of shaded it's a
shaded<00:03:57.720> trim<00:03:57.960> and<00:03:58.200> then<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:58.440> just<00:03:58.620> lay<00:03:58.710> that

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
shaded trim and then you just lay that

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.360 
shaded trim and then you just lay that
over<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.190> top<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.490> that<00:04:00.770> then<00:04:01.770> it<00:04:01.920> gives<00:04:02.070> that

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
over the top of that then it gives that

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:14.000 
over the top of that then it gives that
professional<00:04:03.440> look<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.840> can<00:04:12.990> adjust<00:04:13.530> the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
professional look and you can adjust the

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:25.900 
professional look and you can adjust the
setting<00:04:14.370> of<00:04:14.520> it<00:04:14.640> again

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.960
