you another mod spotlight it is called
the<00:00:05.759> city<00:00:05.970> lights<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.660> clouds<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.680> as<00:00:07.799> you

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
the city lights and clouds and as you

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.890 
the city lights and clouds and as you
can<00:00:07.980> tell<00:00:08.160> right<00:00:08.189> now<00:00:08.370> we<00:00:09.120> are<00:00:09.300> flying<00:00:09.630> over

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
can tell right now we are flying over

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.440 
can tell right now we are flying over
kerbin<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:11.040> can<00:00:11.219> see<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> bunch<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.150> clouds

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
kerbin and you can see a bunch of clouds

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.680 
kerbin and you can see a bunch of clouds
over<00:00:13.170> kerbin<00:00:13.950> at<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.340> time<00:00:14.580> now<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.389> cloud

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
over kerbin at this time now the cloud

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.290 
over kerbin at this time now the cloud
system<00:00:15.960> actually<00:00:16.619> works<00:00:17.160> on<00:00:17.520> kerbin<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
system actually works on kerbin and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.900 
system actually works on kerbin and
every<00:00:19.109> other<00:00:19.289> planet<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.460> has<00:00:20.670> an

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
every other planet that has an

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.120 
every other planet that has an
atmosphere<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.779> cool<00:00:22.880> Laith<00:00:24.140> Doudna<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.410> eve

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
atmosphere so cool Laith Doudna and eve

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.950 
atmosphere so cool Laith Doudna and eve
all<00:00:26.369> have<00:00:26.880> cloud<00:00:27.449> cover

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
all have cloud cover

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.310 
all have cloud cover
now<00:00:28.560> kerbin<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.640> only<00:00:29.900> planet<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.050> has

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
now kerbin is the only planet that has

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.470 
now kerbin is the only planet that has
obviously<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.369> population<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.149> would<00:00:33.300> have

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
obviously a population that would have

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.569 
obviously a population that would have
cities<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> only<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:35.430> that

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
cities so it's the only one that

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.459 
cities so it's the only one that
actually<00:00:35.610> has<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.270> night<00:00:36.510> lighting<00:00:37.050> system

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
actually has the night lighting system

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.590 
actually has the night lighting system
which<00:00:38.070> I'll<00:00:38.219> show<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.700> second<00:00:39.120> now

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
which I'll show you in a second now

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.180 
which I'll show you in a second now
these<00:00:39.780> clouds<00:00:40.140> are<00:00:40.260> pretty<00:00:40.350> cool<00:00:40.680> they<00:00:40.950> are

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
these clouds are pretty cool they are

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.150 
these clouds are pretty cool they are
not<00:00:41.640> drawn<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:44.040> color<00:00:44.600> background<00:00:45.600> of

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
not drawn on to the color background of

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.310 
not drawn on to the color background of
the<00:00:47.160> planet<00:00:47.579> these<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.329> actually<00:00:48.780> perceived

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the planet these are actually perceived

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.279 
the planet these are actually perceived
Dooley<00:00:49.800> generated<00:00:50.520> clouds<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.930> are<00:00:52.110> their

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
Dooley generated clouds they are their

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.220 
Dooley generated clouds they are their
own<00:00:52.320> mesh<00:00:52.860> kind<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.489> sort<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.789> like<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.629> think<00:00:55.140> he

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
own mesh kind of sort of like I think he

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.130 
own mesh kind of sort of like I think he
did<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.410> almost<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> same<00:00:56.160> way<00:00:56.930> that<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
did it almost the same way that the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.040 
did it almost the same way that the
caffeine<00:00:58.500> mod<00:00:58.739> draws<00:00:59.190> its<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.789> mesh<00:01:00.570> over<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
caffeine mod draws its a mesh over the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.290 
caffeine mod draws its a mesh over the
thing<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.500> other<00:01:01.710> than<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.969> it's<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.270> know

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
thing but other than that it's you know

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.750 
thing but other than that it's you know
clouds<00:01:03.690> instead<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.619> know<00:01:04.650> where<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.400> land

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
clouds instead of you know where to land

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.700 
clouds instead of you know where to land
and<00:01:06.119> where<00:01:06.510> caffeine<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.049> located<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.470> Alessa

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
and where caffeine is located in Alessa

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.560 
and where caffeine is located in Alessa
but<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:08.610> won't<00:01:08.760> get<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.030> right<00:01:09.240> now<00:01:09.330> so

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
but we won't get on that right now so

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.670 
but we won't get on that right now so
yeah<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:10.590> they<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:11.100> actually<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.840> sky<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
yeah if they are actually in the sky and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.039 
yeah if they are actually in the sky and
I'll<00:01:13.950> show<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.400> later<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:15.180> when<00:01:15.930> we

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
I'll show you that later now when we

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:24.020 
I'll show you that later now when we
look<00:01:16.259> at<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.840> orbit<00:01:19.350> map<00:01:20.119> this<00:01:21.439> is<00:01:22.670> what<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
look at the orbit map this is what the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.280 
look at the orbit map this is what the
planet<00:01:24.479> looks<00:01:25.259> like

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.580 

give<00:01:29.290> all<00:01:29.380> that<00:01:29.530> stuff<00:01:30.840> clouds<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.110> clouds<00:01:32.290> do

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
give all that stuff clouds the clouds do

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.760 
give all that stuff clouds the clouds do
move<00:01:32.860> with<00:01:33.690> the<00:01:34.690> system<00:01:35.080> they<00:01:35.230> don't<00:01:35.320> stay<00:01:35.590> in

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
move with the system they don't stay in

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.560 
move with the system they don't stay in
one<00:01:36.130> spot<00:01:36.160> it's<00:01:36.700> hard<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:36.970> show<00:01:37.150> it<00:01:37.330> but<00:01:37.480> you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
one spot it's hard to show it but you

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.390 
one spot it's hard to show it but you
would<00:01:37.690> notice<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.080> if<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.260> actually<00:01:38.680> played

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
would notice it if you actually played

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.930 
would notice it if you actually played
it<00:01:39.550> and<00:01:39.730> when<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:40.600> go<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.900> dark<00:01:41.110> side<00:01:41.230> of

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
it and when you go to the dark side of

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.610 
it and when you go to the dark side of
the<00:01:42.940> planet<00:01:42.970> that's<00:01:43.930> when<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.229> city<00:01:44.440> lights

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
the planet that's when the city lights

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.210 
the planet that's when the city lights
kick<00:01:45.010> in<00:01:45.190> and<00:01:45.760> as<00:01:45.880> you<00:01:45.970> can<00:01:46.060> tell<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.890> can<00:01:48.040> see

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
kick in and as you can tell we can see

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.680 
kick in and as you can tell we can see
all<00:01:48.490> kinds<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.300> city<00:01:49.570> lights<00:01:49.840> on<00:01:50.590> kerbin<00:01:51.220> and

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
all kinds of city lights on kerbin and

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
all kinds of city lights on kerbin and
there's<00:01:52.690> more<00:01:52.840> places<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.440> are<00:01:53.590> more

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
there's more places that are more

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.380 
there's more places that are more
populated<00:01:54.310> than<00:01:54.490> other<00:01:54.700> areas<00:01:54.880> he's<00:01:55.240> been

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
populated than other areas he's been

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.450 
populated than other areas he's been
trying<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:55.780> uh<00:01:56.010> you<00:01:57.010> know<00:01:57.040> make<00:01:57.130> it<00:01:57.340> look

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
trying to uh you know make it look

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.940 
trying to uh you know make it look
earth-like<00:01:58.180> but<00:01:58.660> also<00:01:58.990> make<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.170> look<00:01:59.440> cool<00:01:59.680> at

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
earth-like but also make it look cool at

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.600 
earth-like but also make it look cool at
the<00:02:00.070> same<00:02:00.100> time<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:01.470> that's<00:02:02.490> basically<00:02:03.490> how

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
the same time so that's basically how

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.930 
the same time so that's basically how
that<00:02:03.759> is<00:02:04.440> we'll<00:02:05.440> bring<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:05.740> back<00:02:05.979> let's<00:02:06.220> show

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
that is we'll bring this back let's show

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.320 
that is we'll bring this back let's show
you<00:02:07.000> what<00:02:07.509> it's<00:02:07.720> like<00:02:07.869> on<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.530> ground<00:02:09.520> so

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
you what it's like on the ground so

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.540 
you what it's like on the ground so
we'll<00:02:10.570> go<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.720> this<00:02:11.340> switch<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:14.340> again<00:02:15.340> these

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
we'll go to this switch to again these

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.550 
we'll go to this switch to again these
are<00:02:15.700> not<00:02:15.730> drawn<00:02:16.239> these<00:02:16.540> are<00:02:16.720> actually<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
are not drawn these are actually in the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.310 
are not drawn these are actually in the
sky<00:02:17.800> so<00:02:18.160> if<00:02:18.280> we<00:02:18.400> look<00:02:18.580> up<00:02:18.760> right<00:02:18.970> now<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:20.110> can

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
sky so if we look up right now you can

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.500 
sky so if we look up right now you can
actually<00:02:20.500> see<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.340> there<00:02:21.550> are<00:02:21.700> clouds<00:02:22.000> in

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
actually see that there are clouds in

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.110 
actually see that there are clouds in
the<00:02:22.840> sky<00:02:23.080> now<00:02:23.410> they're<00:02:23.560> very<00:02:23.590> light<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.220> as

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
the sky now they're very light and as

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.870 
the sky now they're very light and as
far<00:02:25.300> as<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.540> know<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:26.020> system<00:02:26.440> doesn't<00:02:26.880> do

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
far as I know the system doesn't do

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.190 
far as I know the system doesn't do
storm<00:02:29.370> systems<00:02:30.370> or<00:02:30.700> weather<00:02:31.330> systems<00:02:31.840> it's

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
storm systems or weather systems it's

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.160 
storm systems or weather systems it's
only<00:02:32.350> basically<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:32.980> clear<00:02:33.630> partly<00:02:34.630> cloudy<00:02:34.900> day

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
only basically a clear partly cloudy day

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.830 
only basically a clear partly cloudy day
on<00:02:35.440> kerbin<00:02:35.920> at<00:02:36.130> all<00:02:36.310> times<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:37.030> at<00:02:37.360> night<00:02:37.570> it's

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
on kerbin at all times and at night it's

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.259 
on kerbin at all times and at night it's
the<00:02:38.260> same<00:02:38.530> thing<00:02:38.980> partly<00:02:39.340> cloudy<00:02:39.580> clear<00:02:40.030> night

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
the same thing partly cloudy clear night

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.259 
the same thing partly cloudy clear night
but<00:02:41.200> as<00:02:41.320> we<00:02:41.440> can<00:02:41.590> see<00:02:42.209> these<00:02:43.209> are<00:02:43.470> actually

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
but as we can see these are actually

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.710 
but as we can see these are actually
there<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.510> they<00:02:46.690> just<00:02:46.720> kind<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.200> vanish<00:02:50.340> so

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
there and they just kind of vanish so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.320 
there and they just kind of vanish so
you're<00:02:52.720> not<00:02:52.810> gonna<00:02:52.930> have<00:02:53.110> like<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.790> thick<00:02:54.790> huge

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
you're not gonna have like a thick huge

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.300 
you're not gonna have like a thick huge
cloud<00:02:55.900> layer<00:02:56.170> which<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.799> probably<00:02:57.100> want<00:02:57.250> to

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
cloud layer which you probably want to

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.960 
cloud layer which you probably want to
be<00:02:57.400> launching

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
be launching

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.450 
be launching
satellites<00:02:59.970> or<00:03:00.300> anything<00:03:01.020> in<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.470> mission<00:03:02.280> like

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
satellites or anything in a mission like

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.950 
satellites or anything in a mission like
that<00:03:02.490> anyway<00:03:02.970> at<00:03:03.120> least<00:03:03.150> we<00:03:03.390> don't<00:03:03.570> do<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.870> on

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
that anyway at least we don't do it on

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.930 
that anyway at least we don't do it on
planet<00:03:04.470> earth<00:03:04.800> it's<00:03:05.100> always<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.670> know<00:03:05.730> at

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
planet earth it's always you know at

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.780 
planet earth it's always you know at
least<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.330> clear<00:03:06.540> day<00:03:06.720> like<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.140> out<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:08.370> there

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
least a clear day like this out so there

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.490 
least a clear day like this out so there
we<00:03:08.880> go<00:03:08.910> that's<00:03:09.390> what<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.720> looks<00:03:09.840> like<00:03:09.990> from<00:03:10.440> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
we go that's what it looks like from the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.580 
we go that's what it looks like from the
ground<00:03:11.480> let's<00:03:12.480> take<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.750> look<00:03:13.020> at<00:03:13.170> some<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
ground let's take a look at some of the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.790 
ground let's take a look at some of the
other<00:03:13.740> planets<00:03:14.900> first<00:03:15.900> our<00:03:16.260> first<00:03:16.560> adventure

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
other planets first our first adventure

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.210 
other planets first our first adventure
will<00:03:17.250> be<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.870> Doudna<00:03:18.870> now<00:03:19.590> sometimes<00:03:19.950> when<00:03:20.100> you

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
will be to Doudna now sometimes when you

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.370 
will be to Doudna now sometimes when you
switch<00:03:20.580> like<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:23.820> planet<00:03:24.300> you<00:03:25.110> know<00:03:25.230> it

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
switch like this the planet you know it

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.500 
switch like this the planet you know it
causes<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.800> few<00:03:26.040> issues<00:03:26.250> with<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:27.030> cloud<00:03:27.270> layer

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
causes a few issues with the cloud layer

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.840 
causes a few issues with the cloud layer
actually<00:03:27.870> loading<00:03:28.470> but<00:03:29.130> this<00:03:29.310> is<00:03:29.490> Doudna

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
actually loading but this is Doudna

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.910 
actually loading but this is Doudna
obviously<00:03:30.390> doesn't<00:03:30.630> have<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:31.080> population<00:03:31.770> so

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
obviously doesn't have a population so

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.300 
obviously doesn't have a population so
doesn't<00:03:32.100> have<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> night<00:03:32.960> system<00:03:33.960> to<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.350> but

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
doesn't have a night system to it but

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.870 
doesn't have a night system to it but
it's<00:03:35.880> got<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.660> know<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.900> partially<00:03:37.880> covered

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
it's got a you know a partially covered

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.010 
it's got a you know a partially covered
cloud<00:03:39.240> system<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:40.320> can<00:03:40.500> see<00:03:40.710> through<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:42.020> it's

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
cloud system we can see through it it's

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.440 
cloud system we can see through it it's
kind<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.320> hard<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.640> judge<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:44.940> what<00:03:45.120> this<00:03:45.270> is

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
kind of hard to judge and what this is

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.570 
kind of hard to judge and what this is
based<00:03:45.660> on<00:03:45.900> is<00:03:46.050> it<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.320> don't<00:03:47.130> know<00:03:47.220> if<00:03:47.310> Mars

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
based on is it I don't know if Mars

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.770 
based on is it I don't know if Mars
looks<00:03:47.880> like<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.150> or<00:03:48.240> not<00:03:48.360> I'm<00:03:48.510> pretty<00:03:48.660> sure

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
looks like that or not I'm pretty sure

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.020 
looks like that or not I'm pretty sure
Mars<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.380> always<00:03:49.710> it<00:03:50.040> always<00:03:50.130> looks<00:03:50.550> sort<00:03:50.970> of

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
Mars is always it always looks sort of

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.600 
Mars is always it always looks sort of
clear<00:03:51.530> now<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:52.740> sort<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.130> looks<00:03:53.310> like<00:03:53.370> it's

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
clear now this sort of looks like it's

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.610 
clear now this sort of looks like it's
about<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:54.000> rain<00:03:54.030> or<00:03:54.480> something<00:03:54.810> but<00:03:55.260> who<00:03:55.440> knows

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
about to rain or something but who knows

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.920 
about to rain or something but who knows
I<00:03:55.860> don't<00:03:55.980> know<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.400> don't<00:03:57.180> know<00:03:57.270> maybe<00:03:57.570> but

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
I don't know I don't know maybe but

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:58.490 
I don't know I don't know maybe but
there<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.230> go

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
there you go

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.320 
there you go
that<00:03:58.650> is<00:03:58.920> Doudna<00:04:00.950> we<00:04:01.950> will<00:04:02.100> take<00:04:02.310> another<00:04:02.670> look

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
that is Doudna we will take another look

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.270 
that is Doudna we will take another look
let's<00:04:03.690> go<00:04:03.870> right<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:05.360> Yves<00:04:06.360> Yves<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.770> cool

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
let's go right to Yves Yves is a cool

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.770 
let's go right to Yves Yves is a cool
one<00:04:08.959> Yves<00:04:09.959> has<00:04:10.770> been<00:04:11.070> completely<00:04:11.670> covered

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
one Yves has been completely covered

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.290 
one Yves has been completely covered
I<00:04:12.989> guess<00:04:13.770> just<00:04:14.010> like<00:04:14.130> Venus<00:04:14.580> it's<00:04:14.820> completely

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
I guess just like Venus it's completely

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.680 
I guess just like Venus it's completely
covered<00:04:15.540> in<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:16.020> thick<00:04:16.410> huge<00:04:17.040> cloud<00:04:17.640> layer<00:04:17.850> now

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
covered in a thick huge cloud layer now

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.300 
covered in a thick huge cloud layer now
to<00:04:18.750> make<00:04:19.080> this<00:04:19.980> actually<00:04:20.340> work<00:04:21.270> you<00:04:22.070> can<00:04:23.070> edit

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
to make this actually work you can edit

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.090 
to make this actually work you can edit
any<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.360> planets<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:25.020> have<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.860> cloud

any of the planets that have the cloud

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.950 
any of the planets that have the cloud
cover<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.669> can<00:04:26.820> add<00:04:27.000> as<00:04:27.300> many<00:04:27.480> layers<00:04:27.810> of

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
cover you can add as many layers of

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.420 
cover you can add as many layers of
clouds<00:04:28.350> as<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:28.620> want<00:04:28.860> you<00:04:29.010> can<00:04:29.040> even<00:04:29.220> add<00:04:29.400> more

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
clouds as you want you can even add more

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.220 
clouds as you want you can even add more
layers<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:29.910> kerbin<00:04:30.390> as<00:04:30.480> you<00:04:30.570> want<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.960> does

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
layers to kerbin as you want that does

directions on how to do it and

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.390 
directions on how to do it and
everything<00:04:39.930> again<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.740> guy<00:04:40.860> that<00:04:41.010> made<00:04:41.190> this

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
everything again the guy that made this

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.350 
everything again the guy that made this
mod<00:04:41.910> is<00:04:42.240> arbre<00:04:43.020> 89<00:04:43.650> and<00:04:43.950> currently<00:04:44.700> it<00:04:44.970> is<00:04:45.180> an

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
mod is arbre 89 and currently it is an

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.080 
mod is arbre 89 and currently it is an
alpha<00:04:45.750> 10<00:04:47.090> so<00:04:48.090> there<00:04:48.240> you<00:04:48.300> go

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
alpha 10 so there you go

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.060 
alpha 10 so there you go
until<00:04:49.780> you<00:04:49.900> can't<00:04:50.139> actually<00:04:50.320> see<00:04:50.740> any

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
until you can't actually see any

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.390 
until you can't actually see any
landmass<00:04:51.730> on<00:04:52.060> Eve<00:04:52.660> at<00:04:52.990> all<00:04:53.200> but<00:04:53.560> it<00:04:53.800> is<00:04:53.860> there

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
landmass on Eve at all but it is there

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.310 
landmass on Eve at all but it is there
trust<00:04:54.790> me<00:04:54.880> and<00:04:56.370> we<00:04:57.370> will<00:04:57.400> check<00:04:57.820> out<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:59.080> last

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
trust me and we will check out the last

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.670 
trust me and we will check out the last
two<00:05:00.150> atmosphere<00:05:01.150> planets<00:05:01.900> which<00:05:02.139> would<00:05:02.440> be

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
two atmosphere planets which would be

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.650 
two atmosphere planets which would be
jewel<00:05:03.040> and<00:05:04.290> lathe

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
jewel and lathe

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.890 
jewel and lathe
so<00:05:07.660> now<00:05:07.960> jewel<00:05:08.260> actually<00:05:08.980> looks<00:05:09.450> more<00:05:10.450> like<00:05:10.870> a

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
so now jewel actually looks more like a

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.600 
so now jewel actually looks more like a
gas<00:05:11.290> giant<00:05:11.650> kind<00:05:12.070> of<00:05:12.190> like<00:05:12.310> Jupiter<00:05:12.820> or<00:05:13.060> maybe

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
gas giant kind of like Jupiter or maybe

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.720 
gas giant kind of like Jupiter or maybe
Uranus<00:05:15.610> I<00:05:15.820> had<00:05:16.000> to<00:05:16.090> say<00:05:16.240> Uranus<00:05:16.690> tonight

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
Uranus I had to say Uranus tonight

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.550 
Uranus I had to say Uranus tonight
actually<00:05:18.730> looks<00:05:19.030> like<00:05:19.180> it's<00:05:19.330> more<00:05:19.570> geared

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
actually looks like it's more geared

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.800 
actually looks like it's more geared
towards<00:05:20.740> Jupiter<00:05:21.250> looks<00:05:21.760> even<00:05:22.240> that's<00:05:22.570> an

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
towards Jupiter looks even that's an

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.110 
towards Jupiter looks even that's an
actual<00:05:23.169> I<00:05:23.470> he<00:05:23.830> added<00:05:24.160> to<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.460> that's<00:05:24.639> pretty

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
actual I he added to it that's pretty

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.240 
actual I he added to it that's pretty
damn<00:05:25.389> cool<00:05:25.800> how<00:05:26.800> he<00:05:26.830> did<00:05:27.250> that<00:05:28.800> all<00:05:29.800> right<00:05:30.040> so

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
damn cool how he did that all right so

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.650 
damn cool how he did that all right so
there<00:05:30.430> you<00:05:30.490> go<00:05:30.610> there's<00:05:30.910> jewel<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:31.479> let's

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
there you go there's jewel and let's

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:38.010 
there you go there's jewel and let's
take<00:05:31.960> a<00:05:32.229> look<00:05:33.120> at<00:05:34.860> lathe<00:05:36.660> now<00:05:37.660> we're<00:05:37.840> on<00:05:37.930> the

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
take a look at lathe now we're on the

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.379 
take a look at lathe now we're on the
dark<00:05:38.350> side<00:05:38.680> of<00:05:38.710> lathe<00:05:39.160> which<00:05:39.729> kind<00:05:40.090> of<00:05:40.180> sucks

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
dark side of lathe which kind of sucks

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.379 
dark side of lathe which kind of sucks
let<00:05:40.600> me<00:05:40.690> see<00:05:40.810> if<00:05:40.870> I<00:05:40.930> can<00:05:41.020> get<00:05:41.110> this<00:05:41.200> on<00:05:41.500> the

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
let me see if I can get this on the

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:48.810 
let me see if I can get this on the
dayside<00:05:44.220> lathe<00:05:45.220> actually<00:05:45.940> has<00:05:47.490> cloud<00:05:48.490> layers

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
dayside lathe actually has cloud layers

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.960 
dayside lathe actually has cloud layers
to<00:05:49.180> life<00:05:49.900> is<00:05:50.169> oxygen<00:05:50.800> atmosphere<00:05:51.010> so<00:05:51.580> it<00:05:51.760> would

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
to life is oxygen atmosphere so it would

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.510 
to life is oxygen atmosphere so it would
have<00:05:52.120> a<00:05:52.150> very<00:05:52.240> similar<00:05:53.039> cloud<00:05:54.039> layer<00:05:54.250> as

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
have a very similar cloud layer as

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.360 
have a very similar cloud layer as
kerbin<00:05:55.090> which<00:05:55.270> it<00:05:55.450> does<00:05:55.919> it<00:05:56.919> doesn't<00:05:57.250> seem

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
kerbin which it does it doesn't seem

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.040 
kerbin which it does it doesn't seem
like<00:05:57.520> it's<00:05:57.700> as<00:05:57.910> thick<00:05:58.360> and<00:05:58.570> of<00:05:58.690> course<00:05:58.900> it

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
like it's as thick and of course it

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.260 
like it's as thick and of course it
doesn't<00:05:59.289> have<00:05:59.440> city<00:05:59.800> lights<00:06:00.789> or<00:06:01.030> anything

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
doesn't have city lights or anything

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.450 
doesn't have city lights or anything
like<00:06:01.539> that<00:06:01.570> either<00:06:02.050> because<00:06:02.770> there's<00:06:03.250> no

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
like that either because there's no

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.650 
like that either because there's no
population<00:06:03.760> on<00:06:04.479> lathe<00:06:04.840> that<00:06:05.140> we<00:06:05.320> know<00:06:05.650> of<00:06:06.660> and

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
population on lathe that we know of and

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.980 
population on lathe that we know of and
there<00:06:07.810> we<00:06:07.900> go<00:06:08.050> with<00:06:08.289> Jun<00:06:08.590> in<00:06:09.070> the<00:06:09.250> background

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
there we go with Jun in the background

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.870 
there we go with Jun in the background
so<00:06:10.990> there<00:06:11.110> you<00:06:11.169> go<00:06:11.320> the<00:06:11.500> guys<00:06:11.680> that<00:06:12.430> is<00:06:12.669> the

so there you go the guys that is the

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.760 
so there you go the guys that is the
