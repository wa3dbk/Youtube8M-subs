experience<00:00:15.840> in<00:00:15.959> this<00:00:16.139> than<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.529> but<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.830> don't

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
experience in this than you but I don't

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.450 
experience in this than you but I don't
what<00:00:18.660> really<00:00:18.930> makes<00:00:19.259> a<00:00:19.410> boy<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> man<00:00:22.460> you'll

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
what really makes a boy a man you'll

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.060 
what really makes a boy a man you'll
assume<00:00:23.849> that<00:00:24.150> they<00:00:24.300> do<00:00:24.360> become<00:00:24.960> man<00:00:25.349> right

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
assume that they do become man right

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.260 
assume that they do become man right
I<00:00:26.599> imagine<00:00:27.599> science<00:00:27.960> can<00:00:28.169> define<00:00:28.559> it<00:00:28.770> I<00:00:28.890> mean<00:00:29.160> a

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
I imagine science can define it I mean a

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.260 
I imagine science can define it I mean a
certain<00:00:30.270> agent<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> guess<00:00:30.989> at<00:00:31.259> that<00:00:31.320> point<00:00:31.470> but

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
certain agent I guess at that point but

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.880 
certain agent I guess at that point but
when<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.329> was<00:00:33.450> 5<00:00:33.690> years<00:00:33.720> old<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.410> think<00:00:34.470> it<00:00:34.770> was

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
when I was 5 years old I think it was

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.729 
when I was 5 years old I think it was
about<00:00:35.040> 10<00:00:35.489> when<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:36.420> 10<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.690> was<00:00:36.870> about<00:00:37.050> 13<00:00:37.620> I

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
about 10 when I was 10 I was about 13 I

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.459 
about 10 when I was 10 I was about 13 I
was<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> man<00:00:38.130> I<00:00:38.430> guess<00:00:39.300> say<00:00:39.750> hey<00:00:39.840> puberty<00:00:40.260> but

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
was a man I guess say hey puberty but

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.450 
was a man I guess say hey puberty but
it's<00:00:41.399> not<00:00:41.579> necessarily<00:00:42.210> true<00:00:44.989> when<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.460> drive

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
it's not necessarily true when you drive

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.319 
it's not necessarily true when you drive
a<00:00:47.489> car<00:00:49.370> when<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.489> stop<00:00:50.789> living<00:00:50.999> with<00:00:51.239> your

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
a car when you stop living with your

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.310 
a car when you stop living with your
parents<00:00:51.920> I<00:00:53.359> don't<00:00:54.359> think<00:00:54.659> it<00:00:54.719> has<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.929> do<00:00:55.140> much

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
parents I don't think it has to do much

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.979 
parents I don't think it has to do much
with<00:00:55.499> age<00:00:55.769> I<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:56.969> be<00:00:57.089> a<00:00:57.120> man<00:00:57.359> at<00:00:57.539> 15

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
with age I think you can be a man at 15

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.110 
with age I think you can be a man at 15
years<00:00:58.140> old<00:00:58.499> or<00:00:58.679> you<00:00:58.800> cannot<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.339> man<00:00:59.579> at<00:00:59.760> 40

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
years old or you cannot be a man at 40

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.350 
years old or you cannot be a man at 40
years<00:01:00.239> old<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:05.060> don't<00:01:06.060> know<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.240> they<00:01:06.330> ever

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
years old I don't know if they ever

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:15.070 
years old I don't know if they ever
really<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:11.690> we<00:01:12.690> have<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.870> lot<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> grown<00:01:14.070> boys

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
really do we have a lot of grown boys

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.970 
really do we have a lot of grown boys
acting<00:01:16.080> out<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.560> park

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
acting out the park

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.030 
acting out the park
up<00:01:17.340> now<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.810> thought<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.260> I'm<00:01:19.650> becoming

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
up now and I thought like I'm becoming

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.580 
up now and I thought like I'm becoming
man<00:01:20.310> became<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.910> man<00:01:21.120> like<00:01:21.330> after<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> army

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
man became a man like after the army

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.700 
man became a man like after the army
that's<00:01:23.520> why<00:01:23.760> I<00:01:23.790> thought<00:01:24.590> when<00:01:25.590> he<00:01:26.600> gained

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
that's why I thought when he gained

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.460 
that's why I thought when he gained
responsibility<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:29.040> self

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.680 

probably<00:01:33.340> when<00:01:33.460> he<00:01:33.490> experiences<00:01:34.150> sex<00:01:34.450> for<00:01:34.660> the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
probably when he experiences sex for the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.520 
probably when he experiences sex for the
first<00:01:34.780> time

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.510 

when<00:01:39.040> he<00:01:39.160> has<00:01:39.280> to<00:01:39.430> take<00:01:39.640> care<00:01:39.850> of<00:01:39.970> someone

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.219 

when<00:01:44.030> he<00:01:44.120> probably<00:01:44.330> loses<00:01:44.720> something<00:01:45.020> really

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
when he probably loses something really

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.510 
when he probably loses something really
important<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.650> him<00:01:45.770> I<00:01:47.920> think<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:49.010> boy<00:01:49.100> becomes

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
important to him I think it boy becomes

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.230 
important to him I think it boy becomes
a<00:01:49.640> man<00:01:49.670> when<00:01:50.090> he<00:01:51.220> kind<00:01:52.220> of<00:01:52.250> takes<00:01:52.550> a<00:01:52.729> step<00:01:52.970> but

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
a man when he kind of takes a step but

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.790 
a man when he kind of takes a step but
other<00:01:53.510> people<00:01:53.840> before<00:01:53.960> himself<00:01:55.690> when<00:01:56.690> he

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
other people before himself when he
