00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.150
 another review of my phishing 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.280
 box yes we have now 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.200
 unfortunately, god february 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.360
 most are already in the time of their own 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.519
 and of course I have february here 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.560
 also have the february predatory box 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.090
 simply prepared small times 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.310
 look back and want you now completely 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.199
 briefly show which pictures we all in 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.880
 the box had for them still 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.070
 not get it that way it looks like 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.340
 when the box arrives that often one 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.130
 a bit of advertising in there write a where 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.570
 Then you get the body described 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.610
 here was also a in february 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.059
 coupon code again from the predator 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.980
 shop with it and usually finds 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.750
 you always have a lot of nice stickers with you 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.100
 It has a nice mix here too 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.750
 of course, February is now 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.239
 not the decisive argument though 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.090
 is always a nice bonus 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.390
 let's start in february 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.000
 Mix a mix of three rubber ones 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.690
 Doppler and a spinner but 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.309
 and so logically 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.619
 all the stuff out of every box 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.390
 you get every gummitwist always with 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.860
 the matching send with the time 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.390
 of course , very suitable for 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.490
 those who might just go into that 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.170
 theme predator fishing with art again 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.790
 you do not have to get in much 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.040
 I need someone to think 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.990
 in 30 40 hook the program and 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.700
 the like so long together 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.470
 that it is of course always fitting yes 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.970
 Just start with the first one 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.619
 two rubber but certainly two already 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.409
 years ago I would have to take a look 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.670
 The virus was in the box 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.560
 That's why we have this month 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.270
 Just once again twice 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.079
 brought two different ones once 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.130
 the cupido relax is quite interesting 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.200
 rubber kohler 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.610
 simply due to the subdivision of the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.770
 Of course, rubber cock has one 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.570
 nice game big shovel tail 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.880
 I can still feel good about it 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.860
 Do not remind the drivers of these now 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.780
 but the shape even two years ago in 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.340
 small village caught by sor and 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.350
 meter twenty was an interesting 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.290
 Of course, drill is natural 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.600
 interesting saargummi fish also from 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.490
 Incidentally, the size of all the system 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.040
 We also designed a lot 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.750
 that means everything can be covered 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.660
 I'll say it's around ten inches 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.860
 always fits wonderfully for zander pike 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.920
 and of course maybe one more 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.080
 capital harsh interesting 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.390
 I also find this king chef here 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.340
 coop he has a very very slim shape 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.130
 also an extremely large plate here 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.560
 You see tail and there it goes too 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.830
 Trend towards all rubber fishing 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.020
 to this very thin rubber part here 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.459
 tail that has advantages and disadvantages 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.860
 Of course you have an enormous one 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.480
 Vibration under water that lures robbers 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.040
 from afar 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.250
 However, they are also very very 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.630
 prone to many zander existed march 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.790
 in the back there about scarcely 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.840
 Often the rubber tail away though 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.120
 well, what do you want to do 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.209
 either the bait should be interesting 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.440
 or you catch nothing and of the 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.049
 They are all very rubbery 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.870
 high quality and already 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.690
 ten centimeters of bait that's everywhere 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.970
 can be used at the lake or flowing water 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.060
 yes when in any case two again 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.760
 coups here in the february box 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.650
 matching hook with this vmc we have 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.390
 Very often in there because I like that 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.790
 my personal opinion without now 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.799
 Advertising for the brand is what it is 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.390
 a very good hook for a little money 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.970
 even if you like a lot in 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.410
 rivers fishing vielleich tears off since 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.690
 Of course it's a pity if I say there 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.000
 a fox head takes that because 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.600
 Threefold costs then you have already 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.609
 corpse watering eye during construction in cs 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.709
 always just watch again if you 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.299
 many stones in the waters have tested 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.670
 quiet between times if the hook 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.370
 is still good tip if not always 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.530
 exchange again there you can 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.790
 you guys mess up with so far 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.230
 if he's not harsh anymore 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.470
 test again but otherwise 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.780
 the price is a tip top brands 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.600
 By the way, we also had one 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.290
 other vmc head this time with it 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.720
 in combination with this multi of 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.459
 peter michael so one or michelle 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.930
 or anyway I speak it 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.840
 probably wrong from one 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.850
 French brand too 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.250
 interesting rubber of the form her 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.840
 See, the trend is coming again 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.630
 narrow tail part wide plate 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.519
 Tail of massive body interesting 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.709
 rubber and one with the 3d eyes and there 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.680
 we had something of a different shape from 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.349
 vlc with it that has the consequence 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.450
 that the rubber fish on the side of the tilt 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.220
 if you forbid that 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.170
 now also has an interesting 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.380
 course, of course, again 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.210
 fitting in the coordinated 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.950
 By the way, february was still with me 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.410
 read it in addition to rating rough served in 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.020
 every tenth box made a cooler out of the 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.670
 Pre-mates as a win with it goes 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.780
 had not had even one more thing 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:50.570
 sweet with glasses and of course may also 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.100
 in february we are now in the 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.270
 but it will be soon afterwards 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.470
 go again and then you have already 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.680
 a little buffer for the next 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.930
 season in the tin kÃ¶hler must never be missing 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.110
 and since we had this month one of 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.900
 Robinson with a classic 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.630
 player perfect in size 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:12.980
 tuned to fast and pike yes that 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.690
 highlight of the february box was of course 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.550
 In any case, we have the ball here 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.550
 me once 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.840
 sami may be in the lot 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.660
 do not start in the area like that 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.160
 known whose high end japan boj wants 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.250
 I once called one sees also here 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.510
 right in the back you can also have a look 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.250
 We are invited one is nice out 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.380
 searched without pin this before a 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.080
 good index that the dobler very 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.090
 high quality is because the hook had 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.800
 now here's another unpacked the 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.420
 are of course razor-sharp if some 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.330
 Just go over the skin 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.460
 they are very fast hanging and 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.470
 the same thing happens with the course 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.940
 fish and while, of course, I have 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.650
 now here's a color taken out 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.900
 it's so half transparent you see 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.290
 that's just fine the usa lousy 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.910
 series have tahrir weighted trough the 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.770
 On the one hand there is the word weight 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.900
 Overall, your job weight 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.580
 Of course , there is one too 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.720
 small russell effect so if 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.210
 now take a hand in the hand 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.580
 shakes it's easy to hear that 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.970
 I find rattling very good 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.290
 Incidentally, I think so too 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.090
 more interesting like a very loud one 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.370
 Russell but the matter of taste and 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.250
 then these weights serve these balls 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.180
 here in there that the buck 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.770
 evenly it sinks that means it goes 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.540
 not down with the tip first or 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.960
 somehow wrong but just says 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.300
 from very interesting on to phase always 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.070
 if you throw the boxer out and calm 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.370
 let it sink a bit leads the 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:37.100
 quiet if you use the breaks 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.460
 which I find interesting and attractive 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.160
 then really one 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.319
 View 22 23 Wait and then wait 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:47.099
 continue to come quite often 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:49.680
 the buses in this resting phase of the us 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:51.530
 army wappler said a nice 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.660
 Highlight now here in the february box 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.030
 and if you have not ordered her yet 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.789
 then you should stir up the box 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:02.550
 start at 1 6 3 6 and 12 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:04.860
 months from 14 99 you get this 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.440
 box here and best 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.789
 subscribe to our channel and we 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.440
 Of course we would be happy if you could 

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:11.639
 still easy and then we'll see each other 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.030
 next time so until the 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.030
 next time
