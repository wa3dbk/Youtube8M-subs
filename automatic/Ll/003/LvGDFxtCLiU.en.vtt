00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.880
 I hope very well today for a little memory 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.849
 of 15 years precious that also what 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.000
 can do for weddings according to color or 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:31.029
 for christening this is an idea and I hope 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:37.510
 you like that we occupy we occupy a 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:38.860
 organza sachet of the smallest according to 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.110
 the measure that you want to 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.570
 sweets true sweets of course 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.430
 we occupy the mold the mold is in the 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.500
 bottom part where it says description 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.350
 there they can lower the mold is very 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:57.140
 simple we use glue this is 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:01.170
 terrific school white a brush 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:05.250
 creative scissors if not with the scissors 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.650
 Normal flowers can use flowers of the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.080
 size that you want little girls 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.180
 great in this case I'm going to do it in 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.220
 Pink color can also use these 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.420
 tiny flowers that are very pretty 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.640
 also and a fabric in this case is a 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.970
 thin fabric 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.430
 with brightness that makes it look very pretty 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.580
 the flower can be contrasting with the 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.590
 color that you put of what is the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.500
 true bag can be a color fiusha 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.470
 a wine color 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.170
 no more white no no I do not like it in color 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.750
 white but good you mean silicon 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.450
 The first thing we are going to do is cut back 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.460
 with our creative scissors are you 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.650
 they come as hollande 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.240
 but if they do not have the shape of holland 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.330
 that you want and if not with the 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.170
 same scissors give it an oval shape 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.619
 as lan quoted is true since we did 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.119
 that we're going to grab the thin fabric 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.959
 that we have chosen in this case I 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.759
 I chose one that shines very beautiful and we go 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.759
 to put white glue 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.230
 first we are going to put a little 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.230
 to adhere 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.860
 since we did that that sticks 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.430
 our web because now we are going to 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.430
 put more 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.069
 glue so that it is well covered 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.349
 of glue do not scare the color 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.410
 white is removed becomes transparent to 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.520
 the time to be dry so it's not going to 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.440
 spend nothing 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.580
 will be perfect will continue 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.140
 shining pretty and from the back 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.980
 we're going to do the same thing so 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:03.130
 be on both sides equally 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.130
 bright and beautiful our dress 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.800
 since we have put enough 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.800
 glue we will leave 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.300
 I know that they will do the same with the 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.430
 braces and make them thick they're going to 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.670
 put also fabric 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.420
 we continue when we have our dry 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.700
 telita shines very nice estate 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.300
 lite that I put you can do it without 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.360
 fabric that's optional to me because I 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.170
 like to put fabric but like to say hello 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.230
 nice then let's hit him the 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.209
 suspenders 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.980
 we are going to stick the suspenders with the 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.680
 glue that you want either 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.879
 get with with instant glue 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.200
 I bought this glue I know what I 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.349
 they had said that he had left the 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.530
 market and good but do not follow it 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:07.860
 selling here 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.910
 is equal to the brochita glue that I 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.610
 use but just as strong the only 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.480
 difference that I give him and so 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.060
 I could sometimes do not like much is 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.520
 because he does not have a brush then I have 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.620
 than doing it with a stick or with a 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.620
 brush already old because you start 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.009
 the advantage of this one 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.670
 and it's empty u2 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:43.910
 in a little bit you can be using it and 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:48.620
 it does not dry as fast as it does 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.630
 volatilizes the other the other glue 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.850
 so if then if they learn to use 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.670
 it's perfect it 's super economic 28 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:00.040
 pesos because the bottle is the truth 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:02.560
 very much worth it 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.890
 complete a little bit more but yes 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:10.560
 it's worth it in economic terms 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:10.560
 there is also this one that is for sticking fabric 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.130
 ah 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:32.990
 let's hit him too 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.990
 the little flowers 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.580
 in the suspenders 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.120
 you can stick them so much ahead 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.250
 by behind or nothing else on the part of 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.380
 go ahead as you want 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:53.100
 If the thing is that they are stuck pretty 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.100
 thereafter 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.810
 let's grab our little bag 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.819
 organza that can get them to a 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.919
 excellent price out there ask me 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.530
 I'm glad to give you the link where 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:11.380
 You can get them at a great price 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:13.360
 if they are dedicated to selling the truth 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.790
 let's fill it with sweets that are 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.190
 heavy so that we can stop our 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:23.440
 perfect dress the dress 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.960
 above the seam 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.860
 so that when you close it does not get in your way 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.259
 then you have to go up 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.340
 you can stick it with silicon what can 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:39.949
 stick with instant glue with what 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.949
 that you want 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.680
 they are just going to hit 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:54.360
 that is well well pegadito 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:57.890
 they will close their bag and when closing it 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.890
 they are going to put the cross 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:06.459
 and there they are going to paste the flower but without 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:13.979
 interfere when opening the sachet 

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:13.979
 if nothing else we are going to cross 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:20.300
 and arribita of the crossing we are going to put the 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.430
 flower 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.750
 if so that people can 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.750
 remove perfectly 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:32.270
 and the ribbon and open your bag with sweet 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.810
 even if I want to have music that sometimes 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:39.000
 they do not want to 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:41.520
 take away the sweets 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.680
 As you can see, it looks good. 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:49.090
 fast good economic 

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:51.550
 I hope you liked this idea and 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:54.900
 if you liked it, I like to see you 

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.900
