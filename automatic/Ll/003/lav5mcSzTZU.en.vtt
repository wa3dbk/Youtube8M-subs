00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.590 

okay<00:00:02.070> so<00:00:02.129> we're<00:00:02.820> gonna<00:00:02.939> take<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.240> look<00:00:03.389> at<00:00:03.540> the

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
okay so we're gonna take a look at the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.550 
okay so we're gonna take a look at the
gameplay<00:00:04.250> performance<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:07.140> surface<00:00:07.529> pro

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
gameplay performance of the surface pro

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.180 
gameplay performance of the surface pro
3<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:08.340> half-life<00:00:08.880> 2<00:00:09.030> deathmatch<00:00:10.040> the<00:00:11.040> only

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
3 in half-life 2 deathmatch the only

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.910 
3 in half-life 2 deathmatch the only
thing<00:00:11.340> I've<00:00:11.460> done<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:12.500> change<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.650> resolution

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
thing I've done is change the resolution

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.490 
thing I've done is change the resolution
to<00:00:14.400> match<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.820> surfaces<00:00:15.420> shrubs<00:00:15.719> resolution

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
to match the surfaces shrubs resolution

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.230 
to match the surfaces shrubs resolution
so<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:16.980> full<00:00:17.220> resolution<00:00:17.520> default

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
so this is full resolution default

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.140 
so this is full resolution default
settings<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.619> let's<00:00:19.949> go<00:00:20.220> ahead<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.699> see<00:00:21.029> what

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
settings and let's go ahead and see what

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:29.960 
settings and let's go ahead and see what
this<00:00:21.270> looks<00:00:21.330> like

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.279 

well<00:00:30.970> it's<00:00:31.090> pretty<00:00:31.270> quick

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:33.289 
well it's pretty quick

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:39.520 
well it's pretty quick
and<00:00:36.100> wow<00:00:37.100> that's<00:00:37.609> a<00:00:38.050> I'm<00:00:39.050> pretty<00:00:39.320> good

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
and wow that's a I'm pretty good

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.950 
and wow that's a I'm pretty good
actually<00:00:40.309> it's<00:00:40.850> not<00:00:41.000> bad<00:00:41.179> at<00:00:41.359> all<00:00:41.449> let's<00:00:41.719> turn

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
actually it's not bad at all let's turn

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:49.329 
actually it's not bad at all let's turn
the<00:00:42.109> frame<00:00:42.350> rate<00:00:42.559> counter<00:00:45.280> and<00:00:47.229> I<00:00:48.229> know<00:00:49.219> that's

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
the frame rate counter and I know that's

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.130 
the frame rate counter and I know that's
incredibly<00:00:49.579> teeny<00:00:50.390> on<00:00:50.539> the<00:00:50.629> screen<00:00:50.869> up<00:00:50.960> there

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
incredibly teeny on the screen up there

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.829 
incredibly teeny on the screen up there
but<00:00:51.350> we're<00:00:51.500> looking<00:00:51.829> at<00:00:51.979> 50<00:00:52.940> frames<00:00:53.180> a<00:00:53.420> second

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
but we're looking at 50 frames a second

00:00:53.839 --> 00:01:00.549 
but we're looking at 50 frames a second
right<00:00:53.989> now<00:00:54.019> full<00:00:54.469> screen<00:00:58.239> 50<00:00:59.239> 60<00:01:00.079> frames<00:01:00.379> a

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
right now full screen 50 60 frames a

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.850 
right now full screen 50 60 frames a
second<00:01:02.829> I'll<00:01:03.829> try<00:01:04.070> to<00:01:04.129> mess<00:01:04.399> them<00:01:04.580> stuff<00:01:04.909> up

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
second I'll try to mess them stuff up

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.010 
second I'll try to mess them stuff up
still<00:01:06.860> then<00:01:07.009> I'm<00:01:07.100> pretty<00:01:07.340> damn<00:01:07.580> good

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
still then I'm pretty damn good

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.570 
still then I'm pretty damn good
everything<00:01:09.020> is<00:01:09.289> running<00:01:09.770> quite<00:01:10.190> smoothly

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
everything is running quite smoothly

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.499 
everything is running quite smoothly
I'm<00:01:13.580> actually<00:01:13.729> pretty<00:01:14.030> impressed<00:01:15.159> that

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
I'm actually pretty impressed that

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.940 
I'm actually pretty impressed that
brought<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:17.690> frame<00:01:17.960> rate<00:01:18.170> down<00:01:18.350> in<00:01:18.619> this<00:01:18.740> area

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
brought the frame rate down in this area

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.160 
brought the frame rate down in this area
to<00:01:19.280> 30<00:01:19.610> frames<00:01:19.940> a<00:01:20.240> second<00:01:20.659> for<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:20.869> split<00:01:21.110> second

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
to 30 frames a second for a split second

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.419 
to 30 frames a second for a split second
I'm<00:01:24.170> gonna<00:01:24.350> run<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:24.649> long<00:01:24.770> enough<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.039> see<00:01:25.340> if

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
I'm gonna run it long enough to see if

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.300 
I'm gonna run it long enough to see if
it<00:01:25.549> will<00:01:25.610> actually<00:01:25.759> throttle<00:01:27.100> this<00:01:28.100> is

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
it will actually throttle this is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.980 
it will actually throttle this is
actually<00:01:28.670> running<00:01:28.880> quite<00:01:29.600> well<00:01:31.990> still

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
actually running quite well still

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.210 
actually running quite well still
running<00:01:33.229> at<00:01:33.289> 50<00:01:33.619> times<00:01:33.860> a<00:01:34.009> second<00:01:36.039> okay

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
running at 50 times a second okay

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.770 
running at 50 times a second okay
dips<00:01:37.489> into<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:37.940> 25<00:01:40.000> let's<00:01:41.000> go<00:01:41.179> ahead<00:01:41.300> and<00:01:41.539> try

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
dips into the 25 let's go ahead and try

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.639 
dips into the 25 let's go ahead and try
to

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.120 

even<00:01:47.310> turn<00:01:47.549> up<00:01:47.700> some<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> video<00:01:49.049> all<00:01:49.799> hi

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
even turn up some of the video all hi

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.300 
even turn up some of the video all hi
and<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:51.210> let's<00:01:51.810> try<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.049> some<00:01:52.110> anti<00:01:52.530> lazing

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.910 

turn<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> motion<00:01:59.850> blur<00:01:59.970> and

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.919 

high-dynamic-range

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:20.449 

see<00:02:09.929> how<00:02:10.019> that<00:02:10.229> looks

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.150 

okay<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:21.299> that's

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
okay so that's

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.730 
okay so that's
running<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.000> bit<00:02:24.180> slower<00:02:24.510> that's<00:02:24.840> about<00:02:25.170> 25

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
running a bit slower that's about 25

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.400 
running a bit slower that's about 25
frames<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.100> second<00:02:26.460> now<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.850> like

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
frames a second now this is like

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.990 
frames a second now this is like
basically<00:02:28.410> full<00:02:28.710> full<00:02:29.490> detail<00:02:31.820> so<00:02:32.820> that's

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
basically full full detail so that's

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.380 
basically full full detail so that's
probably<00:02:34.130> not<00:02:35.130> playable<00:02:37.460> well<00:02:38.490> playable<00:02:39.120> but

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
probably not playable well playable but

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.020 
probably not playable well playable but
not<00:02:39.780> ideal<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.470> we're<00:02:41.160> dipping<00:02:41.340> into<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.880> 20s

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
not ideal so we're dipping into the 20s

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.270 
not ideal so we're dipping into the 20s
here<00:02:42.540> but<00:02:43.020> that's<00:02:43.110> pretty<00:02:43.410> astounding

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
here but that's pretty astounding

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.430 
here but that's pretty astounding
at<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.700> full<00:02:45.210> resolution<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.990> surface

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
at the full resolution of the surface

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.760 
at the full resolution of the surface
the<00:02:47.210> 1440p<00:02:48.290> that's<00:02:49.940> pretty<00:02:50.940> good<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.840> that's

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
the 1440p that's pretty good so that's

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.890 
the 1440p that's pretty good so that's
our<00:02:53.010> high<00:02:53.190> resolution<00:02:53.400> test<00:02:54.150> let's<00:02:54.510> bump<00:02:54.780> it

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
our high resolution test let's bump it

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.350 
our high resolution test let's bump it
down<00:02:54.960> now<00:02:56.240> to<00:02:57.240> pump<00:02:57.330> this<00:02:57.660> down<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:59.360> something

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
down now to pump this down to something

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:08.690 
down now to pump this down to something
like<00:03:00.590> 1280<00:03:01.590> by<00:03:02.280> 768<00:03:06.980> let's<00:03:07.980> see<00:03:08.250> what<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.490> looks

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
like 1280 by 768 let's see what it looks

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.270 
like 1280 by 768 let's see what it looks
like<00:03:08.880> then<00:03:11.030> because<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.060> mean<00:03:12.570> gaming<00:03:13.280> this

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
like then because I mean gaming this

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.350 
like then because I mean gaming this
resolution<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:17.070> know<00:03:17.210> that<00:03:18.210> high

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
resolution is you know that high

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.240 
resolution is you know that high
resolution<00:03:18.800> is<00:03:20.210> not<00:03:21.650> necessary<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.770> would<00:03:22.890> say

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.660 

so

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
so

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.340 
so
pumping<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.180> down<00:03:27.210> to<00:03:27.480> like<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.660> 720p

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
pumping it down to like a 720p

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.970 
pumping it down to like a 720p
resolution<00:03:29.690> which<00:03:30.690> on<00:03:30.900> this<00:03:31.050> small<00:03:31.320> screen<00:03:31.740> is

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
resolution which on this small screen is

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.650 
resolution which on this small screen is
actually<00:03:32.250> not<00:03:32.640> bad<00:03:32.700> at<00:03:33.090> all<00:03:33.210> and<00:03:33.830> it's<00:03:35.660> other

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
actually not bad at all and it's other

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.900 
actually not bad at all and it's other
than<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.990> it's<00:03:37.230> like<00:03:37.410> all<00:03:37.590> high<00:03:37.800> details<00:03:38.280> and

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
than that it's like all high details and

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.810 
than that it's like all high details and
it's<00:03:39.180> running<00:03:39.830> pretty<00:03:40.830> smoothly<00:03:41.250> at<00:03:41.430> 60

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
it's running pretty smoothly at 60

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.840 
it's running pretty smoothly at 60
frames<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.210> second<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.040> that's<00:03:44.040> pretty<00:03:44.430> nice<00:03:45.470> so

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
frames a second so that's pretty nice so

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.430 
frames a second so that's pretty nice so
that's<00:03:47.850> been<00:03:48.120> our<00:03:48.150> half-life<00:03:48.570> 2<00:03:48.900> deathmatch

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
that's been our half-life 2 deathmatch

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.380 
that's been our half-life 2 deathmatch
test<00:03:50.040> on<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.400> surface<00:03:50.760> pro<00:03:51.000> 3<00:03:53.180> terms<00:03:54.180> of

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
test on the surface pro 3 terms of

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.780 
test on the surface pro 3 terms of
thermal<00:03:54.600> throttling<00:03:55.020> I<00:03:55.530> can<00:03:56.190> feel<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.520> fans

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
thermal throttling I can feel the fans

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.110 
thermal throttling I can feel the fans
ramped<00:03:57.270> up<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.170> it's<00:03:58.460> as<00:03:59.460> hot<00:03:59.820> as<00:03:59.970> it

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
ramped up and it's and it's as hot as it

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.980 
ramped up and it's and it's as hot as it
ever<00:04:00.420> gets

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
ever gets

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.660 
ever gets
I<00:04:01.230> mean<00:04:01.440> which<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:01.680> not<00:04:01.950> hotter<00:04:02.190> than<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.520> can

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
I mean which is not hotter than you can

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.060 
I mean which is not hotter than you can
actually<00:04:02.820> touch<00:04:03.150> it's<00:04:03.570> fine<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:04.410> touch<00:04:04.650> on

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
actually touch it's fine to touch on

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.280 
actually touch it's fine to touch on
there<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:06.750> it's<00:04:06.990> still<00:04:07.230> playing<00:04:09.140> really<00:04:10.140> well

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
there and it's still playing really well

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.010 
there and it's still playing really well
so<00:04:10.710> I<00:04:10.830> imagine<00:04:11.610> this<00:04:11.910> throttling<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.750> little

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
so I imagine this throttling a little

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.310 
so I imagine this throttling a little
bit<00:04:13.200> here<00:04:13.470> but<00:04:14.510> still<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.540> really<00:04:16.109> good

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
bit here but still a really good

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.520 
bit here but still a really good
gameplay<00:04:17.010> experience<00:04:18.320> so<00:04:19.320> pretty<00:04:20.190> impressive
