00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and of course this metal part goes on

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.960 
and of course this metal part goes on
the<00:01:29.310> bottom

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
this is why I found it kind of

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.920 
this is why I found it kind of
irritating<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.000> got<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:45.720> now

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
irritating so you got that in there now

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.359 
irritating so you got that in there now
it<00:01:46.590> should<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:46.829> good<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.250> go<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.960> then<00:01:49.369> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
it should be good to go and then the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.039 
it should be good to go and then the
microSD<00:01:51.210> card

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
microSD card

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.859
