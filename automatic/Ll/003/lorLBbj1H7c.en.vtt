 most Norwegians with all the flags that show. 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.730
 I didn't think the part they were hoping for from the private houses of personal data - 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.830
 solitary bcs 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.690

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.960
 meter where 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.270
 luckily for us we won and there was a 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.930
 in the silence of the grave inc. throughout the stadium 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.360
 but after a few second hours 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.360

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.210
 that in that situation 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.650
 after a moment of confusion 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.960
 they started from the d 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.470
 Italians

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.869
 after a few cold seconds this is a huge applause 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:31.919
 and but then nos 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.029
 her throughout the day throughout the whole Olympiad every 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:39.129
 Norwegian that between the street and complimented what not 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.899
 unfortunately it does not happen for photos 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:43.899
 then we remember the other 3 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:46.130
 maurilio dante dante ita 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.160
 albarella 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.749
 silvio fauner 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:50.339
 CORIMA 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:53.050
 he says that the life that may have been 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.430
 that of the 50 kilometers a year later at the thunder bay world championships 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.489
 I don't know if it's true 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.739
 too harp let us revive in 3 seconds what you think in these 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.659
 last 100 meters clothing 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.179
 but the memory just thought I was the one you 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:13.099
 but it's not like I made a big one 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.099
 for 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:23.319
 the memory of 3 rooms is very great, but I planned the whole 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.179
 the whole race is days before and I was hoping to get to the one in that one 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:31.179
 situation in those at that time point to 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.599
 the invoked of the last corner stadium 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.149
 Pomellato a thing the finish line and I didn't think of state 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:41.879
 then I insist last comment 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.900
 the relay for those who use this technique are good if I remember correctly it was 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.200
 technical director 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.189
 bet a lot on this 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:52.969
 and he had thought 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.469
 of the calculations 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:04:00.459
 changes took place within certain seconds you had possibilities 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.489
 tension to go to me Italian to win and you 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.929
 when you realized that instead the possibility was to get on the step 

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:13.309
 higher and let's say we calculate prisons first day and we have them 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:14.719
 facts 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:18.989
 each mixed a bit all flat roofs the first impressions stand alone 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:19.930
 for you 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.930
 We were hoping he stayed with 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.069
 at most 20 25 seconds while he arrived with 8 seconds then 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.599
 it was all for all the masai mara out laundry 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.240
 for all those natal for the second in 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.880
 you can not kilometers told the two in front and then giorgio vanzetta armed 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.520
 touch me together and together with the Norwegian Finnish Simmel who broke away 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.289
 immediately 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.249
 then you too 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:49.610
 the same fate to enjoy 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.909
 from champion 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.169
 from Olympic to technical director 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.949
 shaking your wrists it's easier to poop 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.990
 but I must certainly agree with this love 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.620
 it's a lot it's much easier to get it over with d 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.770
 dt manage as you want 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.150

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.569
 technical responsibility of an ardent staff therefore 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.639
 the entrepreneur 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.460
 the concern 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.669
 criticized 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.400
