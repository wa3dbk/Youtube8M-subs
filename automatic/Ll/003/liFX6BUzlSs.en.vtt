00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
 boss of 15 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.250
 we change 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.800
 Well, in my opinion, even now I feel 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.800
 better pedal 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.289
 even very much better than those I should say 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.090
 not better accelerates straight 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.250
 felt 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.640
 Here's a medal for a little bit really shake 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.120
 before it was here now she should 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.860
 follow the gas pedal you push 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.930
 the only thing that she works there 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.790
 one-third and the gas pedal that is where 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.479
 the work ends, he is such a provalchik 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:09.290
 going to pull just gotta remember 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:14.480
 and this one works 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.310
 and this one just on the rise there still 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.620
 something feels like don't pull on 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.380
 press both at the personal as well as vice versa 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.880
 dragging to the action zone channel 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.630
 cadillac 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.630
 word numbers like 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.040
 60 on 5 should pull out 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.300
 here on the rise on overtaking on lower 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.300
 can not switch 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.180
 physics seems to be going fine 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.119
 20 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.380
 stand on top 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.380
 they 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.359
 earlier when 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.899
 details in Moscow 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.430
 by 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.650
 by 5 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.650
 metro per hour 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.490
 Well, as we see a cat 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.490
 pulls out 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.660
 and pulls you no well 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.760
 customers are so good and bye 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.519
 no good good even nicer ride 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.519
 by far 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.120
 no completely different thing completely 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.390
 I haven't left mine out of the pond 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.160
 exactly 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.330
 already began to remind solaris all 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.330
 everything is fine smoothly 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.870
 switches hell you they will try 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.950
 overtake 4 8 6 by 5 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.950
 very good 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.250
 do not spend even now 12 2 for me 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.950
 I have not had such a number yet 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:10.240
 I'll say a little now 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:13.260
 12 and 8 in my opinion the smallest now 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.260
 you are already 12 2 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.230
 inhabited by 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.920
 but for now we will not go where that's at now my 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.920
 air conditioning 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.229
 here's your air conditioner works no 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.229
 it's okay anyway 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.069
 no I do not feel change because 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.069
 the fact that air conditioning is the cause 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.180
 just not even a comparison on Solaris 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.290
 when I turned on the air conditioning reception 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.900
 felt the car 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.670
 periodically jerks did it 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.350
 there is 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.110
 skates idols to know yourself 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.950
 here we drove 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.950
 no changes 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.569
 -10 came to mark 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:12.690
 rating smoothly so smoothly at all 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.690
 and you are no match in order to 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.110
 10 and 8 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:23.789
 9 it can and 8 go down 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.220
 well, it's generally amazing paper only 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:29.220
 positive emotions only 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:33.199
 positive and here's the expense of saying such 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.199
 I did not have such numbers
