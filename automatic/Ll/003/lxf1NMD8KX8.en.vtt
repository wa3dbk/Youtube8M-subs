00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.620 
something like mint blue I'm not really
sure<00:01:35.610> what<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.000> called<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.600> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
sure what it's called but it's like a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.530 
sure what it's called but it's like a
bluish<00:01:36.990> color<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.850> this<00:01:38.850> was<00:01:38.970> my<00:01:39.119> first<00:01:39.299> time

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
bluish color and this was my first time

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.100 
bluish color and this was my first time
ever<00:01:39.659> trying<00:01:40.110> female<00:01:40.530> clay<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:42.020> kind<00:01:43.020> of

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
ever trying female clay and I kind of

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.749 
ever trying female clay and I kind of
messed<00:01:43.320> up<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.770> temperature<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.310> little<00:01:44.549> bit

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
messed up the temperature a little bit

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.760 
messed up the temperature a little bit
but<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.299> came<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.689> okay<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.649> is

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
but I think came out okay so this is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.030 
but I think came out okay so this is
what<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.040> looks<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:48.680> of<00:01:49.680> course<00:01:49.710> i'll

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
what that looks like and of course i'll

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.920 
what that looks like and of course i'll
still<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.369> experimenting<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.329> clays<00:01:51.600> i

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
still be experimenting with the clays i

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.870 
still be experimenting with the clays i
usually<00:01:52.350> use<00:01:52.380> sculpey<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.189> primo<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.729> this

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
usually use sculpey and primo so this

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.910 
usually use sculpey and primo so this
was<00:01:54.030> definitely<00:01:54.210> new<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.659> me<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.079> i<00:01:55.530> love<00:01:55.799> how
