00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
video I'm just going to briefly outline

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.789 
video I'm just going to briefly outline
some<00:01:30.369> of<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:30.729> themes<00:01:31.509> of<00:01:31.779> those<00:01:32.139> just<00:01:32.469> so

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
some of the themes of those just so

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.239 
some of the themes of those just so
you're<00:01:33.009> familiar<00:01:33.490> with<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:34.770> lesson<00:01:35.770> plan<00:01:35.979> as

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:36.249 
you're familiar with the lesson plan as

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:38.029 
you're familiar with the lesson plan as
it's<00:01:36.729> going<00:01:37.029> to<00:01:37.119> unfold

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
it's going to unfold

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.489 
it's going to unfold
so<00:01:39.039> the<00:01:39.369> first<00:01:39.670> one<00:01:40.359> of<00:01:40.479> these<00:01:40.630> will<00:01:41.319> be<00:01:41.469> the

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:41.499 
so the first one of these will be the

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:45.899 
so the first one of these will be the
advanced<00:01:42.130> French<00:01:42.549> which<00:01:43.359> continues<00:01:44.079> with<00:01:44.909> two

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
advanced French which continues with two

to<00:01:53.289> grab<00:01:54.039> space<00:01:54.399> by<00:01:54.969> playing<00:01:55.979> 'if<00:01:56.979> I've

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.600 

and<00:02:01.050> initially<00:02:02.050> this<00:02:02.260> looks<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.920> little<00:02:03.430> bit

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
and initially this looks a little bit

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.770 
and initially this looks a little bit
awkward<00:02:04.060> for<00:02:04.450> black<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:05.170> takes<00:02:05.860> away<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:06.780> f6

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
awkward for black it takes away the f6

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.400 
awkward for black it takes away the f6
square<00:02:08.410> for<00:02:08.770> example<00:02:09.570> but<00:02:10.570> as<00:02:10.810> you'll<00:02:10.960> see<00:02:11.020> in

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
square for example but as you'll see in

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
square for example but as you'll see in
future<00:02:11.770> videos

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
future videos

that's<00:02:12.670> not<00:02:13.630> something<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.380> be<00:02:14.590> overly

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
that's not something to be overly

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.150 
that's not something to be overly
concerned<00:02:15.310> about<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:17.020> French<00:02:17.950> advance

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
concerned about and the French advance

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.200 
concerned about and the French advance
is<00:02:18.670> an<00:02:18.880> awful<00:02:19.330> lot<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.480> fun<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.900> play<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:22.000> most

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
is an awful lot of fun to play the most

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.440 
is an awful lot of fun to play the most
thematic<00:02:22.870> way<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:24.690> continuing<00:02:25.690> is<00:02:26.460> with<00:02:27.460> c5

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
thematic way of continuing is with c5

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.080 
thematic way of continuing is with c5
and<00:02:28.750> black<00:02:29.710> will<00:02:30.160> usually<00:02:30.400> follow<00:02:30.880> this<00:02:31.030> up

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
and black will usually follow this up

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.470 
and black will usually follow this up
with<00:02:31.510> moves<00:02:31.960> such<00:02:32.650> as<00:02:33.660> knight<00:02:34.660> c6<00:02:36.180> Queen<00:02:37.180> b6

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
with moves such as knight c6 Queen b6

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.830 
with moves such as knight c6 Queen b6
and<00:02:38.170> really<00:02:38.920> starting<00:02:39.490> to<00:02:39.520> place<00:02:39.850> an<00:02:40.120> awful

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
and really starting to place an awful

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.910 
and really starting to place an awful
lot<00:02:41.020> of<00:02:41.200> pressure<00:02:41.500> on<00:02:42.180> d4<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:44.680> course

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
lot of pressure on d4 and of course

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.560 
lot of pressure on d4 and of course
we'll<00:02:45.220> go<00:02:45.370> into<00:02:45.580> each<00:02:45.850> of<00:02:46.060> these<00:02:46.180> variations

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
we'll go into each of these variations

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.350 
we'll go into each of these variations
in<00:02:47.140> an<00:02:47.290> awful<00:02:47.620> lot<00:02:47.740> more<00:02:47.770> detail<00:02:48.250> as<00:02:49.150> we

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
in an awful lot more detail as we

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.250 
in an awful lot more detail as we
continue<00:02:49.840> through<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.140> course<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.900> let's

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
continue through the course so let's

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.370 
continue through the course so let's
just<00:02:53.410> go<00:02:53.530> back<00:02:53.710> to<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.890> beginning<00:02:55.410> efore<00:02:56.880> c6

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
just go back to the beginning efore c6

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
of being a beginner is we're going to

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.770 
of being a beginner is we're going to
relieve<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.180> tension<00:04:40.620> immediately<00:04:41.620> and

relieve the tension immediately and

Knight c3 or Knight d2 we're going to

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.430 
Knight c3 or Knight d2 we're going to
simplify<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:50.850> immediately<00:04:51.850> takes<00:04:52.150> D<00:04:52.780> takes

simplify and immediately takes D takes

simplify and immediately takes D takes
e4<00:04:54.130> and<00:04:54.400> this<00:04:55.240> cuts<00:04:55.540> down<00:04:55.630> on<00:04:56.020> an<00:04:56.230> awful<00:04:56.710> lot<00:04:56.890> of

e4 and this cuts down on an awful lot of

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.770 
e4 and this cuts down on an awful lot of
theory<00:04:58.950> so<00:04:59.950> if<00:05:00.730> you're<00:05:00.940> interested<00:05:01.180> in<00:05:01.630> the
