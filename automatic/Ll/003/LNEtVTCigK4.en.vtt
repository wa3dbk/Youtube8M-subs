00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.849
 hello and welcome to our 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.259
 new video my name is niklas and us 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.360
 have a new product from home 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.890
 devil we get now 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.930
 probably also clearly 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.689
 see is and that is it 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.090
 this is about the devil ary one 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.489
 wireless bluetooth headphones too 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.989
 intended for outdoor use is yet 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.820
 before we get to the technical 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.190
 enter specifications and the 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.700
 characteristics of the headphones we look 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.500
 us and now once the scope of delivery 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.679
 if we have removed the cartonage 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.749
 we see that we have a transport bag 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.579
 I'm always very happy 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:53.030
 praiseworthy when traveling 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.530
 ideal for stowing the headphones of the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.230
 Furthermore, we have another two 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.920
 user manuals once in the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.229
 once in English and one on 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.609
 German 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.100
 but we are of course interested in something 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.850
 is in the transport bag 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.310
 Of course this is about this 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.940
 real product and we will see then 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.000
 even when the harry opens it immediately 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.900
 in the eye he sticks more to the version 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.650
 with anthracite a hanger and earcups 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.990
 a white silicone band very simple 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.450
 but I like it 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.360
 actually very good then we have too 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.490
 a usb cable to recharge the battery is 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.550
 Finally, a wireless headset 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.900
 but should the battery on the go yet 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.240
 then give up the ghost that too 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.100
 no problem because we can not do that 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.400
 headphones then also with these 3 5 mm 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:49.210
 be used to connect cables use cable 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.720
 can do more over either an nfc chip 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.120
 assuming of course that yours 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.430
 smartphone or player then too 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.280
 have a nfc chip are the 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.140
 the simplest variant I think 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.680
 or we can of course also on the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.690
 then classical fashion over the 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.970
 normal pairing mode the devices 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.830
 simply couple with each other 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.200
 once to turn on the headphones 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.730
 press the play button for three seconds and 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.040
 then automatically starts the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.920
 pairing process as it then s.der led 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.870
 is indicated on the website have 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.530
 we also have a volume 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.880
 Rake everything right on the ear again 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.410
 can control 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.030
 is also going back and forth and we 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.480
 can also accept calls or 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.010
 refuse about the control panels like me 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.660
 I think it's very practical to be like that 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.470
 mobile phone theoretically no longer out of the 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.470
 take a bag to control the music 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.650
 we see here we have silicone 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.170
 upholstery and here the usb connection to 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.730
 charge the battery the loud devil up 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.020
 to endure for 20 hours 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.210
 but I have yet to be in one 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.440
 test show alternatively as I said 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.340
 We then also the jack 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.110
 use 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.370
 However, then the electronics 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.010
 and we can not do any more 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.840
 the control panels to start the music 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.180
 or use quiet and loud rule 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.900
 The silicone earcups can also be 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.150
 change 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.130
 we only have to do this once against the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.120
 Turn clockwise a bit and 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.420
 already we can take care of you 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.440
 for example, to lose some weight though 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.510
 also to shape them against others 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.210
 to be exchanged devil offers in 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.770
 online shop then still as an accessory 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.050
 different colored earpads on 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.390
 also the silicone band can be 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.710
 remove and then against another 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.230
 exchange or just to 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.320
 cleansing slimming I find a cool 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.730
 idea 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.100
 of course we can also use the headphones 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.780
 to adapt to our head has his 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.640
 headphones view that at least one 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.850
 good and here we see then that would be 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.830
 stop on both sides of the headphones one 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.990
 can adjust a bit on the size 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.430
 so that actually for every head shape the 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.320
 suitable size should be there 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.570
 I do not have any technology yet 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.230
 so much said we have 40mm linear hd 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.330
 driver 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.420
 these are magnetized by neodymium 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.880
 powered bluetooth 4.0 is available 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.360
 and is streamed with the ptx codec 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.160
 thereby halt achieved cd quality 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.540
 is about the bluetooth streaming on 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.980
 the devil leaves the first glance 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.840
 a very good impression 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.510
 I have heard a short sample 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.530
 even there I know how to convince 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.239
 that certainly a little bit longer 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.900
 to hear a final conclusion 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.250
 leave 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.630
 the other is me, of course 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.730
 interested in whether the devil 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.710
 specified 20 hours really achieved 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.700
 So be 20 hours of battery life at 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.100
 normal volume 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.300
 All this will then clarify our test 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.950
 We will be here in the video description 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.050
 link and where you then 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.640
 I can inform you in detail 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.510
 you would like me over 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.580
 a thumb tall 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.169
 and when we subscribe to our channel 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.909
 I'll love it until the next video 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.909
 readers and spectators until then see
