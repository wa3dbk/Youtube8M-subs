this<00:01:24.810> team<00:01:25.049> less<00:01:25.259> than<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> month<00:01:25.680> ago<00:01:25.939> what

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
this team less than a month ago what

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.060 
this team less than a month ago what
does<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.360> need<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.770> next<00:01:28.979> level

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
does it need to get to that next level

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.770 
does it need to get to that next level
and<00:01:29.340> how<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.790> provide<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.150> well<00:01:30.750> I

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and how can you provide that well I

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.030 
and how can you provide that well I
think<00:01:30.900> one<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> things<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.680> learn<00:01:31.860> in

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
think one of the things you learn in

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.219 
think one of the things you learn in
this<00:01:32.130> league<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:33.060> there's<00:01:33.600> very<00:01:33.689> very

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
this league is that there's very very

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.280 
this league is that there's very very
little<00:01:34.470> difference<00:01:34.950> between<00:01:35.479> 3<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.630> 13<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
little difference between 3 and 13 and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.260 
little difference between 3 and 13 and
13<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.890> 3<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.250> mean<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.640> lot<00:01:38.759> like<00:01:39.030> that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
13 and 3 I mean it's a lot like that

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.670 
13 and 3 I mean it's a lot like that
matter<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.750> fact<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.049> was<00:01:40.140> one<00:01:40.259> year<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.560> had

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
matter of fact it was one year we had

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.039 
matter of fact it was one year we had
the<00:01:40.770> 14<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.280> overrun<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.759> 2009<00:01:42.540> there<00:01:42.960> were

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the 14 and overrun in 2009 there were

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.719 
the 14 and overrun in 2009 there were
seven<00:01:43.439> games<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.860> came<00:01:44.040> from<00:01:44.159> behind<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
seven games we came from behind in the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.280 
seven games we came from behind in the
fourth<00:01:44.970> quarter<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.329> order<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.659> win<00:01:45.810> we<00:01:46.140> could

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
fourth quarter in order to win we could

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.840 
fourth quarter in order to win we could
have<00:01:46.380> been<00:01:46.470> seven<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:46.950> seven<00:01:47.250> as<00:01:47.369> easy<00:01:47.579> as<00:01:47.729> we

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
have been seven and seven as easy as we

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.190 
have been seven and seven as easy as we
were<00:01:48.000> 14<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.750> OH

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
were 14 and OH

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.639 
were 14 and OH
so<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> big<00:01:50.009> thing<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.649> you

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
so the big thing is I think is that you

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.289 
so the big thing is I think is that you
know<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:53.220> gonna<00:01:53.340> need<00:01:53.579> some<00:01:53.759> tweaking<00:01:54.030> in

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
know it's gonna need some tweaking in

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.940 
know it's gonna need some tweaking in
some<00:01:54.479> areas<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.380> some<00:01:55.590> areas<00:01:55.860> just

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
some areas and then some areas just

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.859 
some areas and then some areas just
gonna<00:01:56.189> need<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> lot<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.000> hard<00:01:57.299> work<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
gonna need a lot of hard work and

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.870 
gonna need a lot of hard work and
determination<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.579> always<00:01:59.729> a

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
determination and it's always a

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.190 
determination and it's always a
combination<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.540> those<00:02:00.659> two<00:02:00.869> there<00:02:01.079> are<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
combination of those two there are the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.179 
combination of those two there are the
biggest<00:02:01.350> feather<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.740> your<00:02:01.770> cap<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.159> that
