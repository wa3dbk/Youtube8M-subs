00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.049
 hello how are you welcome to this 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.330
 technological segment today we are going to 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.759
 explore applications to order a 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.220
 little more their lives the first one is called 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.919
 spend and here we tell you what it is about 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.720
 you and is an application that allows 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.149
 keep track of our expenses 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.120
 a very visual way and now it reaches 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.670
 Young 7 with a pretty clean design and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.590
 successful is definitely an application 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.079
 quite complete and simple to use 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.070
 generate a new expense record is 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.870
 very easy 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.999
 we tap on the icon more and 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.859
 we add the amount then the 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:49.920
 category to which the expense belongs 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:52.710
 be the car home family travel food 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.629
 clothes entertainment bills and others to 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.460
 from there all the data will go 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.589
 generating information statistics 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.199
 that we can use to see evolution 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.969
 for a week or a month to meet in 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.870
 what we spend more and see if we can 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.810
 reduce or not this way expense is our 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.250
 second recommendation for this day 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.110
 form is a task manager of 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.240
 collaboration that is made for 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.920
 homes and has a list of tasks to 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.570
 each member of the household 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.700
 most of the applications of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.619
 projects are individualistic and only 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.080
 they take into account what a person has 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.149
 what to do and that's why form is complete 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.250
 form provides a list of tasks 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.830
 earrings that each member can add 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.110
 and complete the application you can by 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.210
 supposed to use for business tasks 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.720
 last but not least 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.820
 we suggest using almost as if family 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.399
 organizer available for android and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.100
 iphone faithful to his name keeps his life 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.689
 family synchronized the application 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.670
 offers a shared calendar that 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.009
 has a color code for each 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.020
 member of his family therefore he 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.780
 can see at a glance who is going to 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.369
 where and when do you add an appointment 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.530

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.780
 family that are also involved 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.850
 of the cousy calendar provides a 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.740
 do list list 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.380
 purchases and even a newspaper from the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.870
 family that can include text and photos 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.360
 there you have three options for 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.430
 choose which one is best suited to 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.200
