because I used it so today I'll be

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.679 
because I used it so today I'll be
talking<00:00:24.240> about<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.570> software<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:26.070> hardware

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
talking about the software the hardware

let's<00:00:32.340> start<00:00:32.430> with<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> motors<00:00:34.160> easel<00:00:35.160> here

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
let's start with the motors easel here

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.229 
let's start with the motors easel here
our<00:00:35.640> dynamics<00:00:36.180> will<00:00:36.329> absolve<00:00:36.930> motors<00:00:38.239> and

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
our dynamics will absolve motors and

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.180 
our dynamics will absolve motors and
they're<00:00:40.200> considered<00:00:40.500> some<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> most

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
they're considered some of the most

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.979 
they're considered some of the most
advanced<00:00:41.820> robot<00:00:43.280> actuators<00:00:44.280> out<00:00:44.610> there<00:00:44.989> they

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
advanced robot actuators out there they

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.290 
advanced robot actuators out there they
have<00:00:46.680> built-in<00:00:47.309> microcontrollers<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:50.300> they

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
have built-in microcontrollers and they

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.040 
have built-in microcontrollers and they
kept<00:00:51.570> our<00:00:51.930> sensors<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.440> measure<00:00:52.850> temperature

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
kept our sensors to measure temperature

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.810 
kept our sensors to measure temperature
current<00:00:56.000> load<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.420> they<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.320> either<00:00:58.440> go<00:00:58.820> 360

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
current load and they can either go 360

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.209 
current load and they can either go 360
degrees<00:01:00.359> they<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.829> continuous

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
degrees they can have continuous

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.679 
degrees they can have continuous
rotation<00:01:02.340> or<00:01:02.960> they<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.350> rotate<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.689> optimum

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
rotation or they can rotate to optimum

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.520 
rotation or they can rotate to optimum
position<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> standard<00:01:07.830> hobby<00:01:08.010> servo

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
position like a standard hobby servo

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.030 
position like a standard hobby servo
they're<00:01:10.530> pretty<00:01:10.650> expensive<00:01:11.360> fifty<00:01:12.360> bucks

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
they're pretty expensive fifty bucks

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.950 
they're pretty expensive fifty bucks
somewhere<00:01:14.040> around<00:01:14.100> there<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.580> piece<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.240> think

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
somewhere around there a piece I think

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.980 
somewhere around there a piece I think
that's<00:01:16.080> what<00:01:16.259> makes<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.880> kit<00:01:17.880> really<00:01:18.330> good

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
that's what makes this kit really good

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.550 
that's what makes this kit really good
Smith<00:01:19.680> price<00:01:20.420> now<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.930> sensor<00:01:22.259> unit

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
Smith price now you have a sensor unit

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.810 
Smith price now you have a sensor unit
which<00:01:22.680> looks<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.040> lot<00:01:23.189> like<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.549> motors

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
which looks a lot like the motors

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.090 
which looks a lot like the motors
actually<00:01:24.270> except<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.750> actually<00:01:25.530> lifting

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
actually except if you actually lifting

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.969 
actually except if you actually lifting
it<00:01:26.220> you'll<00:01:26.400> feel<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.790> lot<00:01:26.939> later<00:01:27.680> it's<00:01:28.680> got

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
it you'll feel it's a lot later it's got

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.060 
it you'll feel it's a lot later it's got

robot<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.810> walking<00:02:35.989> droid<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.830> here<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:39.920> a

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
robot the walking droid and here is a

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.370 
robot the walking droid and here is a
controller<00:02:40.600> wont<00:02:41.600> thing<00:02:41.780> that<00:02:41.900> are<00:02:42.019> see<00:02:42.200> about

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
controller wont thing that are see about

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.630 
controller wont thing that are see about
this<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:42.980> doesn't<00:02:43.010> actually<00:02:43.340> have<00:02:43.610> a

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
this is it doesn't actually have a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.479 
this is it doesn't actually have a
bottom<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.590> battery<00:02:45.860> costs<00:02:46.190> out<00:02:46.280> pretty

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
bottom so the battery costs out pretty

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.680 
bottom so the battery costs out pretty
easily<00:02:46.700> but<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:48.140> does<00:02:48.260> have<00:02:48.410> this<00:02:48.620> enclosure

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
easily but it does have this enclosure

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.360 
easily but it does have this enclosure
which<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:51.170> have<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.530> put<00:02:51.709> screws<00:02:52.010> in<00:02:52.220> these

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
which you have to put screws in these

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.070 
which you have to put screws in these
little<00:02:52.550> holes<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.209> it's<00:02:53.330> really<00:02:53.600> hard<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.930> see

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
little holes and it's really hard to see

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.310 
little holes and it's really hard to see
because<00:02:54.350> screw<00:02:54.709> Nelson<00:02:55.070> um<00:02:55.989> that's<00:02:56.989> kind<00:02:57.260> of

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
because screw Nelson um that's kind of

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.650 
because screw Nelson um that's kind of
annoying<00:02:57.820> but<00:02:58.820> about<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.060> controller<00:02:59.510> in

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
annoying but about the controller in

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.220 
annoying but about the controller in
general<00:03:00.019> it's<00:03:00.290> got<00:03:00.500> like<00:03:01.190> d-pad<00:03:01.989> buttons<00:03:02.989> free

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
general it's got like d-pad buttons free

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.390 
general it's got like d-pad buttons free
right<00:03:03.560> here<00:03:03.620> for<00:03:03.860> interacting<00:03:04.220> with<00:03:04.310> the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
right here for interacting with the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.210 
right here for interacting with the
robot<00:03:04.700> it's<00:03:05.450> got<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:05.930> mode<00:03:06.260> button<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:06.860> managed

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
robot it's got a mode button so managed

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.190 
robot it's got a mode button so managed
program<00:03:07.730> or<00:03:07.940> play<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.600> program<00:03:08.959> that's

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
program or play the program that's

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.850 
program or play the program that's
loaded<00:03:09.530> on<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:09.700> start<00:03:10.700> button<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.209> then<00:03:11.860> to

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
loaded on it start button and then to

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.740 
loaded on it start button and then to
your<00:03:12.950> bus<00:03:13.190> for<00:03:13.640> us<00:03:13.730> right<00:03:13.910> here<00:03:14.260> like<00:03:15.260> PC<00:03:16.190> link

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
your bus for us right here like PC link

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.100 
your bus for us right here like PC link
switch<00:03:17.750> on/off<00:03:18.410> switch

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:30.360 

charging<00:03:23.110> port<00:03:24.300> so<00:03:25.920> about<00:03:26.920> these<00:03:28.230> motors<00:03:29.370> you

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
charging port so about these motors you

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.940 
charging port so about these motors you
can<00:03:30.489> see<00:03:30.670> it's<00:03:30.819> only<00:03:31.000> got<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.560> three<00:03:32.560> buses<00:03:32.920> to

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
can see it's only got a three buses to

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.540 
can see it's only got a three buses to
plug<00:03:33.310> them<00:03:33.519> into<00:03:33.900> however<00:03:35.040> if<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.220> take<00:03:36.400> them

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
plug them into however if you take them

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.920 
plug them into however if you take them
voters<00:03:36.849> in<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.030> sensor<00:03:37.420> you'll<00:03:37.629> notice<00:03:37.900> that

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
voters in the sensor you'll notice that

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.720 
voters in the sensor you'll notice that
they<00:03:38.110> have<00:03:38.200> two<00:03:38.349> ports<00:03:38.650> are<00:03:38.769> here<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.160> they

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
they have two ports are here and they

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.160 
they have two ports are here and they
can<00:03:39.940> actually<00:03:40.090> be<00:03:40.330> daisy-chained<00:03:40.930> because

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
can actually be daisy-chained because

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.270 
can actually be daisy-chained because
like<00:03:41.319> I<00:03:41.410> said<00:03:41.470> they<00:03:41.800> each<00:03:41.920> have<00:03:42.069> their<00:03:42.099> own

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
like I said they each have their own

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.630 
like I said they each have their own
individual<00:03:42.849> microcontroller<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:45.340> can

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
individual microcontroller so it can

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.949 
individual microcontroller so it can
output<00:03:46.180> serial<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.950> certain<00:03:48.430> IDs<00:03:48.880> like<00:03:49.840> you

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
output serial to certain IDs like you

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.580 
output serial to certain IDs like you
smarter<00:03:50.230> amazon<00:03:50.560> unique<00:03:51.220> ID<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:51.819> can

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
smarter amazon unique ID so it can

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.509 
smarter amazon unique ID so it can
output<00:03:53.590> something<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.069> each<00:03:54.220> motor

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
output something to each motor

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.339 
output something to each motor
specifically<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.720> other<00:03:55.840> is<00:03:55.959> one<00:03:56.140> read

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
specifically and the other is one read

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.770 
specifically and the other is one read
it<00:03:56.500> but<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.709> motor<00:03:56.890> that<00:03:57.750> has<00:03:58.750> a

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
it but the motor that has a

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.890 
it but the motor that has a
corresponding<00:03:59.110> ID<00:03:59.650> will<00:04:00.720> perform<00:04:01.720> whatever

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
corresponding ID will perform whatever

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.410 
corresponding ID will perform whatever
casa<00:04:02.650> q<00:04:02.860> esta<00:04:03.250> tu<00:04:03.630> so<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.690> go<00:04:05.079> like<00:04:05.110> this<00:04:05.410> and

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
casa q esta tu so you go like this and

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.470 
casa q esta tu so you go like this and
then<00:04:07.420> fly<00:04:08.349> motor<00:04:08.650> ID<00:04:08.920> 1<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.489> motor<00:04:09.670> ID<00:04:09.910> to<00:04:10.209> both

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
then fly motor ID 1 and motor ID to both

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.449 
then fly motor ID 1 and motor ID to both
plug<00:04:10.750> into<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.200> same<00:04:11.500> port<00:04:11.829> and<00:04:12.040> plug<00:04:12.280> into

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
plug into the same port and plug into

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.400 
plug into the same port and plug into
each<00:04:12.579> other<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:13.090> I<00:04:13.630> can<00:04:13.780> control<00:04:14.140> them<00:04:14.290> each

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
each other and I can control them each

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.180 
each other and I can control them each
individually<00:04:14.620> anyways<00:04:15.570> about<00:04:16.570> these<00:04:16.720> virus

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
individually anyways about these virus

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.819 
individually anyways about these virus
the<00:04:18.190> connectors<00:04:18.790> are<00:04:19.320> kind<00:04:20.320> of<00:04:20.380> hard<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.620> pull

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
the connectors are kind of hard to pull

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.770 
the connectors are kind of hard to pull
out<00:04:20.950> actually<00:04:21.430> you<00:04:22.150> can't<00:04:22.389> really<00:04:22.510> grip

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
out actually you can't really grip

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.180 
out actually you can't really grip
plastic<00:04:23.440> part<00:04:23.650> so<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:23.860> feels<00:04:23.950> like<00:04:24.100> you're

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
plastic part so it feels like you're

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.350 
plastic part so it feels like you're
going<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.400> end<00:04:24.550> up<00:04:24.610> yanking<00:04:24.970> out<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.090> wires

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
going to end up yanking out the wires

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.940 
going to end up yanking out the wires
but<00:04:25.660> they're<00:04:25.810> pretty<00:04:25.990> tough<00:04:26.380> actually<00:04:26.680> you

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
but they're pretty tough actually you

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.770 
but they're pretty tough actually you
can<00:04:27.070> pull<00:04:27.250> on<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.460> wires<00:04:27.639> and<00:04:28.090> it'll<00:04:28.450> be<00:04:28.510> okay

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
can pull on the wires and it'll be okay

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.779 
can pull on the wires and it'll be okay
that's<00:04:29.590> what<00:04:29.740> I've<00:04:29.830> been<00:04:29.979> doing<00:04:30.130> it's<00:04:30.610> fine

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
that's what I've been doing it's fine

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:31.800 
that's what I've been doing it's fine
because<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.150> can't<00:04:31.330> really<00:04:31.450> get<00:04:31.630> at<00:04:31.720> this

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
because you can't really get at this

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:42.350 
because you can't really get at this
plastic<00:04:32.289> all<00:04:33.100> right<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:37.169> lastly<00:04:38.169> is<00:04:38.590> software

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.870 

this<00:04:43.360> comes<00:04:43.780> with<00:04:44.080> a<00:04:44.320> disc<00:04:44.830> with<00:04:45.160> three

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
this comes with a disc with three

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.940 
this comes with a disc with three
programs<00:04:46.300> on<00:04:46.539> it<00:04:46.570> um<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:49.510> motion<00:04:50.440> control

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
programs on it um the motion control

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.090 
programs on it um the motion control
editor<00:04:51.639> I<00:04:51.850> think<00:04:52.210> what<00:04:52.870> she<00:04:53.110> shows<00:04:53.620> you<00:04:53.919> like

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
editor I think what she shows you like

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.140 
editor I think what she shows you like
an<00:04:54.880> image<00:04:55.150> of<00:04:55.240> your<00:04:55.389> robot<00:04:55.780> or<00:04:56.430> just<00:04:57.430> service

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
an image of your robot or just service

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.610 
an image of your robot or just service
if<00:04:58.300> you<00:04:58.330> don't<00:04:58.539> tell<00:04:58.930> it<00:04:59.080> which<00:04:59.169> robot<00:04:59.380> you've

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
if you don't tell it which robot you've

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.520 
if you don't tell it which robot you've
made<00:04:59.860> and<00:05:00.100> we<00:05:01.030> can<00:05:01.270> do<00:05:01.389> is<00:05:01.600> you<00:05:01.690> can<00:05:01.720> position

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
made and we can do is you can position

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.629 
made and we can do is you can position
them<00:05:03.630> and<00:05:04.630> then<00:05:04.810> it<00:05:05.349> will<00:05:05.500> take<00:05:05.680> that<00:05:05.889> and<00:05:06.220> you

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
them and then it will take that and you

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.969 
them and then it will take that and you
can<00:05:06.820> hit<00:05:07.720> a<00:05:07.750> button<00:05:07.960> and<00:05:08.200> we'll<00:05:08.320> save<00:05:08.590> that<00:05:08.800> is

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
can hit a button and we'll save that is

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.490 
can hit a button and we'll save that is
like<00:05:09.130> a<00:05:09.160> pose<00:05:09.430> and<00:05:09.880> then<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:13.870> can<00:05:14.020> replay<00:05:14.289> that

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
like a pose and then you can replay that

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.839 
like a pose and then you can replay that
pose<00:05:14.680> you<00:05:14.919> can<00:05:15.039> make<00:05:15.130> animations<00:05:15.729> with

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
pose you can make animations with

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.190 
pose you can make animations with
different<00:05:16.120> poses<00:05:16.270> and<00:05:16.539> stuff<00:05:16.570> that's<00:05:16.960> got<00:05:17.169> a

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
different poses and stuff that's got a

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.690 
different poses and stuff that's got a
behavior<00:05:17.590> control<00:05:17.919> editor<00:05:18.250> which<00:05:19.060> is<00:05:19.240> like

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
behavior control editor which is like

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.510 
behavior control editor which is like
programming<00:05:21.780> just<00:05:22.780> it's<00:05:23.260> just<00:05:23.440> a<00:05:23.770> graphical

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520

programming just it's just a graphical
drag-and-drop<00:05:25.150> type<00:05:25.889> what's<00:05:26.889> not<00:05:26.979> really

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
drag-and-drop type what's not really

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.680 
drag-and-drop type what's not really
drag<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:27.550> drop<00:05:27.700> but<00:05:27.940> it's<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.210> graphical

it's<00:05:30.740> kind<00:05:31.340> of<00:05:31.580> strange<00:05:32.419> but<00:05:32.900> it's<00:05:33.590> got<00:05:33.830> this

I<00:06:16.450> had<00:06:17.450> to<00:06:17.540> go<00:06:17.660> online<00:06:17.810> to<00:06:18.020> get<00:06:18.139> them<00:06:18.320> because

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
I had to go online to get them because

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.969 
I had to go online to get them because
the<00:06:18.680> CD<00:06:19.040> that<00:06:19.580> it<00:06:19.700> came<00:06:19.880> with<00:06:19.910> didn't<00:06:20.540> support

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
the CD that it came with didn't support

the CD that it came with didn't support
64-bit<00:06:21.979> windows<00:06:23.260> so<00:06:24.260> that<00:06:24.290> wasn't<00:06:24.680> stick<00:06:25.070> me

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
64-bit windows so that wasn't stick me

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.190 
64-bit windows so that wasn't stick me

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.690 
while figured out why it wasn't working
um<00:06:29.860> another<00:06:30.860> thing<00:06:30.950> I'll<00:06:31.160> mention<00:06:31.340> about<00:06:31.550> the

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
um another thing I'll mention about the

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.310 
um another thing I'll mention about the
hardware<00:06:31.940> I<00:06:32.270> said<00:06:32.660> how<00:06:32.780> they<00:06:32.900> have<00:06:33.020> clunky

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
hardware I said how they have clunky

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
the Korean right here I believe so you

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.350

standard<00:06:44.990> screwdrivers<00:06:45.680> with<00:06:46.010> this<00:06:46.220> I'm<00:06:46.970> just

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
standard screwdrivers with this I'm just

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.130 
standard screwdrivers with this I'm just
using<00:06:47.450> regular<00:06:48.039> Phillips<00:06:49.930> screwdrivers<00:06:50.930> I

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140 
using regular Phillips screwdrivers I

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.779 
using regular Phillips screwdrivers I
found<00:06:51.350> a<00:06:51.530> really<00:06:51.740> good<00:06:52.010> size<00:06:52.250> that<00:06:52.610> works

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
found a really good size that works

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:55.810 
found a really good size that works
pretty<00:06:53.030> well<00:06:53.210> and<00:06:54.220> even<00:06:55.220> though<00:06:55.340> there's<00:06:55.640> a

pretty well and even though there's a

pretty well and even though there's a
potential<00:06:56.090> you<00:06:56.390> could<00:06:56.419> strip<00:06:56.780> the<00:06:57.020> screws<00:06:57.470> I

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
potential you could strip the screws I

have been on okay with just using

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.400 
have been on okay with just using
regular<00:07:00.650> Phillips<00:07:01.250> head<00:07:01.400> so<00:07:02.389> I<00:07:02.780> won't<00:07:03.139> be<00:07:03.229> too

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410 
regular Phillips head so I won't be too

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.129
