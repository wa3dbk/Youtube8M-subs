today I'm going to introduce you to
specialty<00:00:13.250> resins<00:00:13.789> fabric<00:00:14.480> cast<00:00:14.719> 50<00:00:15.379> what's

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
specialty resins fabric cast 50 what's

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.430 
specialty resins fabric cast 50 what's
nice<00:00:16.520> about<00:00:16.550> this<00:00:17.060> system<00:00:17.119> is<00:00:17.750> a<00:00:17.780> very<00:00:17.930> low

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
nice about this system is a very low

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.160 
nice about this system is a very low
viscosity<00:00:18.730> system<00:00:19.730> which<00:00:20.360> enables<00:00:20.780> you<00:00:21.140> to

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
viscosity system which enables you to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.890 
viscosity system which enables you to
get<00:00:21.410> every<00:00:21.740> bit<00:00:21.770> of<00:00:22.040> detail<00:00:22.460> and<00:00:22.790> also<00:00:23.600> let<00:00:23.780> you

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
get every bit of detail and also let you

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.990 
get every bit of detail and also let you
get<00:00:24.050> any<00:00:24.230> air<00:00:24.740> entrapment<00:00:25.130> that<00:00:25.490> you<00:00:25.610> may<00:00:25.790> have

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
get any air entrapment that you may have

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.720 
get any air entrapment that you may have
in<00:00:26.210> some<00:00:26.390> of<00:00:26.480> those<00:00:26.570> hard<00:00:26.900> parts<00:00:27.550> let's<00:00:28.550> go

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
in some of those hard parts let's go

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.120 
in some of those hard parts let's go
ahead<00:00:28.850> and<00:00:29.240> make<00:00:29.810> a<00:00:29.840> cast<00:00:30.200> in<00:00:30.500> and<00:00:30.740> you<00:00:30.860> can<00:00:31.010> get

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
ahead and make a cast in and you can get

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.510 
ahead and make a cast in and you can get
a<00:00:31.160> better<00:00:31.490> idea<00:00:31.730> on<00:00:31.970> how<00:00:32.180> this<00:00:32.419> works<00:00:33.280> I'm<00:00:34.280> go

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
a better idea on how this works I'm go

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.050 
a better idea on how this works I'm go
ahead<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:34.760> mix<00:00:34.879> this<00:00:35.030> by<00:00:35.300> volume<00:00:36.670> you<00:00:37.670> can<00:00:37.850> mix

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
ahead and mix this by volume you can mix

00:00:38.060 --> 00:01:02.660 
ahead and mix this by volume you can mix
it<00:00:38.180> by<00:00:38.329> weight<00:00:38.570> or<00:00:38.810> volume

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:11.870 

go<00:01:03.670> ahead<00:01:03.880> and<00:01:04.000> pour<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.360> a<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.870> B<00:01:05.050> together

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.899 

we're<00:01:12.480> gonna<00:01:12.600> mix<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.170> about<00:01:13.460> 15<00:01:14.460> seconds

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
we're gonna mix it for about 15 seconds

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:26.289 
we're gonna mix it for about 15 seconds
or<00:01:15.060> so

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:02:02.039 

it's<00:01:26.750> a<00:01:26.840> really<00:01:27.229> thin<00:01:27.530> system

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.370 

go<00:02:02.890> ahead<00:02:03.040> and<00:02:03.130> let<00:02:03.220> that<00:02:03.250> sit<00:02:03.670> for<00:02:03.700> about

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
go ahead and let that sit for about

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.840 
go ahead and let that sit for about
10-15<00:02:05.380> minutes<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.070> come<00:02:06.159> back<00:02:06.340> and<00:02:06.580> de<00:02:06.670> molde

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
10-15 minutes and come back and de molde

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:18.690 
10-15 minutes and come back and de molde
it

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.180 

it's<00:02:19.270> been<00:02:19.420> about<00:02:19.630> two<00:02:20.200> minutes<00:02:20.410> now<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.130> you

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
it's been about two minutes now and you

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.510 
it's been about two minutes now and you
can<00:02:21.370> see<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.820> materials<00:02:22.330> start<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.810> turn<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.260> a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
can see the materials start to turn to a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.140 
can see the materials start to turn to a
whitish<00:02:24.520> color<00:02:25.890> give<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.010> another<00:02:27.280> 10<00:02:27.820> minutes

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
whitish color give it another 10 minutes

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
minutes you can see the casting is a

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.949 
minutes you can see the casting is a
nice<00:02:46.420> solid<00:02:46.900> bone<00:02:47.440> white<00:02:47.830> color<00:02:48.540> my<00:02:49.540> mixing
