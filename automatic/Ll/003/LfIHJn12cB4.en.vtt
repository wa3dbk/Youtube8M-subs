00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:14.630
 First of all, let's create a strong team 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:20.240
 It is the thing that I usually think about, but now I will introduce about 5 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:24.830
 It is not limited to only the scene of the basket, but it is like this when trying to make a group 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.760
 If I could create a strong group then this was not only I thought separately but also various things 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.760
 From 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.240
 I got information 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:36.830
 It is not only a sport scene, for example a company 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.700
 It is said that such a place is used well first of all but it is one 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.720
 Is it 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.940
 When the course have a pride as a member 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.160
 What does this mean ? 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.550
 Well then 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.000
 Aichi Naturally teamwork is good 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.870
 The third is 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.530
 It was now governed Kitara finished that kind of thing 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.310
 wooden 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.460
 It's about moving the group towards the video 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.530
 It's just that you're just trying to set the number of fields 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:12.320
 I'm going to get in on this for a moment 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:18.040
 In it and knees are down it and was here that are perfectly hand raised in what the basic stance 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.040
 It is that it is crooked and then the back stands up properly 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.290
 I will keep this attitude for a long time 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.140
 So already 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.630
 Hyogo it is 22 flight and knee bend 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:34.299
 Please make a back straight back 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.340
 I think it's a stare Keep it forever Ben and back straight to these three things 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.360
 Let's enter 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.370
 It is Tona do this is made properly 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.370
 Or whether it will always say that it is a company in balance 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.430
 The 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.990
 Yes , this is like creating your opponent from time to time and lifting that variable from below 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.540
 Do 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.900
 Such an image 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.280
 It seems like it's all over from being overturned, not having that kind of image 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.450
 End up 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.170
 I am saying perfectly with the image, such as lifting from the bottom from the bottom to the other party 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.400
 Please give me 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.530
 So , for example, you drew me here 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.380
 I can still protect in such a situation 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.640
 The place is 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.790
 This its I'm to try to protect even when you are over this situation that will 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.879
 It's mostly because I am 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.900
 Are you going to be far but coming in front of you 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:26.590
 So another Once such a place is thought that this this is I wonder was over a little downy done with solder 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.300
 I do not follow now, here 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.050
 It will be done without running fast 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.170
 Still it seems to try to keep such a place working hard 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.260
 There is the fact that where to pass 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.260
 Whether passing through here saying this is about 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.390
 Whether passing between the child say this 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.520
 Another way is that this was broken when the screen came in 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.300
 I think this is the screen 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:56.030
 It is integrated by making 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.030
 I'm going to leave you there are three ways
