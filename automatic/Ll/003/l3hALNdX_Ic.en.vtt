00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 good guys is the first was the steering wheel 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.379
 For you, I was going to make the plate with 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.870
 acrylic 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.400
 so I believe I forget that school 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.889
 boys 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.900
 it is thicker at the other bit 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.660
 had made with pvc 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.170
 I also thought of 4 mm here so 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.320
 dish that I'm going to change upon it 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:31.410
 this is the total 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.960
 this tank is another equal piece with these 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.180
 two here that are the same as I cut 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.120
 to make two small dish wanted to do 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.170
 a big dish for the little one 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.520
 same because to me it would be better then 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.850
 I did my best but will do 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.030
 All right , here you go. 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:57.510
 I'll put it in the middle I will not 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.440
 cut and now the people who make powder with 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.359
 ElisÃ¢ngela already put in the mold just right 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.150
 The program roughly covers whether the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.400
 predicts this is normal 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.110
 the only thing that does the same thing as 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.580
 I connected to the base 220 degrees 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.189
 50 he will have already warm where 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.710
 hot, the only thing I'm going to do 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:29.310
 now is to put the term of metal together 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.979
 has the seal on the lining and we will 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.570
 follow me and through the glass I looked 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.170
 I came here we'll have a notion 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.990
 time the emails you will start selling 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.430
 it will start until it is restarted 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.820
 excellent also when it comes to taking 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:52.890
 company on top of that other one there 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:59.280
 I met up here that I'm going to take 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:02.360
 this money has gotten hot 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.549
 soon with this part that let you 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.260
 from this year the holders and leave the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.740
 I teach here 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.069
 until that is where this thing nothing 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.850
 interested here he will come back but it is 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.180
 only take out blocked use one more than i 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.280
 I am using current bathroom and then 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.920
 can put five years of training and 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.680
 impression because you will be generated 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.150
 from raid from below to part in teaching 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.540
 heat itself can then go there but additionally 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:41.700
 it's just you get what I'm going to do 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:46.730
 now as that number 7 or so 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:54.690
 here so and I'll put it on the liner 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:57.830
 show him on my set I can 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.390
 leave you half way on one side here today 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.700
 27 with that side means 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.250
 The only thing I'm going to do now is 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.049
 come back inside I have this part 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.209
 here for when I pull it does not say 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.920
 note that I pull according to khair 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:20.250
 So I'm doing the knife to 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:23.750
 playing ago I going to do now is already 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:32.640
 on the spot right 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:37.459
 now I'll put it now I 'm going to stay 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.500
 A few minutes we follow 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:45.150
 Look more or less here a little more 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.670
 You can see a little of the plate for you. 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.400
 there's the name when it starts to melt 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.540
 at the time I 'm going to take him I 'm going to put him 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.220
 I'm going to stop a little bit soon 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.220
 video here for him berretta there 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:01.250
 in later we will return with him 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.250
 well melted is printed will change 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:13.379
 the le will return now that it has already melted 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.219
 he spent so I'll take one 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.829
 oven 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:19.859
 that's what I did here to talk about how it is 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:23.130
 he is well and has already heated up and 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:29.250
 I felt good and now I will pull coal to 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:32.360
 I'll take the deadline here too. 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.360
 I'll take the deadline. 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.880
 I'll play up 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:47.300
 it looks wrong to go back to the remedy 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:53.669
 Here you have it all! 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:59.370
 to make it work beck on but 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:03.210
 as it is already small amounts already out new today 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:06.210
 round here I believe I'm doing it 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.259
 very simple canon it's hard not to give 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.860
 right 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.990
 I pretended I 'm doing more here to do. 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.340
 but this is how I 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.760
 I'm doing here 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.159
 I'd rather do so cut the 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.389
 money after a way the size that 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:24.060
 I want to 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.970
 anyone can set up any practice 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.849
 You can make this template and I'm doing it. 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:35.580
 here i have a danger 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:42.710
 I do not know if you would let it burn 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:42.710
 so now I'll get you you 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.870
 take away the rest of you 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.860
 now I'll just wait a little bit for 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:02.429
 I take off and 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:16.919
 use the knife to see how it is 

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:22.969
 It was is beginning to drop us 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:27.659

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:29.789
