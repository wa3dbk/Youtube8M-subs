00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.930
 Heinz BÃ¼se what he can look forward to after the victory 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.160
 Â«I'll let you introduce the action c64 today to the cases 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.219
 KH 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.759
 on the hook 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.330
 more restrained stronger 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.980
 it starts with the first channel Ki Ka 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.060
 there would be 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.060
 de Jager 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.500
 Hermann Klein failed the channel builders 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.390
 back and forth between the two channels 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.510
 then come to Oberberg 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.750
 until now yawn the volume 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.890
 and operators like collateral 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.440
 In addition, amplifier had even less 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.190
 Keep it still 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.370
 so Ehlers can contribute 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.460
 all of us 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.140
 He criticized Aigner 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.510
 doubting you have to get on it would have operation 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.530
 Katja can sound like that 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.550
 and the hosts 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.650
 the headphone jack to late hour from 19 o'clock still 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.600
 and why can 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 so the world is now known by the times 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.550
 Deputy Abed duties 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.170
 the paper around 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.910
 yes not satisfied Alina output for the speaker 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.140
 with World Conference from the fact device to turn on 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.200
 and we have the connection running down with the last one 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.560
 can switch between both channels 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.530
 this can only be said to date 65 watts 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.110
 what performance 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.740
 absolutely sufficient the rehearsal room 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.740
 you get drunk on it 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.470
 such a mystical sea-bear parties 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.500
 to send the subindex 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
 We have to be told on Tel -nr 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.489
 after all, they seem 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.969
 Dieter Hecking 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.349
 Mo 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.459
 finally bring in the region again 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.059
 Hundreds of visitors sat 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.059
 Bundesliga 1 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.119
 because 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.809
 Lumengo 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:09.040
 by the projectile 60 percent 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.109
 in my opinion a real powerhouse with 65 watts 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.759
 slaughter and bath around for super by going in the rehearsal room 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:19.829
 i would suggest this is another thunderstorm i'm not alone 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.199
 stand back 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:22.119
 believed
