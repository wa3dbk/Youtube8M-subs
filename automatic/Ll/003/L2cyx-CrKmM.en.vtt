 Invictus spirit when competing 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.640
 but to take care of nature 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.040
 after a long way we have 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.379
 found our next guest the 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.360
 professional climber is a columnist

 nature and right here is coming 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:16.110

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.850
 I have pleasure as a guest I see that 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.229
 we will be climbing in day but 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.550
 before that I want to make you some 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.970
 questions where and how the 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.250
 fascination for the good scale is born 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.190
 when I was a kid who lived hanging on 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.770
 the trees but it was actually a 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.650
 discover when you're in the second year of 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.080
 the university there as I was looking for 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.520
 some sport to do that would help me 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.170
 spend a little energy while 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.000
 studied want the career is 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.800
 frying directly into starch what is 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.660
 I needed and was very tired 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.060
 energy and I could not spend it 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.880
 while it is to take care of revisions by which 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.490
 you wrote a little review that has 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.340
 klein mertz point cl where you said 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.439
 how to scale certain structures to the air 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.299
 free where the motivation for 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.750
 massify the issue of climbing is good 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.950
 when you are having right in that 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.080
 There was a bad climbing wall 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.489
 day of some friends and that's where he started 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.470
 scalar iphone from I started to motivate me 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.690
 later I realized that there was 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.459
 places in nature to go out 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.140
 I started looking for places and the third 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.940
 question add is felipe what 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.980
 christi features that you have to 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.040
 have a man to be considered a 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.569
 man I invite from my experience 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.310
 fundamentally being methodical, you have to 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.110
 be consistent with these things because the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.970
 progress is slow especially in this 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.110
 kind of sports like climbing and 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.360
 good to have a love for nature 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.680
 what it has to be to go beyond 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.780
 anything because really these 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.920
 places you have to respect them and you have 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.680
 that being one with them has to be 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.970
 part of the good environment boys already 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.730
 we have known a little more about the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.290
 intimacy of felipe but now what 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.610
 We came to train so I invite 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.610
 the three exercises this week 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.740
 most of the exercises that we do 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.360
 among all are focused for 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.790
 take advantage of the resources we have in 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.800
 this case we have a base column rock 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.930
 flat in which we're going to work the 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.760
 back with the pull-ups 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.489
 the great strength that everything must have 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.260
 climber are his arms and his back and 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.540
 that's why the dominated are the 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.849
 basic exercise we take with the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.590
 firm hands of some bar and 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.540
 we begin to climb with the bar by 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.329
 front of our body in this case 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.980
 we adapt to the same nature is 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.019
 an exercise that involves both 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.420
 arms in specific great part of the 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.730
 biceps as the back in specific 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.859
 areas like the rhomboid latissimus dorsi is 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.719
 the lower portion of the trapeze and 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.680
 round greater to increase the 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:44.359
 difficulty 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.909
 You can use a backpack with weight 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.590
 moment to perform this exercise to 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.780
 this exercise we will start with four 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.310
 series of 6 repetitions and as 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.069
 increases the difficulty of form 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.340
 progressive we will arrive at the 4 series of 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.340
 10 repetitions 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.480
 ah 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.520
 for the next exercise we are going to 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.900
 occupy this path that is on the rise 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.580
 and we are going to do the push-ups in 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.830
 movement the practice of climbing 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.240
 it involves as much strength in the arms as 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.579
 also flexibility and coordination 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.799
 body and that's why our 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.260
 second exercise contains these three 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.300
 variables we take bending position of 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.730
 arms with arms slightly more 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.040
 open and one arm later than the 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.290
 another at the time of bending 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.910
 we will advance with the leg coordinating 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.850
 both the bending and the advance of 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.890
 our body on the floor this exercise 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.169
 besides working strength in our 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.970
 arms will also allow the 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.980
 coordination and flexibility of 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.740
 legs simulating the movement that 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.540
 they perform at the moment of climbing 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.710
 for this exercise we will perform four 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.710
 series of 20 repetitions 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.270
 and for the last exercise we are going to 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.490
 look for a comfortable place where we can 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.410
 sit down and we will occupy a shirt to 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.970
 work the alterations due to the 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.160
 narrowness of the spaces where 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.070
 scale the weight of our body falls 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.750
 largely on the forearms is 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.750
 why our last exercise 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.550
 will seek to strengthen them for this 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.830
 exercise we will use a shirt 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.230
 We support the forearm with the palm towards 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.600
 up we take the shirt by one end 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.310
 and on the other we perform counterweight with 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.230
 the arm that we have unoccupied and 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.050
 we begin to raise and lower the hand 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.630
 wielded with this exercise we will allow 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.910
 have greater development and strength in 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.430
 the area of ​​the forearms for this 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.630
 exercise we will perform 4 or 6 of 15 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.630
 repetitions per arm 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.830
 good guys these were the three 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.450
