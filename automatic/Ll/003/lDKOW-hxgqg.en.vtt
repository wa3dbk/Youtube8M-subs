00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
wondering why I prefer free my apps over

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.670 
wondering why I prefer free my apps over
other<00:02:00.270> apps<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.049> basically<00:02:01.140> comes<00:02:01.590> down

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
other apps and it basically comes down

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.310 
other apps and it basically comes down
to<00:02:01.950> two<00:02:02.100> reasons<00:02:02.460> number<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.990> less

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
to two reasons number one it's less

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.560 
to two reasons number one it's less
dependent<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:04.920> referrals<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.790> most<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
dependent on referrals so most of the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.389 
dependent on referrals so most of the
times<00:02:06.780> people<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.350> use<00:02:07.500> other<00:02:07.770> apps<00:02:08.040> to<00:02:08.190> get

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
times people that use other apps to get

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.609 
times people that use other apps to get
gems<00:02:08.700> end<00:02:09.000> up<00:02:09.149> quitting<00:02:09.390> because<00:02:10.019> those<00:02:10.350> apps

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
gems end up quitting because those apps

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.560 
gems end up quitting because those apps
are<00:02:10.769> really<00:02:11.130> dependent<00:02:11.850> on<00:02:11.940> referrals

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
are really dependent on referrals

through my apps is different because

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.949 
through my apps is different because
it's<00:02:14.610> good<00:02:14.790> for<00:02:14.970> people<00:02:15.209> who<00:02:15.239> don't<00:02:15.540> have<00:02:15.690> the

it's good for people who don't have the

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.990 
it's good for people who don't have the
capability<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.590> referring<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.310> whole<00:02:17.519> lot<00:02:17.850> of

some<00:02:24.569> apps<00:02:24.780> I've<00:02:25.080> noticed<00:02:25.440> take<00:02:25.590> double<00:02:26.129> the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
some apps I've noticed take double the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.520 
some apps I've noticed take double the
amount<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.790> points<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.390> get<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.569> $10<00:02:28.200> gift<00:02:28.440> card

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530

amount of points to get a $10 gift card
so<00:02:29.159> for<00:02:29.310> example<00:02:29.700> while<00:02:29.909> one<00:02:30.150> application

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
so for example while one application

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.990 
so for example while one application
might<00:02:30.900> require<00:02:31.170> 6000<00:02:31.980> points<00:02:32.129> for<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.430> $10<00:02:32.790> gift
