00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.999 
can do a lot of cool stuff of it and so
in<00:03:29.650> quick<00:03:30.040> it'd<00:03:30.400> be<00:03:30.699> like<00:03:31.329> this<00:03:31.859> and<00:03:32.859> it<00:03:32.979> just

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:33.009 
in quick it'd be like this and it just

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.039 
in quick it'd be like this and it just
look<00:03:33.280> like<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.759> put<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.060> pips<00:03:34.269> on<00:03:34.449> and<00:03:34.659> you

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
on the bottom see so it's like

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.640 
on the bottom see so it's like
situations<00:04:00.909> like<00:04:01.060> that<00:04:01.229> they'll<00:04:02.229> fall<00:04:02.500> on<00:04:02.590> the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
situations like that they'll fall on the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.490 
situations like that they'll fall on the
bottom<00:04:02.949> like<00:04:03.790> this<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.299> you<00:04:05.229> can<00:04:05.379> ask

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
bottom like this and you can ask

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.800 
bottom like this and you can ask
spectator<00:04:05.979> to<00:04:06.069> pick<00:04:06.250> any<00:04:06.459> card<00:04:06.759> they<00:04:06.819> want<00:04:07.030> so

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
spectator to pick any card they want so

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.080 
spectator to pick any card they want so
if<00:04:07.900> they<00:04:08.049> pick<00:04:08.199> this<00:04:08.319> one<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:09.430> six<00:04:09.699> of<00:04:09.849> spades

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
if they pick this one the six of spades

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.689 
if they pick this one the six of spades
and<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:11.590> tell<00:04:11.859> them<00:04:12.039> to<00:04:12.129> put<00:04:12.159> it<00:04:12.310> on<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.489> top

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:12.699 
and you tell them to put it on the top

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.779 
and you tell them to put it on the top
now<00:04:13.479> you<00:04:13.509> can<00:04:14.109> do<00:04:14.259> the<00:04:14.409> load<00:04:14.560> of<00:04:14.709> shuffles<00:04:15.129> like

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:15.789 
now you can do the load of shuffles like

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.189 
now you can do the load of shuffles like
this<00:04:16.000> but<00:04:16.209> what<00:04:16.329> you<00:04:16.359> want<00:04:16.509> to<00:04:16.570> make<00:04:16.690> sure<00:04:16.719> is

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
this but what you want to make sure is

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.550 
this but what you want to make sure is
that<00:04:17.680> when<00:04:18.039> they<00:04:18.219> shuffle<00:04:18.669> like<00:04:18.789> that<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:20.289> top

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
that when they shuffle like that the top

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.640 
that when they shuffle like that the top
card<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:21.279> red<00:04:22.060> card<00:04:22.330> is<00:04:22.750> allocated<00:04:23.289> on<00:04:23.469> top

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
card the red card is allocated on top

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.409 
card the red card is allocated on top
that<00:04:24.800> selection<00:04:25.130> so<00:04:25.820> they<00:04:25.910> won't<00:04:26.030> see<00:04:26.270> this

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
that selection so they won't see this

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.400 
that selection so they won't see this
because<00:04:26.810> you'll<00:04:26.930> be<00:04:27.020> doing<00:04:27.169> with<00:04:27.350> these

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
because you'll be doing with these

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.350 
because you'll be doing with these
shuffles<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:28.009> they<00:04:28.070> won't<00:04:28.220> see<00:04:28.580> and<00:04:29.150> you<00:04:29.210> can

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
shuffles that they won't see and you can

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.920 
shuffles that they won't see and you can
do<00:04:29.540> all<00:04:29.750> this<00:04:29.930> like<00:04:30.530> that<00:04:30.770> doesn't<00:04:31.759> matter<00:04:31.940> and

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
do all this like that doesn't matter and

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.640 
do all this like that doesn't matter and
then<00:04:33.850> you<00:04:34.850> can<00:04:34.970> say<00:04:35.150> right<00:04:35.419> snap<00:04:36.110> your<00:04:36.289> fingers

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
then you can say right snap your fingers

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.450 
then you can say right snap your fingers
one<00:04:37.430> card<00:04:38.590> turns<00:04:39.590> right<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.160> they're<00:04:40.310> like

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
one card turns right and they're like

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.939 
one card turns right and they're like
whoa<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.630> then<00:04:41.840> when<00:04:42.110> you<00:04:42.259> reveal<00:04:42.680> to<00:04:42.710> them

that I found with these cards is that

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.430 
that I found with these cards is that
they're<00:05:54.280> they're<00:05:55.280> different<00:05:55.690> this<00:05:56.690> side<00:05:57.050> as

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
they're they're different this side as

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.680 
they're they're different this side as
you<00:05:57.680> can<00:05:57.800> see<00:05:58.010> here<00:05:58.310> he's<00:05:59.120> actually<00:05:59.389> darker

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.350 
you can see here he's actually darker
than<00:05:59.810> this<00:05:59.960> side<00:06:00.199> so<00:06:00.979> if<00:06:01.460> I<00:06:01.820> took<00:06:01.880> these<00:06:02.150> two

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
than this side so if I took these two

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.810 
than this side so if I took these two
cards<00:06:02.780> and<00:06:03.039> turn<00:06:04.039> them<00:06:04.190> over<00:06:04.280> in<00:06:04.550> the<00:06:04.639> deck

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
cards and turn them over in the deck

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.570 
cards and turn them over in the deck
he'd<00:06:05.000> put<00:06:05.180> together<00:06:05.440> see<00:06:06.440> it<00:06:07.220> doesn't

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
he'd put together see it doesn't

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.670 
he'd put together see it doesn't
actually<00:06:08.060> fit<00:06:08.659> so<00:06:08.870> it<00:06:08.990> sort<00:06:09.139> of<00:06:09.169> been<00:06:09.320> that<00:06:09.500> way

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680
