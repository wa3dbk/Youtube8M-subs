like to have and then we stir in my hair

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.270 
like to have and then we stir in my hair
because<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:05.909> coarse<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:08.359> porous<00:03:09.359> and

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
because it is coarse and porous and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.289 
because it is coarse and porous and
especially<00:03:11.280> since<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.609> bleached<00:03:11.879> my<00:03:12.030> hair

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
well highlight it that's more important

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
so yeah just scratch it and it's richer

of let it go to the central part and

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.030 
of let it go to the central part and
then<00:03:34.109> I<00:03:34.470> will<00:03:35.720> let<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:36.870> air<00:03:37.049> dry<00:03:37.079> and<00:03:37.590> just<00:03:37.799> let

crunchin<00:03:41.220> okay<00:03:41.519> now<00:03:41.760> I've<00:03:42.000> scratched<00:03:42.389> with

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
crunchin okay now I've scratched with

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.000 
crunchin okay now I've scratched with
the<00:03:42.659> crunch<00:03:44.000> one<00:03:45.000> thing<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.449> did<00:03:45.720> spray<00:03:46.229> some<00:03:46.859> of

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
the crunch one thing I did spray some of

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.360 
the crunch one thing I did spray some of
this<00:03:47.250> on<00:03:47.699> top<00:03:48.299> of<00:03:48.359> my<00:03:48.510> hair<00:03:48.780> too<00:03:49.280> just<00:03:50.280> like

this on top of my hair too just like
this<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:52.470> kind<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.769> get<00:03:52.949> a<00:03:53.489> little<00:03:53.729> more<00:03:54.030> frizz

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
this to kind of get a little more frizz

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.210 
this to kind of get a little more frizz

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
but the lavender oil spray is good too

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.360 
but the lavender oil spray is good too
because<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.579> has<00:03:59.699> cleansing<00:04:00.180> properties<00:04:01.370> but

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
because it has cleansing properties but

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.670 
because it has cleansing properties but
this<00:04:02.909> is<00:04:03.120> good<00:04:03.389> like<00:04:03.690> if<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:04.049> don't<00:04:04.229> have<00:04:04.409> time
