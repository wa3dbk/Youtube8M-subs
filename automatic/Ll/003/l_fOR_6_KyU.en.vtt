00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.180 

I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:00.539> we<00:00:00.719> all<00:00:00.870> go<00:00:01.199> through<00:00:01.560> this<00:00:01.709> journey

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
I think we all go through this journey

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.499 
I think we all go through this journey
to<00:00:03.060> get<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.389> that<00:00:03.870> point<00:00:04.490> to<00:00:05.490> wake<00:00:05.670> up<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.210> I

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
to get to that point to wake up and I

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.919 
to get to that point to wake up and I
think<00:00:06.810> that's<00:00:07.049> what<00:00:07.890> all<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:09.120> experience

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
think that's what all of the experience

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.539 
think that's what all of the experience
is<00:00:10.170> about<00:00:10.610> some<00:00:11.610> people<00:00:12.200> get<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.679> few<00:00:14.190> times

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
is about some people get it a few times

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.269 
is about some people get it a few times
before<00:00:15.240> they<00:00:15.599> wake<00:00:15.780> up<00:00:15.839> some<00:00:16.410> people<00:00:16.680> get<00:00:17.130> it

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
before they wake up some people get it

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.820 
before they wake up some people get it
all<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.820> time<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.510> never<00:00:18.779> wake<00:00:19.109> up

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
all the time and never wake up

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.490 
all the time and never wake up
so<00:00:20.010> what<00:00:20.400> was<00:00:22.010> it<00:00:23.010> for<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:24.660> get<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.080> to

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
so what was it for you to get you to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.859 
so what was it for you to get you to
come<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.490> level<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:27.090> consciousness

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
come to this level of consciousness

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.300 
come to this level of consciousness
because<00:00:28.109> there's<00:00:28.260> many<00:00:28.590> levels<00:00:28.949> of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
because there's many levels of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.209 
because there's many levels of
consciousness<00:00:30.050> right<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:31.619> keep<00:00:31.830> evolving

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219
