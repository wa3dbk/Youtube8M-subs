00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.580
 and so far 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.429
 a series of numbers 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.899
 before you can work to calculate it 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:17.169
 the first neighborhood where media michel angers in their role 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:18.509
 increasing 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.919
 so here opening croissants jus choose the rocroi sanchez marc for the 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.710
 smaller monkeys down 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.730
 I copy it continues what did I like 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.899
 Thursday May 6th at g8 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.349
 I want a myth 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.110
 I beat 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.380
 then 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.870
 10 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.870
 then 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.950
 13 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.660
 I still have some 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.960
 I continue 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 I have now finished and I have my statistical series 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.650
 the data set that is arranged in ascending order 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.480
 to find the first galactic 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.280
 the total number of series n 16 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.580
 the first district saint-jacques number 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.580
 for which at least 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.930
 A quarter 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.860
 values 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.220
 who are not inferior or equal to him 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.690
 so at first happy to a quarter of the set of values ​​that represents 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.060
 how much here as required 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.229
 single player surround divide by four the sector 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.960
 a two or three 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.910
 the afp the first finally the first name for which 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.650
 the jury below 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.320
 which values ​​are less than or equal to his stress 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.320
 so the first neighborhood 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.540
 first moon area 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.060
 13 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.460
 the third quarter that is now 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.200
 same thing but with three quarters 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.580
 the one to find 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.480
 the smallest number 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.670
 for the oldest of three quarters of the values 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.789
 if his name inside can be said to his drama revenge to three quarters 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.689
 divide by 4 7 and 4 3% 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:13.120
 2 four six or eight 10 painful 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.569
 so the smallest number 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.569
 for the three-quarter trap 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:24.089
 values ​​insured at the gala under seal on 24 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.869
 the median 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:29.479
 my shadow 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:33.089
 we did what we had to do to get this site 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:37.289
 between the 8th and the 9th value in eighths 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.540
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 abbas 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.630
 103 19 and 19 so I'm going to take 19 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.149
 the median and 19 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:50.149
 she's not my plan two groups 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:53.899
 the two euros 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.899
 of the same size 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.149
 cg now do the box diagram 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.149
 I will take a centimeter or two units 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:07.539
 my boyfriend this 32 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.539
 holy cross here 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:14.419
 even five units out of a dozen friends 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:15.949
 So here is 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:17.409
 I am here 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.060
 the minimum value small-synthe the maximum value of 32 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:25.549
 so they are related 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.549
 the important members first quarter 13 

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:32.119
 donate cold blood six and a half centimeters 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:35.329
 13 this one line 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.329
 the third quarter if the same if the winner 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.959
 moreover on the uci 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.039
 at 12 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:45.240
 then 19 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.240
 for the median, which was not elected since 2006 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.529
 so play here 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:55.969
 williams is here 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.969
 julie 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.529
 the third quarter times 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:04.599
 some 24 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.599
 I am here the first karting that fuse 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.789
 I will then 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.319
 a box 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.979
 hence the name of budget really box 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.979
 I will limit this volatility 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.129
 or karting ranking is tight 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:32.129
 between the two southern neighborhoods 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.009
 so that's why besides why the south-marketed interesting because 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.719
 right here 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.719
 the width of the box you indicate 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.520
 the neighborhoods in question here 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.449
 Thursday 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.599
 the Bonesian secret part 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.999
 we immediately went kelleher 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:08.999
 the number which is because here 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:13.009
 in two sets in two equal groups 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.889
 here I play on it 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.559
 somehow his name 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:20.539
 values 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.729
 extreme here 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.729
 I know here on this side here cons 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.740
 I go up to 4 years of struggle 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.629
 here I have so 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:33.819
 extreme values 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:36.180
 the median 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.180
 the first quarter kyle 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.479
 third karting 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.180
 the diamond has to be interesting because we can see 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:51.969
 that these between 13 and 24 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:55.659
 what is the biggest of the many significant 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.960
 from the Serie
