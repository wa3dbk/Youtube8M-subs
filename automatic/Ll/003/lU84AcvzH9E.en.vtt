00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.809
 nowadays the most common way of 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.550
 listening to music is with headphones 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.099
 but there are times when you want 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.740
 to listen to songs without a phone and in those hours 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.260
 the speakers are producing a good 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.170
 option but which one is best for 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.720
 find out we tested 6 to test 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.939
 battery we have leveled the volume of the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.210
 boxes using a signal generator and a 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.630
 microphone and then we play the same playlist 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.700
 with 130 songs from various genres 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.980
 each box stops working for 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.770
 evaluate the sound quality of the years one 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.200
 set of 20 songs and we alternate 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.610
 several times to fill the boxes during 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.800
 each one of them 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.950
 Let's see which is the best our first 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.260
 box is the philips bt 2000 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.510
 It is too small too light. 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.120
 You play inside your backpack. 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.859
 bag when you use it open the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.780
 box as if it were an accordion 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.719
 pulling their tips 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.040
 The battery lasts almost four hours. 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.100
 it's a good time 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.100
 considering the small size of the carton 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.470
 it plays loud and does not distort the sound more 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.180
 almost without seriousness because the high 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.580
 speaker is too small 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.460
 if you do not use this, but you want 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.060
 to have a little sound ok at hand can be 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.060
 a good option 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.210
 our next box is the logitech x300 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.280
 it spreads the sound well because it has high 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.570
 speakers facing forward and also 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.479
 to the sides 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.729
 has a little bit of annoyance plays loud and 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.130
 never of stocks or sound but this has a 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.130
 negative side if you are listening 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.560
 loud music sometimes the box reduces 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.229
 the volume to prevent 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.420
 music distorts is the right thing to 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.479
 do but it can be a bit 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.549
 times the box an option to listen without 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.979
 great pretensions on the beach or 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.799
 pool because the battery lasts a lot 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.700
 almost nine hours and also because it is 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.700
 rubberized 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.910
 samsung level is like a 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.270
 improved and slightly more expensive version of 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.340
 logitech the size and weight are similar 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.560
 but the sound is much better 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.810
 in more defined treble and much more 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.910
 mainly due to a 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.380
 box application you can download 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.960
 In your cellphone 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.470
 only android and have features that improve 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.790
 the sound of the battery is 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.210
 best of all 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.810
 It lasts a lot with however after 10 hours 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.100
 continuous use the volume goes down 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.880
 automatically gradually but this does not 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.880
 becomes a problem 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.930
 Our next box is a jbl press. 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.300
 she has a well- meaning dna looks like a 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.120
 brass and covered by a 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.250
 flashing multi-colored LEDs on the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.260
 rhythm of the music or according to 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.260
 programming you choose the 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.720
 lights can also be turned off and 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.910
 good that you do it because otherwise 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.730
 battery that normally lasts more than 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.400
 seven hours ends in half the time 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.880
 sound is loud and clear but 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.900
 bass to the samsung box that's fine 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.440
 smaller 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.440
 have more 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:28.610
 the 360 here is the largest and heaviest 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.940
 of them all looks like a suitcase with 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.250
 handle and sound quality it is the best it is 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.769
 that the box has four speakers in the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.900
 sides that fill the environment well and 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.230
 plus a serious pointed speaker 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.140
 down so the tdk would be the best 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:49.250
 option was not for a problem 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.410
 the battery is very weak in our test is the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.440
 barely two hours 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.380
 it's very little even that limits a lot 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.350
 the use of the product that, after all, is 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.160
 a portable sound box will be used 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.160
 away from the wall outlet 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.670
 Our next box is the sony x5 she does not 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.549
 it's very compact there 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.560
 looks like a 500 page book and you 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.139
 still have to take the charger because 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.500
 it does not load and we see usb like the others 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.260
 but that yes conveniences are worth it 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.199
 the sound is very good with real bass 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.419
 and sharp the box has 8 watts 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.400
 but when it is plugged into power 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.050
 It increases for us and it improves 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.479
 the sound 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.270
 sony has acceptable quality to use 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.310
 at home replacing micro system and 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.699
 also a battery that lasts a great deal 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.530
 time away from the take almost seven hours 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:48.120
 can be used to 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.120
 recharge your cell phone battery 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.330
 it is the only one of the boxes tested with 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.910
 this optimal combination of features 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.900
 quality and high power of the 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.870
 drums 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.690
 so it is the best option if it were 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.940
 with my money I would buy this 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.940
 That's a hug and see you next month
