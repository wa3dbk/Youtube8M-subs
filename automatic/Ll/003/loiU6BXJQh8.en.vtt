first<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.410> I<00:01:10.440> want<00:01:10.620> to<00:01:10.710> say<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.040> we're<00:01:11.159> in

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
first of all I want to say that we're in

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.870 
first of all I want to say that we're in
drop<00:01:11.520> D<00:01:11.550> tuning

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.459 

what<00:01:14.479> we've<00:01:14.600> done<00:01:14.719> is<00:01:14.869> we're<00:01:14.990> taking<00:01:15.259> our

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
what we've done is we're taking our

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:16.840 
what we've done is we're taking our
yeast<00:01:15.649> ring<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.100> dropped<00:01:16.280> it<00:01:16.399> down<00:01:16.549> in<00:01:16.700> full

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
yeast ring and dropped it down in full

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.539 
yeast ring and dropped it down in full
step

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
step

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.679 
step
so

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
so

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.480 
so
detuning<00:01:21.499> is<00:01:21.560> kind<00:01:21.799> of<00:01:21.829> nice<00:01:22.009> because<00:01:22.189> you<00:01:22.369> get

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
detuning is kind of nice because you get

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:36.539 
detuning is kind of nice because you get
that<00:01:22.609> bottom<00:01:26.859> very<00:01:27.859> dynamic

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.429 

now<00:01:37.119> what<00:01:37.299> I<00:01:37.329> what<00:01:37.720> I'd<00:01:37.810> like<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.079> call<00:01:38.229> this

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
it's sort of a modal tuning it's neither

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.310 
it's sort of a modal tuning it's neither
major<00:01:42.100> nor<00:01:42.369> minor<00:01:42.399> but<00:01:42.909> the<00:01:43.899> scales<00:01:44.140> we're

probably know by now

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.959 
probably know by now
that's<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.740> first<00:01:57.920> chord<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.579> second<00:01:58.820> chord

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
that's the first chord the second chord

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.560 
that's the first chord the second chord
is<00:01:59.030> just<00:01:59.179> a<00:01:59.240> straight<00:01:59.479> C<00:02:00.939> not<00:02:01.939> be<00:02:02.090> careful<00:02:02.329> when

is just a straight C not be careful when

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.200 
is just a straight C not be careful when
you<00:02:02.689> hit<00:02:02.840> this<00:02:02.990> C<00:02:03.289> not<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.310> hit<00:02:04.429> the<00:02:04.549> low<00:02:04.670> D<00:02:04.909> at

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
you hit this C not to hit the low D at

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.690 
you hit this C not to hit the low D at
the<00:02:05.270> same<00:02:05.329> time<00:02:06.250> it's<00:02:07.250> not<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.490> end<00:02:07.579> of<00:02:07.610> the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
the same time it's not the end of the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.969 
the same time it's not the end of the
world<00:02:07.880> if<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.060> do<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.619> little<00:02:09.619> bit<00:02:09.739> a<00:02:09.769> little

bit of a discord

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.270 
bit of a discord
so<00:02:11.150> in<00:02:11.629> general<00:02:11.989> when<00:02:12.560> hitting<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.860> C<00:02:13.099> make

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
so in general when hitting the C make

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.009 
so in general when hitting the C make
sure<00:02:13.430> your<00:02:13.640> target<00:02:14.000> note<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.299> this<00:02:14.450> this<00:02:14.840> one

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.130 
and then your target note on your first
court<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.680> your<00:02:19.830> Lodi

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
court is your Lodi

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.230 
court is your Lodi
so<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.830> verses<00:02:23.250> are<00:02:23.430> just<00:02:23.610> simply<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.940> deep

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
so the verses are just simply a deep

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.000 
so the verses are just simply a deep
honor

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.920 

then<00:02:29.580> back<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.819> your<00:02:29.970> seat

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.770

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
back here D minor

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.300 
back here D minor
kind<00:02:39.410> of<00:02:39.470> nice<00:02:39.590> strong

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.520 

this<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.209> what<00:02:44.330> marks<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.780> end<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.050> verse

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.410 

and<00:02:49.070> then<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.250> B<00:02:49.370> section<00:02:49.640> is<00:02:49.940> interesting

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
and then the B section is interesting

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.960 
and then the B section is interesting
this<00:02:50.870> is<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.080> B<00:02:51.290> flat<00:02:51.500> chord<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:52.460> you've<00:02:52.610> got<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.790> B

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
this is a B flat chord so you've got a B

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.840 
this is a B flat chord so you've got a B
flat<00:02:53.210> on<00:02:53.330> your<00:02:53.360> bass<00:02:53.630> on<00:02:53.870> your<00:02:53.990> a<00:02:54.020> string<00:02:54.850> your

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.330 

and<00:03:00.890> then<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.070> half<00:03:01.250> step<00:03:01.280> up

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
and then a half step up

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.880 
and then a half step up
to<00:03:03.879> a<00:03:03.910> C<00:03:04.239> so<00:03:05.170> from<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.440> b-flat

see

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
see

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.370 
see
see<00:03:10.530> how<00:03:10.650> that's<00:03:10.860> going<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:12.570> see<00:03:12.780> what<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:12.990> DNA

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
see how that's going to see what the DNA

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.740 
see how that's going to see what the DNA
then<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.830> bridge<00:03:14.070> goes<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.700> aji<00:03:15.060> now<00:03:15.360> remember

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
then the bridge goes to aji now remember

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.050 
then the bridge goes to aji now remember
you've<00:03:15.930> got<00:03:16.140> your<00:03:16.320> URI<00:03:16.770> down<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.220> D<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:17.670> you

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
you've got your URI down to D so you

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.460 
you've got your URI down to D so you
have<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.270> do<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.360> different<00:03:18.720> kind<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:19.110> G<00:03:19.290> but

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
have to do a different kind of G but

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.170 
have to do a different kind of G but
check<00:03:19.710> this<00:03:19.860> out<00:03:20.070> this<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.460> cool<00:03:20.670> kind<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:21.000> G

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
check this out this is a cool kind of G

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:34.680 
check this out this is a cool kind of G
it<00:03:21.690> almost<00:03:21.870> sounds<00:03:22.110> like<00:03:22.140> bagpipes

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.110 

so<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.380> way<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.530> accomplish<00:03:35.830> that<00:03:36.070> is<00:03:36.280> you

string and your D note sides up so as
almost<00:03:52.030> as<00:03:52.270> if<00:03:52.450> well<00:03:53.440> you<00:03:54.010> have<00:03:54.130> to<00:03:54.250> visualize

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
almost as if well you have to visualize

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.750 
almost as if well you have to visualize
it<00:03:54.880> if<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.780> was<00:03:55.870> down<00:03:56.020> to<00:03:56.230> an<00:03:56.380> e<00:03:56.590> your<00:03:57.580> G

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
it if it was down to an e your G

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.850 
it if it was down to an e your G
position<00:03:58.150> obviously<00:03:58.450> looks<00:03:58.600> like<00:03:58.660> that<00:03:58.930> but

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
position obviously looks like that but

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.320 
position obviously looks like that but
because<00:04:00.160> we've<00:04:00.340> gone<00:04:00.490> down<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:00.820> D<00:04:01.090> we<00:04:01.300> have

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
because we've gone down to a D we have

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.100 
because we've gone down to a D we have
to<00:04:01.540> finger<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.930> this<00:04:02.080> way<00:04:03.690> but<00:04:04.690> what<00:04:04.810> happens

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
to finger it this way but what happens

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:12.480 
to finger it this way but what happens
it's<00:04:05.320> a<00:04:05.350> very<00:04:05.530> dark<00:04:05.740> sound<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.280> hear<00:04:06.400> that<00:04:11.490> was

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
it's a very dark sound you hear that was

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:24.080 
it's a very dark sound you hear that was
a<00:04:12.520> foreboding<00:04:13.000> kind<00:04:13.390> of<00:04:13.480> sound

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.450 

so<00:04:24.660> that's<00:04:24.870> how<00:04:25.020> this<00:04:25.169> song<00:04:25.440> goes<00:04:25.740> it's<00:04:26.220> called
