is kind of a basically a Nikon d4 X
preview<00:00:15.360> how<00:00:16.080> do<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.230> know<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.680> I'll<00:00:17.010> get<00:00:17.279> to

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
preview how do I know that I'll get to

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.759 
preview how do I know that I'll get to
that<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.640> second<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:24.230> how<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.500> say<00:00:25.650> if

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
that in a second so how can I say if

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.500 
that in a second so how can I say if
there<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:25.980> some<00:00:26.279> validity<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:26.939> well<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.269> mean

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
there is some validity to it well I mean

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.390 
there is some validity to it well I mean
I<00:00:27.570> can't<00:00:27.869> say<00:00:28.050> there's<00:00:28.260> 100%<00:00:28.800> authenticity

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
I can't say there's 100% authenticity

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.669 
I can't say there's 100% authenticity
yeah<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.390> guess<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.810> still<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.019> rumour<00:00:31.470> mill

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
yeah I guess it's still a rumour mill

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.950 
yeah I guess it's still a rumour mill
but<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.009> pretty<00:00:32.520> much<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.730> solidified<00:00:33.480> rumor

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
but it's pretty much a solidified rumor

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.080 
but it's pretty much a solidified rumor
in<00:00:34.110> regards<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:35.190> screenshot<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.820> I

in regards to this screenshot that I
have<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.660> I'm<00:00:36.750> not<00:00:36.870> gonna<00:00:37.079> say<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.950> know

over like how do I think that this is at
least<00:00:51.539> semi<00:00:51.989> valid<00:00:52.379> why<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.890> used<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.190> work<00:00:53.340> for

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
least semi valid why I used to work for

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.010 
least semi valid why I used to work for
a<00:00:53.550> camera<00:00:53.879> store<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.809> they

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
a camera store and they you they

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
generate pages for you and that lay on

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.450 
generate pages for you and that lay on
everything<00:00:57.719> like<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.469> varies<00:00:59.430> depending

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
everything like that it varies depending

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.990 
everything like that it varies depending
on<00:01:00.239> site<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.219> it<00:01:02.219> means<00:01:02.520> pretty<00:01:02.910> much

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
on site and it means pretty much

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.030 
on site and it means pretty much
something's<00:01:03.690> coming<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.350> don't<00:01:04.500> know<00:01:04.710> when<00:01:05.010> I

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
something's coming you don't know when I

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.890 
something's coming you don't know when I
think<00:01:05.339> someone<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:05.850> accidentally<00:01:06.630> pulled

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
think someone just accidentally pulled

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.410 
think someone just accidentally pulled
the<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.799> old<00:01:07.920> trigger<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.640> click<00:01:08.970> when

the the old trigger and just click when

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750 
the the old trigger and just click when
they<00:01:09.570> shouldn't<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.650> figure<00:01:11.310> might

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
they shouldn't have but I figure might

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
they shouldn't have but I figure might
as<00:01:11.909> well<00:01:12.060> not<00:01:12.299> as<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.570> said<00:01:12.630> I'm<00:01:13.020> not<00:01:13.229> gonna<00:01:13.380> say

but why boom you're getting a fifty four

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.289 
but why boom you're getting a fifty four
point<00:01:37.320> six<00:01:37.619> megapixel<00:01:38.430> sensor<00:01:38.790> once<00:01:39.030> again

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
point six megapixel sensor once again

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.850 
point six megapixel sensor once again
this<00:01:39.900> could<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.229> been<00:01:40.259> about<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.770> be

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
this could have been about to be

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.499 
this could have been about to be
released<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.369> little<00:01:41.640> bit<00:01:41.729> ago<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.360> they

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
released a little bit ago and that they

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.109 
released a little bit ago and that they
decided<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.960> change<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.350> spec<00:01:43.560> or<00:01:43.740> two<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.369> once

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
decided to change a spec or two or once

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.399 
decided to change a spec or two or once
again<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.360> think<00:01:45.479> someone<00:01:45.810> pulled<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.110> trigger

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
again I think someone pulled the trigger

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.310 
again I think someone pulled the trigger
so<00:01:46.950> assume<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.909> 54<00:01:48.570> megapixels<00:01:49.259> you

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
so assume that this is 54 megapixels you

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.050 
so assume that this is 54 megapixels you
have<00:01:49.560> people<00:01:49.860> complaining<00:01:50.009> about<00:01:50.520> what<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:50.970> it

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
have people complaining about what is it

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.460 
have people complaining about what is it
the<00:01:51.149> 32<00:01:51.659> 34<00:01:52.229> megapixel<00:01:52.860> d800<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.270> yeah<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.259> is

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
the 32 34 megapixel d800 so yeah this is

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.130 
the 32 34 megapixel d800 so yeah this is
a<00:01:55.500> beast<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.040> if<00:01:56.130> you're<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:57.750> only<00:01:57.930> thing<00:01:58.020> with

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
a beast so if you're the only thing with

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.530 
a beast so if you're the only thing with
this<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:59.219> me<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.880> really<00:02:00.299> unnecessary

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
this is to me this is really unnecessary

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.469 
this is to me this is really unnecessary
for<00:02:01.229> about<00:02:01.590> eighty<00:02:02.100> seven<00:02:02.700> thousand<00:02:03.180> percent

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
for about eighty seven thousand percent

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.780 
for about eighty seven thousand percent
of<00:02:03.600> what<00:02:03.719> people<00:02:04.020> shoot<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:05.100> once<00:02:05.250> again<00:02:05.520> this

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
of what people shoot but once again this

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.850 
of what people shoot but once again this
is<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.509> pro<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.469> full-time

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
is for the pro this for the full-time

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.190 
is for the pro this for the full-time
pro<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.399> think<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> studio<00:02:09.539> camera<00:02:10.020> so

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
pro I think this is a studio camera so

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.720 
pro I think this is a studio camera so
they're<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:10.709> like<00:02:10.830> they<00:02:11.039> almost<00:02:11.190> want<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.610> go

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
they're it's like they almost want to go

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.910 
they're it's like they almost want to go
medium<00:02:12.239> format

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
medium format

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.380 
medium format
and<00:02:14.160> everything<00:02:14.490> like<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:14.970> they<00:02:15.150> just

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and everything like that but they just

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.120 
and everything like that but they just
want<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.630> DSLR<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.560> they<00:02:16.650> want<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.890> use<00:02:16.980> their

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
want a DSLR and they want to use their

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.980 
want a DSLR and they want to use their
Nikon<00:02:17.460> lenses<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.510> that's<00:02:18.630> why<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.750> feel<00:02:18.930> like

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
Nikon lenses so that's why I feel like

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.780 
Nikon lenses so that's why I feel like
this<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.320> for<00:02:19.560> but<00:02:20.040> there's<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.280> couple<00:02:20.430> huge

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
this is for but there's a couple huge

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.010 
this is for but there's a couple huge
things<00:02:21.060> obviously<00:02:21.300> you're<00:02:21.690> gonna<00:02:21.810> get

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
things obviously you're gonna get

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.470 
things obviously you're gonna get
amazing<00:02:22.530> ISL<00:02:23.250> but<00:02:23.730> I'll<00:02:23.820> talk<00:02:23.970> with<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.180> couple

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
amazing ISL but I'll talk with a couple

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.730 
amazing ISL but I'll talk with a couple
of<00:02:24.510> friends<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.930> everything<00:02:25.260> like<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.590> once

of friends and everything like that once

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.570 
of friends and everything like that once
again<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:25.980> want<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.130> brought<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.460> my<00:02:26.550> attention

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
again I want to brought to my attention

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.920 
again I want to brought to my attention
the<00:02:27.180> 16-bit<00:02:28.110> right<00:02:28.620> here<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:29.880> huge<00:02:30.360> that

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
the 16-bit right here that is huge that

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.490 
the 16-bit right here that is huge that
dynamic<00:02:31.470> range<00:02:31.770> is<00:02:32.040> going<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.370> be

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
dynamic range is going to be

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.530 
dynamic range is going to be
mind-blowing<00:02:34.500> once<00:02:35.340> again<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:35.790> isn't<00:02:36.000> 100%

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
mind-blowing once again this isn't 100%

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.660 
mind-blowing once again this isn't 100%
I'm<00:02:37.080> pretty<00:02:37.470> sure<00:02:37.680> it's<00:02:37.830> close<00:02:38.070> but<00:02:38.640> that

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
I'm pretty sure it's close but that

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.370 
I'm pretty sure it's close but that
16-bit<00:02:39.480> as<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.720> said<00:02:39.930> it's<00:02:40.110> going<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.410> be<00:02:40.770> huge

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
16-bit as I said it's going to be huge

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.130 
16-bit as I said it's going to be huge
so<00:02:43.380> eight<00:02:44.010> grand<00:02:44.400> worthy<00:02:44.850> once<00:02:45.450> again<00:02:45.750> it's

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
so eight grand worthy once again it's

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.350 
so eight grand worthy once again it's
for<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.560> professional<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.490> you're<00:02:48.210> gonna

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
for that professional and you're gonna

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.000 
for that professional and you're gonna
get<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.900> I'll<00:02:49.020> touch<00:02:49.380> upon<00:02:49.440> one<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.890> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
get and I'll touch upon one of the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.320 
get and I'll touch upon one of the
things<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.370> you're<00:02:50.490> getting<00:02:50.700> seven<00:02:50.970> frames<00:02:51.150> a

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
things so you're getting seven frames a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.970 
things so you're getting seven frames a
second<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.750> feel<00:02:51.930> like<00:02:52.020> if<00:02:52.170> you're<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.860> know

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
second I feel like if you're you know

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.410 
second I feel like if you're you know
paying<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.370> much<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.820> should<00:02:53.970> probably

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
paying that much you should probably

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.660 
paying that much you should probably
about<00:02:54.720> 24<00:02:55.260> frames<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.710> second<00:02:56.100> but<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.550> know

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
about 24 frames a second but I know

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.280 
about 24 frames a second but I know
these<00:02:56.940> these<00:02:57.090> large<00:02:57.390> files<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.840> they<00:02:57.990> have<00:02:58.140> to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
these these large files and they have to

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.650 
these these large files and they have to
write<00:02:58.500> which<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.430> also<00:02:59.580> pretty<00:03:00.030> key<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.540> got<00:03:00.630> a

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
write which is also pretty key you got a

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.830 
write which is also pretty key you got a
bigger<00:03:00.900> LCD<00:03:01.320> screen<00:03:01.680> whoop-dee-doo

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
bigger LCD screen whoop-dee-doo

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.710 
bigger LCD screen whoop-dee-doo
dual<00:03:03.840> X<00:03:04.610> XQD<00:03:05.610> card<00:03:05.640> slots<00:03:06.360> now<00:03:06.600> if<00:03:06.660> you

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
dual X XQD card slots now if you

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.210 
dual X XQD card slots now if you
remember<00:03:06.930> they<00:03:07.050> came<00:03:07.230> out<00:03:07.290> with<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.650> d4<00:03:08.070> and

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
remember they came out with the d4 and

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.340 
remember they came out with the d4 and
they<00:03:08.310> have<00:03:08.490> one<00:03:08.760> slot<00:03:09.060> regular<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.140> then<00:03:10.200> the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
they have one slot regular and then the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.260 
they have one slot regular and then the
other<00:03:10.470> slot<00:03:10.740> is<00:03:11.010> either<00:03:11.220> SD<00:03:11.640> or<00:03:11.670> CF<00:03:12.120> or

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
other slot is either SD or CF or

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.810 
other slot is either SD or CF or
whatever<00:03:12.510> like<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:13.140> think<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.620> was<00:03:13.710> a<00:03:13.820> SD

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
whatever like that I think it was a SD

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.170 
whatever like that I think it was a SD
but<00:03:15.780> yes<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.680> now<00:03:16.830> they're<00:03:17.010> going<00:03:17.130> dual<00:03:17.430> XQD

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
but yes so now they're going dual XQD

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.360 
but yes so now they're going dual XQD
card<00:03:18.210> I<00:03:18.750> would<00:03:18.840> think<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.860> card<00:03:20.160> was

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
card I would think that that card was

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.060 
card I would think that that card was
dying<00:03:20.760> but<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.570> have<00:03:21.930> Lexar<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.770> everything

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
dying but you have Lexar and everything

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.200 
dying but you have Lexar and everything
like<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.640> they're<00:03:23.760> coming<00:03:24.060> out<00:03:24.180> and

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
like that that they're coming out and

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.720 
like that that they're coming out and
that<00:03:24.420> they're<00:03:24.570> making<00:03:25.010> these<00:03:26.010> cards<00:03:26.370> now<00:03:26.490> so<00:03:26.700> I

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
that they're making these cards now so I

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.760 
that they're making these cards now so I
guess<00:03:27.000> that's<00:03:27.210> here<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.660> stay<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.230> my<00:03:28.530> cons

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
guess that's here to stay and my cons

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.890 
guess that's here to stay and my cons
the<00:03:28.950> one<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.280> adapt<00:03:29.520> them<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:29.910> far<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.690> that's

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
the one to adapt them so far so that's

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.790 
the one to adapt them so far so that's
what<00:03:31.020> that's<00:03:31.170> gonna<00:03:31.350> be

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
what that's gonna be

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.680 
what that's gonna be
you're<00:03:32.520> gonna<00:03:32.610> get<00:03:32.790> your<00:03:32.910> true<00:03:33.120> video<00:03:33.360> modes

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
you're gonna get your true video modes

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.300 
you're gonna get your true video modes
and<00:03:33.930> I'm<00:03:34.020> sure<00:03:34.200> it's<00:03:34.350> gonna<00:03:34.440> look<00:03:34.620> great<00:03:34.890> with

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
and I'm sure it's gonna look great with

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.340 
and I'm sure it's gonna look great with
everything<00:03:35.490> like<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:35.970> fast<00:03:36.720> image

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
everything like that fast image

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.740 
everything like that fast image
processor<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.040> everything<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.460> that<00:03:38.750> just

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
processor and everything like that just

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.540 
processor and everything like that just
I<00:03:39.870> said<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.410> frames<00:03:40.650> per<00:03:40.800> second<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:41.340> don't

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
I said the frames per second I don't

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.010 
I said the frames per second I don't
really<00:03:41.760> know<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.210> once<00:03:42.330> again<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:42.630> feel<00:03:42.870> like

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
really know and once again I feel like

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.440 
really know and once again I feel like
this<00:03:43.230> this<00:03:43.620> right<00:03:43.800> here<00:03:43.890> 54<00:03:44.670> megapixels<00:03:45.330> is

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
this this right here 54 megapixels is

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.210 
this this right here 54 megapixels is
extreme<00:03:46.670> overkill<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.960> mean<00:03:49.860> yeah<00:03:50.010> once

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
extreme overkill so I mean yeah once

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.500 
extreme overkill so I mean yeah once
again<00:03:50.430> this<00:03:50.580> is<00:03:50.730> just<00:03:50.850> commenting<00:03:51.270> on<00:03:51.330> what<00:03:51.480> I
