00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:14.160
 Marion 25 each 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:18.230
 replacement of the star 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:23.720
 I bought this on the market but I need to put 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:27.990
 36 back I already put left on 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:35.130
 16 leading thing to do 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:40.680
 unscrew the two bolts key 8 and remove 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:44.390
 the cover so the cover we removed now 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.420
 loosen the target to loosen the chain the chain 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:53.100
 you need to twist this bolt pit and such 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.309
 same from that side and unleash on 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.879
 tensioner 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.780
 so sepsis guys folded more carefully with 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.739
 this thing 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.150
 with a tensioner she has a thread very 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:11.610
 snotty metal is very soft 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.610
 I thread yes let's say the words already broke well 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.369
 well worn at the beginning can be the third 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.130
 tighten the nut can be normal 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.110
 tighten and so be careful because 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.880
 breaks made of apple 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:31.250
 now unscrew 2 bolts 10 to 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:36.170
 remove the star itself so here we unscrew 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.600
 you can safely shoot it to put a new 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:49.110
 all set is now left to pull 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:53.119
 chain and adjust to chain lay 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.880
 exactly and everything is important here these bolts 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.070
 at 10 not much to drag 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.920
 rip thread not perez not 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.850
 overdo it because they are very 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.640
 flimsy well and tighten ok too what 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.270
 the roads are not yet unscrewed the most important thing 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.510
 this is to keep everything clean because 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.770
 on chains and a lot of dirt and sand 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.510
 all this is natural and 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.760
 on stars then on carving and everywhere 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.230
 so everything must be done carefully and 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.540
 purely 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:35.650
 chain tension chain lift chain 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.909
 should be 25 millimeters then 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.129
 there is you in the middle of the chain raised up and 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:44.099
 lowered down the distance it should be 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.739
 25 millimeters 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:52.079
 the chain to itself pulls this one 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.879
 tensioner nut and contra nut 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:03:00.310
 tighten it you tighten the chain 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:07.209
 further very one important thing wheel then 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:09.340
 she stands on two tensioners here 2 more 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.769
 it turns out just stupidly pull 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.620
 chain it does not work this chain pulled 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:18.849
 the wheel will be crooked wheel one way 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.189
 watching motorcycles there is another that garbage 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.379
 pula 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:27.609
 so you need to adjust 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:31.030
 governed this by the stars stars they 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:33.939
 lie on one axis and need to do so 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.760
 to chain too 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:42.760
 lying on the same axis here it has 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.889
 a slight backlash to achieve such 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.040
 arrangements for the wheel to spin 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.040
 and 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.650
 the chain has always remained in the middle there 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.680
 if she walks off to one hundred 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.750
 percent wheel 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.720
 motorcycles rides one way the wheel in 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:10.270
 the other one therefore needs to be taken to 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:16.750
 very seriously so the chain and pulled exactly 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:18.760
 21 centimeter and atc on look 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:24.640
 chain position 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:30.680
 we take so the wheel scrolls and look 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.720
 in this direction departs 5 in this direction 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.220
 also departs 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:40.750
 that is, the chain falls exactly on the star 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:45.140
 means that the axis of the spirit of the stars are the same 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:51.490
 this is the most important thing now is left 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.490
 cover and then fasten bolts
