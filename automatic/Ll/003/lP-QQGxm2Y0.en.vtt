for<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> nighttime<00:00:33.480> shot<00:00:34.079> you'll<00:00:34.800> see<00:00:35.010> later

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
for the nighttime shot you'll see later

for the nighttime shot you'll see later
why<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.790> need<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:40.160> now<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.309> these<00:00:41.489> shots<00:00:41.760> you

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
why we need it now in these shots you

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.779 
why we need it now in these shots you
can<00:00:42.030> clearly<00:00:42.390> see<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.110> no<00:00:43.530> IR<00:00:43.950> camera<00:00:44.460> that

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
can clearly see the no IR camera that

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.540 
can clearly see the no IR camera that
the<00:00:45.000> colors<00:00:45.780> are<00:00:46.079> quite<00:00:46.350> washed<00:00:46.770> out<00:00:47.070> while

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the colors are quite washed out while

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.060 
the colors are quite washed out while
the<00:00:47.969> IR<00:00:48.510> camera<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.140> still<00:00:49.350> full<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.710> color

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the IR camera is still full of color

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.619 
the IR camera is still full of color
this<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.520> because<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> lack<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
this is because of the lack of the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.610 
this is because of the lack of the
infrared<00:00:52.110> filter<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> no<00:00:53.219> IR<00:00:53.610> camera<00:00:54.620> now

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
infrared filter in the no IR camera now

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.130 
infrared filter in the no IR camera now
we<00:00:55.680> know<00:00:56.129> IR<00:00:56.520> camera<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.090> better<00:00:57.300> suited<00:00:57.960> for

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
we know IR camera is better suited for

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.889 
we know IR camera is better suited for
nitrogen<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.160> makes<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.670> great<00:01:00.420> for<00:01:00.840> a

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
nitrogen that makes it great for a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.229 
nitrogen that makes it great for a
security<00:01:01.440> camera<00:01:01.710> night<00:01:02.340> life<00:01:02.609> watching

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
security camera night life watching

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.690 
security camera night life watching
monitoring<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> help<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.409> green<00:01:04.860> plants<00:01:05.129> even

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
monitoring the help of green plants even

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.679 
monitoring the help of green plants even
and<00:01:06.030> there's<00:01:06.540> tons<00:01:06.930> more<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:07.830> it

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
and there's tons more you can do with it

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.840 
and there's tons more you can do with it
then<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.229> normal<00:01:10.590> camera<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.159> better<00:01:11.490> for

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
then the normal camera is better for

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.899 
then the normal camera is better for
just<00:01:12.090> normal<00:01:12.570> daytime<00:01:13.080> video<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.920> photos<00:01:14.400> and

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
just normal daytime video and photos and

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.450 
just normal daytime video and photos and
time<00:01:15.659> lapses<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.409> either<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:17.070> here<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.430> have

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
time lapses of either now here we have

whilst be no IR camera can still see
quite<00:01:27.030> well<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.619> without<00:01:28.799> being

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
here is another low-light environment

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.390 
here is another low-light environment
but<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.299> IR<00:01:33.659> camera<00:01:34.140> has<00:01:34.320> some<00:01:34.619> visual<00:01:35.189> but

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
but the IR camera has some visual but

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.179 
but the IR camera has some visual but
clearly<00:01:36.329> not<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:36.869> clear<00:01:37.290> as<00:01:37.439> an<00:01:37.590> IR<00:01:37.950> camera

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
clearly not as clear as an IR camera

clearly not as clear as an IR camera
here<00:01:38.759> now<00:01:39.570> let's<00:01:39.990> switch<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.470> lights<00:01:40.680> off<00:01:40.890> now

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
here now let's switch the lights off now

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.929 
here now let's switch the lights off now
I<00:01:41.729> am<00:01:42.030> using<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.810> infrared<00:01:43.680> illuminator<00:01:44.399> as<00:01:44.759> I

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
I am using the infrared illuminator as I

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.870 
I am using the infrared illuminator as I
mentioned<00:01:45.360> earlier<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.170> as<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
mentioned earlier and as you can see the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.800 
mentioned earlier and as you can see the
no<00:01:48.119> IR<00:01:48.450> camera<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.020> pretty<00:01:49.439> clear<00:01:50.360> if<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.479> didn't

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
no IR camera is pretty clear if I didn't

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.899 
no IR camera is pretty clear if I didn't
have<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> illuminator<00:01:52.770> then<00:01:53.070> flight<00:01:53.369> cameras

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
have the illuminator then flight cameras

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.940 
have the illuminator then flight cameras
will<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.240> completely<00:01:54.869> blind<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.860> is

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
will be completely blind so that is

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.700 
will be completely blind so that is
extremely<00:01:56.579> important<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.509> had<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.439> you

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
extremely important you had this if you

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.999 
extremely important you had this if you
want<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.219> nighttime<00:01:59.850> shots<00:02:00.680> now<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.710> hope

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
want to do nighttime shots now I hope

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.550 
want to do nighttime shots now I hope
this<00:02:02.159> comparisons<00:02:02.909> help<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.689> deciding<00:02:04.170> the
