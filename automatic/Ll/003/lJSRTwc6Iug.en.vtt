00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
know have so many ideas it's just about

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.199 
know have so many ideas it's just about
starting<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.220> getting<00:03:31.489> into<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.819> game<00:03:32.000> and

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
starting and getting into the game and

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.030 
starting and getting into the game and
then<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.480> evolve<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.170> figure<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.620> out<00:03:33.769> and

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
then you evolve and figure it out and

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.250 
then you evolve and figure it out and
because<00:03:34.400> you<00:03:34.549> touched<00:03:34.819> on<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.209> gorgeous<00:03:36.049> orb

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
because you touched on that gorgeous orb

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.150 
because you touched on that gorgeous orb
is<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.410> little<00:03:36.590> bit<00:03:36.680> different<00:03:36.920> because<00:03:36.980> you

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
is a little bit different because you

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.800 
is a little bit different because you
actually<00:03:37.489> started<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.819> online<00:03:38.180> store<00:03:38.480> first

actually started the online store first
correct<00:03:39.319> and<00:03:39.500> then<00:03:39.590> opened<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.040> store<00:03:40.220> fronts

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
correct and then opened the store fronts

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.280 
correct and then opened the store fronts
and<00:03:40.849> so<00:03:41.180> what<00:03:41.389> did<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.630> do<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:41.989> get<00:03:42.109> started

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
what was your first step okay so what

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.960 
what was your first step okay so what
happened<00:03:45.950> was<00:03:46.099> and<00:03:46.370> this<00:03:46.519> was<00:03:46.579> during<00:03:46.849> the

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
happened was and this was during the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.000 
happened was and this was during the
internet<00:03:47.359> pay<00:03:47.569> day<00:03:47.810> where<00:03:48.260> there<00:03:48.650> were<00:03:48.769> so

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
internet pay day where there were so

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.800 
internet pay day where there were so
many<00:03:49.130> new<00:03:49.250> internet<00:03:49.940> businesses<00:03:50.389> it<00:03:50.569> was<00:03:50.690> the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
many new internet businesses it was the

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.270 
many new internet businesses it was the
first<00:03:50.989> time<00:03:51.169> you<00:03:51.290> could<00:03:51.440> buy<00:03:51.620> products<00:03:52.069> online

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
first time you could buy products online

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.479 
first time you could buy products online
but<00:03:53.000> there<00:03:53.120> was<00:03:53.239> no<00:03:53.930> cosmetic<00:03:54.410> sites<00:03:54.859> and<00:03:55.220> so

but there was no cosmetic sites and so

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.420 
but there was no cosmetic sites and so
my<00:03:55.639> idea<00:03:55.940> was<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.239> start<00:03:56.299> a<00:03:56.720> cosmetic<00:03:57.319> site<00:03:57.590> so

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
challenges do you face that you found

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.550 
challenges do you face that you found
that<00:04:59.419> were<00:04:59.509> unique<00:04:59.840> being<00:05:00.259> a<00:05:00.379> young

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
that were unique being a young

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.839 
that were unique being a young
entrepreneur<00:05:00.830> it's<00:05:01.460> an<00:05:01.610> interesting

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
entrepreneur it's an interesting

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.149 
entrepreneur it's an interesting
question<00:05:02.659> I<00:05:02.810> think<00:05:02.900> being<00:05:03.800> a<00:05:03.979> younger

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
question I think being a younger

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:05.860 
question I think being a younger
entrepreneur<00:05:04.759> is<00:05:05.000> actually<00:05:05.479> a<00:05:05.509> little<00:05:05.690> bit

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
entrepreneur is actually a little bit

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.719 
entrepreneur is actually a little bit
easier<00:05:06.259> because<00:05:06.469> you<00:05:06.770> have<00:05:06.919> nothing<00:05:07.099> to<00:05:07.520> lose

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
easier because you have nothing to lose

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.480 
easier because you have nothing to lose
I<00:05:08.120> wasn't<00:05:08.659> married<00:05:08.810> I<00:05:09.020> had<00:05:09.169> no<00:05:09.349> kids<00:05:09.650> I<00:05:10.039> just

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
I wasn't married I had no kids I just

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.909 
I wasn't married I had no kids I just
had<00:05:10.610> my<00:05:10.729> rent<00:05:11.000> to<00:05:11.180> pay<00:05:11.389> so<00:05:12.319> I<00:05:12.349> actually<00:05:12.650> think

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
had my rent to pay so I actually think

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.249 
had my rent to pay so I actually think
it's<00:05:13.099> the<00:05:13.190> easiest<00:05:13.280> thing<00:05:13.819> to<00:05:13.969> do<00:05:14.270> because<00:05:14.599> you

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
it's the easiest thing to do because you

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.050 
it's the easiest thing to do because you
just<00:05:15.469> you<00:05:15.530> don't<00:05:15.770> see<00:05:16.039> any<00:05:16.190> barriers<00:05:16.699> it's

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
just you don't see any barriers it's

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.939 
just you don't see any barriers it's
actually<00:05:17.750> a<00:05:17.810> little<00:05:17.960> bit<00:05:18.110> harder<00:05:18.500> once<00:05:18.770> you

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
actually a little bit harder once you

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.010 
actually a little bit harder once you
have<00:05:19.099> a<00:05:19.129> family<00:05:19.669> and<00:05:19.849> you're<00:05:20.060> concerned<00:05:20.750> about

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
have a family and you're concerned about

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.930 
have a family and you're concerned about
making<00:05:21.500> sure<00:05:21.680> you've<00:05:21.860> got<00:05:22.069> food<00:05:22.250> on<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.580> table

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
making sure you've got food on the table

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.570 
making sure you've got food on the table
so<00:05:23.810> I<00:05:23.840> would<00:05:24.080> actually<00:05:24.229> say<00:05:24.500> the<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:25.009> the<00:05:25.340> most

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
so I would actually say the the the most

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.850 
so I would actually say the the the most
opportune<00:05:26.240> time<00:05:26.659> is<00:05:26.930> when<00:05:27.289> you're<00:05:27.440> young<00:05:27.650> and

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
opportune time is when you're young and

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.580 
opportune time is when you're young and
in<00:05:27.919> your<00:05:28.039> 20s<00:05:28.460> in<00:05:29.240> terms<00:05:29.539> of<00:05:29.750> a<00:05:29.810> barrier<00:05:30.289> you

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
in your 20s in terms of a barrier you

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.080 
in your 20s in terms of a barrier you
know<00:05:30.830> sometimes<00:05:31.279> people<00:05:31.340> don't<00:05:31.729> take<00:05:31.909> you

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
know sometimes people don't take you

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.480
