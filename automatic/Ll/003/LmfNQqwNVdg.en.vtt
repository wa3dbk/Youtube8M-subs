00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
figures a lot of the pen aligning looks

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.139 
figures a lot of the pen aligning looks
like<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.170> been<00:02:07.469> done<00:02:07.680> by<00:02:07.829> hand<00:02:08.099> which<00:02:08.759> which

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
like it's been done by hand which which

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.630 
like it's been done by hand which which
I'm<00:02:09.300> sure<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.629> has<00:02:09.780> been<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:11.310> they're<00:02:11.459> pretty

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
I'm sure it has been and they're pretty

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.280 
I'm sure it has been and they're pretty
much<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.879> same<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.090> different<00:02:12.360> size<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:13.140> mean

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
much the same just different size I mean

much the same just different size I mean
even

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
even

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.250 
even
the<00:02:13.709> face<00:02:13.980> sculpt<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.700> not<00:02:14.940> really<00:02:15.330> much<00:02:16.019> of<00:02:16.080> a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
the face sculpt is not really much of a

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.869 
the face sculpt is not really much of a
difference<00:02:16.590> just<00:02:16.800> one<00:02:17.010> looks<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.459> little<00:02:17.610> bit

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
difference just one looks a little bit

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.600 
difference just one looks a little bit
uh<00:02:18.140> too<00:02:19.140> happy<00:02:19.590> compared<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.310> other<00:02:20.430> one

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
uh too happy compared to the other one

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.199 
uh too happy compared to the other one
what<00:02:21.599> I<00:02:21.629> did<00:02:21.840> like<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.879> bubbles<00:02:23.879> up

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
what I did like is that the bubbles up

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.920 
what I did like is that the bubbles up
here<00:02:24.239> do<00:02:24.780> pop<00:02:24.989> off<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.379> little<00:02:25.530> helmet<00:02:25.800> things

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
here do pop off the little helmet things

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.789 
here do pop off the little helmet things
yep<00:02:27.930> same<00:02:28.260> thing<00:02:28.440> on<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.709> one<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:30.500> there's<00:02:31.500> I

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
yep same thing on that one and there's I

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.920 
yep same thing on that one and there's I
guess<00:02:32.069> transformable<00:02:32.849> this<00:02:33.209> one<00:02:33.420> was<00:02:33.900> a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
guess transformable this one was a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.900 
guess transformable this one was a
little<00:02:34.019> tough<00:02:34.410> most<00:02:34.799> of<00:02:34.950> everything<00:02:35.459> stuck

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
little tough most of everything stuck

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.930 
little tough most of everything stuck
the<00:02:36.680> articulation<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.129> arms<00:02:38.549> I'm<00:02:38.819> not

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
the articulation is the arms I'm not

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.539 
the articulation is the arms I'm not
going<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.120> force<00:02:39.330> them<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.260> soft<00:02:40.500> PVC<00:02:40.709> you

are bent backwards and then the feet

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.449 
are bent backwards and then the feet
fold<00:02:46.049> up<00:02:46.230> but<00:02:46.799> i'm<00:02:46.890> going<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.069> show<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.250> that

feature on this guy since this guy's a

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.530 
feature on this guy since this guy's a
little<00:02:49.170> looser<00:02:49.319> you'll<00:02:49.680> see<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:49.950> arm<00:02:50.540> there's

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
little looser you'll see the arm there's

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.110 
little looser you'll see the arm there's
no<00:02:51.750> waste<00:02:51.989> at<00:02:52.140> all<00:02:52.670> again<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.819> do<00:02:53.940> have<00:02:53.970> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
no waste at all again you do have the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.839 
no waste at all again you do have the
hips<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.019> move<00:02:55.200> up<00:02:55.410> for<00:02:56.280> some<00:02:56.400> reason<00:02:56.700> he's

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
hips that move up for some reason he's

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.160 
hips that move up for some reason he's
being<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> little<00:02:57.120> stubborn<00:02:57.450> now<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.959> got<00:02:58.079> the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
being a little stubborn now you got the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.809 
being a little stubborn now you got the
knees<00:02:58.379> that<00:02:58.560> fold<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.099> in<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.310> foot<00:02:59.579> right

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
knees that fold and in the foot right

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.119 
knees that fold and in the foot right
here<00:02:59.849> so<00:03:00.629> basically<00:03:01.049> when<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:01.530> transform<00:03:01.950> it

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
here so basically when you transform it

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.589 
here so basically when you transform it
it<00:03:02.340> would<00:03:02.489> do<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:03.090> wheels<00:03:03.269> are<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.510> the

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
it would do this the wheels are on the

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.420 
it would do this the wheels are on the
bottom<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:04.379> looks<00:03:04.560> pretty<00:03:04.709> stupid<00:03:05.190> if<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.370> ask

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
bottom it looks pretty stupid if you ask

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.660 
bottom it looks pretty stupid if you ask
me<00:03:05.879> but<00:03:06.599> yeah<00:03:07.170> soft<00:03:07.530> PVC<00:03:07.709> done<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.310> matte

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
me but yeah soft PVC done in matte

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.750 
me but yeah soft PVC done in matte
finish<00:03:09.239> paint<00:03:10.019> almost<00:03:10.980> looks<00:03:11.160> painted<00:03:11.459> by

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
finish paint almost looks painted by

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.509 
finish paint almost looks painted by
hand<00:03:12.170> it's<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.260> little<00:03:13.379> rough<00:03:13.799> if<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.340> get

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
hand it's a little rough if you get

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.059 
hand it's a little rough if you get
really<00:03:14.790> close<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.480> details<00:03:16.049> but<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:16.829> think

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
really close to the details but I think

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.559 
really close to the details but I think
if<00:03:17.160> you're<00:03:17.280> just<00:03:17.400> displaying<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.150> it's<00:03:18.269> fine

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
if you're just displaying it it's fine

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.400 
if you're just displaying it it's fine
and<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.739> know<00:03:19.859> speaking<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:20.519> plane<00:03:21.410> this

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
and you know speaking of this plane this

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.009 
and you know speaking of this plane this
guy<00:03:22.680> here<00:03:23.010> deluxe<00:03:23.370> sized<00:03:23.579> figure<00:03:24.120> put<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.870> next

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
guy here deluxe sized figure put it next

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.559 
guy here deluxe sized figure put it next
to<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.380> I<00:03:25.980> guess<00:03:26.220> it's<00:03:26.579> scales<00:03:26.850> are<00:03:27.030> nice<00:03:27.299> but

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
to it I guess it's scales are nice but

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.860 
to it I guess it's scales are nice but
once<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.900> have<00:03:28.079> spiked<00:03:28.560> next<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.099> it<00:03:29.690> seems<00:03:30.690> to

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
once you have spiked next to it seems to

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.069 
once you have spiked next to it seems to
be<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.019> little<00:03:31.170> bit<00:03:31.380> too<00:03:31.620> big<00:03:32.599> this<00:03:33.599> guy<00:03:33.780> seems

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
be a little bit too big this guy seems

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.339 
be a little bit too big this guy seems
just<00:03:34.440> about<00:03:34.560> right<00:03:35.630> but<00:03:36.630> then<00:03:36.750> again<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:37.170> might

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
just about right but then again it might

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.400 
just about right but then again it might
be<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.530> tad<00:03:37.799> small<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:39.150> here<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.569> is<00:03:39.599> next<00:03:40.290> to

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
be a tad small and here it is next to

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.720 
be a tad small and here it is next to
the<00:03:40.849> masterpiece<00:03:41.849> Optimus<00:03:42.389> let<00:03:42.599> me<00:03:42.690> just<00:03:43.730> move

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
the masterpiece Optimus let me just move

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.400 
the masterpiece Optimus let me just move
up<00:03:44.940> here<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.359> you<00:03:45.450> can<00:03:45.599> really<00:03:45.750> get<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:45.989> sense<00:03:46.079> of

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
up here so you can really get a sense of

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.030 
up here so you can really get a sense of
scale<00:03:46.849> there's<00:03:47.849> Optimus<00:03:48.650> start<00:03:49.650> from<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.859> top

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
scale there's Optimus start from the top

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.800 
scale there's Optimus start from the top
and<00:03:51.049> go<00:03:52.049> down<00:03:52.519> with<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:54.030> spike<00:03:54.299> in<00:03:54.329> spark

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
and go down with the the spike in spark
