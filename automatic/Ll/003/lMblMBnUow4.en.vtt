00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.390 
anyway so and a lot of young kids are
working<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.950> having<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.070> all<00:01:26.220> in

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
working on it and and having it all in

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.600 
working on it and and having it all in
one<00:01:26.580> place<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:27.390> ones<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.350> one<00:01:28.560> spot<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
one place in ones in one spot and and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.390 
one place in ones in one spot and and
getting<00:01:30.180> credit<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.600> doing<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
getting credit for doing it I think is a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.069 
getting credit for doing it I think is a
real<00:01:32.640> credit<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:32.970> myself<00:01:33.360> among<00:01:33.570> co-authors

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
real credit to myself among co-authors

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.780 
real credit to myself among co-authors
so<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.680> better<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.159> do<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.640> someone

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
so it's better that we do it and someone

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.420 
so it's better that we do it and someone
else<00:01:36.000> does<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.420> you're<00:01:36.689> right<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.280> will<00:01:38.280> be

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
else does it and you're right it will be

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.240 
else does it and you're right it will be
a<00:01:38.460> little<00:01:38.850> minus<00:01:39.270> EV<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> player<00:01:40.979> still
