reinforce that statement you could see

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.920 
reinforce that statement you could see
it<00:00:46.890> has<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.070> fire<00:00:47.460> rate<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.000> thousand<00:00:48.660> rounds

per minute and a bullet velocity of 370

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.590 
per minute and a bullet velocity of 370
meters<00:00:51.989> per<00:00:52.410> second<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.250> believe<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.180> gun<00:00:54.390> is

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
meters per second I believe this gun is

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.869 
meters per second I believe this gun is
the<00:00:54.780> fastest<00:00:55.410> shooting<00:00:55.770> weapon<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.550> game

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the fastest shooting weapon in the game

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.380 
the fastest shooting weapon in the game
the<00:00:57.750> velocity<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.410> not<00:00:58.680> too<00:00:59.100> good<00:00:59.460> but<00:00:59.520> again

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the velocity is not too good but again

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.910 
the velocity is not too good but again
this<00:01:00.840> thing<00:01:01.079> definitely<00:01:01.500> tears<00:01:01.739> through

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
this thing definitely tears through

the heavy LMGs due so that's a lot of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.990 
the heavy LMGs due so that's a lot of
recoil<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.280> that's<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> get<00:01:44.820> out<00:01:44.970> of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
recoil but that's what you get out of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.609 
recoil but that's what you get out of
the<00:01:45.149> fastest<00:01:45.630> shooting<00:01:45.899> weapon<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> game

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the fastest shooting weapon in the game

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.530 
the fastest shooting weapon in the game
so<00:01:47.310> now<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.549> we've<00:01:47.790> taken<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.210> look<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
so now that we've taken a look at the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.240 
so now that we've taken a look at the
basic<00:01:48.840> stats<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.350> weapon<00:01:49.680> let's<00:01:49.829> compare

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
basic stats of this weapon let's compare

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.039 
basic stats of this weapon let's compare
to<00:01:50.460> two<00:01:50.579> other<00:01:50.759> popular<00:01:51.360> guns<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> game

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
to two other popular guns in the game

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.200 
to two other popular guns in the game
we're<00:01:52.470> gonna<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.770> comparing<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.310> cz<00:01:53.670> 3a<00:01:53.939> one

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
we're gonna be comparing the cz 3a one

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.170 
we're gonna be comparing the cz 3a one
to<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.590> aek-971<00:01:55.590> assault<00:01:56.219> weapon<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
to the aek-971 assault weapon and the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.230 
to the aek-971 assault weapon and the
p90<00:01:57.860> PDW<00:01:58.860> now<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.640> tell<00:01:59.700> there<00:02:00.030> are<00:02:00.180> a

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
p90 PDW now as you can tell there are a

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.630 
p90 PDW now as you can tell there are a
lot<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.600> similarities<00:02:01.140> between<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.920> couple<00:02:02.430> of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
lot of similarities between a couple of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.230 
lot of similarities between a couple of
these<00:02:03.110> basically<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.890> cz<00:02:05.189> 3a<00:02:05.460> one<00:02:05.729> trumps

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
these basically the cz 3a one trumps

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.910 
these basically the cz 3a one trumps
everything<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.659> rate<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.840> fire<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.770> also

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
everything in rate of fire but it also

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.889 
everything in rate of fire but it also
comes<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.399> with<00:02:08.520> 25<00:02:08.879> damage<00:02:09.270> making<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.720> higher

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
comes in with 25 damage making it higher

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.839 
comes in with 25 damage making it higher
than<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.259> p90<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> p90<00:02:11.520> has<00:02:11.640> almost

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
than the p90 but the p90 has almost

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.370 
than the p90 but the p90 has almost
double<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.270> ammo<00:02:12.540> capacity

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
double the ammo capacity

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.900 
double the ammo capacity
and<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.890> velocity<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.520> little<00:02:14.730> higher<00:02:14.880> on

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
and the velocity is a little higher on

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.370 
and the velocity is a little higher on
the<00:02:15.120> other<00:02:15.240> ones<00:02:15.420> as<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.600> can<00:02:15.720> see<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.960> AEK

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
the other ones as you can see the AEK

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.440 
the other ones as you can see the AEK
pretty<00:02:16.710> much<00:02:16.890> outperforms<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.550> cz<00:02:17.820> 3a<00:02:18.060> one<00:02:18.300> in

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
pretty much outperforms the cz 3a one in

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.120 
pretty much outperforms the cz 3a one in
this<00:02:18.570> game<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.170> also<00:02:19.320> has<00:02:19.620> much<00:02:19.890> more

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
this game and it also has much more

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.800 
this game and it also has much more
manageable<00:02:20.370> recoil<00:02:20.880> something<00:02:21.480> that's<00:02:21.630> not

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
manageable recoil something that's not

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.590 
manageable recoil something that's not
on<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.230> screen<00:02:22.500> right<00:02:22.740> now<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.700> cz<00:02:24.000> 3a<00:02:24.270> one

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
on the screen right now so the cz 3a one

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.320 
on the screen right now so the cz 3a one
is<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:25.200> insane<00:02:25.710> beast<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.520> close<00:02:26.730> quarters<00:02:27.180> but

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
is in insane beast in close quarters but

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.300 
is in insane beast in close quarters but
it's<00:02:27.450> only<00:02:27.600> effective<00:02:28.140> up<00:02:28.260> until<00:02:28.530> about<00:02:28.710> 15<00:02:29.190> to

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
it's only effective up until about 15 to

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.610 
it's only effective up until about 15 to
30<00:02:29.340> meters<00:02:30.120> after<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.990> it's<00:02:31.200> not<00:02:31.380> even<00:02:31.500> worth

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
30 meters after that it's not even worth

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.800 
30 meters after that it's not even worth
using<00:02:31.920> not<00:02:32.250> even<00:02:32.520> in<00:02:32.640> single<00:02:33.000> shot<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.570> falls

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
using not even in single shot it falls

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.980 
using not even in single shot it falls
off<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.080> hard<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.580> truth<00:02:35.970> be<00:02:36.120> told<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.810> gun

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
off that hard so truth be told the gun

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.020 
off that hard so truth be told the gun
is<00:02:37.140> incredible<00:02:37.650> but<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.340> make<00:02:38.550> this<00:02:38.760> thing

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
is incredible but to make this thing

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.060 
is incredible but to make this thing
succeed<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.870> need<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.200> use<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.740> proper

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
succeed you need to use it in the proper

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.970 
succeed you need to use it in the proper
Maps<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.110> really<00:02:43.440> what<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:43.860> feel

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
Maps and that is really what I feel

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.770 
Maps and that is really what I feel
about<00:02:44.490> this<00:02:44.700> this<00:02:44.970> gun<00:02:45.210> obviously

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
about this this gun obviously

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.930 
about this this gun obviously
statistically<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:46.860> not<00:02:47.040> as<00:02:47.190> good<00:02:47.280> as<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.520> AEK

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
statistically is not as good as the AEK

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.520 
statistically is not as good as the AEK
when<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.180> comes<00:02:48.330> down<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.630> range<00:02:48.900> medium<00:02:49.380> and

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
when it comes down the range medium and

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.470 
when it comes down the range medium and
long<00:02:49.680> range<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.130> cannot<00:02:50.370> compete<00:02:50.730> with<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:51.090> it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
long range it cannot compete with it it

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.840 
long range it cannot compete with it it

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.820 
does Trump out gunfights one-on-one
situations<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.600> gun<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:54.960> gonna<00:02:55.110> win<00:02:55.350> within

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
situations this gun is gonna win within

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.740 
situations this gun is gonna win within
the<00:02:55.950> first<00:02:56.160> 30<00:02:56.370> meters<00:02:56.730> most<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.480> time

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the first 30 meters most of the time

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.570 
the first 30 meters most of the time
which<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.530> good<00:02:58.770> thing<00:02:58.800> enough<00:02:59.160> but<00:02:59.340> this<00:02:59.430> is

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
which is a good thing enough but this is

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.640 
which is a good thing enough but this is
battlefield<00:03:00.180> not<00:03:00.330> every<00:03:00.660> fight<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.110> within<00:03:01.320> 30

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
battlefield not every fight is within 30

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.930 
battlefield not every fight is within 30
meters<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.070> as<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.460> can<00:03:02.580> see<00:03:02.700> right<00:03:02.880> there

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
meters and as you can see right there

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.210 
meters and as you can see right there
things<00:03:03.840> get<00:03:04.050> crazy<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.650> want<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:04.920> talk<00:03:05.070> about

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
things get crazy so I want to talk about

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.040 
things get crazy so I want to talk about
how<00:03:05.460> I<00:03:05.490> feel<00:03:05.940> with<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.240> weapon<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.690> why<00:03:06.840> this

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
how I feel with this weapon and why this

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.870 
how I feel with this weapon and why this
one<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.350> my<00:03:07.470> favorite<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.040> game<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.700> gun

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
one is my favorite in the game the gun

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.970 
one is my favorite in the game the gun
to<00:03:09.060> me<00:03:09.210> has<00:03:09.390> only<00:03:09.600> one<00:03:09.840> real<00:03:10.200> advantage<00:03:10.440> and

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
to me has only one real advantage and

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.500 
to me has only one real advantage and
that's<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.340> fire<00:03:11.610> rate<00:03:11.880> this<00:03:12.060> thing<00:03:12.300> is<00:03:12.420> just

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
that's the fire rate this thing is just

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.780 
that's the fire rate this thing is just
gonna<00:03:12.630> win<00:03:12.930> gunfights<00:03:13.200> like<00:03:14.010> it's<00:03:14.220> nothing<00:03:14.670> on

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
gonna win gunfights like it's nothing on

gonna win gunfights like it's nothing on
top<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.300> it's<00:03:15.480> hipfire<00:03:15.990> is<00:03:16.400> absolutely

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
top of that it's hipfire is absolutely

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.180 
top of that it's hipfire is absolutely
phenomenal<00:03:17.760> as<00:03:18.480> are<00:03:18.720> many<00:03:19.050> of<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.290> pdws<00:03:19.980> but

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
phenomenal as are many of the pdws but

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.280 
phenomenal as are many of the pdws but
this<00:03:20.340> thing<00:03:20.550> just<00:03:20.790> does<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.270> much<00:03:21.480> damage<00:03:21.540> and

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
this thing just does so much damage and

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.200 
this thing just does so much damage and
it<00:03:22.710> does<00:03:22.860> fall<00:03:23.100> off<00:03:23.250> quite<00:03:23.490> heavily<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:24.180> you

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
it does fall off quite heavily so you

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.090 
it does fall off quite heavily so you
need<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.540> play<00:03:24.720> on<00:03:24.870> maps<00:03:25.050> like<00:03:25.200> Locker<00:03:25.650> but<00:03:25.950> you

you plan on using it all up to you and I

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.390 
you plan on using it all up to you and I

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
have the flash hider on there because it

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.680 
have the flash hider on there because it

doesn't really have a negative it's one

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.940 
doesn't really have a negative it's one
of<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.840> few<00:05:36.960> attachments<00:05:37.410> in<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.560> game<00:05:37.740> that

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
of the few attachments in the game that

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.350 
of the few attachments in the game that
actually<00:05:38.220> helps<00:05:38.430> you<00:05:38.550> out<00:05:38.580> without<00:05:38.970> taking

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
actually helps you out without taking

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.780 
actually helps you out without taking

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
anything away and with a gun like this I

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.610 
anything away and with a gun like this I
don't<00:05:42.090> recommend<00:05:42.540> putting<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:43.020> compensator

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
don't recommend putting the compensator

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.640 
don't recommend putting the compensator
or<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:45.060> muzzle<00:05:45.390> brake<00:05:45.570> on<00:05:45.750> it<00:05:45.900> to<00:05:46.020> reduce<00:05:46.440> the

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
or the muzzle brake on it to reduce the

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:47.840 
or the muzzle brake on it to reduce the
recoil<00:05:46.800> which<00:05:47.130> it<00:05:47.280> does<00:05:47.430> have<00:05:47.580> a<00:05:47.610> lot<00:05:47.820> of

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
recoil which it does have a lot of

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.570 
recoil which it does have a lot of
recoil<00:05:48.270> but<00:05:48.510> doing<00:05:48.780> that<00:05:48.930> would<00:05:49.170> sacrifice

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
recoil but doing that would sacrifice

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.880 
recoil but doing that would sacrifice
23%<00:05:50.580> your<00:05:50.700> spread<00:05:51.060> making<00:05:51.480> the<00:05:51.600> bullets<00:05:51.930> not

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
23% your spread making the bullets not

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.640 
23% your spread making the bullets not
as<00:05:53.070> accurate<00:05:53.310> so<00:05:54.150> honestly<00:05:54.750> you<00:05:55.140> can<00:05:55.290> adjust

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
as accurate so honestly you can adjust

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.320 
as accurate so honestly you can adjust
to<00:05:55.770> recoil<00:05:56.100> any<00:05:56.370> player<00:05:56.640> can<00:05:56.880> adjust<00:05:57.210> to

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
to recoil any player can adjust to

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.270 
to recoil any player can adjust to
recoil<00:05:57.660> but<00:05:57.870> you<00:05:57.960> can't<00:05:58.200> adjust<00:05:58.530> a<00:05:58.650> spread<00:05:58.980> so
