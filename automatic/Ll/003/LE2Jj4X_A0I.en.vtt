00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.139
 I am pigeons in vigo and his friend 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.139
 and now let's start 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.269
 to talk about the letter 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.019
 the tasting of the wines 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.369
 and the fish we will also do to define 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.749
 in a colloquial way 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:25.499
 what does a letter mean or what is the meaning properly a tasting 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.050
 the appreciation of a wine through all the senses 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.060
 fluid 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.180
 the view 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.230
 smell, taste and touch 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.430
 we will start with 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.050
 percent the run away at the time of uncovering a wine we can have 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.210
 state before conservation that they find wine through 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.790
 to listen how 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.020
 what sound like that when it's uncovered 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.090
 then with the sight, although it is turbid and cloudy, the placement 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.630
 about we can know the age 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.480
 likewise the smell 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.750
 if your young wine if your old wine 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.820
 says that features that hugo h 13 tracks 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.149
 i the bust 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.360
 we can not perceive others 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.510
 in certain senses as is the cybele viewer 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.280
 the bitterness we have spoken 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.880
 it is about elucidating the case of the pact 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.140
 for the same not we do not impose through the touch of the mouth to be able 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.960
 to detect a certain sense is the sensations as they can be 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.530
 in the temperature 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.780
 etcetera etcetera 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.150
 It is important to note that in order to perform a good tasting or require 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.850
 of certain 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.970
 elements 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.220
 many of them 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.330
 What are they 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.560
 congenital a person natural in the person as they can be 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.660
 how developed the senses are 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.820
 the person who is capturing the wines 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.649
 what do I mean by this percent I mean that a person who has 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.660
 much more developed the sense of smell for example 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.980
 will be much better taster than one who has the bad luck to be born 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.410
 there is also someone who will develop 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.770
 seven other tools such as olfactory memory 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.770
 what does this mean good means 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.489
 on trains 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.499
 your memory your mind to be able to return by art 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.059
 of the Tarahumara 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.659
 the one that has each wine of the aromas and flavors that each wine has and that 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.579
 besides everything you can express the 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.950
 obviously to be able to express you're also having a vocabulary 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.039
 specific 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.389
 to 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.389
 talk about wine in order to express yourself about the wine that is 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.329
 words species is very very 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.919
 in what areas to define certain about the character of certain aromas 112 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.569
 personalities that can 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.569
 that can have 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:50.399
 It is important to start talking about the cup 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:52.919
 it's the mental tip 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.560
 that the cup that we use is the right one for each one 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.569
 of the wines 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.109
 but international we can say 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.859
 that the best glasses to appreciate a wine have to have all 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.219
 different diameters 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:08.030
 between what is the bet 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.019
 bandage of the cup accident the body 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.379
 it must be much smaller from the mouth for what 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:15.910
 a way to concentrate 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.889
 the aromas 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.309
 and that when we are going to be that they are not loving we can perceive the 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:22.099
 much clearer way 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.530
 a very important thing is also the way 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.439
 in which the glasses are washed 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.399
 percent above all you have to be very careful in the restaurants 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:34.379
 because it happens that maybe in washing is not as perfect as it could be in a 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.129
 home 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.059
 and it is likely that many times 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:41.789
 they can have unpleasant odors from other waste 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:42.629
 foods 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.559
 It is by the way in which the cups are commercially washed in two hours 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:47.599
 However 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.679
 It is also very important 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:51.639
 in as much a message as in the house 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.510
 try not to use 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.919
 detergents 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.810
 to wash the cup the cup should always be washed with plenty of water 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.429
 ic just with a little neutral soap I'll explain why 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:05.199
 the detergents with you can see on TV 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.330
 really your advertising and what is 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.709
 what they sell for is why 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.059
 you will not hear many commercials where they say 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:16.059
 the unpleasant colors of the dishes 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.970
 i is precisely what we want we do not believe that the waste of 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.349
 Detergent and mitigate the aromas that you have in vilo 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.439
 as I was saying depending 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.990
 the wine that we go to see closely the glass that we go to 

00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:36.110
 use 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.310
 What do I mean by this 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.319
 that is, if we wanted to see a sparkling wine 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:41.949
 with josep a campaign 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.279
 we would have to use a cup with this form 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:47.309
 which is called tulip 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:48.939
 the way he has 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.430
 why is this is not random 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.430
 we will build a sparkling wine 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.629
 rough carbonic bubble burst that children have like 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:00.319
 others like for example the champagne 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.330
 It is directly proportional to the area it has at the bottom of the cup 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.020
 It's very important 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.830
 mention this because these cups are designed to end in tip 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.189
 this means 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:16.189
 what the aria or the surface of the bottom of the cup 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.180
 so the explosion of bubbles 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.349
 if it will not be so 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:22.969
 somehow so 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:24.539
 crashing percent 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.120
 and that we lose gas a quick way inside the cup 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.620
 will be much more gradual and we will keep the gas and the bubble 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.090
 for much longer than what we are looking for
