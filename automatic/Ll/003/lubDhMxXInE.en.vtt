 not 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.139
 clear 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:09.589
 he 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:12.589
 Rafael Meira 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.630
 there 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.460
 now 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.360
 There is no way 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.340
 had allowed the people of Israel to leave 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.400
 but changed his mind as part of the times it was announced 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.730
 joined with comment successes 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.570
 because we did that by letting Israel go so that it would not serve us 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.880
 said 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.880
 the pharaoh then had his warriors assembled 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.390
 when they realized that they were being persecuted they were terrified and camargo 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.600
 great 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.500
 of being an exception 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.530
 there were no tombs from Egypt to get us out of there as soon as we died 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.650
 right 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.100
 Why did you make us leave Egypt? 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.649
 better served us to the Egyptians than to die even of the army 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.710
 the distinguished gentleman an example 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.340
 because everything passes 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.570
 say the sons of israel that maritime 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.060
 get up with the rod I stretched out my hand over the sea and felt for the children 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.930
 of Israel crosses in 5 km of the sea 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.860
 kings that sorrow and I will be the heart of the Egyptians and these have gone after them 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.790
 and I will be glorified in the end not all his army in his chariots and his 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.460
 knights and the Egyptians will know that I am the bell 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.550
 moses rose formed on the sea 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.020
 and god made a thesis to draw by a strong wind then 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.410
 who blew all night 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.030
 the sea became dry 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.180
 and the waters divide 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.039
 the children of Israel pass from five by the sea and roasts formed with what walls 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.999
 guess who you want 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:14.010
 the Egyptians came in after them yet their chariot horses 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:16.809
 when dawn arrived 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.809
 in the pillar of fire and the cloud looked at the Egyptians 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:24.139
 caused a big mistake I will cheer for them interrogated the wheels of cars 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:25.409
 their 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.749
 we pulled israel shouted because the lord fought for them against us 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:33.349
 You were indicted in sets 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.749
 I stretched out your hand over the sea 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:40.129
 so that the waters that fell on the Egyptians on the chariots and on the 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.199
 their knights 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.939
 so six months 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.909
 and to the municipality the sea returned to its place 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.149
 while farah hears the men tried to flee 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.079
 none of them escaped death 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.449
 in that day 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:57.479
 freed the Hebrews from the power of the Egyptians 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.799
 sell yourself prodigies this is the opinion of the Lord 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.730
 and believe in God and Moses your brain
