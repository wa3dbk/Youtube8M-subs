put on put the prediction card on look

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.469 
put on put the prediction card on look
at<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> number<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.640> then<00:01:32.880> move<00:01:33.210> my

at the number and then move my
prediction<00:01:33.930> card<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.439> meant<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.770> number

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
prediction card that meant that number

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.880 
prediction card that meant that number
either<00:01:35.549> left<00:01:35.939> or<00:01:36.150> right<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.930> let's<00:01:37.439> see<00:01:37.619> this

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
either left or right so let's see this

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.039 
either left or right so let's see this
is<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> 5<00:01:38.460> ok<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> five<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.360> spades<00:01:39.509> we're<00:01:39.930> only

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
is a 5 ok the five of spades we're only

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.319 
is a 5 ok the five of spades we're only
interested<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.860> number<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.790> five<00:01:42.000> so

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
interested in the number so it's five so

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.100 
interested in the number so it's five so
we<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.570> go<00:01:42.689> one<00:01:43.020> two<00:01:43.439> three<00:01:44.040> four<00:01:44.490> five<00:01:44.520> or<00:01:45.210> one

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
we can go one two three four five or one

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.200 
we can go one two three four five or one
two<00:01:46.409> three<00:01:46.860> four<00:01:47.250> five<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:47.820> actually<00:01:48.030> end<00:01:48.149> up

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
two three four five we actually end up

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.510 
two three four five we actually end up
in<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> same<00:01:48.570> spot<00:01:48.780> either<00:01:49.110> way<00:01:49.350> alright<00:01:50.040> so

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
in the same spot either way alright so

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.370 
in the same spot either way alright so
at<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.240> point<00:01:51.479> i<00:01:51.659> would<00:01:51.720> say<00:01:51.810> arcade

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
at this point i would say arcade

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.289 
at this point i would say arcade

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
and my prediction just like that I

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.289 
and my prediction just like that I
didn't<00:03:05.439> watch<00:03:05.620> okay<00:03:06.189> my<00:03:06.340> back<00:03:06.579> was<00:03:06.790> turned<00:03:06.819> and
