00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
arguments a lot of people want to just

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.630 
arguments a lot of people want to just
ignore<00:03:22.260> them<00:03:22.440> but<00:03:23.010> if<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.190> ignore<00:03:23.609> a

ignore them but if you ignore a
counter-argument<00:03:24.390> then<00:03:25.079> your<00:03:25.440> paper<00:03:25.709> seems

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
counter-argument then your paper seems

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160 
counter-argument then your paper seems
weaker<00:03:26.609> because<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.060> feels<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.959> reader

that maybe you're not aware of some of
these<00:03:29.940> other<00:03:30.150> arguments<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:30.959> that's<00:03:31.440> why

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
these other arguments and that's why

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.650 
these other arguments and that's why
you're<00:03:31.950> not<00:03:32.130> addressing<00:03:32.910> them<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.269> it's<00:03:33.420> key

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
you're not addressing them so it's key

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.140 
you're not addressing them so it's key
to<00:03:33.690> identify<00:03:34.380> strong<00:03:34.920> counter<00:03:35.430> arguments<00:03:36.030> and

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
to identify strong counter arguments and

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.090 
to identify strong counter arguments and
then<00:03:36.720> present<00:03:37.170> them<00:03:37.380> at<00:03:37.590> in<00:03:37.980> your

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
then present them at in your

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.940 
then present them at in your
counterclaim<00:03:39.109> then<00:03:40.109> you<00:03:40.260> finish<00:03:40.590> your<00:03:40.739> paper

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
counterclaim then you finish your paper

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.099 
counterclaim then you finish your paper
and<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.250> have<00:03:41.370> an<00:03:41.459> opportunity<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:42.180> rebut<00:03:42.780> or

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
and you have an opportunity to rebut or

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.340 
and you have an opportunity to rebut or
to<00:03:43.799> address<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.760> counterclaim<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:46.200> is

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
to address that counterclaim and this is

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.690 
to address that counterclaim and this is
where<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.590> provide<00:03:46.950> evidence<00:03:47.489> and

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
where you provide evidence and

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.990 
where you provide evidence and
explanation<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.780> disproves<00:03:49.440> or<00:03:50.000> discredit

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
explanation that disproves or discredit

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.780 
explanation that disproves or discredit
or<00:03:51.329> weakens<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.290> counterclaim<00:03:52.950> in<00:03:53.280> some<00:03:53.609> way

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
or weakens the counterclaim in some way

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.849 
or weakens the counterclaim in some way
and<00:03:54.630> this<00:03:54.720> is<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.930> combination<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.680> both

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
and this is a combination of both

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.430 
and this is a combination of both
research<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.459> data<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.450> your<00:03:58.049> explanation

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
research and data and your explanation

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.759 
research and data and your explanation
so<00:03:59.340> this<00:03:59.609> again<00:03:59.989> similar<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.019> your<00:04:01.350> warrant

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
so this again similar to your warrant

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.009 
so this again similar to your warrant
might<00:04:02.220> be<00:04:02.430> one<00:04:02.700> sentence<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.390> might<00:04:03.569> be<00:04:03.750> three

might be one sentence it might be three

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.690 
might be one sentence it might be three

sentences you want to give yourself a

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.759 
sentences you want to give yourself a

I've left the labels up so you can

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.920 
I've left the labels up so you can
clearly<00:04:25.650> see<00:04:25.830> what<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.280> claim<00:04:26.580> is<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:27.240> data

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
clearly see what the claim is the data

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.810 
clearly see what the claim is the data
the<00:04:28.139> warrant<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.830> counterclaim<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.759> the

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
the warrant the counterclaim and the

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.330 
the warrant the counterclaim and the
rebuttal<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:31.050> this<00:04:31.199> this<00:04:31.590> example<00:04:31.800> reads

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
rebuttal so this this example reads

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.310

generally have a long lifespans so the

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.200

sound idea that should be encouraged it
is<00:05:03.389> not<00:05:03.570> feasible<00:05:03.840> in<00:05:04.199> many<00:05:04.380> rural<00:05:04.680> or

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
is not feasible in many rural or

thus<00:05:08.010> hybrid<00:05:08.490> cars<00:05:08.729> are<00:05:08.970> a<00:05:09.030> better<00:05:09.210> solution

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
thus hybrid cars are a better solution

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.469 
thus hybrid cars are a better solution
for<00:05:10.050> much<00:05:10.260> of<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.560> nation's<00:05:10.889> population<00:05:11.479> so

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
for much of the nation's population so

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.080 
for much of the nation's population so
in<00:05:12.690> this<00:05:12.840> example<00:05:13.199> it's<00:05:13.919> clear<00:05:14.520> that<00:05:14.699> the

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810

strategy because and here's the the data
most<00:05:26.520> cars<00:05:26.789> are<00:05:27.030> on<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.210> road<00:05:27.360> for<00:05:27.389> 12<00:05:28.020> to<00:05:28.169> 15

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
most cars are on the road for 12 to 15

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.560 
most cars are on the road for 12 to 15
years<00:05:28.740> so<00:05:29.009> the<00:05:29.220> car<00:05:29.430> you<00:05:29.580> choose<00:05:29.610> to<00:05:30.030> drive<00:05:30.210> has

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
years so the car you choose to drive has

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.600 
years so the car you choose to drive has
a<00:05:30.599> big<00:05:30.870> impact<00:05:31.229> over<00:05:31.650> the<00:05:31.800> space<00:05:32.039> of<00:05:32.250> that<00:05:32.340> time

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
a big impact over the space of that time

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.810 
a big impact over the space of that time

warrant<00:05:36.270> explains<00:05:36.900> that<00:05:37.199> because<00:05:37.410> cars<00:05:38.070> have

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
warrant explains that because cars have

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.950 
warrant explains that because cars have
this<00:05:38.460> long<00:05:38.639> lifespan<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.449> decision<00:05:39.810> to

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
this long lifespan the decision to

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.250 
this long lifespan the decision to
switch<00:05:40.349> has<00:05:40.860> a<00:05:40.889> long-term<00:05:41.250> positive<00:05:41.849> impact

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
switch has a long-term positive impact

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.100 
switch has a long-term positive impact
the<00:05:43.260> counterclaim<00:05:44.389> they<00:05:45.389> present<00:05:45.870> is

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
the counterclaim they present is

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.469 
the counterclaim they present is
basically<00:05:46.710> the<00:05:46.860> idea<00:05:47.130> that<00:05:47.370> you<00:05:47.970> know<00:05:48.090> hybrid

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
basically the idea that you know hybrid

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:49.909 
basically the idea that you know hybrid
cars<00:05:48.690> are<00:05:48.840> nice<00:05:49.020> but<00:05:49.320> really<00:05:49.380> what<00:05:49.800> we<00:05:49.889> should

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
cars are nice but really what we should

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.920 
cars are nice but really what we should

be doing as a society is shifting to
mass<00:05:52.500> transportation<00:05:53.280> so<00:05:53.960> railway<00:05:54.960> and<00:05:55.440> other

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
mass transportation so railway and other

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.600 
mass transportation so railway and other
you<00:05:56.400> know<00:05:56.630> Underground's<00:05:57.630> bus<00:05:58.560> lines<00:05:58.949> things

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610

that<00:05:59.849> get<00:05:59.940> lots<00:06:00.240> of<00:06:00.360> people<00:06:00.479> traveling

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
that get lots of people traveling

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.140 
that get lots of people traveling
together<00:06:01.560> and<00:06:02.010> kind<00:06:02.159> of<00:06:02.190> get<00:06:02.370> rid<00:06:02.550> of<00:06:02.580> this<00:06:02.760> car

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
together and kind of get rid of this car

culture that we have in the United
States<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:05.580> rebuttal<00:06:06.000> says<00:06:06.270> mass<00:06:06.960> transit<00:06:07.440> is

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
States the rebuttal says mass transit is

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.480 
States the rebuttal says mass transit is
a<00:06:07.560> great<00:06:07.949> idea

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
a great idea

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.600 
a great idea
very<00:06:08.820> 'mentally<00:06:09.810> sound<00:06:10.139> but<00:06:10.530> not<00:06:10.919> realistic

for<00:06:11.639> everyone<00:06:12.240> because<00:06:12.510> of<00:06:12.630> all<00:06:12.750> these

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
for everyone because of all these

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.320 
for everyone because of all these
different<00:06:12.930> examples<00:06:13.740> so<00:06:14.310> here<00:06:14.699> we<00:06:14.909> have<00:06:15.150> them

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
different examples so here we have them

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.689 
different examples so here we have them
following<00:06:15.780> the<00:06:16.500> different<00:06:17.070> steps<00:06:17.280> of<00:06:17.550> the

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
following the different steps of the

following the different steps of the
paragraph<00:06:18.150> and<00:06:19.110> maybe<00:06:19.860> it's<00:06:20.010> not<00:06:20.070> the

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
paragraph and maybe it's not the

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.820 
paragraph and maybe it's not the
strongest<00:06:20.610> example<00:06:21.270> that<00:06:21.690> that<00:06:21.960> is<00:06:22.380> out<00:06:22.560> there

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
strongest example that that is out there

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.500 
strongest example that that is out there
but<00:06:23.039> it's<00:06:23.159> a<00:06:23.250> good<00:06:23.550> it<00:06:23.820> kind<00:06:24.030> of<00:06:24.150> clearly

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
but it's a good it kind of clearly

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.029 
but it's a good it kind of clearly
identifies<00:06:25.139> all<00:06:25.349> the<00:06:25.380> different<00:06:25.710> parts<00:06:25.949> and

identifies all the different parts and

identifies all the different parts and
this<00:06:26.130> is<00:06:26.280> what<00:06:26.400> you<00:06:26.550> want<00:06:26.699> to<00:06:26.760> strive<00:06:27.000> for<00:06:27.030> in

this is what you want to strive for in
