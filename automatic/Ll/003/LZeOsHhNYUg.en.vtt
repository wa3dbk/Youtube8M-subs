it's just a brand new company actually

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.359 
it's just a brand new company actually
he's<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> collaboration<00:00:26.039> with<00:00:26.070> Street

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
he's a collaboration with Street

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.740 
he's a collaboration with Street
electronics<00:00:26.849> which<00:00:27.060> were<00:00:27.240> founded<00:00:27.630> in

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
electronics which were founded in

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.529 
electronics which were founded in
nineteen<00:00:27.869> eighty<00:00:28.260> five<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:29.099> LA<00:00:29.490> they<00:00:30.390> also

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
built the state border dragon for steven

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.510 
built the state border dragon for steven
slate<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> collaboration<00:00:35.040> backwards

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
slate so it's a collaboration backwards

you're using a daww and make it up day

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.860 
you're using a daww and make it up day
to<00:01:01.559> better<00:01:01.739> saturate<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.789> able<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.180> make

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
to better saturate it to be able to make

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.240 
to better saturate it to be able to make
it<00:01:03.930> sound<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.409> bit<00:01:04.439> larger<00:01:04.799> than<00:01:04.830> life<00:01:04.979> give<00:01:05.189> it

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
a console almost like a console sound

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.109 
a console almost like a console sound
like<00:01:07.049> an<00:01:07.140> analog<00:01:07.439> sound<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.159> also<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.970> got

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
like an analog sound and also it's got

fantastic the iBooks on it which I run

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.820 
fantastic the iBooks on it which I run
through<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> basic<00:01:12.840> premise<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.680> can

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
through so the basic premise is you can

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.420 
through so the basic premise is you can
switch<00:01:14.100> over<00:01:14.369> line<00:01:15.090> or<00:01:15.299> some<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:16.100> 2d<00:01:17.100> tops<00:01:17.340> in

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
switch over line or some as 2d tops in

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.450 
switch over line or some as 2d tops in
the<00:01:17.520> back<00:01:17.670> which<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:17.970> 16<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.450> 22<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:20.400> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the back which is 16 in 22 and if you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.890 
the back which is 16 in 22 and if you
sweets<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.790> line<00:01:20.939> level<00:01:21.119> these<00:01:21.390> front<00:01:21.600> panels

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
sweets in line level these front panels

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.630 
sweets in line level these front panels
become<00:01:22.200> active<00:01:22.500> now<00:01:22.650> what<00:01:22.860> happens<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
become active now what happens is the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.780 
become active now what happens is the
signal<00:01:24.180> path<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.570> thus<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.229> choose<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:26.520> we

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
signal path is thus you can choose if we

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.149 
signal path is thus you can choose if we

section now with fouls if you're hitting

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.870 
section now with fouls if you're hitting
something<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:01.079> very<00:02:01.229> hard<00:02:01.579> it's<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.670> lot<00:02:02.820> of

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
something very very hard it's a lot of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.160 
something very very hard it's a lot of
fits<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.240> top<00:02:03.390> end<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:03.750> we've<00:02:03.899> added<00:02:04.020> a

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
fits on the top end so we've added a

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.370 
fits on the top end so we've added a
high-pass<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.560> low-pass<00:02:04.770> filter<00:02:05.670> which<00:02:06.090> is

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
high-pass and low-pass filter which is

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.809 
high-pass and low-pass filter which is
dual<00:02:07.380> purpose<00:02:07.890> because<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.459> box<00:02:08.670> would<00:02:08.789> be

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
dual purpose because this box would be

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.740 
dual purpose because this box would be
used<00:02:09.060> for<00:02:09.209> mix<00:02:09.360> downs<00:02:09.599> as<00:02:09.810> well<00:02:09.959> as<00:02:10.080> tracking

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
used for mix downs as well as tracking

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.250 
used for mix downs as well as tracking
so<00:02:11.740> there's<00:02:12.220> some<00:02:12.580> really<00:02:12.730> good<00:02:13.260> actual

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
so there's some really good actual

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.440 
so there's some really good actual
filter<00:02:14.590> points<00:02:14.920> on<00:02:15.040> there<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.790> facilitate<00:02:15.940> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
filter points on there to facilitate the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.820 
filter points on there to facilitate the
whole<00:02:16.600> range<00:02:17.020> of<00:02:17.230> what<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.440> want<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.620> do<00:02:17.710> with

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
whole range of what you want to do with

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.320 
whole range of what you want to do with
it<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.340> say<00:02:18.520> for<00:02:18.550> example<00:02:18.700> you're<00:02:19.120> hitting<00:02:19.300> the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
it so say for example you're hitting the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.210 
it so say for example you're hitting the
stage<00:02:19.540> i'm<00:02:19.780> really<00:02:20.020> really<00:02:20.140> hard<00:02:20.410> you're<00:02:21.070> on<00:02:21.130> a

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
stage i'm really really hard you're on a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.910 
stage i'm really really hard you're on a

roll off at 5 kilohertz to stop with the

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.340 
roll off at 5 kilohertz to stop with the
fist<00:02:24.070> coming<00:02:24.280> in<00:02:24.490> so<00:02:25.420> that's<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.170> valve

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350

output trim which is a failure on the
console<00:03:15.519> fatally<00:03:15.910> shot<00:03:16.209> so<00:03:16.570> it's<00:03:16.660> completely

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
console fatally shot so it's completely

game<00:03:17.230> matchable<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.739> whole<00:03:17.860> way<00:03:17.980> around<00:03:18.070> now

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
game matchable the whole way around now

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.539 
game matchable the whole way around now
so<00:03:19.630> effectively<00:03:20.560> our<00:03:20.709> idea<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.160> if<00:03:21.430> you're

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
so effectively our idea is if you're

one<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:42.150> bypass<00:03:43.150> is<00:03:43.540> true<00:03:43.959> bypass<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.620> you

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
one the bypass is true bypass and you

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.039 
one the bypass is true bypass and you
anti-ban<00:03:45.340> relay<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.299> can<00:03:46.510> effectively<00:03:46.810> do

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
anti-ban relay so you can effectively do

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.350 
anti-ban relay so you can effectively do
a<00:03:47.079> daww<00:03:47.650> mix-a-lot<00:03:47.980> their<00:03:48.370> mix<00:03:48.549> and<00:03:48.790> just
