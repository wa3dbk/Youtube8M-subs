00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:08.150
 Well let's see if it cooks so good 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.880
 as they say the tools will send so much 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.950
 welcome to 3 gr as rich is you 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.660
 I'm going to test to see if it's so 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.249
 rich what are you doing today we are going to make a 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.169
 service but I want you to tell me which 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:20.779
 are the ingredients first good the 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:24.109
 ceviche that we are going to do today 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.779
 it's one of those things that one that will combine 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.089
 with pe with that the classic cebiches or 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.470
 the classic Peruvian la serva de nashville 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.489
 they know by there how is the Peruvian 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.670
 classic and it's basically onion fish 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.230
 cilantro lemon juice salt pepper salt 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.680
 or a little chili 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.559
 true from that idea I find 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.239
 another idea because this ceviche is going to 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.910
 accompany with bread let's make some 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.239
 ceviche tapas because ever 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.329
 I was in Lima eating breakfast and then yes I 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.339
 they passed bread fresh from the bakery or the 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.589
 that king then they say to me good here the 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.499
 Sunday breakfast with ceviche 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.820
 Ceviche at 8 o'clock in the morning 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:09.640

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.340
 Of course I said good that he will know the bread with 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.770
 the ceviche then I made a sandwich of 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.380
 Ceviche slipping from ceviche came out the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.660
 ceviche tapa because we were going to do 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.640
 then you have the bread here for 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.800
 make the capita that said man stan 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.160
 France is French bread we can use 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.229
 french bread artisan bread a few already 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.470
 breads that are not too spicy for 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.110
 that do not steal the spotlight to be of 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.380
 this type 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.899
 this is low mass pangasius is a fish 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.130
 of vietnam that is commercialized a lot in 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.660
 MedellÃ­n we can also see it with 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.479
 Snook with tilapia with snapper if we want 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.020
 they also give ok then let's start 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.970
 to do already 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.119
 the purple onion we are going to do it in 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.740
 squares 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.690
 we quickly see that he has no problems 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.910
 with this to handle the knife since 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.320
 was cut 5 should speak and handle 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.330
 well that takes a lot of study to 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.090
 get to that please do not do it in the 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:19.090
 This can only be done by people 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:22.330
 because if they do not come with the rich here already 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.610
 Lucero is renting the qualities 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.280
 they started to work very well enough 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.980
 pretty lemon lemon will be left marinating 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.650

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.810
 minutes is 10 up is true 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.700
 but it's not a long time either 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.650
 you need because if you do not get rid of 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.069
 fish though now that we're going to do 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.970
 let's add passion fruit juice 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:51.480
 It looks a bit thick and it is a pulp 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.480

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.560

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.270
 We want to recommend something very rich and 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:24.520

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.250

 there is little and burning dream 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.340

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.280
