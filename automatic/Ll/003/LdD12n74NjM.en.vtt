before you run away sing o Sauron I
remember<00:00:09.260> them<00:00:09.410> they<00:00:09.590> were<00:00:09.650> quite<00:00:10.100> a<00:00:10.130> crappy

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
remember them they were quite a crappy

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.080 
remember them they were quite a crappy
CPU<00:00:11.120> yes<00:00:11.780> they<00:00:12.019> wear<00:00:12.290> but<00:00:13.040> that<00:00:13.099> was<00:00:13.519> 10<00:00:13.880> years

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
CPU yes they wear but that was 10 years

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.839 
CPU yes they wear but that was 10 years
ago<00:00:14.240> and<00:00:14.599> now<00:00:14.720> they<00:00:15.139> changed<00:00:15.710> they<00:00:16.429> are<00:00:16.490> quite

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:16.849 
ago and now they changed they are quite

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.450 
ago and now they changed they are quite
reliable<00:00:17.060> they<00:00:17.839> run<00:00:18.079> very<00:00:18.109> cool<00:00:18.769> they<00:00:19.009> perform

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
reliable they run very cool they perform

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.109 
reliable they run very cool they perform
well<00:00:19.759> and<00:00:20.029> they<00:00:20.779> have<00:00:20.929> nice<00:00:21.199> integrated<00:00:22.119> GPU

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
well and they have nice integrated GPU

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.329 
well and they have nice integrated GPU
and<00:00:23.509> yeah<00:00:23.779> they're<00:00:24.409> just<00:00:24.679> bang<00:00:25.009> for<00:00:25.249> the<00:00:25.310> buck

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:25.339 
and yeah they're just bang for the buck

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.749 
and yeah they're just bang for the buck
so<00:00:26.119> if<00:00:26.390> you<00:00:26.569> need<00:00:27.050> a<00:00:27.079> simple<00:00:27.499> PC<00:00:28.130> like<00:00:28.339> I<00:00:28.550> have

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
so if you need a simple PC like I have

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.059 
so if you need a simple PC like I have
here<00:00:29.119> so<00:00:29.300> I<00:00:29.359> have<00:00:29.449> a<00:00:29.509> case<00:00:29.839> which<00:00:30.499> is<00:00:30.649> a<00:00:30.679> budget

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:31.069 
here so I have a case which is a budget

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:33.160 
here so I have a case which is a budget
case<00:00:31.249> budgets<00:00:31.849> power<00:00:32.180> supply<00:00:32.539> and<00:00:32.780> budget

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
case budgets power supply and budget

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.380 
case budgets power supply and budget
motherboard<00:00:33.710> all<00:00:34.129> of<00:00:34.489> them<00:00:34.640> are<00:00:34.789> reliable

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
motherboard all of them are reliable

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.869 
motherboard all of them are reliable
pieces<00:00:35.899> of<00:00:36.050> equipment<00:00:36.260> and<00:00:36.739> quite<00:00:37.309> good<00:00:37.609> for

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
pieces of equipment and quite good for

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.259 
pieces of equipment and quite good for
the<00:00:38.030> price<00:00:38.269> so<00:00:39.079> I<00:00:39.379> thought<00:00:39.620> why<00:00:39.890> not<00:00:40.239> buy<00:00:41.239> a

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
the price so I thought why not buy a

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.060 
the price so I thought why not buy a
surround<00:00:42.019> CPU<00:00:42.699> so<00:00:43.699> yeah<00:00:43.850> that's<00:00:44.179> one<00:00:44.449> now<00:00:45.070> in

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
surround CPU so yeah that's one now in

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.689 
surround CPU so yeah that's one now in
terms<00:00:46.399> of<00:00:46.609> the<00:00:46.760> desktop<00:00:47.359> CPUs<00:00:48.170> for<00:00:48.800> work<00:00:49.070> study

and<00:00:50.120> little<00:00:50.449> bit<00:00:50.570> of<00:00:50.690> play<00:00:51.129> it's<00:00:52.129> it's<00:00:52.429> pretty

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
and little bit of play it's it's pretty

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.029 
and little bit of play it's it's pretty
much<00:00:52.910> on<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.449> lowest<00:00:54.019> bracket<00:00:54.260> above<00:00:54.890> it

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
much on the lowest bracket above it

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.660 
much on the lowest bracket above it
would<00:00:55.309> be<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:56.589> Intel<00:00:57.589> pension<00:00:58.100> if<00:00:58.280> I'm<00:00:58.519> not

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
would be the Intel pension if I'm not

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.619 
would be the Intel pension if I'm not
mistaken<00:00:59.739> above<00:01:00.739> that<00:01:00.890> would<00:01:01.129> be<00:01:01.280> i3<00:01:01.820> i5<00:01:02.329> and

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
mistaken above that would be i3 i5 and

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.950 
mistaken above that would be i3 i5 and
obviously<00:01:02.929> i7<00:01:03.710> now<00:01:04.310> I<00:01:04.340> 3<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.090> i-5<00:01:05.450> probably

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.750 
lagging behind just under the Pentium
however<00:01:12.110> it's<00:01:12.350> not<00:01:12.560> that<00:01:12.860> far<00:01:13.160> behind<00:01:13.400> like

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
however it's not that far behind like

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.150 
however it's not that far behind like
for<00:01:13.970> instance<00:01:14.060> compared<00:01:14.630> this<00:01:14.840> with<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.620> i3

okay<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.590> let's<00:02:23.340> open<00:02:23.430> up<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.790> box<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.150> see

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
okay so let's open up the box and see

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.460 
okay so let's open up the box and see
what's<00:02:24.540> inside

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.500 

alright<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.910> obviously<00:02:30.200> inside<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.560> box

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
alright so obviously inside of the box

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.890 
alright so obviously inside of the box
supposed<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.720> be<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:34.460> CPU<00:02:35.460> obviously<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:37.380> fan

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
supposed to be a CPU obviously and a fan

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.830 
supposed to be a CPU obviously and a fan
or<00:02:39.900> basically<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:41.090> heatsink<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.630> fan<00:02:42.810> I

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
or basically a heatsink and the fan I

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.440 
or basically a heatsink and the fan I
should<00:02:43.170> say<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:44.040> that's<00:02:44.670> all<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.209> really

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
should say and that's all you really

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.710 
should say and that's all you really
need<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.020> for<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.440> CPU<00:02:46.980> because<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:47.790> on

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
need and for this CPU because it's so on

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.510 
need and for this CPU because it's so on
washes<00:02:49.910> any<00:02:50.910> pretty<00:02:51.390> much<00:02:51.650> active<00:02:52.650> cooling

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
washes any pretty much active cooling

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.490 
washes any pretty much active cooling
will<00:02:53.970> do<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.540> especially<00:02:54.840> since<00:02:55.260> you're<00:02:55.410> not

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
will do and especially since you're not

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.400 
will do and especially since you're not
going<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.890> overclock<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.959> have<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.110> nice

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
going to overclock it so you have a nice

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.710 
going to overclock it so you have a nice

to<00:03:04.200> put<00:03:04.380> on<00:03:04.470> my<00:03:04.500> case<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:04.950> certainly<00:03:05.430> will<00:03:05.730> along

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
to put on my case I certainly will along

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.820 
to put on my case I certainly will along
with<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.959> ASUS<00:03:07.590> motherboards<00:03:08.280> logo<00:03:08.959> then<00:03:09.959> you

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
with the ASUS motherboards logo then you

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.080 
with the ASUS motherboards logo then you
have<00:03:11.040> standard<00:03:12.000> Intel<00:03:12.330> heatsink

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
have standard Intel heatsink

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.460 
have standard Intel heatsink
identical<00:03:15.090> one<00:03:15.300> comes<00:03:15.630> with<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.959> i3<00:03:16.350> and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
identical one comes with the i3 and

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.780 
identical one comes with the i3 and
probably<00:03:17.010> i-5<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:18.660> think<00:03:19.350> identical<00:03:19.920> yeah<00:03:20.100> so

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
probably i-5 I think identical yeah so

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.509 
probably i-5 I think identical yeah so
it<00:03:20.910> has<00:03:21.090> some<00:03:21.450> aluminum<00:03:22.110> fins<00:03:22.410> thermal<00:03:23.310> place

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
it has some aluminum fins thermal place

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.340 
it has some aluminum fins thermal place
pre-applied<00:03:24.180> which<00:03:24.570> actually<00:03:25.140> works

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
pre-applied which actually works

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
pre-applied which actually works
surprisingly<00:03:25.530> well<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:27.150> have<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:28.370> four

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
surprisingly well and you have a four

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.550 
surprisingly well and you have a four
pin<00:03:29.670> connector<00:03:30.420> there<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:30.989> monitors<00:03:31.530> your

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
pin connector there so it monitors your

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.830 
pin connector there so it monitors your
temperature<00:03:32.250> speed<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:32.730> timing<00:03:32.970> things<00:03:33.630> like

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
temperature speed and timing things like

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.539 
temperature speed and timing things like
that<00:03:34.049> well<00:03:34.230> maybe<00:03:34.680> not<00:03:34.860> temperature<00:03:35.220> speed

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
that well maybe not temperature speed

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.880 
that well maybe not temperature speed
and<00:03:35.790> things<00:03:35.940> like<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:37.019> obviously<00:03:37.470> other

you have a CPU and it's LGA 1155 don't

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.610 
you have a CPU and it's LGA 1155 don't
