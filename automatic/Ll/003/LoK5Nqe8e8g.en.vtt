 hello girls here we are with the appointment

 of the ever beauty box I will show you 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.880
 what we found in the mythical 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.120
 box, however, of two previous months or 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.200
 that of May if I'm not mistaken is that 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.000
 on June 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.279
 because I didn't make beef 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.279
 because there were really very few 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.650
 products as you will see and not me 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.480
 liked for nothing then it goes well e 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.779
 so if he goes he has taken advantage of it since 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.019
 they were really 34 little crosses 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.340
 I said ok we do together with 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.100
 also that of the previous month 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.930
 as you know boxing always comes to me 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.540
 white from the company this is that of the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.350
 May month of boxing mind that is 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.980
 birthday for Della's birthday 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.230
 never screw bot 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.559
 the first products found are these here 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.480
 which are two are practically gods 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.590
 minitalia and the oréal brand is gods 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.129
 hair products 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.840
 one is an oil you know the oil for 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:04.710
 hair to put on maybe wet for 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.500
 do the styling are 45 ml and others are 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.900
 of the bards and a bassano to make them 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.760
 sparkling sparkling seasoning from 45 to 75ml 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.799
 as you can see I haven't really opened it 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.680
 because you know that I do n't know bad for i 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.049
 hair use other types of products 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.869
 I think but I think aside because I would like 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.880
 do some sort of rest stop but 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.260
 I'm keeping all of the products we say 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.990
 because I would like to do some 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.760
 let's say for you a little bit up 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.000
 instagram a bit on facebook if that 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.150
 I can even here on youtube maybe 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.830
 hidden because in short I never know with i 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.260
 contests how it works here on youtube 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.940
 so I want to do some little thoughts maybe 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.790
 also hidden in the videos so i'm 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.670
 putting Beijing aside then let's see 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.740
 what what must escort here we have 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.410
 a sample of the fluid cream for the 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.980
 body of the arangara arangara brand is 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.620
 so a made in italy eco bio brand is 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.930
 an eco-organic body cream though 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.700
 we had already found me previously 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.280
 remember I had already used the 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.490
 last summer he hadn't done me 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.130
 sincerely go crazy though this e 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.140
 then with lemon moines plus peach 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.020
 maybe I will probably like it better 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.360
 because it is cooler and summery a 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.570
 sample of a tail product there 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.150
 which is therefore a product for legs 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.190
 color for legs this is the only one 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.239
 product that intrigued me about this 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.010
 box that is is not a self-tanner is 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.520
 a colored cream for the legs 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.950
 here to put maybe that occasion 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.900
 that you want to go out maybe tools 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.000
 works on the legs 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.269
 canavesi that with my maybe you 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.610
 put this here and you have some color 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.830
 here, however, with the water series is removed 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.739
 away it is not a tanning action and then 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.190
 sandro mini mini sample of this one 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:05.050
 here that the garnier miracle skin of a 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:09.140
 face cream and finally sample of 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.780
 this scent of tail up there all music i 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.300
 products that intrigued me boston 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.450
 these two tail products there though how 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.520
 you saw nothing interesting 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.970
 according to me it means think me 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.440
 while weight is this month's 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.930
 let's say this is slightly more 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.690
 nice as a box I'll show you then 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.950
 immediately the products strong pieces these two 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.680
 enamels of mavalà 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.860
 here they are very cute 1 on the viola 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.410
 on i did it they made mistakes 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.640
 part in changes of collections 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.790
 past summer precedents of 2012 o 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.020
 2013 in short, facebook 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.210
 one is the number 174 purple sensation that 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.360
 it is this purple and unfortunately not exactly 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.740
 you will find around in stores because 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.380
 in fact they are limited editions 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.300
 past I like the fact that they put 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.560
 must something that is not found anyway 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.720
 around or in any case editions 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.470
 limited as that glaze had happened 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.770
 of them if you remember in the previous box 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.140
 and just because it's nice anyway 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.430
 find something in any case 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:24.420
 limited that may not be around 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.980
 and if you will certainly see me anyway 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.070
 you will surely see him wearing because 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.310
 you know that I in lilac and violet and then 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.820
 number 170 touch of provence tests for 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.400
 this a little bit that on the cute lilac 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.450
 however the enamels but mavalà cost 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.880
 approximately 5 euros 5 euros and 20 then one 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:50.100
 full size of a cream soap 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:53.190
 brand germain friends however one creates 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.230
 a bar of soap let's say that it always does 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.820
 also useful for washing hands for 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:02.430
 wash your feet so I still don't have it 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:07.190
 open as it is always useful 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:10.050
 we have this wax roll on top 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.980
 there is written liposoluble of the brand 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:18.390
 cruises has the cherry as an idea is 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.340
 nice though how to use the same name 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.580
 used such a product because 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.120
 I always use cold waxing and this 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.229
 not having the role 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.260
 I don't know how you can use size from 2 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:34.389
 euro and 40 in short let me know if 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.570
 you know how you only use it 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.360
 dissolve in some way and finally a 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.530
 product that left me a little 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:48.310
 perplexed or this integrator 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:51.100
 food of the brand balances for the 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:56.380
 bowel regularity or are gods 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:58.810
 so similar loaves of sugar cubes 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.750
 because they are hard they melt it 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.539
 they should melt a tea juice 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:08.260
 fruit etc. 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:11.880
 as it is not bad in the sense as the friend b 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:16.600
 may not even like it though 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.970
 bowel regularity does not make me 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.419
 going crazy let's say I would have preferred to know that 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.100
 the balance also makes herbal teas 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.960
 draining herbal teas here I would have preferred 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.660
 since we are also in the summer period 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.330
 of the herbal teas maybe trembling I am 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:34.720
 using an herbal tea that suits me 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.789
 enjoying a lot of angelica for 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.770
 deflate the belly and I am enjoying a 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:41.410
 I would also like to take herbal teas 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.860
 brena I would have preferred you maybe those 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:53.260
 rather intestinal regularity 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:55.690
 these are the ingredients that end 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.630
 we have a cappuccino of balance and 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.130
 this is the famous aloe income gel 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.169
 here some balance does not like for 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.199
 charity is useful because in any case elements 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:07.599
 you put a sample in the 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:09.490
 clutch bag and always a profit is good 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:10.900
 because I use it for a lot of things 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.150
 here are all the uses 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.580
 however I think I am 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.590
 the only one on youtube that you don't like 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.430
 of Italy of the balance because epic 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.490
 koso and I do not like healthy I like it 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.410
 the smell is 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.090
 in short I am using another type a 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.569
 the other already the deal is much much more 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:31.880
 valid of which I will speak to you later 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:33.470
 so these were the products in the end 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.080
 this month 's only interesting thing 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:39.800
 were the magolà enamels for the 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.660
 I remain nothing transcendental 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.759
 let me know what you think of 

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.750
 these two boxes and we'll see each other at 

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:46.870
 next 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.870
 Hello
