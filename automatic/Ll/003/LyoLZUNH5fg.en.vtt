00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
is there a certain mental approach that

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.490 
is there a certain mental approach that
you<00:02:27.680> have<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:27.980> training<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.730> specifically

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
you have to training and to specifically

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.809 
you have to training and to specifically
working<00:02:30.500> in<00:02:30.739> competition<00:02:31.280> running<00:02:31.760> in

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
working in competition running in

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.089 
working in competition running in
competition<00:02:33.550> well<00:02:34.550> tell<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.180> truth

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
competition well tell the truth

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.720 
competition well tell the truth
the<00:02:37.099> subconscious<00:02:37.630> approaches<00:02:38.630> is<00:02:39.370> much<00:02:40.370> more

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
the subconscious approaches is much more

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.470 
the subconscious approaches is much more
effective<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.720> it<00:02:41.870> actually<00:02:42.260> goes<00:02:42.970> along<00:02:43.970> a

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
effective and it actually goes along a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.840 
effective and it actually goes along a
much<00:02:44.989> longer<00:02:45.380> way<00:02:45.500> than<00:02:45.769> conscious<00:02:46.280> when<00:02:46.580> by

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
much longer way than conscious when by

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.309 
much longer way than conscious when by
the<00:02:46.910> time<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.269> get<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.450> competition<00:02:48.170> you

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
the time you get to competition you

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.259 
the time you get to competition you
really<00:02:48.560> not<00:02:48.709> thinking<00:02:49.400> very<00:02:49.640> much<00:02:50.000> anymore

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
really not thinking very much anymore

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.449 
really not thinking very much anymore
because<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.500> by<00:02:51.709> then<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.160> should<00:02:52.340> have

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
because you by then you should have

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.220 
because you by then you should have
habituated<00:02:53.239> everything<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.840> need<00:02:54.049> to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
do and make it a subconscious reaction

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.199 
do and make it a subconscious reaction
in<00:02:56.900> competition<00:02:57.590> so<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.849> if<00:02:58.940> you're<00:02:59.060> gonna

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
in competition so and if you're gonna

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.059 
in competition so and if you're gonna
think<00:02:59.360> about<00:02:59.720> it<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.230> that's<00:03:00.860> what<00:03:01.010> you're

think about it and that's what you're
doing<00:03:01.130> training<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.989> think<00:03:02.989> in<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.560> repetitive

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
doing training you think in a repetitive

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.650 
doing training you think in a repetitive
fashion<00:03:05.349> to<00:03:06.349> do<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.730> right<00:03:07.910> things<00:03:08.239> in<00:03:08.480> other

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
to think about it anymore then you just

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.360 
to think about it anymore then you just
do<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.209> subconsciously<00:03:18.010> but<00:03:19.010> at<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.220> same

give to other athletes who want to

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.379 
give to other athletes who want to
improve<00:03:44.569> their<00:03:44.630> sprinter<00:03:45.200> oh<00:03:46.389> yeah

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
improve their sprinter oh yeah

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.370 
improve their sprinter oh yeah
definitely<00:03:47.620> three<00:03:48.620> things<00:03:49.720> stride<00:03:50.720> length<00:03:51.109> or

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
definitely three things stride length or

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.340 
definitely three things stride length or
how<00:03:52.340> far<00:03:52.549> apart<00:03:52.700> your<00:03:53.120> your<00:03:53.540> feet<00:03:53.840> land<00:03:54.109> when

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
how far apart your your feet land when

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.910 
how far apart your your feet land when
you<00:03:54.500> run<00:03:54.709> in<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:56.139> morning<00:03:57.139> I've<00:03:57.290> used<00:03:57.530> both<00:03:57.709> an

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
you run in and morning I've used both an

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.890 
you run in and morning I've used both an
example<00:03:58.430> because<00:03:58.700> he's<00:03:58.850> mastered<00:03:59.510> all<00:03:59.630> three

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
example because he's mastered all three

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.650 
example because he's mastered all three
and<00:04:00.230> because<00:04:00.889> he's<00:04:01.040> long<00:04:01.340> six<00:04:01.760> five<00:04:02.000> like<00:04:02.299> I<00:04:02.480> am

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
and because he's long six five like I am

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.110 
and because he's long six five like I am
course<00:04:03.530> his<00:04:04.069> feet<00:04:04.340> are<00:04:04.519> going<00:04:04.639> much<00:04:04.910> further

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
course his feet are going much further

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.000 
course his feet are going much further
apart<00:04:05.299> when<00:04:05.630> you<00:04:05.660> step<00:04:05.989> in<00:04:06.170> and<00:04:06.319> I<00:04:06.500> fall<00:04:06.829> so

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
apart when you step in and I fall so

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.729 
apart when you step in and I fall so
even<00:04:07.310> longer<00:04:07.549> with<00:04:07.880> momentum<00:04:08.569> with<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:08.930> Ryan

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
even longer with momentum with that Ryan

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.530 
even longer with momentum with that Ryan
you<00:04:10.190> know<00:04:10.220> 28<00:04:10.850> miles<00:04:11.030> an<00:04:11.209> hour

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
you know 28 miles an hour

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.059 
you know 28 miles an hour
of<00:04:11.720> course<00:04:11.989> these<00:04:12.200> feats<00:04:12.470> are<00:04:12.650> going<00:04:12.799> even

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
of course these feats are going even

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.399 
of course these feats are going even
longer<00:04:13.280> then<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.329> next<00:04:14.569> thing<00:04:14.720> stride

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.409 
longer then the next thing stride

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.199

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
frequency we call it turnover basically

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.849 
frequency we call it turnover basically
just<00:04:20.479> how<00:04:20.720> fast<00:04:21.019> your<00:04:21.200> feets<00:04:21.440> are<00:04:21.590> turning

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
just how fast your feets are turning

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.920 
just how fast your feets are turning
over<00:04:21.950> a<00:04:22.360> minute<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:23.510> then

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
over a minute and then

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.670 
over a minute and then
the<00:04:24.020> same<00:04:24.229> time<00:04:25.750> groan<00:04:26.750> contact<00:04:27.289> time<00:04:27.470> how

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
the same time groan contact time how

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.370

long your feet is staying on the ground

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.950 
long your feet is staying on the ground
is<00:04:30.380> an<00:04:30.590> important<00:04:30.979> factor<00:04:31.539> and<00:04:32.539> then<00:04:32.660> after

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
is an important factor and then after

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.659 
is an important factor and then after
that<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:33.259> add<00:04:33.410> some<00:04:33.440> other<00:04:33.800> factors<00:04:34.310> into<00:04:34.550> it

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
that you add some other factors into it

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.460 
that you add some other factors into it
but<00:04:34.850> those<00:04:35.090> predominant<00:04:35.810> once<00:04:35.990> you<00:04:36.080> master

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
but those predominant once you master

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.010 
but those predominant once you master
those<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:37.370> gets<00:04:37.789> you<00:04:38.120> get<00:04:38.300> pretty<00:04:38.570> interesting

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
those it gets you get pretty interesting

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.980 
those it gets you get pretty interesting
but<00:04:39.199> and<00:04:40.190> some<00:04:40.430> people<00:04:40.669> try<00:04:40.789> to<00:04:40.820> do<00:04:41.030> stride

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
but and some people try to do stride

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.659 
but and some people try to do stride
frequency<00:04:42.560> first<00:04:42.860> in<00:04:43.160> other<00:04:43.280> words<00:04:43.460> try<00:04:43.610> to

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
frequency first in other words try to

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.840 
frequency first in other words try to

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
run fast first turning over but if they

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.490 
run fast first turning over but if they
don't<00:04:47.060> have<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.330> length<00:04:47.600> into<00:04:48.020> it<00:04:48.169> then

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
don't have the length into it then

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.930 
don't have the length into it then
they're<00:04:48.860> kind<00:04:49.070> of<00:04:49.160> like<00:04:49.280> on<00:04:49.550> a<00:04:49.610> treadmill

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
they're kind of like on a treadmill

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.900 
they're kind of like on a treadmill
you're<00:04:50.240> running<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:51.430> you<00:04:52.430> look<00:04:52.580> like<00:04:52.729> you're

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
you're running and you look like you're

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.100 
you're running and you look like you're
moving<00:04:53.030> fast<00:04:53.509> but<00:04:53.660> you're<00:04:53.840> not<00:04:53.930> really

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
moving fast but you're not really

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.460 
moving fast but you're not really
covering<00:04:54.650> much<00:04:54.830> ground<00:04:55.250> and<00:04:56.139> we<00:04:57.139> have<00:04:57.320> that

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
covering much ground and we have that

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.620 
covering much ground and we have that
also<00:04:58.099> during<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.610> acceleration<00:04:59.419> phase

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
also during the acceleration phase

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.360 
also during the acceleration phase
coming<00:05:00.020> all<00:05:00.199> the<00:05:00.289> blocks<00:05:00.530> you<00:05:00.740> have<00:05:00.919> way<00:05:01.070> cold

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
coming all the blocks you have way cold

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.900 
coming all the blocks you have way cold
now<00:05:02.210> ground<00:05:02.630> coverage<00:05:03.160> but<00:05:04.160> it's<00:05:04.280> it's<00:05:04.610> pretty

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
now ground coverage but it's it's pretty

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.460 
now ground coverage but it's it's pretty
technical<00:05:05.150> it's<00:05:05.599> much<00:05:05.780> more<00:05:05.930> technical<00:05:06.320> and

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
technical it's much more technical and

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.650 
technical it's much more technical and
it<00:05:06.560> seems<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.039> they've<00:05:07.490> done<00:05:07.639> a<00:05:07.699> good<00:05:08.000> job<00:05:08.060> in

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
it seems and they've done a good job in

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.379 
it seems and they've done a good job in
Jamaica<00:05:08.990> and<00:05:09.259> in<00:05:10.190> terms<00:05:10.490> of<00:05:10.610> learning<00:05:10.849> from
