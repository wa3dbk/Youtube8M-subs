00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Did you ever receive a call from someone? 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.899
 when I was thinking about this person 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.889
 if yes how would you explain this link 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.719
 spiritual telepathy coincidence for 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.429
 analyzing this kind of situation is worth 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.059
 It is worthwhile to know something about the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.059
 confirmation 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.410
 Hey 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.530
 the confirmation bias is a propensity 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.270
 automatic noting to seek to give greater 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.740
 importance and remember more 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.640
 information consistent with their 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.989
 beliefs 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.880
 If you've already seen our video about 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.560
 reasoned reasoning may be 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.510
 Wondering the difference between coming 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.760
 confirmation and the motivated killer 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.800
 with this motivated fate is a trend 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.360
 to be less rigorous when assessing the 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.910
 information consistent with our 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.770
 beliefs and critics when evaluating 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.670
 information inconsistent with our 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.680
 beliefs 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.720
 the difference is in the processes 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.970
 cognitive processes involved in each 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.260
 The first is a bias in attention and 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.680
 memory 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.899
 the second is a bias in reasoning bias 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.330
 of confirmation is our mental sieve 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.100
 to understand this metaphor let's think 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.810
 the following if you make a juice of 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.550
 orange does not like bagasse 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.850
 you put a sieve on top of the jar and 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.550
 games juice the juice passes the bag stays in the 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.950
 sieve information we like are 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.830
 like juice information we do not like 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.660
 are the bagasse returning the example of 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.509
 beginning of the video if you believe in 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.280
 mental powers will 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.200
 remind you more easily of occasions in 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.810
 What were you thinking of someone and 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.850
 this caller soon after but 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.709
 You probably do not remember the many 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.170
 other times on which you were 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.940
 thinking about this person and she did not call and 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.100
 neither of the times she had a goal and you 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.539
 I was not thinking about her because 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.560
 are contradictory evidence 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.209
 your beliefs 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.160
 the hypothesis that people provide 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.840
 more attention and give more importance to 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.750
 information favorable to their beliefs 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.550
 was tested in several surveys by 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.890
 For example, people with depression who 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.990
 believe to be a failure in the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.849
 importance and remember more easily 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.709
 situations in which they have failed 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:07.929
 than situations in which they obtained 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.429
 success 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.920
 this can lead to a vicious cycle 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.690
 that worsens the picture because their minds 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.240
 more and more evidence 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.640
 corroborate their negative beliefs ignored 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.349
 evidence that does not corroborate the problem 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.970
 of the confirmation bias is that it can 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.370
 distort our perception of things 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.230
 lead us to make mistaken decisions and 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.110
 produce unfair trials 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.760
 even at a political and economic level 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.500
 so be careful not to lend 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.480
 attention only to what has already confirmed 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.920
 points of view as this can lead to 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.599
 make mistakes 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.599
