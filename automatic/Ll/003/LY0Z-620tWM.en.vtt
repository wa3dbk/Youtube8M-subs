can't<00:02:46.620> underestimate<00:02:46.889> the<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.639> enormous

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
can't underestimate the the enormous

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.740 
can't underestimate the the enormous

leap of faith that they had to take to

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.809 
leap of faith that they had to take to
say<00:02:51.930> look<00:02:52.409> what<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:52.769> seems<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.099> bit<00:02:53.220> weird<00:02:53.459> if

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
say look what this seems a bit weird if

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.449

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
half barbecue its cost a lot of money

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.770
