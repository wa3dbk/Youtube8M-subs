00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.060
 sure that brewer jesus and yes I am 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.800
 completely because there is no doubt about 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.310
 to have when we love something 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.260
 must be proud 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.390
 and I'm proud of it I'm proud 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.980
 to be a jay reatard from the series of 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.560
 the yes state that goes to disney channel 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.510
 that I discovered by doing 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.890
 a baby sitting and so about a 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.719
 little girl and who looks violetta and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.040
 I like to watch together and the promo 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.870
 phone I saw them I had like a 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.090
 love at first sight for the series it's a 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.710
 it's a little silly to say that but it's true 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.829
 songs are already found this is the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.460
 first thing that touched me I know 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.000
 I do not have the first jean song 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.600
 twisted it was tight corn seed and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.660
 I think that's what really made me 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.790
 something and I decided to 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.120
 discover more where I looked on 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.560
 youtube songs episodes and 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.640
 then I try to catch up with the whole 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.840
 week I was late for all 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.700
 the seasons the first season and the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.610
 start of season 2 yes because he 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.020
 was not a fan since the beginning I admit 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.910
 but that does not stop and that now 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.040
 I really really really 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.930
 really very fun and silence actors 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.880
 so yes now it's really 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.950
 javaugues I will keep this little 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.960
 jada girl i watched violetta with 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.490
 she because I have a vision 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.410
 different from the movie of the difference 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.470
 of age but really it's something 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.149
 of extraordinary a moment to share the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.479
 vision of less than me and so we 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.250
 share it now it's a bit 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.310
 became an obsession advantage then 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.690
 you since thiago I put on youtube 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.039
 eg watching his videos I 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.990
 watching his concerts I'm going to learn 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.240
 these junctions and learn to sing them 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.130
 but if I do not like it anyway and 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.939
 I try to play them on the guitar at 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.740
 singing and piano evidence she 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.610
 train and when I have mild weather 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.030
 that's what I do because I like 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.090
 a lot 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.649
 and that reminds me of the series that 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.470
 I love songs as much music this 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.650
 that will make you feel every time and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.400
 every time I feel much better 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.660
 that's it now I wake up 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.220
 morning 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.690
 right now my alarm clock is great 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.060
 creative here and I dreamed of good 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.640
 mood where you have to go to class I'm 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:38.190
 wake up with jade and not the others and 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.260
 all the time I made my stick and I 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.300
 also do something to say no 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.860
 but I spend my life I was are you 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.350
 in toy stores games there you 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.910
 also to say that I shot a lot 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.530
 around objects of violetta 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.870
 it was a little girls thing it's 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.980
 just we're going to have violetta it's 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.940
 true when you see something that 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.560
 you like it's a bit like 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.140
 you belong not even time but you 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.880
 are proud even if you are alone 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.980
 my support I am only friends and so 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.030
 here I see myself a little short wait to 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.100
 I always watch everything I want 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.150
 game objects the state but it is there 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.500
 here I do it when I 'm all 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.540
 young if I go to see I'm smiling I'm doing 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.830
 the turn I watch I am having fun and I am 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.330
 go and I'm happy just because 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.240
 here I saw something it's like 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.890
 if I had seen but my masterpiece 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.570
 somewhere and I'm very proud of it 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.790
 does it even if it's not me 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.060
 I'm proud of this water of success 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.730
 of their talent they were really going 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.330
 really far and that it forces me is 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.130
 really proud sasson embarrassment 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.170
 even they are there timmy younger than 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.880
 me for example there I have my little sister 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.860
 but do not like a little sister 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.240
 because she's so big of 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.890
 see his talent and yes it's a little 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.140
 cliche to say that but it's true she 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.230
 and I'm really expecting this extremely 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.230
 really someone beautiful hyper 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.910
 talented players to power it 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.360
 to say that in front and that's why 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.930
 I have this video today 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.750
 try to win this meeting with the 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.950
 troop and see her in concert because 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.540
 that I never had the opportunity to see her 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.760
 in concert 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.080
 unfortunately apart on youtube and 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.340
 I would really really really 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.540
 see since I knew that she leads in 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.160
 France I sought all the means 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.840
 possible to have it all you have 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.030
 searched what day to meet him the 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.530
 to and I admit for now it's not 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.520
 still that 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.260
 that's the same, if I'd really like 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.209
 really really meet and because 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.620
 that it's really the dream of a lifetime 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.500
 even though it's true that it's not all 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.930
 my life since I will meet 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.669
 discovered not too long ago and 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.980
 I know I even want to 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.620
 congratulate to congratulate them for telling them 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:36.240
 how much I love them and in Spain 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.310
 is of course and that's what all 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.090
 what they brought me joy that 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.140
 their songs provides daily 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.150
 the agathois on a model for me because 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.880
 Yes 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.310
 their life is a bit of a monet for 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.050
 some a dream plays he dances he sings 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.940
 they sell or I do not know it's me 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.380
 find it perfect and I would really like 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.020
 bad to meet them even though I was not 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.760
 not how I would react because that's 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.520
 motivating done and I still have a soul 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.160
 of children course and even if they are more 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.440
 young people I think it's very 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.020
 very very very intimidated but really 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.240
 I do not know I would really like 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.170
 frangins for the return is really 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.570
 my dream and gba that left two for 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.430
 me because that's good, it's not a 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.680
 friend of both men and scarred 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.380
 of exoticism and not one that does not attempt anything 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.560
 has nothing I'm here to try because 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.140
 that me tiny I really loved him 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.400
 I wish they had frozen melo 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.130
 ogeu is but when some of the 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.090
 music and all the boys 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.000
 I love them and that's it 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.730
 that I know how to see them 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.669
 meetings and debates all tell them 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.669
 hello that's so 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.320
 and 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.320
 inhabitant
