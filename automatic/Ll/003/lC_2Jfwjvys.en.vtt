know once you take the set or once you
print<00:05:06.639> this<00:05:06.729> thing<00:05:06.790> out<00:05:07.150> it<00:05:07.630> really<00:05:07.960> looks

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
print this thing out it really looks

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.860 
print this thing out it really looks
like<00:05:08.350> a<00:05:08.710> copy<00:05:09.669> you<00:05:09.940> know<00:05:10.030> somebody<00:05:10.360> add<00:05:10.570> it<00:05:10.750> in

with this you know you can check stuff

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.480 
with this you know you can check stuff
off<00:05:22.419> you<00:05:22.690> can<00:05:22.840> obviously<00:05:23.229> do<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.919> signatures

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
off you can obviously do the signatures

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.950 
off you can obviously do the signatures
at<00:05:24.669> the<00:05:24.789> end<00:05:27.000> anywhere<00:05:28.000> you<00:05:28.030> would<00:05:28.600> write<00:05:28.780> on<00:05:28.930> a
