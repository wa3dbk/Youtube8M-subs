00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.200

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.040
 "Meatballs 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.160
 -welcome 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
 Thank you very much for your good words, very elegant 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.640
 - I'll make a two recipe with you 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.000
 I'm going to make you a nice potato bulgur patties. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 - Before the lady who showed us her talents ... 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.840
 Let's take a look at the list of materials, then let's continue 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.840
 2 cups of fine bulgur 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.320
 5 pieces of medium size boiled potatoes 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.080
 1 piece of medium onion 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.440
 1 piece of medium size tomato 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.840
 1 tablespoon lemon juice 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.320
 1 tablespoon paste 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.000
 1 bunch of parsley 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.760
 5 - 6 fresh onions 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.240
 1 teaspoon of cumin 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.800
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 and lettuce leaves for service 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.520
 Yes, we are starting to make our meatballs. 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.320
 Our recipe for raw raw meatballs has been cleaned, cleaned ... 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.640
 we find our findings 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.240
 need to be especially dry 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.160
 now we grate our onions and tomatoes on it 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.600
 without water 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.480
 - so it will soften with the water of onions and tomatoes? 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.560
 especially 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.480
 we shred the onion, now we grate 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.200
 I hope you know your skills in the next sections will benefit from you often 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.400
 - well I can't be as much as you, thank you for your nice feedback 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:40.400
 tomatoes are juicy for us 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.640
 because it will get wet with its own water 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.640
 we confuse 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.440
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.240
 and continue to stir 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:11.400
 While this is soft, we are peeling potatoes with Banu Atabay, we are chopping parsley 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.440
 10 minutes to rest, we do other operations 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.920
 To benefit from the benefits of parsley ... 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.280
 We chop it up, after finely chopping, you don't mind 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.960
 I heard that this recipe is very popular. 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.240
 -Every thanks to my friends 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.680
 I don't know what our audience will think 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.920
 now we grate our potatoes, we will mix after grating 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.080
 In the meantime, Banu lady also chopped our onions thin 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.200
 In the meantime our finding continues to soften 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 it will be delicious, yes 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 -Miss is over now, yours lady Banu? 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.760
 -it's almost done 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.000
 into our ingredients, we will put our paste 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.160
 -let me help you 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.440
 Thank you very gracefully 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.120
 and grated potatoes ... 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.520
 put it in the material and mix it all 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.520
 then we'll knead? 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.480
 -Yeah 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.040
 spoon, fork with whichever mix 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.400
 cumin I see you add? 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.480
 -Yeah, no trouble 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.640
 yes we got it 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.640
 Did it come in the green? 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.400
 we add the parsley we chop 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.000
 and fresh green onions 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.120
 subject to this season 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.880
 Cemile hanÄ±m 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.880
 Thank you thank you Banu lady with your help was ... 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.360
 at least 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.720
 to solve all the materials, we will knead with our hands 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.440
 Let's squeeze a little lemon 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.440
 1 tablespoon is enough 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.120
 we will knead quite a bit for this way 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.880
 3 - takes 4 minutes 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.480
 - they took a very good consistency. 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.200
 After we get a good consistency, we make meatballs 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.520
 after wetting the fingers, in terms of taking shape 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.720
 - You made dessert 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:40.280
 - Yes, some kids can't eat spicy 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.000
 We have adjusted according to ourself 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.640
 red pepper 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.480
 - can we run the system? 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:58.120
 -we can put, other spices can be put according to your desire 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.480
