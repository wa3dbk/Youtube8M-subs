00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
powdery you can use them wet which makes

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.950 
powdery you can use them wet which makes
the<00:00:43.649> color<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.100> lot<00:00:44.340> more<00:00:44.550> vibrant<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.239> this

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
skin it actually reminds me a lot of

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.529 
skin it actually reminds me a lot of
sidewalk<00:00:50.129> chalk<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.760> color<00:00:51.000> attention

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
sidewalk chalk the color attention

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.869 
sidewalk chalk the color attention
because<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> little<00:00:52.440> bit<00:00:52.649> chalky<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.730> if

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
because it is a little bit chalky but if

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.670 
because it is a little bit chalky but if
you<00:00:54.000> use<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.390> wet<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.469> take

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
you use it wet then it's going to take

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.619 
you use it wet then it's going to take
away<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.100> kind<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.489> powdery<00:00:57.059> chalkiness

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
away that kind of powdery chalkiness

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.389 
away that kind of powdery chalkiness
this<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:58.859> that's<00:00:59.100> super<00:00:59.340> bright<00:00:59.960> this<00:01:00.960> is

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
that's what I love um but anyway so i

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.960 
that's what I love um but anyway so i
use<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.690> darkest<00:02:42.110> one<00:02:42.380> for<00:02:42.830> my<00:02:43.130> eyebrows<00:02:43.640> i

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
use the darkest one for my eyebrows i

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.479 
use the darkest one for my eyebrows i
used<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.660> center<00:02:45.140> shade<00:02:45.410> for<00:02:45.920> my<00:02:46.220> highlight

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
used the center shade for my highlight

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.380 
used the center shade for my highlight
and<00:02:47.060> then<00:02:47.720> i<00:02:47.989> used<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:49.340> two<00:02:49.550> kind<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.940> shimmery

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
and then i used the two kind of shimmery

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.110 
and then i used the two kind of shimmery
colors<00:02:50.780> all<00:02:51.050> over<00:02:51.320> my<00:02:51.500> lid<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.010> then<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.670> darker

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
colors all over my lid and then a darker

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.390 
colors all over my lid and then a darker
one<00:02:53.300> for<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.720> outer<00:02:53.870> half<00:02:54.019> so<00:02:54.800> i<00:02:54.830> think<00:02:55.070> that

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
one for the outer half so i think that

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.650 
one for the outer half so i think that
this<00:02:55.519> is<00:02:55.580> going<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.880> be<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.090> really<00:02:56.480> good

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
this is going to be a really good

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.020 
this is going to be a really good
palette<00:02:57.080> just<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.470> carry<00:02:57.980> around<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.730> you

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
palette just to carry around and you

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.420 
palette just to carry around and you
don't<00:02:59.209> have<00:02:59.300> a<00:02:59.360> bunch<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.690> eyeshadows<00:03:00.320> and<00:03:00.530> I'm

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
don't have a bunch of eyeshadows and I'm

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.640 
don't have a bunch of eyeshadows and I'm
I<00:03:01.850> mean<00:03:02.269> it's<00:03:02.390> not<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.630> smallest<00:03:02.870> packaging

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
I mean it's not the smallest packaging

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.560 
I mean it's not the smallest packaging
but<00:03:03.830> considering<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.459> get<00:03:04.640> what<00:03:04.850> like<00:03:05.030> seven

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
but considering you get what like seven

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.720 
but considering you get what like seven
shades<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.470> is<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.650> really<00:03:07.010> come<00:03:07.190> unison<00:03:07.550> size

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
shades this is a really come unison size

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.699 
shades this is a really come unison size
of<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:07.940> compact<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:08.930> think<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.530> this<00:03:09.650> is

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
of a compact so I think that this is

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.410 
of a compact so I think that this is
going<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.010> be<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.220> really<00:03:10.610> good<00:03:10.760> palette<00:03:11.209> just

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
going to be a really good palette just

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.449 
going to be a really good palette just
to<00:03:11.600> carry<00:03:12.110> around<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.860> you<00:03:13.160> don't<00:03:13.310> have<00:03:13.400> a

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
to carry around and you don't have a

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.509 
to carry around and you don't have a
bunch<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.820> eyeshadows<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.660> I<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.950> mean<00:03:16.370> it's

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
bunch of eyeshadows and I I mean it's

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.920 
bunch of eyeshadows and I I mean it's
not<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.760> smallest<00:03:17.000> packaging<00:03:17.750> but

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
not the smallest packaging but

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.660 
not the smallest packaging but
considering<00:03:18.470> you<00:03:18.590> get<00:03:18.769> what<00:03:18.980> like<00:03:19.130> seven

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
considering you get what like seven

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.850 
considering you get what like seven
shades<00:03:20.120> this<00:03:20.570> is<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:20.750> really<00:03:21.110> come<00:03:21.290> unison<00:03:21.680> size

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
shades this is a really come unison size

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.610 
shades this is a really come unison size
of<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.040> compact<00:03:22.519> so<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.209> really<00:03:24.049> really<00:03:24.410> like
