okay<00:00:01.199> here's<00:00:01.439> the<00:00:01.560> second<00:00:01.920> attempt<00:00:02.280> at

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
okay here's the second attempt at

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.599 
okay here's the second attempt at
showing<00:00:02.580> you<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.230> Ailee<00:00:04.230> cut<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:05.160> then<00:00:05.279> using

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
showing you the Ailee cut and then using

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.459 
showing you the Ailee cut and then using
my<00:00:05.839> double<00:00:06.839> bevel<00:00:07.560> on<00:00:07.919> my<00:00:08.130> bowl<00:00:08.400> gouge<00:00:09.469> usually

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
my double bevel on my bowl gouge usually

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.530 
my double bevel on my bowl gouge usually
when<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.710> do<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> cut<00:00:11.219> on<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.460> surface<00:00:12.360> like<00:00:12.480> this

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
when you do a cut on a surface like this

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.529 
when you do a cut on a surface like this
you<00:00:13.410> do<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:14.360> 45<00:00:15.440> 45<00:00:16.440> 45<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.730> then<00:00:18.090> bring<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
you do the 45 45 45 and then bring the

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.320 
you do the 45 45 45 and then bring the
gouge<00:00:18.720> across<00:00:19.109> like<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.910> but<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> way<00:00:21.090> Ailee

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
gouge across like this but the way Ailee

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.660 
gouge across like this but the way Ailee
shows<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.840> with<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.109> double<00:00:22.470> bevel<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:23.430> that

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
shows it with this double bevel is that

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.220 
shows it with this double bevel is that
you<00:00:23.789> put<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.210> gouge<00:00:24.359> basically<00:00:24.810> right

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
you put the gouge basically right

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.519 
you put the gouge basically right
exactly<00:00:26.060> in<00:00:27.060> line<00:00:27.359> with<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.779> ways<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.320> and

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
exactly in line with the ways and and

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.500 
exactly in line with the ways and and
pretty<00:00:29.220> much<00:00:29.400> parallel<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> waist<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
pretty much parallel to the waist and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.690 
pretty much parallel to the waist and
then<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.140> would<00:00:31.320> bring<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.040> back<00:00:32.160> over<00:00:32.369> so

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
then you would bring it back over so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.110 
then you would bring it back over so
that<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.030> bevel<00:00:33.840> there<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.350> rubbing<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.219> then

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
that the bevel there is rubbing and then

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
that the bevel there is rubbing and then
just<00:00:36.390> drop<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.899> touch<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.320> just<00:00:37.530> roll<00:00:37.770> it

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
just drop it a touch and just roll it

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.639 
just drop it a touch and just roll it
just<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.160> touch<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:39.480> way<00:00:39.690> your<00:00:40.170> cutting

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
just a touch and this way your cutting

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.180 
just a touch and this way your cutting
in<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.920> direction<00:00:41.600> instead<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.719> scraping

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
in this direction instead of scraping

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.069 
in this direction instead of scraping
okay<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.460> lace<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.789> set<00:00:44.969> at<00:00:45.090> 1500<00:00:45.600> rpm<00:00:45.660> I'll

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
okay the lace is set at 1500 rpm I'll

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.350 
okay the lace is set at 1500 rpm I'll
try<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.350> give<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.620> little<00:00:46.800> demo<00:00:46.980> here<00:00:50.360> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
try to give you a little demo here the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.540 
try to give you a little demo here the
very<00:00:51.570> light<00:00:51.780> cut<00:00:52.079> at<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> finishing<00:00:53.010> cut<00:00:53.340> is

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
very light cut at the finishing cut is

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.459 
very light cut at the finishing cut is
not<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.789> shaping<00:00:54.420> cut

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
not a shaping cut

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.910 
not a shaping cut
the<00:00:55.949> last<00:00:56.129> cut<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.519> you<00:00:56.640> would<00:00:56.789> do

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.740 

and<00:01:01.399> if<00:01:01.550> you've<00:01:01.670> got<00:01:01.700> consistent<00:01:02.450> pressure

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
and if you've got consistent pressure

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.210 
and if you've got consistent pressure
and<00:01:03.260> consistent<00:01:03.920> motion<00:01:04.159> yes<00:01:04.640> I<00:01:04.909> don't<00:01:06.220> what

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
and consistent motion yes I don't what

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.380 
and consistent motion yes I don't what
I'm<00:01:07.340> trying<00:01:07.700> to<00:01:07.790> get

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.370 

he<00:01:10.900> has<00:01:11.050> very<00:01:11.229> nice<00:01:11.530> light<00:01:11.860> shading

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
he has very nice light shading

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.800 
he has very nice light shading
and<00:01:13.619> giving<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.010> an<00:01:14.280> insert<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:15.030> huge<00:01:15.450> fat

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.399 

with<00:01:19.350> no<00:01:19.620> terror<00:01:20.010> at<00:01:20.160> all

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.859 

yeah<00:01:25.979> stop<00:01:26.640> right<00:01:26.850> over<00:01:26.880> there<00:01:27.329> before<00:01:27.780> you

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
yeah stop right over there before you

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.330 
yeah stop right over there before you
can<00:01:27.899> take<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.229> look<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.649> not<00:01:28.710> there's<00:01:29.039> so<00:01:29.189> much

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
can take a look and not there's so much

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.149 
can take a look and not there's so much
time

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
time

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.139 
time
fortunately<00:01:32.159> my<00:01:32.250> pressure<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.939> kind<00:01:33.119> of

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
fortunately my pressure and that kind of

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.270 
fortunately my pressure and that kind of
stuff<00:01:33.329> isn't<00:01:33.539> so<00:01:33.750> good<00:01:33.930> yet<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.289> this<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.649> this

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
stuff isn't so good yet but this is this

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.560 
stuff isn't so good yet but this is this
is<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.610> smooth<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.570> almost<00:01:36.810> shiny<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.979> like

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
is so smooth it's almost shiny it's like

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.639 
is so smooth it's almost shiny it's like
baby<00:01:39.570> bottom<00:01:40.020> smooth<00:01:40.259> you

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
baby bottom smooth you

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.410 
baby bottom smooth you
I'm<00:01:40.920> not<00:01:41.189> kidding<00:01:41.579> when<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.789> say<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.179> you<00:01:42.270> can

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
I'm not kidding when I say that you can

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.660 
I'm not kidding when I say that you can
start<00:01:42.689> sanding<00:01:42.929> it<00:01:43.259> at<00:01:43.530> three

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
start sanding it at three

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.800 
start sanding it at three
well<00:01:45.299> 240<00:01:45.899> or<00:01:45.990> 320<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:48.240> more<00:01:48.390> practice

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
well 240 or 320 a little more practice

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.179 
well 240 or 320 a little more practice
and<00:01:48.960> hopefully<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.289> can<00:01:49.409> get<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.710> smoother

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
and hopefully I can get that smoother

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.359 
and hopefully I can get that smoother
this<00:01:50.909> cut<00:01:51.210> really<00:01:51.450> works<00:01:51.720> well<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.590> think<00:01:53.100> that

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
this cut really works well I think that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.830 
this cut really works well I think that
on<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.610> flat<00:01:53.789> surface<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.390> could<00:01:54.509> use<00:01:54.720> this

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
on a flat surface you could use this

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.249 
on a flat surface you could use this
normal<00:01:55.259> ball<00:01:55.470> gouge<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:57.090> normal<00:01:57.360> one<00:01:57.539> double

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
normal ball gouge the normal one double

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.260 
normal ball gouge the normal one double
but<00:01:59.069> on<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> inside<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.880> ball<00:02:00.060> or<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
but on the inside of a ball or the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.389 
but on the inside of a ball or the
outside<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.780> bowl<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.409> very<00:02:01.590> short<00:02:02.009> short

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
outside of a bowl the very short short

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.999 
outside of a bowl the very short short
short<00:02:02.459> bevel<00:02:03.060> at<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.299> front<00:02:03.569> here<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.009> around

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
short bevel at the front here and around

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.249 
short bevel at the front here and around
the<00:02:05.159> front<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.459> the<00:02:05.610> sides<00:02:05.849> gives<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> lot

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the front and the sides gives you a lot

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.070 
the front and the sides gives you a lot
more<00:02:07.289> maneuvering<00:02:08.069> room<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.700> can<00:02:08.940> drop<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
more maneuvering room you can drop the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.050 
more maneuvering room you can drop the
handle<00:02:10.530> or<00:02:10.649> up<00:02:10.769> the<00:02:10.950> handle<00:02:11.280> or<00:02:11.459> slightly
