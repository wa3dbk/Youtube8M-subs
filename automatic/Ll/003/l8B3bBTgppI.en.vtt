00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
absolute favorite throughout college I

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.420 
absolute favorite throughout college I
use<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.269> for<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> very<00:02:21.690> long<00:02:21.840> time<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
use this for a very long time this is a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.640 
use this for a very long time this is a
brown<00:02:23.790> base<00:02:24.060> nude<00:02:24.540> it's<00:02:24.810> much<00:02:25.080> lighter<00:02:25.470> than

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
brown base nude it's much lighter than

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.290 
brown base nude it's much lighter than
the<00:02:25.770> others<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.550> if<00:02:27.090> you

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
the others so if you

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.850 
the others so if you
our<00:02:27.420> lighter<00:02:27.720> skin<00:02:28.080> than<00:02:28.320> me<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.500> think<00:02:28.740> this

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
our lighter skin than me I think this

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.260 
our lighter skin than me I think this
one<00:02:29.010> would<00:02:29.130> be<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.280> great<00:02:29.610> one<00:02:29.730> for<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:30.030> and

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
one would be a great one for you and

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.760 
one would be a great one for you and
this<00:02:30.690> doesn't<00:02:30.930> really<00:02:31.020> require<00:02:31.260> anything

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
this doesn't really require anything

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.710 
this doesn't really require anything
else<00:02:31.980> also<00:02:32.490> it's<00:02:32.610> not<00:02:32.790> quite<00:02:33.000> as<00:02:33.150> pigmented<00:02:33.630> as

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
else also it's not quite as pigmented as

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.660 
else also it's not quite as pigmented as
the<00:02:33.840> others<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.680> will<00:02:35.070> let<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> little<00:02:35.550> bit

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
the others so it will let a little bit

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.270 
the others so it will let a little bit
of<00:02:35.730> your<00:02:35.880> natural<00:02:36.360> lip<00:02:37.050> color<00:02:37.080> show<00:02:37.950> through

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
of your natural lip color show through

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.250 
of your natural lip color show through
which<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.180> kind<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.660> makes<00:02:39.960> it<00:02:40.050> look<00:02:40.170> a

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
which I kind of like it makes it look a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.600 
which I kind of like it makes it look a
little<00:02:40.380> bit<00:02:40.530> more<00:02:40.710> natural<00:02:40.890> because<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.490> that

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
little bit more natural because of that

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.680 
little bit more natural because of that
so<00:02:42.600> as<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.750> guys<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:43.080> see<00:02:43.260> warmer<00:02:43.680> undertones

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
so as you guys can see warmer undertones

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.270 
so as you guys can see warmer undertones

on the outside not so much everywhere

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.490 
on the outside not so much everywhere
because<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.270> is<00:02:54.390> quite<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.630> dark<00:02:54.990> brown<00:02:55.200> lip

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
will get for our Indian skin tone it

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.730 
will get for our Indian skin tone it
does<00:03:06.060> also<00:03:06.420> have<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.900> sort<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.350> yellowish

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
does also have a sort of yellowish

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.710 
does also have a sort of yellowish
undertone<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:08.700> that's<00:03:08.910> why<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.150> requires<00:03:09.600> a

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
undertone but that's why it requires a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.270 
undertone but that's why it requires a
lip<00:03:09.990> liner<00:03:10.140> with<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.710> think<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.190> it

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
lip liner with that I think that it

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.190 
lip liner with that I think that it
tends<00:03:11.460> to<00:03:11.550> work<00:03:11.760> out<00:03:11.940> really<00:03:12.060> well<00:03:12.200> again

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
tends to work out really well again

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.380 
tends to work out really well again
though<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.530> will<00:03:13.860> need<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.370> nice<00:03:14.700> dark<00:03:15.180> eye

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
though you will need a nice dark eye

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.860 
though you will need a nice dark eye
