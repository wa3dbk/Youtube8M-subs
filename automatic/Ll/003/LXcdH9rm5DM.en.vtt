bread<00:02:22.709> stars<00:02:23.070> you<00:02:23.760> might<00:02:24.030> as<00:02:24.180> well<00:02:24.209> ditch<00:02:24.840> the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
bread stars you might as well ditch the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.750 
bread stars you might as well ditch the
sword<00:02:25.380> since<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.799> relies<00:02:26.040> on<00:02:26.070> waggle<00:02:26.640> that

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
sword since it relies on waggle that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.900 
sword since it relies on waggle that
only<00:02:26.910> works<00:02:27.090> about<00:02:27.380> 40%<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.470> time<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:31.910> also

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
only works about 40% of time I also

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.370 
only works about 40% of time I also
think<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.360> double<00:02:33.660> jump<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:33.989> only<00:02:34.110> included

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
think the double jump is only included
