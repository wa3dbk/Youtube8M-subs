00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
close to the scalp and pulling the iron

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.120 
close to the scalp and pulling the iron
all<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.149> way<00:01:39.299> through<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.929> go<00:01:40.890> into<00:01:41.009> the

opposite direction of the hair growth so

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:44.419 
opposite direction of the hair growth so
that<00:01:43.319> the<00:01:43.530> hair<00:01:43.679> will<00:01:43.740> stand<00:01:43.920> up<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.280> go
