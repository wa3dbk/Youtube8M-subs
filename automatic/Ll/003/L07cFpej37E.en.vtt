00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.859
 well there's a team of Spanish researchers are working on the 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.660
 automotive technology that will allow a row of cars in a 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.119
 The motorway will go autonomously to a car and 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.810
 it's actually a set of cars with a vehicle at the head 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.960
 manually driven followed by a series of cars in very 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.179
 close to her 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.660
 that means that on your way to work you could read the newspaper 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.100
 take breakfast make-up while on the highway even though 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.960
 this technology or you have about a decade to be really available 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.089
 volvo already have silver kind of it there was no now we are building the 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:46.820
 first prototype for the peloton 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.190
 enciso we compare it with a car normally produces something that really 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.920
 it's not that we can automatically direct the vehicle that way the car 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.480
 you have to automatically follow the motorist headings what is 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.340
 can see here is that we detect an object in front of our vehicle and what 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.890
 guidance system to the Taliban automatically from the address 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.230
 correct another type of research is using simulator to test 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.080
 the driver's reactions to the system 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.230
 we are not learning how people react when they are driving so 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.370
 near another vehicle 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.910
 when they drive very close to the vehicle that is in front of others as it 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.910
 feels when they are driving in this kind of valuation systems 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.570
 mclaren the truth is that we have found some reactions 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.270
 different than expected an attractive party like that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.650
 This person in charge explains how there are people who trust the system fully 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.310
 while others do not even one of the investigators of the system 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.640
 He was reluctant to take his eyes off the road 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.750
 in such encounter the sea meanwhile of blood for me is really good 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.750
 because I do not have time to read the verdict start no partner 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.969
 no ban ki-moon 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.350
 dv 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.900
 I feel safe on the internet and send a charge to Miguel in which he played 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.180
 understand that line of feeling secure because the security of the 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.159
 squad drivers are ultimately responsible to the driver of the 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.160
 vehicle day 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.869
 he must take a series of precautions before getting going 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.509
 the driver of the car in the lead must insert a security card and 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:19.139
 pass a breathalyzer test before you can start driving the 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:23.519
 automobile once the road other systems monitor their state of 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.239
 alert for example we have other driver monitoring systems 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.609
 European project called javi suit that detects if the driver is distracted 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.829
 country based on driving support systems we help monitor the 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.520
 platoon safely through the regimen in that school p though it part 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.899
 of research focuses on how to make technology work 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.159
 another part of it is trying to understand what can go wrong 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.670
 we are trying to understand what can go wrong in the context of don bosco hair and 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:55.480
 it can be things like the first car is about to have an accident and 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:58.559
 what would be the consequences for the courses that follow and how can we 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:00.420
 solve it and address these problems 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.599
 The truth is that they are once again the only car manufacturer with the idea of 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.559
 vehicles that drive themselves 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:10.169
 nissan is also working on a similar technology called eporo and they are 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:14.259
 robots that can follow each other by adjusting their speeds preventing 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:18.399
 this asses by themselves if the day vehicle help if in something they match 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.569
 nissan and volvo is that so that one day we can take our eyes off the 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.719
 road and trust in the technology that takes us where we want to go yet 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.239
 There is a long way to go
