00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
that mission so this is kale and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.359 
that mission so this is kale and
unfortunately<00:00:27.410> you<00:00:27.470> can't<00:00:27.680> get<00:00:27.829> kale<00:00:28.070> all

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
unfortunately you can't get kale all

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.980 
unfortunately you can't get kale all
year<00:00:28.579> long<00:00:28.759> because<00:00:28.970> it's<00:00:29.240> not<00:00:29.360> in<00:00:29.480> season<00:00:29.840> all

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
year long so when you can get it by as

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.760 
year long so when you can get it by as
much<00:00:32.540> as<00:00:32.599> you<00:00:32.780> can<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:33.440> we're<00:00:33.590> going<00:00:33.710> to

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
much as you can and we're going to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.650 
much as you can and we're going to
freeze<00:00:34.070> it<00:00:34.100> chop<00:00:34.670> it<00:00:34.850> and<00:00:34.969> freeze<00:00:35.210> it<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:35.540> then

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
freeze it chop it and freeze it and then

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.400 
freeze it chop it and freeze it and then
you<00:00:35.719> can<00:00:35.870> use<00:00:36.020> it<00:00:36.170> any<00:00:36.680> time<00:00:36.890> in<00:00:37.340> smoothies<00:00:38.059> in

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
you can use it any time in smoothies in

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.889 
you can use it any time in smoothies in
salads<00:00:39.410> in<00:00:39.680> quinoa<00:00:40.489> dishes<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:41.329> stir<00:00:41.629> fries

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
do give it a good wash and then chop it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.819 
do give it a good wash and then chop it
up<00:00:46.760> roughly<00:00:47.239> like<00:00:47.600> I've<00:00:47.749> done<00:00:47.870> here<00:00:47.929> there's

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
up roughly like I've done here there's

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.069 
up roughly like I've done here there's
no<00:00:49.129> magic<00:00:49.609> to<00:00:49.699> how<00:00:49.820> you<00:00:49.879> cut<00:00:50.179> it<00:00:50.210> about<00:00:50.629> quarter

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
no magic to how you cut it about quarter

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.419 
no magic to how you cut it about quarter
inch<00:00:51.260> slices<00:00:53.559> you<00:00:54.559> don't<00:00:54.829> need<00:00:55.039> to<00:00:55.129> take<00:00:55.249> out

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:55.429 
inch slices you don't need to take out

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:57.099 
inch slices you don't need to take out
the<00:00:55.550> stem<00:00:55.789> some<00:00:56.149> people<00:00:56.420> you<00:00:56.480> say<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:56.749> have<00:00:57.019> to

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
the stem some people you say you have to

the stem some people you say you have to
take<00:00:57.230> out<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.440> stem<00:00:57.649> but<00:00:57.800> that<00:00:57.949> is<00:00:58.100> a

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
take out the stem but that is a

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.860 
take out the stem but that is a
laborious<00:00:58.429> process<00:00:58.640> you<00:00:59.239> don't<00:00:59.480> need<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.749> do

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
laborious process you don't need to do

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.020 
laborious process you don't need to do
it<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:00.589> don't<00:01:00.739> waste<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.069> time<00:01:01.100> then<00:01:01.789> all<00:01:01.909> you

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
it so don't waste the time then all you

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.689 
it so don't waste the time then all you
need<00:01:02.059> is<00:01:02.480> a<00:01:02.989> baking<00:01:03.440> sheet<00:01:03.469> a<00:01:03.890> cookie<00:01:04.250> sheet<00:01:04.460> or

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
need is a baking sheet a cookie sheet or

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.640 
need is a baking sheet a cookie sheet or
anything<00:01:04.970> flat<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:05.720> you're<00:01:06.170> going<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.350> lay

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
anything flat and you're going to lay

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.810 
anything flat and you're going to lay
the<00:01:07.040> kale<00:01:07.340> out<00:01:07.550> in<00:01:07.820> one<00:01:08.180> single<00:01:08.720> layer<00:01:09.820> just

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
the kale out in one single layer just

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.399 
the kale out in one single layer just
spread<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:11.210> out<00:01:11.300> and<00:01:11.630> then<00:01:12.170> you're<00:01:12.260> going<00:01:12.350> to

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
spread it out and then you're going to

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.580 
spread it out and then you're going to
put<00:01:12.860> it<00:01:12.979> in<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:13.340> freezer<00:01:13.580> on<00:01:14.380> this<00:01:15.380> cookie

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
put it in the freezer on this cookie

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.469 
put it in the freezer on this cookie
sheet<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.550> reason<00:01:16.880> we<00:01:16.970> freeze<00:01:17.210> it<00:01:17.240> like

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
sheet so the reason we freeze it like

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.149 
sheet so the reason we freeze it like
this<00:01:17.690> is<00:01:17.900> because<00:01:18.170> if<00:01:18.290> you<00:01:18.380> froze<00:01:18.649> it<00:01:18.829> right

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
this is because if you froze it right

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.620 
this is because if you froze it right
now<00:01:19.340> in<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.670> bag<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:20.119> would<00:01:20.210> just<00:01:20.299> clump

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
now in a bag it would just clump

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.170 
now in a bag it would just clump
together<00:01:20.810> into<00:01:21.079> a<00:01:21.350> giant<00:01:21.649> kale<00:01:22.070> ice<00:01:22.399> cube<00:01:22.759> so

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
together into a giant kale ice cube so

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.580 
together into a giant kale ice cube so
what<00:01:23.329> we<00:01:23.420> do<00:01:23.540> is<00:01:23.659> we<00:01:23.750> freeze<00:01:24.049> it<00:01:24.229> like<00:01:24.259> this

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
what we do is we freeze it like this

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.270 
what we do is we freeze it like this
flattened<00:01:25.460> out<00:01:25.640> put<00:01:26.420> it<00:01:26.570> in<00:01:26.719> a<00:01:27.140> bag<00:01:27.560> after<00:01:27.799> it's

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
flattened out put it in a bag after it's

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.740 
flattened out put it in a bag after it's
frozen<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:28.880> we<00:01:28.939> have<00:01:29.030> individual<00:01:29.719> little

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
frozen so we have individual little

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.010 
frozen so we have individual little
pieces<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.409> frozen<00:01:30.950> kale<00:01:31.329> so<00:01:32.329> after<00:01:32.899> it's

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
pieces of frozen kale so after it's

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.859 
pieces of frozen kale so after it's
frozen<00:01:33.759> put<00:01:34.759> it<00:01:34.880> into<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.180> bag<00:01:35.329> fill<00:01:35.719> it<00:01:35.810> up

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
frozen put it into the bag fill it up

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.020 
frozen put it into the bag fill it up
about<00:01:36.020> half<00:01:36.380> way<00:01:36.649> don't<00:01:37.340> fill<00:01:37.579> it<00:01:37.700> up<00:01:37.729> all<00:01:37.969> the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
about half way don't fill it up all the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.060 
about half way don't fill it up all the
way<00:01:38.530> push<00:01:39.530> out<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.890> air<00:01:40.450> seal<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:41.689> up<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.079> you

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
way push out the air seal it up and you

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.289 
way push out the air seal it up and you
can<00:01:43.219> keep<00:01:43.399> it<00:01:43.520> then<00:01:43.700> in<00:01:43.850> your<00:01:43.939> freezer<00:01:44.210> for

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
can keep it then in your freezer for

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.179 
can keep it then in your freezer for
about<00:01:44.479> 10<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:45.020> 12<00:01:45.229> months<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:45.799> every<00:01:46.039> morning
