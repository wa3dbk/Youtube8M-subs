00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
figure 8 leg lucky call it a leg luck

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.590 
figure 8 leg lucky call it a leg luck
because<00:01:30.230> it's<00:01:30.470> I<00:01:30.680> guess<00:01:31.040> lock<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.030> legs<00:01:32.270> but

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600

because it's I guess lock the legs but
it<00:01:32.720> doesn't<00:01:32.990> make<00:01:33.050> any<00:01:33.110> sense<00:01:33.410> but<00:01:33.590> it's<00:01:33.770> just

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
it doesn't make any sense but it's just

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.100 
it doesn't make any sense but it's just
like<00:01:34.040> a<00:01:34.070> ripoff<00:01:34.460> of<00:01:34.520> her<00:01:34.790> father's<00:01:35.120> figure<00:01:35.900> for
