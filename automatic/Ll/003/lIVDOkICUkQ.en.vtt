00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.270 
to pull my hair like inter ponytail and
it<00:05:06.479> took<00:05:06.660> a<00:05:06.750> long<00:05:06.870> time<00:05:06.930> but<00:05:07.440> now<00:05:08.039> they're

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
it took a long time but now they're

it takes so good I'd say it takes a good
five<00:05:16.020> days<00:05:16.770> or<00:05:17.039> so<00:05:17.220> for<00:05:17.580> your<00:05:17.699> braids<00:05:18.120> to

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
redone recently and it took a few days

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.100 
redone recently and it took a few days
for<00:05:23.190> it<00:05:23.220> to<00:05:23.310> get<00:05:23.610> kind<00:05:23.880> of<00:05:23.970> loose<00:05:24.210> before<00:05:24.539> like
