00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
with public DNA this process was similar

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.670 
with public DNA this process was similar
in<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.020> involved<00:01:43.020> breaking<00:01:43.920> up<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.250> DNA<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
in that involved breaking up to DNA and

in that involved breaking up to DNA and
blasting<00:01:46.680> apart<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> private
