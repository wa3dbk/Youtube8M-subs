okay bison tubes wire the bane
of<00:00:27.869> many<00:00:28.070> cashers<00:00:28.730> existence

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:29.599 
of many cashers existence

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.330 
of many cashers existence
the<00:00:30.220> main<00:00:30.460> reason<00:00:30.830> is<00:00:31.210> they're<00:00:31.330> so

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.490 
the main reason is they're so

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.730 
the main reason is they're so
small<00:00:32.180> their<00:00:32.660> micro<00:00:33.150> incise

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.130 
small their micro incise

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.720 
small their micro incise
which<00:00:34.310> means<00:00:34.600> that<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:34.840> only<00:00:35.160> hold<00:00:35.720> a

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
which means that the only hold a

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.500 
which means that the only hold a
logbook<00:00:36.410> they're<00:00:37.240> made<00:00:37.460> a<00:00:37.500> three

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.829 
logbook they're made a three

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.520 
logbook they're made a three
main<00:00:38.090> components:

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.920 
main components:

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.480 
main components:
a<00:00:38.970> keyring<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.300> cap<00:00:40.990> and<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.480> bison

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:41.840 
a keyring the cap and the bison

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.400 
a keyring the cap and the bison
tube<00:00:42.079> itself

tube itself

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.330 
tube itself
okay<00:00:43.970> so<00:00:44.230> wire<00:00:44.520> bison<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.050> such<00:00:45.330> a

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.410 
okay so wire bison to such a
