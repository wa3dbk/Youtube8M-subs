00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.340
 dear citizens of russian iron 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.320
 roads greet you 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.320
 happy and safe Putin 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.130
 so that nothing darkens the pleasant 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.989
 memories from the journey we 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.140
 we remind that the railways 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.779
 high-risk areas remain 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.989
 not empty words not an attempt to scare anyone 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.790
 then this is a real fact 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.790
 crippled destinies and ruined lives 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.199
 being on the railway 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.390
 transport is necessary to know and exactly 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.780
 follow the rules of safe behavior 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.670
 be extremely vigilant myself and 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.640
 attentive to others not allowing 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.280
 thoughtless actions remember that 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.180
 the price of carelessness can be yours 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.180
 life and health 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.539
 Russian railways create 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.790
 maximum safe conditions for 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.040
 facilities of the passenger complex for 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.220
 Overhead lines are being built for these purposes. 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.220
 initial bridges tunnel set 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.299
 warning alarms are fenced 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.420
 dangerous places 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.260
 in one word everything is done to increase 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.540
 your safety 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.670
 however due to unwarranted haste and 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.190
 carelessness of adults and children 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.320
 reluctance to use bridge bridges 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.850
 and pedestrian crossings and sometimes just 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.430
 because of mischief 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.260
 hooliganism on railways and 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.280
 on the territory adjacent to them 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:44.360
 injured and killed especially hurt and 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.370
 a shame when this happens here guys 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.980
 left unsupervised 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.350
 often play near rail 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.570
 paths or stations probably many 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.450
 had to watch as children for the sake of 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.670
 curiosities rise on the wagon zazov 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.670
 ARISING throw snowballs and even stones 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.780
 passing passenger trains 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.390
 enclose foreign objects on 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.479
 rails exposing with danger not 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.120
 only themselves but also for all who are in 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.430
 by train or as adults walk by 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.910
 railway tracks like walking on 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.880

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.060
 the machinist will have time for the site on the sidelines alas 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.230
 too often too many lives 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.870
 pay for such self-confidence 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.580
 pay attention to the light and 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.590
