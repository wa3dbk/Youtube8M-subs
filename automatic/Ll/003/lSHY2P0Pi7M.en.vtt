and you pass it pass it around so you

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.220 
and you pass it pass it around so you
don't<00:00:29.250> get<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.490> light<00:00:29.699> turned<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.359> he<00:00:31.080> got

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
don't get the light turned on and he got

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.770 
don't get the light turned on and he got
the<00:00:31.380> light<00:00:31.529> turned<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:32.090> so<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.420> restart

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the light turned on so just to restart

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.209 
the light turned on so just to restart
it<00:00:33.960> but<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.829> leave<00:00:34.980> her<00:00:35.100> down<00:00:35.190> again<00:00:37.160> okay<00:00:38.160> so

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it but to leave her down again okay so

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.220 
it but to leave her down again okay so
it<00:00:39.000> takes<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.360> while<00:00:39.480> because<00:00:39.690> there's<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.050> lot

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
it takes a while because there's a lot

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.139 
it takes a while because there's a lot
of<00:00:40.260> redstone<00:00:40.649> repeaters<00:00:43.160> so<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> turns<00:00:44.399> off<00:00:44.640> we

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
of redstone repeaters so it turns off we

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.389 
of redstone repeaters so it turns off we
start<00:00:45.450> being<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.590> again<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> work<00:00:47.190> player

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
start being so again it's a work player

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.010 
start being so again it's a work player
game<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.059> better<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.450> four<00:00:48.660> people

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
game so it's better with four people

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.260 
game so it's better with four people
what<00:00:49.379> makes<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.710> work<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.129> very<00:00:50.309> easy<00:00:50.489> it's

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
what makes this work is very easy it's

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.479 
what makes this work is very easy it's
the<00:00:51.629> leavers<00:00:52.350> connected<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.930> redstone<00:00:55.489> so

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the leavers connected to a redstone so

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.950 
the leavers connected to a redstone so
when<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.379> sounds<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.859> search<00:00:59.899> sends<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
when it's on it sounds a search sends a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.860 
when it's on it sounds a search sends a
surge<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:02.730> there's<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.030> large<00:01:03.329> storm<00:01:03.539> Peters

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
surge and there's a large storm Peters

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.380 
surge and there's a large storm Peters
and<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.710> turns<00:01:04.979> off<00:01:05.840> these<00:01:06.840> red<00:01:07.200> stone<00:01:08.390> these

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and it turns off these red stone these

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.230 
and it turns off these red stone these
are<00:01:09.540> its<00:01:09.630> dumb<00:01:09.900> twitch's<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.820> whenever<00:01:12.119> its

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
are its dumb twitch's so whenever its

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.109 
are its dumb twitch's so whenever its
tilt<00:01:12.450> which<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.750> all<00:01:12.900> off<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:16.970> Ritz<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
tilt which is all off the the Ritz the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.240 
tilt which is all off the the Ritz the
lamp<00:01:18.299> will<00:01:18.479> turn<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.650> when<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> turn<00:01:20.040> on

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
lamp will turn on so when you turn on

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.520 
lamp will turn on so when you turn on
the<00:01:20.280> game<00:01:21.229> it'll<00:01:22.229> take<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.979> while<00:01:23.509> before<00:01:24.530> all

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
the game it'll take a while before all

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.359 
the game it'll take a while before all
of<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> redstone<00:01:26.640> repeaters<00:01:27.360> turn<00:01:27.689> off<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:29.009> by

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
of the redstone repeaters turn off so by

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.039 
of the redstone repeaters turn off so by
the<00:01:29.400> time<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.939> redstone<00:01:30.270> repeaters<00:01:30.659> get

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the time the redstone repeaters get

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.310 
the time the redstone repeaters get
there<00:01:31.820> it<00:01:32.820> will<00:01:33.240> give<00:01:33.509> time<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.079> players

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
there it will give time for the players

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.960 
there it will give time for the players
to<00:01:34.650> play<00:01:34.770> around<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:36.200> try<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.340> try<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.400> pass<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
to play around and try to try to pass it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.740 
to play around and try to try to pass it
before<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> gets<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:42.360> redstone

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
before it gets here and the redstone

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.499 
before it gets here and the redstone
purchase<00:01:43.500> turn<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.759> that's<00:01:44.970> why<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.149> did<00:01:45.479> a

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
purchase turn on so that's why I did a

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.050 
purchase turn on so that's why I did a
lot<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.840> redstone<00:01:46.200> repeaters<00:01:46.680> because<00:01:47.100> that

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
lot of redstone repeaters because that

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.330 
lot of redstone repeaters because that
will<00:01:48.149> give<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.420> time<00:01:48.799> for<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> players<00:01:50.100> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
will give it time for the players to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.499 
will give it time for the players to
pass<00:01:50.520> around<00:01:50.790> torch<00:01:51.649> instead<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:53.509> but

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
pass around torch instead of just but

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.219 
pass around torch instead of just but
it's<00:01:55.079> there<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.790> passing<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.079> for<00:01:58.079> one

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it's there just passing it like for one

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.530 
it's there just passing it like for one
second<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.740> yeah<00:01:59.009> that's<00:01:59.430> about<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.880> just

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
second and yeah that's about it you just

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.630 
second and yeah that's about it you just
turn<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:01.020> here<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.790> pass<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:04.640> and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
turn out here and you just pass it and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.150 
turn out here and you just pass it and
it's<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.329> 4<00:02:06.509> Flavian<00:02:06.960> again<00:02:07.229> keep<00:02:07.770> saying<00:02:08.009> that

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
it's a 4 Flavian again keep saying that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.400 
it's a 4 Flavian again keep saying that
because<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.759> mean<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.690> can't<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:10.050> do<00:02:10.289> this

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
because I mean you can't really do this

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.430 
because I mean you can't really do this
by<00:02:10.590> myself<00:02:11.690> because

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
by myself because

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.320 
by myself because
