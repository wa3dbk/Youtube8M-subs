00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
saving the planets all very well but

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.010 
saving the planets all very well but
it's<00:00:02.070> not<00:00:02.220> always<00:00:02.370> that<00:00:02.490> much<00:00:02.730> fun<00:00:03.000> we<00:00:03.750> wanted

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
it's not always that much fun we wanted

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.450 
it's not always that much fun we wanted
to<00:00:04.110> make<00:00:04.230> it<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.380> bit<00:00:04.529> more<00:00:04.560> interesting<00:00:04.890> by

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
to make it a bit more interesting by

familiar with it just well just have a
look<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.670> youtube<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.289> it's<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:23.060> infinitely

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
look on youtube and it's a infinitely

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.560 
look on youtube and it's a infinitely
generated<00:00:24.960> world<00:00:25.199> where<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.670> mean<00:00:27.420> it

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
generated world where you can mean it

which flops destroy them rebuild them
into<00:00:30.300> other<00:00:30.420> things<00:00:30.510> um<00:00:31.700> this<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.820> all<00:00:32.940> very

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
into other things um this is all very

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.250 
into other things um this is all very
nice<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:34.940> but<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.420> know<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.809> want<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.050> bring<00:00:37.140> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
nice and but you know we want to bring a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.740 
nice and but you know we want to bring a
bit<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.500> environmental<00:00:38.370> stewardship<00:00:38.969> sort<00:00:39.690> of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
bit of environmental stewardship sort of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.600 
bit of environmental stewardship sort of
thing<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.800> one<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> things<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.460> Minecraft

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
thing so one of the things in Minecraft

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.049 
thing so one of the things in Minecraft
is<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:43.260> make<00:00:43.440> things<00:00:43.789> one<00:00:44.789> way<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
is that you can make things one way is

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.180 
is that you can make things one way is
that<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.510> make<00:00:45.960> things<00:00:46.170> out<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:46.649> thinks<00:00:47.010> is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that you make things out but thinks is

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.959 
that you make things out but thinks is
biased<00:00:47.940> reporting<00:00:48.030> them<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:49.649> furnace<00:00:50.100> so

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
biased reporting them in a furnace so

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.240 
biased reporting them in a furnace so
for<00:00:51.719> instance<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> furnace<00:00:53.039> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
for instance here we have a furnace and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.180 
for instance here we have a furnace and
we<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.149> cook<00:00:54.329> some<00:00:54.539> beef<00:00:54.719> by<00:00:55.680> burning<00:00:56.039> some

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
we can cook some beef by burning some

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.979 
we can cook some beef by burning some
wood<00:00:57.320> now<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:59.000> was<00:01:00.000> good<00:01:00.210> that's<00:01:00.390> gonna<00:01:00.600> start

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
wood now I was good that's gonna start

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.990 
wood now I was good that's gonna start
cooking<00:01:01.289> away<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.370> notice<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
cooking away and as you notice up in the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.880 
cooking away and as you notice up in the
top<00:01:03.180> corner<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.629> screen<00:01:03.899> there<00:01:04.140> there<00:01:04.769> is

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
top corner in the screen there there is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.640 
top corner in the screen there there is
a<00:01:04.920> counter<00:01:05.780> which<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.900> popping<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.439> every

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
a counter which is popping up for every

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.050 
a counter which is popping up for every
bit<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> wood<00:01:08.100> that's<00:01:08.280> burned<00:01:08.549> what's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
bit of wood that's burned what's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.969 
bit of wood that's burned what's
actually<00:01:09.270> happening<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.439> every<00:01:10.799> time<00:01:10.920> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
actually happening is that every time a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.850 
actually happening is that every time a
piece<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.220> wood<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.610> burnt<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.570> furnace<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
piece of wood is burnt in that furnace a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.240 
piece of wood is burnt in that furnace a
call<00:01:14.729> has<00:01:14.880> been<00:01:14.909> made<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.420> MEAP<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.250> just

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
call has been made to the MEAP I just

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.300 
call has been made to the MEAP I just
going<00:01:17.400> off<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.909> using<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.500> ipcc

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
going off it's using and the ipcc

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.780 
going off it's using and the ipcc
statuary<00:01:21.000> combustion<00:01:21.920> methodologies<00:01:22.920> for

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
statuary combustion methodologies for

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.380 
statuary combustion methodologies for
wood<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.560> case<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:27.060> that's<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.330> very

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
wood in this case so that's all very

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.359 
wood in this case so that's all very
well<00:01:27.540> that's<00:01:27.869> going<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.110> keep<00:01:28.259> counting<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.189> as

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
well that's going to keep counting up as

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.340 
well that's going to keep counting up as
it<00:01:30.000> burns<00:01:30.210> more<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.570> more<00:01:30.689> wood<00:01:30.869> we're<00:01:31.229> going

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it burns more and more wood we're going

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.539 
it burns more and more wood we're going
to<00:01:31.439> keep<00:01:31.530> pumping<00:01:31.890> some<00:01:32.009> carbon<00:01:32.340> into<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
to keep pumping some carbon into the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.609 
to keep pumping some carbon into the
atmosphere<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:33.180> see<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.229> cook<00:01:34.439> with

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
atmosphere or see we can cook with

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.109 
atmosphere or see we can cook with
different<00:01:34.950> things<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.610> burn<00:01:35.759> plaques

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
different things so we can burn plaques

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.179 
different things so we can burn plaques
its<00:01:36.479> data<00:01:36.689> they're<00:01:37.369> slightly<00:01:38.369> less

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
its data they're slightly less

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.260 
its data they're slightly less
carbon-intensive<00:01:41.189> because<00:01:41.790> there's<00:01:41.970> not<00:01:42.150> as

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
carbon-intensive because there's not as

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.200 
carbon-intensive because there's not as
much<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.229> make<00:01:43.549> four<00:01:44.549> planks<00:01:44.790> from<00:01:45.000> one

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
much you can make four planks from one

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.389 
much you can make four planks from one
but<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.450> would<00:01:45.600> say<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.770> quite<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.070> much<00:01:47.159> with

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
but it would say not quite as much with

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.310 
but it would say not quite as much with
that<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:50.090> it's<00:01:51.090> likewise<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.780> sticks<00:01:52.079> we

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that and it's likewise with sticks we

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.280 
that and it's likewise with sticks we
can<00:01:52.470> burn<00:01:52.619> those<00:01:53.030> again<00:01:54.030> they're<00:01:54.329> even<00:01:55.110> best

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
can burn those again they're even best

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.039 
can burn those again they're even best
attempt<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.329> even<00:01:57.329> less<00:01:57.450> carbon<00:01:57.810> per<00:01:57.960> stick<00:02:00.049> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
attempt a even less carbon per stick and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.260 
attempt a even less carbon per stick and
so<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:01.770> forth<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.280> these<00:02:02.399> are<00:02:02.579> orkin<00:02:02.909> sort

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
so on so forth so these are orkin sort

so on so forth so these are orkin sort
of<00:02:03.329> count<00:02:03.540> up<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.320> even<00:02:04.439> burn<00:02:04.649> saplings

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
of count up we can even burn saplings

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.559 
of count up we can even burn saplings
they<00:02:06.570> burn<00:02:06.810> really<00:02:07.049> quickly<00:02:07.399> and<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:09.390> have

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
they burn really quickly and but have

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.250 
they burn really quickly and but have
hardly<00:02:09.810> anything<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.379> them<00:02:10.530> so

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
hardly anything to them so

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.119 
hardly anything to them so
let's<00:02:12.260> take<00:02:13.129> these<00:02:13.310> back<00:02:13.549> out<00:02:13.730> again<00:02:15.129> cooking

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
let's take these back out again cooking

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:23.080 
let's take these back out again cooking
our<00:02:16.219> beef<00:02:18.730> more<00:02:21.549> have<00:02:22.549> you<00:02:22.730> seen<00:02:22.909> we've

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
our beef more have you seen we've

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.530 
our beef more have you seen we've
already<00:02:23.299> pumped<00:02:24.019> 300<00:02:24.799> kilos<00:02:25.159> of<00:02:25.459> carbon<00:02:26.359> into

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
already pumped 300 kilos of carbon into

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.030 
already pumped 300 kilos of carbon into
the<00:02:26.569> atmosphere<00:02:26.629> this<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.680> all<00:02:27.799> done<00:02:27.980> through

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
the atmosphere this is all done through

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.059 
the atmosphere this is all done through
the<00:02:28.639> MEAP<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.599> as<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.590> say<00:02:30.859> it's<00:02:32.680> going<00:02:33.680> off<00:02:33.799> doing

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
the MEAP I as I say it's going off doing

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.649 
the MEAP I as I say it's going off doing
websites<00:02:34.430> come<00:02:34.730> whenever<00:02:35.030> an<00:02:35.150> item's<00:02:35.450> burn

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
websites come whenever an item's burn

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.809 
websites come whenever an item's burn
them<00:02:35.840> on<00:02:35.959> these<00:02:36.079> furnaces<00:02:36.409> and<00:02:36.709> it's<00:02:37.579> working

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
them on these furnaces and it's working

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.910 
them on these furnaces and it's working
out<00:02:38.319> based<00:02:39.319> on<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:40.659> mass<00:02:41.659> of<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.930> item<00:02:42.829> that's

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
out based on the mass of the item that's

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.770 
out based on the mass of the item that's
been<00:02:43.129> burned<00:02:43.340> which<00:02:43.639> to<00:02:44.150> be<00:02:44.239> honest<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.599> had<00:02:44.750> a

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
been burned which to be honest I had a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.789 
been burned which to be honest I had a
bit<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:44.959> an<00:02:45.109> educated<00:02:45.439> guess<00:02:45.709> at<00:02:45.919> and<00:02:46.389> and

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
bit of an educated guess at and and

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.140 
bit of an educated guess at and and
working<00:02:48.799> out<00:02:48.919> what<00:02:49.069> it<00:02:49.159> would<00:02:49.250> be<00:02:49.280> if<00:02:49.849> pumped

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
working out what it would be if pumped

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.970 
working out what it would be if pumped
into<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.359> atmosphere<00:02:50.510> obviously<00:02:51.470> one<00:02:51.799> more

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
into the atmosphere obviously one more

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.849 
into the atmosphere obviously one more
thing<00:02:52.250> we<00:02:52.609> can<00:02:52.790> do<00:02:52.970> is<00:02:53.120> we<00:02:53.329> can<00:02:53.359> earn<00:02:53.659> coal<00:02:53.959> so

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
thing we can do is we can earn coal so

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:56.979 
thing we can do is we can earn coal so
you<00:02:55.010> can<00:02:55.280> find<00:02:55.489> coal<00:02:55.669> underground<00:02:56.150> in<00:02:56.840> my

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
you can find coal underground in my

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.550 
you can find coal underground in my
draft<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:58.340> as<00:02:58.909> we<00:02:59.120> burn<00:02:59.299> that<00:02:59.480> that's<00:03:00.349> going<00:03:00.500> to

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
draft so as we burn that that's going to

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.250 
draft so as we burn that that's going to
pump<00:03:00.799> out<00:03:01.480> more<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.569> more<00:03:02.719> carbon<00:03:03.049> into<00:03:03.200> the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
pump out more and more carbon into the

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.750 
pump out more and more carbon into the
atmosphere<00:03:03.319> as<00:03:03.769> well<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.810> that's<00:03:06.799> pretty<00:03:07.609> good

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
atmosphere as well so that's pretty good

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.940 
atmosphere as well so that's pretty good
this<00:03:08.150> could<00:03:08.359> see<00:03:08.480> here<00:03:08.719> you<00:03:09.049> know<00:03:09.079> it<00:03:09.379> was<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.620> it

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
this could see here you know it was a it

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.580 
this could see here you know it was a it
was<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.099> nice<00:03:10.280> sunny<00:03:10.549> day<00:03:10.609> say<00:03:11.569> it's<00:03:11.719> starting

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
was a nice sunny day say it's starting

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.780 
was a nice sunny day say it's starting
to<00:03:12.650> get<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.799> little<00:03:12.859> bit<00:03:12.980> murky<00:03:13.400> that's<00:03:13.579> like

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
to get a little bit murky that's like

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.710 
to get a little bit murky that's like
straight<00:03:14.480> up<00:03:14.629> and<00:03:15.579> obvious<00:03:16.579> though<00:03:17.209> there<00:03:17.629> are

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
straight up and obvious though there are

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.719 
straight up and obvious though there are
other<00:03:17.840> ways<00:03:18.019> in<00:03:18.290> which<00:03:18.319> to<00:03:18.470> pursue<00:03:18.949> your<00:03:19.370> want

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:19.729 
other ways in which to pursue your want

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:21.909 
other ways in which to pursue your want
an<00:03:19.909> environmental<00:03:20.479> destruction<00:03:20.750> let's<00:03:21.650> just

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
an environmental destruction let's just

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.140 
an environmental destruction let's just
assume<00:03:22.370> have<00:03:22.669> a<00:03:22.699> deforestation<00:03:24.849> you're<00:03:25.849> havin

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
assume have a deforestation you're havin

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.819 
assume have a deforestation you're havin
flare<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:27.709> far<00:03:27.949> to<00:03:28.099> some<00:03:28.280> trees<00:03:29.650> treat<00:03:30.650> them

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
flare so far to some trees treat them

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.189 
flare so far to some trees treat them
quite<00:03:31.069> well<00:03:31.659> nice<00:03:32.859> keep<00:03:33.859> you<00:03:33.949> warm<00:03:34.159> tonight

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
quite well nice keep you warm tonight

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.710 
quite well nice keep you warm tonight
and<00:03:36.199> you<00:03:36.530> can<00:03:36.560> see<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:37.599> counter<00:03:38.599> there

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
and you can see the counter there

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.699 
and you can see the counter there
ticking<00:03:39.079> up<00:03:39.229> as<00:03:39.409> the<00:03:40.400> leaves<00:03:40.609> burn<00:03:40.939> away<00:03:41.709> quite

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
ticking up as the leaves burn away quite

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.649 
ticking up as the leaves burn away quite
severely<00:03:43.120> so<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:45.250> yeah<00:03:46.250> deforestation<00:03:47.120> I'll

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
severely so so yeah deforestation I'll

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:53.439 
severely so so yeah deforestation I'll
get<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:47.930> moon<00:03:48.019> run<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:50.389> do<00:03:50.720> this<00:03:50.900> coal<00:03:52.449> so

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.449 
get the moon run and do this coal so

00:03:53.449 --> 00:04:00.180 
get the moon run and do this coal so
that's<00:03:54.609> in<00:03:55.609> it<00:03:56.739> quite<00:03:58.120> nice

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
that's in it quite nice

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.170 
that's in it quite nice
let's<00:04:00.760> get<00:04:00.910> much<00:04:01.120> more<00:04:01.300> trees<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.570> them<00:04:03.180> really

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
let's get much more trees to them really

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.760 
let's get much more trees to them really
don't<00:04:04.600> like<00:04:08.280> yeah<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:11.140> that's<00:04:11.380> going<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.590> burn

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
don't like yeah so that's going to burn

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.870 
don't like yeah so that's going to burn
his<00:04:11.920> wounds<00:04:12.180> yeah<00:04:13.180> that's<00:04:13.690> not<00:04:14.200> so<00:04:14.410> nice<00:04:14.880> so

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
his wounds yeah that's not so nice so

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.960 
his wounds yeah that's not so nice so
what<00:04:16.690> else<00:04:16.989> is<00:04:17.140> in<00:04:17.260> this<00:04:17.350> world<00:04:17.940> there<00:04:18.940> are

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
what else is in this world there are

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.090 
what else is in this world there are
lots<00:04:19.209> of<00:04:19.360> lots<00:04:19.720> of<00:04:19.840> animals<00:04:20.049> around<00:04:20.350> there's<00:04:21.040> a

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
lots of lots of animals around there's a

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.810 
lots of lots of animals around there's a
care<00:04:21.400> for<00:04:21.670> instance<00:04:22.230> and<00:04:23.250> if<00:04:24.250> we<00:04:24.400> do<00:04:24.550> that<00:04:24.580> is

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
care for instance and if we do that is

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.580 
care for instance and if we do that is
this<00:04:25.000> same<00:04:26.310> get<00:04:27.310> beef<00:04:27.580> from<00:04:27.970> cows<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:28.900> which

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
this same get beef from cows and which

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.130 
this same get beef from cows and which
is<00:04:29.710> what<00:04:29.860> we<00:04:29.950> were<00:04:30.040> cooking<00:04:30.160> earlier<00:04:30.400> but<00:04:31.390> what

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
is what we were cooking earlier but what

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.300 
is what we were cooking earlier but what
interesting<00:04:32.530> way<00:04:32.620> to<00:04:32.650> get<00:04:32.860> beef<00:04:33.010> is<00:04:33.190> to

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
interesting way to get beef is to

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.440 
interesting way to get beef is to
actually<00:04:34.020> try<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.290> set<00:04:35.800> i<00:04:35.920> took<00:04:36.160> out<00:04:36.340> ok<00:04:37.120> come

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
actually try and set i took out ok come

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.400 
actually try and set i took out ok come
back<00:04:37.600> here<00:04:37.750> come<00:04:38.110> back<00:04:38.140> out<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:39.060> babe<00:04:40.060> I'm

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
happy and whoa what just happened to the

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.100 
happy and whoa what just happened to the
sky<00:04:56.520> we've<00:04:57.520> just<00:04:57.550> pumped<00:04:58.210> out<00:04:58.300> a<00:04:58.360> huge<00:04:58.810> amount

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
sky we've just pumped out a huge amount

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.220 
sky we've just pumped out a huge amount
of<00:04:59.140> carbon<00:04:59.530> cow<00:05:00.160> is<00:05:00.490> 600<00:05:01.480> kilos<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:01.870> pure

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
of carbon cow is 600 kilos of pure

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.110 
of carbon cow is 600 kilos of pure
biomass<00:05:02.740> that<00:05:02.950> equivalent<00:05:03.460> to<00:05:03.520> burning<00:05:03.820> a<00:05:03.880> lot

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
biomass that equivalent to burning a lot

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.230 
biomass that equivalent to burning a lot
of<00:05:04.360> trees<00:05:05.130> so<00:05:06.130> clouds<00:05:07.000> are<00:05:07.180> gone<00:05:07.240> black<00:05:07.600> that

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
of trees so clouds are gone black that

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.659 
of trees so clouds are gone black that
the<00:05:10.240> clouds<00:05:10.480> have<00:05:10.690> actually<00:05:10.960> come<00:05:11.169> down<00:05:11.669> to

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
the clouds have actually come down to

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.000 
the clouds have actually come down to
the<00:05:12.880> little<00:05:13.510> bit<00:05:13.690> glow<00:05:13.840> it's<00:05:14.050> not<00:05:14.350> not<00:05:14.650> a<00:05:14.680> very

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
the little bit glow it's not not a very

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.940 
the little bit glow it's not not a very
much<00:05:15.310> place<00:05:15.580> to<00:05:15.730> be<00:05:15.880> there<00:05:16.120> so<00:05:17.080> we<00:05:17.230> can<00:05:17.410> just

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
much place to be there so we can just

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.409 
much place to be there so we can just
try<00:05:20.220> make<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.310> place<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.520> bit<00:05:21.669> nicer<00:05:21.880> well

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
try make the place a bit nicer well

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.850 
try make the place a bit nicer well
where<00:05:22.660> do<00:05:23.470> a<00:05:23.530> bit<00:05:23.650> of<00:05:23.680> that<00:05:24.090> carbon<00:05:25.090> offsetting

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
where do a bit of that carbon offsetting

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.040 
where do a bit of that carbon offsetting
by<00:05:26.860> planting<00:05:27.400> few<00:05:27.550> more<00:05:27.669> tree<00:05:30.600> as<00:05:31.600> you<00:05:31.750> can<00:05:31.900> see

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
by planting few more tree as you can see

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.880 
by planting few more tree as you can see
as<00:05:32.320> we<00:05:33.190> plant<00:05:33.430> a<00:05:33.520> tree<00:05:33.700> the<00:05:34.630> amount<00:05:35.230> of<00:05:35.380> wood

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
as we plant a tree the amount of wood

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.220 
as we plant a tree the amount of wood
and<00:05:36.220> so<00:05:36.550> on<00:05:36.610> that<00:05:36.910> sir<00:05:37.210> that's<00:05:37.660> in<00:05:37.810> it<00:05:37.900> gets

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
and so on that sir that's in it gets

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.440 
and so on that sir that's in it gets
added<00:05:38.830> up<00:05:39.040> and<00:05:41.790> pull<00:05:42.790> back<00:05:43.060> out<00:05:43.270> of<00:05:43.300> the

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
added up and pull back out of the

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.870 
added up and pull back out of the
atmosphere<00:05:44.190> that<00:05:45.190> feat

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:06:10.820 

lots<00:05:50.880> more<00:05:51.260> stupid<00:05:52.260> back

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.050 

nice<00:06:11.830> and<00:06:12.070> I<00:06:12.130> think<00:06:12.430> it's<00:06:12.550> getting<00:06:12.670> towards

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
nice and I think it's getting towards

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:20.370 
nice and I think it's getting towards
night<00:06:13.240> time<00:06:15.690> so<00:06:16.690> we've<00:06:17.050> modeled<00:06:17.470> and<00:06:17.770> a<00:06:19.380> number

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
night time so we've modeled and a number

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.350 
night time so we've modeled and a number
of<00:06:20.470> object<00:06:21.040> a<00:06:21.250> lot<00:06:21.700> of<00:06:21.790> the<00:06:21.970> things<00:06:22.180> that<00:06:22.300> you

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
of object a lot of the things that you

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.310 
of object a lot of the things that you
can<00:06:22.480> burn<00:06:22.630> a<00:06:22.690> lot<00:06:22.960> of<00:06:23.020> the<00:06:23.200> and<00:06:24.690> biomass<00:06:25.690> type

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
can burn a lot of the and biomass type

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.380 
can burn a lot of the and biomass type
emissions<00:06:27.160> like<00:06:27.370> cows<00:06:27.640> and<00:06:27.940> sheep<00:06:28.090> and<00:06:28.300> pigs

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
emissions like cows and sheep and pigs

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.820 
emissions like cows and sheep and pigs
we<00:06:29.380> can<00:06:29.590> work<00:06:30.310> out<00:06:30.490> the<00:06:30.550> year<00:06:31.200> work<00:06:32.200> out<00:06:32.380> the

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
we can work out the year work out the

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.130 
we can work out the year work out the
emissions<00:06:33.100> from<00:06:33.220> 75<00:06:33.760> to<00:06:33.790> those<00:06:34.060> again<00:06:34.900> this<00:06:34.990> is

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
emissions from 75 to those again this is

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.300 
emissions from 75 to those again this is
all<00:06:35.230> using<00:06:35.560> Amy<00:06:35.710> data<00:06:36.010> and<00:06:37.350> we<00:06:38.350> have<00:06:38.500> to<00:06:38.650> assume

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
all using Amy data and we have to assume

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.430 
all using Amy data and we have to assume
that<00:06:39.400> cows<00:06:39.760> are<00:06:39.940> just<00:06:40.120> made<00:06:40.270> of<00:06:40.440> generic

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
that cows are just made of generic

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.540 
that cows are just made of generic
biomass<00:06:41.950> but<00:06:42.250> still<00:06:42.580> that's<00:06:43.390> fine<00:06:44.550> sunset
