point<00:06:08.690> was<00:06:08.840> so<00:06:09.080> high<00:06:09.289> this<00:06:10.280> is<00:06:10.460> about<00:06:10.639> 650

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
point was so high this is about 650

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.659 
point was so high this is about 650
episodes<00:06:11.930> in<00:06:12.080> her<00:06:12.139> so<00:06:12.320> but<00:06:13.039> with<00:06:13.340> that<00:06:13.520> much

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
episodes in her so but with that much

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:15.909 
episodes in her so but with that much
time<00:06:14.060> passed<00:06:14.360> even<00:06:14.870> though<00:06:15.139> he's<00:06:15.320> still<00:06:15.620> 10

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
time passed even though he's still 10

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:17.920 
time passed even though he's still 10
you<00:06:16.370> don't<00:06:16.490> travel<00:06:16.849> four<00:06:17.240> regions<00:06:17.690> and<00:06:17.810> not

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
you don't travel four regions and not

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.659 
you don't travel four regions and not
learn<00:06:18.260> anything<00:06:18.620> or<00:06:18.860> grow<00:06:19.070> as<00:06:19.190> a<00:06:19.220> character

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
learn anything or grow as a character

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:21.670 
learn anything or grow as a character
and<00:06:19.849> you<00:06:20.330> can<00:06:20.510> really<00:06:20.690> see<00:06:20.990> that<00:06:21.140> Nash<00:06:21.380> in<00:06:21.560> this

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
and you can really see that Nash in this

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.850 
and you can really see that Nash in this
battle<00:06:22.039> more<00:06:22.220> than<00:06:22.400> the<00:06:22.490> rest

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
battle more than the rest

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.580 
battle more than the rest
so<00:06:23.849> if<00:06:24.180> this<00:06:24.389> battle<00:06:24.690> is<00:06:24.900> the<00:06:25.020> best<00:06:25.259> of<00:06:25.440> watch

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
so if this battle is the best of watch

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.869 
so if this battle is the best of watch
then<00:06:25.889> what<00:06:26.400> could<00:06:26.520> possibly<00:06:26.970> be<00:06:27.060> number<00:06:27.449> one

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:28.879 
then what could possibly be number one

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:34.129 
then what could possibly be number one
number<00:06:29.879> one<00:06:32.180> after<00:06:33.180> the<00:06:33.330> Conaway<00:06:33.720> battle<00:06:34.080> is

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
number one after the Conaway battle is

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:35.809 
number one after the Conaway battle is
an<00:06:34.229> even<00:06:34.500> more<00:06:34.530> exciting<00:06:35.039> battle<00:06:35.520> against

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819 
an even more exciting battle against

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:38.689 
an even more exciting battle against

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
Paul the sinal rival Paul basically uses

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.059 
Paul the sinal rival Paul basically uses
every<00:06:39.090> strategy<00:06:39.569> ash<00:06:39.840> has<00:06:40.050> ever<00:06:40.229> used<00:06:40.620> against
