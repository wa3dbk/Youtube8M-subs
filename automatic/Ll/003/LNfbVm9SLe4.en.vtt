00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.949
 this show is 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.249
 christ is dead musical we wanted to do something that extremely music is 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.210
 stocked up on musical instruments that emphasize 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.919
 let's say the whole story 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.880
 the 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.570
 cursed videos north wall of the communication or of the year in 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.810
 a very current topic in my opinion during this period 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.730
 it is a mind a father who tells stories to the world is a child a boy 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.100
 following him 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.500
 and at some point in their we say unit year 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.660
 but what happens in this family children 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.640
 the wife goes away 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.530
 me knows 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.530
 love 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.510
 and the child's mother 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.320
 % and therefore begins this journey the father for of my voice you can no longer 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.320
 to put up stories for pain 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.840
 the kid's the time 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.340
 makes this journey begin 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.490
 to recover his mother to save her we say either reunite the family 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.049
 so the kid takes all the responsibility for this thing 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:51.830
 puts 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.920
 in action, travel begins to create a series of ideas 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.270
 in fact, to resolve the situation at the end 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.370
 he succeeds because the harmony recharges 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.299
 and a show that talks about communication about weapons 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.780
 way of seeking harmony who does not mean escapes always by force 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.209
 be happy and contented but 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.549
 to find 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.040
 a how to say a 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.400
 just embrace a harmony a circle that closes 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.400
 where everything is included 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.399
 USA 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:28.149
 bari 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:30.079
 it is always a memory 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.919
 is 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.839
 the two sides of the great comedians of 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:38.469
 of the Italian theater cinema toto 'e peppino 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:45.069
 and so on, there are so many of us we could or should mention so many 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.509
 and I refer to them a little I don't think of them when I create dialogues 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.299
 of our shows 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.299
 100m 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:00.329
 does 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.769
 lot 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.629
 no 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.069
 but 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.099
 waters 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.099
 exact time but 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.579
 color 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:21.000
 you naturally taking into account the story who has this complexity 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.749
 history must be understood yes but in the novel 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:27.000
 and shouldn't change it enough e 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.909
 and bring more closer 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.729
 in the interest of children 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:36.139
 but also in adults because we really talk about children but also those children 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.139
 that are hidden in the 90s in cotto 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.939
 beautiful 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.239
 but 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.239
 It is in the 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:57.369
 thehun 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.389
