common on loads of bikes but it's quite

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.480

Thompson's elite covert post as well the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.910 
Thompson's elite covert post as well the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
reverb side drive it and but I don't see

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.359 
reverb side drive it and but I don't see
this<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> bad<00:00:25.320> thing<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.949> means<00:00:26.160> they're

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
this is a bad thing it means they're

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.490 
this is a bad thing it means they're
both<00:00:26.519> pretty<00:00:26.939> user<00:00:27.269> serviceable<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.410> don't

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
both pretty user serviceable a you don't

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.900 
both pretty user serviceable a you don't
have<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.769> bleed<00:00:28.980> them<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.460> there's<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.760> lot

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
have to bleed them and there's a lot

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.189 
have to bleed them and there's a lot
less<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.390> go<00:00:30.510> wrong<00:00:30.539> with<00:00:30.869> them<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.080> many

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
less to go wrong with them in many

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.370 
less to go wrong with them in many
senses<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.000> command<00:00:33.450> post<00:00:33.660> IR<00:00:34.020> CC

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
senses so this is the command post IR CC

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.780 
senses so this is the command post IR CC
which<00:00:34.590> stands<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:34.950> internally<00:00:35.670> routed

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
which stands for internally routed

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.690 
which stands for internally routed
cruise<00:00:36.450> control<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.680> previous<00:00:38.129> generations

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
cruise control the previous generations

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.000 
cruise control the previous generations
of<00:00:38.969> command<00:00:39.719> posts<00:00:40.050> had<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> three<00:00:40.620> position

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
of command posts had a three position

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.270 
of command posts had a three position
setup<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.739> bottom<00:00:43.739> descending

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
setup so you have this bottom descending

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.459 
setup so you have this bottom descending
position<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.600> top<00:00:45.809> climbing<00:00:46.320> one

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
position you have the top climbing one

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.260 
position you have the top climbing one
and<00:00:46.649> then<00:00:47.039> one<00:00:47.280> down<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> middle<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.059> well

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
and then one down in the middle as well

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.180 
and then one down in the middle as well
for<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> sort<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:48.989> trail<00:00:49.200> riding<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
for a sort of trail riding the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.310 
for a sort of trail riding the
difference<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.360> around<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> mid

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
difference now is that around the mid

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.170 
difference now is that around the mid
point<00:00:52.559> you've<00:00:52.739> got<00:00:52.949> ten<00:00:53.250> little<00:00:53.430> indentations

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
point you've got ten little indentations

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.750 
point you've got ten little indentations
which<00:00:54.390> give<00:00:54.629> about<00:00:55.379> five<00:00:55.710> mil<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.100> difference

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
which give about five mil of difference

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.400 
which give about five mil of difference
between<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.210> saddle<00:00:57.510> height<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:58.140> each<00:00:58.199> of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
between the saddle height for each of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.540 
between the saddle height for each of
them<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:58.980> thing<00:00:59.160> which<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.399> always

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
them the one thing which is always

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.160 
them the one thing which is always
coming<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.940> them<00:01:00.120> with<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.510> command<00:01:00.840> post<00:01:01.020> is

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
coming to them with the command post is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.720 
coming to them with the command post is
that<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.379> return<00:01:01.500> speed<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.100> incredibly<00:01:02.579> high

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
that the return speed is incredibly high

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.570 
that the return speed is incredibly high
so<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.229> go<00:01:04.350> from<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> bottom<00:01:04.769> back<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so if we go from the bottom back up to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.649 
so if we go from the bottom back up to
the<00:01:05.670> top<00:01:06.350> if<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.560> value<00:01:07.770> fertility<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:08.790> yeah

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the top if you value fertility then yeah

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.090 
the top if you value fertility then yeah
perhaps<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.049> not<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.680> just

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
perhaps it's not the one for you just

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.800 
perhaps it's not the one for you just
here<00:01:11.310> you've<00:01:11.490> got<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> little<00:01:12.270> Schrader<00:01:12.540> valve

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
here you've got a little Schrader valve

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.200 
here you've got a little Schrader valve
which<00:01:13.500> controls<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.310> air<00:01:14.520> pressure<00:01:14.790> inside<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
which controls the air pressure inside a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.880 
which controls the air pressure inside a
small<00:01:15.450> air<00:01:15.720> canister<00:01:16.200> inside<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> person

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
small air canister inside the person

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.399 
small air canister inside the person
this<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.040> what<00:01:17.280> regulates<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.509> return<00:01:18.810> it

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
this is what regulates the return it

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.800 
this is what regulates the return it
comes<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> box<00:01:20.220> at<00:01:20.759> 20<00:01:21.180> psi<00:01:21.330> which<00:01:21.780> is

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
comes out of the box at 20 psi which is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.749 
comes out of the box at 20 psi which is
a<00:01:21.930> maximum<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.070> adjust<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.400> down<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
a maximum and you can adjust it down to

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.749 
a maximum and you can adjust it down to
15<00:01:24.290> because<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.680> low<00:01:25.950> pressure<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.549> low

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
15 because it's a low pressure and low

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.370 
15 because it's a low pressure and low
volume<00:01:26.909> air<00:01:27.360> cam<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.960> actually<00:01:28.229> quite

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
volume air cam it's actually quite

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.170 
volume air cam it's actually quite
difficult<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.829> get<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.130> shock<00:01:29.640> pump<00:01:29.850> or<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> track

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
difficult to get a shock pump or a track

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.929 
difficult to get a shock pump or a track

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
filter to notice the pressure changes so

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.190 
filter to notice the pressure changes so
it's<00:01:33.060> actually<00:01:33.180> quite<00:01:33.450> difficult<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.900> tune

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
it's actually quite difficult to tune

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.050 
it's actually quite difficult to tune
but<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.009> be<00:01:35.100> fair<00:01:35.310> if<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.700> let<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> little

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
but to be fair if you just let a little

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.550 
but to be fair if you just let a little
bit<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.360> air<00:01:36.509> out<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.110> play<00:01:37.290> around<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
bit of air out you can play around a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.780 
bit of air out you can play around a
little<00:01:37.619> bit<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:37.979> will<00:01:38.189> slow<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> rate

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
little bit and it will slow the rate

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.969 
little bit and it will slow the rate
down<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> little<00:01:39.299> bit<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.290> one<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> nicer

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
down a little bit so one of the nicer

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.889 
down a little bit so one of the nicer
things<00:01:41.159> about<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> IRC<00:01:41.850> see<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
things about the IRC see is that in the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.539 
things about the IRC see is that in the
box<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.290> get<00:01:43.470> two<00:01:43.680> different<00:01:43.829> lever<00:01:44.159> options

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
box you get two different lever options

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.760 
box you get two different lever options
so<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.180> vertically<00:01:45.689> orientated<00:01:46.320> lever<00:01:46.530> which

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
so the vertically orientated lever which

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
so the vertically orientated lever which
comes<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> box<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.640> really<00:01:47.820> nicely<00:01:48.240> shaped

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
comes in the box is really nicely shaped

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.300 
comes in the box is really nicely shaped
it's<00:01:48.990> got<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> good<00:01:49.350> thumb<00:01:49.619> paddle<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.159> and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
it's got a good thumb paddle on it and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.410 
it's got a good thumb paddle on it and
it's<00:01:50.430> got<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> reasonable<00:01:50.970> amount<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.180> length

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it's got a reasonable amount of length

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.969 
it's got a reasonable amount of length
which<00:01:51.780> gives<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.079> good<00:01:52.229> bit<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.380> leverage<00:01:52.770> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
which gives a good bit of leverage to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.139 
which gives a good bit of leverage to
pull<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> cable<00:01:53.549> through<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> full<00:01:54.000> length

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
pull the cable through the full length

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.789 
pull the cable through the full length

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
times the other option is what they call

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.319 
times the other option is what they call
the<00:01:58.079> srl<00:01:58.619> or<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.040> single<00:01:59.460> ring<00:01:59.670> lever<00:01:59.909> it

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the srl or the single ring lever it

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.450 
the srl or the single ring lever it
shaped<00:02:00.659> much<00:02:00.960> more<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.920> thumb<00:02:02.159> paddle

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460

from<00:02:02.640> from<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.210> shifter<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.680> goes<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.219> more

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
from from a shifter so it goes in more

so<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.840> difference<00:02:18.080> between<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.890> Thompson

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
so the difference between the Thompson

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.760 
so the difference between the Thompson
and<00:02:19.610> specialized<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.320> Thompson<00:02:21.680> is

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770

return it's actually a damped return so

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.690
