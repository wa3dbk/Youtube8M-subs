00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
here and it's really tricky I went into

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.340 
here and it's really tricky I went into
this<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:22.080> blade<00:01:22.590> dancer<00:01:23.220> now<00:01:23.850> that's

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
this as a blade dancer now that's

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.080 
this as a blade dancer now that's
essential<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:26.640> able<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.970> go

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
essential because I was able to go

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.690 
essential because I was able to go
invisible<00:01:27.480> and<00:01:28.080> my<00:01:28.590> friend<00:01:28.890> Stark<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
invisible and my friend Stark was a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.480 
invisible and my friend Stark was a
warlock<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:31.080> could<00:01:31.229> obviously<00:01:31.500> self<00:01:32.070> res

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
warlock that could obviously self res

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.820 
warlock that could obviously self res
now<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.510> is<00:01:33.570> really<00:01:33.870> good<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.380> if<00:01:34.530> somebody

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
now this is really good for if somebody

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.550 
now this is really good for if somebody
goes<00:01:35.010> down<00:01:35.340> it'll<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.270> way<00:01:36.479> easier<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.260> get<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
goes down it'll be way easier to get the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.500 
goes down it'll be way easier to get the
other<00:01:37.680> person<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.460> one<00:01:39.060> person<00:01:39.479> is

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
other person up if one person is

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.660 
other person up if one person is
invisible<00:01:40.050> or<00:01:40.260> if<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.560> person<00:01:40.950> has<00:01:41.100> self<00:01:41.370> res

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
invisible or if one person has self res

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.870 
invisible or if one person has self res
and<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.420> literally<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.260> trying<00:01:44.070> time<00:01:44.640> your

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
and it's literally just trying time your

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.450 
and it's literally just trying time your
jumps<00:01:45.299> between<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:46.020> stairs<00:01:46.290> try<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.130> really

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
jumps between the stairs try and really

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.060 
jumps between the stairs try and really
drag<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.180> out<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.600> top<00:01:49.229> pretty<00:01:49.680> much<00:01:49.799> time

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
drag it out and top pretty much time

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.940 
drag it out and top pretty much time
your<00:01:50.250> jumps<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.210> don't<00:01:51.570> die<00:01:52.020> when<00:01:52.799> it

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
your jumps so that you don't die when it

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.359 
your jumps so that you don't die when it
says<00:01:53.190> or<00:01:53.460> ox<00:01:53.640> rage<00:01:54.210> burns<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.990> ground<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:56.190> is

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
says or ox rage burns the ground this is

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.800 
says or ox rage burns the ground this is
literally<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:57.090> seems<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> only

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
literally it seems like the only

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.080 
literally it seems like the only
strategy<00:01:58.260> for<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.040> area<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.820> kind<00:02:00.030> of

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
strategy for this area is the kind of

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.090 
strategy for this area is the kind of
time<00:02:00.270> your<00:02:00.420> jumps<00:02:00.780> between<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.560> two<00:02:01.740> stairs

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
time your jumps between the two stairs
