really really well and of course a lot
of<00:01:50.939> people<00:01:51.060> big<00:01:51.329> fascism<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:51.960> what<00:01:52.380> I've<00:01:52.470> done

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
of people big fascism and what I've done

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.130 
of people big fascism and what I've done
is<00:01:52.740> pretty<00:01:53.130> much<00:01:53.220> as<00:01:53.399> uses<00:01:53.729> s<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.479> inform<00:01:54.899> card

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
is pretty much as uses s is inform card

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.959 
is pretty much as uses s is inform card
as<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.680> card<00:01:55.920> they<00:01:56.009> released<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.399> benattia

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
as the card they released like benattia

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.149 
as the card they released like benattia
but<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.659> thought<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.170> what<00:01:58.200> EA<00:01:58.619> tend<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.040> do

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
but I thought this is what EA tend to do

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.980 
but I thought this is what EA tend to do
this<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.490> they<00:01:59.640> don't<00:01:59.790> tend<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.149> ring<00:02:00.719> release

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
this and they don't tend to ring release

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.959 
this and they don't tend to ring release
the<00:02:01.439> second<00:02:01.829> informed<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.310> know<00:02:02.579> he<00:02:02.670> doesn't<00:02:02.820> go

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the second informed I know he doesn't go

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.520

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
under yet but i don't think that think

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.959
