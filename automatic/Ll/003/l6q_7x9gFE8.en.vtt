00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.890
 one day later 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.530
 this would be the result of the sockets 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.800
 these are 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:27.330
 what is the part of the connection 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.330
 is where you connect every 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.660
 each leg of the integrated circuits 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.730
 they are those sockets of the circuits 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.129
 integrated there are several types of sockets 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:44.720
 but these are integrated circuits 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.470
 Well, this liquid 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.350
 clear nitric acid looks so blue 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.380
 because here they have dissolved they have 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.960
 dissolved then the aluminum and 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.100
 other metals and what has been left 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:05.270
 has been these supports say 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.790
 I leave that they are gold is worth then 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.850
 some of you clear everyone 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.420
 is free to comment or 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.500
 Any type of comment is worth 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:21.380
 some say this is copper well if 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.860
 out copper any kid knows 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.789
 nitric acid dissolves copper 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:32.080
 so if this were copper it would be 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:37.030
 dissolved would be in the same liquid 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.760
 and without it being noticed nothing is worth then 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.820
 this can not be copper because I've 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.890
 said a thousand times and if you do not believe then 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.580
 can enter so there are those who 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.259
 you can enter world rating 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.860
 they were a dot com and you go in there and there 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:59.799
 They explain a lot of things to you 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.710
 about gold over platinum over 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:06.479
 silver over gold all kinds of metals 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.910
 valuable or can explain them for free 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.470
 Okay it's in English but I think that 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.450
 You can also find there 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.190
 colleagues from all over the world are there 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.050
 all stuck in this forum and not 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.660
 only this forum but there are many 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.700
 other forums that talk about the 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.910
 recovery of precious metals 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.400
 going back to ours or this would be 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.349
 the result of the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.720
 what I've done is worth this is gold 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:39.510
 then you have to filter 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.110
 this resolution somehow 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.060
 filter it and stay in the filter 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.330
 single 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.450
 these connections and it does not matter if you want 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.489
 At the bottom you can see that they are 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.430
 plastic pieces of headdresses 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.480
 Of course it does not matter if in the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.510
 filter is left 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.209
 the achievement with the support is plastic 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.400
 it does not matter while the son of 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.629
 this 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.709
 it's good to see if I find a filter 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:15.890
 because now I do not have any filter 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.709
 that you can separate so you can capture 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.590
 those little pieces although we are not either 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:25.440
 small but I need a filter 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:30.060
 to let the liquid pass and that 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.290
 I keep those connectors and then 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:38.700
 after filtering everything that is left 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.160
 plastic plus these golden connections the 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.430
 we went through water region we passed by 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.120
 water regia then we follow the steps 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.550
 always 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.080
 neutralized 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.760
 you give me potassium bisulfite and point 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.970
 good ya 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.909
 I have already filtered it at the end it works with 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.470
 a filter of normal paper of the 2003 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:08.260
 always and here we have what are the 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.270
 part 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.780
 of plastics worth 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.720
 of the fences 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.079
 and here is what is achieved 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.079
 the sockets 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.360
 as they go floating they separate very easy 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:29.390
 of the plastics because they are floating 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.390
 then you can go to the filter 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.460
 and the liquid in the glass 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.400
 and the liquid goes along with the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.050
 with the gold contacts because as they go 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.930
 floating they go together it filters and then it 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.740
 recover he 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.680
 this gold is recovered and passed through water 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.289
 regia 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.760
 nitric acid hydrochloric acid and then 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:00.300
 the next steps 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:03.949
 so here I leave you 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.949
 with this ministerial 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.620
 and if you have any doubt any comment 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.860
 as the question can do in the 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.860
 channel
