00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.400
 Polyclinic doctors number 46 of the city of Ufa 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.990
 new features have recently appeared 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.969
 medical institutions equipped 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.610
 computer tomograph third 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.010
 generations this system is most suitable 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.550
 for brain research and everything 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.160
 bodies 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.910
 thanks to a new tomograph from specialists 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
 polyclinics 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.820
 can now accurately measure dimensions and 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.180
 volumes of pathological neoplasms 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.710
 glinka 46 get us frisky 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.260
 company computer tomograph 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.160
 which allows you to taste any organs 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.860
 and the system also purchased an injector 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.990
 which allows for research 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.860
 with contras and contrasting on 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.150
 revealing 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.850
 early pathology is also late pathology 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.190
 metastatic lesions of any organs 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.480
 and systems 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.710
 the device is still pretty modern 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.239
 Toshiba's latest development 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.040
 Toshiba CT scanner refers to 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.439
 third generation systems with 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.299
 continuous rotation on this setting 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.659
 can explore the osteo-articular 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.210
 apparatus 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.679
 bones of the skull brain organs 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.780
 chest and abdominal cavity 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:16.700
 as well as the pelvic organs and not 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.829
 abdominal space besides 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.869
 the listed installation options 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.499
 allows you to produce a contrast 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.319
 study 

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:26.090
 this is angiography of the main brain and 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.700
 peripheral arteries to this 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.829
 studies of the liver and spleen and much 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.689
 other in this case we see on 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.079
 patient study monitor 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.710
 whose neurologist suspects some 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.229
 vascular diseases 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.690
 we shot with contrasting patients 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.550
 here you can see the work of the neck vessels 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.310
 vertebrae can be seen by contrast 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.110
 cervical that is very so voluminous 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.210
 study informative for 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.580
 a clinician for a doctor then we are glasses 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.119
 can be printed and doctors can already 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.159
 see a review of the body's work 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.310
 patient in this case the patient 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.090
 no pathology detected 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.100
 CT scanner is not 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.350
 the only modern equipment 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.300
 in the arsenal of experts 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.730
 clinics here created a whole 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.950
 Department of introscopy which includes 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.709
 ultrasound x-ray diagnostics 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.340
 research others 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.140
 high tech medical 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.940
 equipment guarantees to patients 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.880
 high quality research 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.720
 reliability of the results 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.610
 maximum accurate localization 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.489
 pathological process 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.620
 now to the population attached for 46 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.510
 Polyclinic is also available computer 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.489
 tomography however on a fee basis 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.130
 get tested on a new device 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.519
 everyone can cost 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.840
 research from 2000 rubles 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.180
 pensioners are given a discount 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.260
 You can make an appointment through a single
