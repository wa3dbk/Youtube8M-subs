00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
current sharpness I'll probably sharpen

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.590 
current sharpness I'll probably sharpen
it<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.380> little<00:01:46.530> bit<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.310> cuz<00:01:48.180> about<00:01:48.479> as

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
it up a little bit but cuz about as

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.359 
it up a little bit but cuz about as
sharp<00:01:48.750> as<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> rest<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> my<00:01:49.290> Condor<00:01:49.710> line<00:01:49.890> has

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
sharp as the rest of my Condor line has

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.340 
sharp as the rest of my Condor line has
what<00:01:50.579> they<00:01:50.670> call<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.970> natural<00:01:51.270> finish<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.200> so

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
what they call a natural finish on it so

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.080 
what they call a natural finish on it so
it<00:01:52.439> looks<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.680> little<00:01:52.770> rough<00:01:53.100> frankly<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:54.030> I

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
it looks a little rough frankly but I

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.580 
it looks a little rough frankly but I
think<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.329> looks<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.479> little<00:01:54.540> cool<00:01:54.780> also<00:01:55.170> as

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
think it looks a little cool also as

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.859 
think it looks a little cool also as
well<00:01:55.799> hopefully<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.909> camera<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.450> pick<00:01:57.479> that

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
well hopefully the camera can pick that

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.319 
well hopefully the camera can pick that
up<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:59.250> see<00:01:59.340> Condor<00:01:59.880> there<00:02:02.270> there's<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
up you can see Condor there there's the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.639 
up you can see Condor there there's the
back<00:02:03.509> side<00:02:03.810> again<00:02:04.610> natural

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.160 

obviously<00:02:08.649> like<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.550> Bushmen<00:02:09.970> it's<00:02:10.660> a<00:02:10.810> single

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
obviously like the Bushmen it's a single

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.320 
obviously like the Bushmen it's a single
piece<00:02:11.349> of<00:02:11.650> steel<00:02:12.580> that's<00:02:12.849> been<00:02:12.940> rolled<00:02:13.209> around

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
piece of steel that's been rolled around

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.559 
piece of steel that's been rolled around
now<00:02:14.080> unlike<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.730> Bushmen<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:16.120> can<00:02:16.269> see<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
now unlike the Bushmen you can see the

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.330 
now unlike the Bushmen you can see the
seam<00:02:16.750> on<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.349> don't<00:02:17.680> know<00:02:17.830> if<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.040> camera

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
seam on this I don't know if the camera

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.330 
seam on this I don't know if the camera
is<00:02:18.370> gonna<00:02:18.550> be<00:02:18.670> able<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.819> pick<00:02:18.970> that<00:02:19.000> up

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
is gonna be able to pick that up

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.440 
is gonna be able to pick that up
particularly<00:02:21.340> well<00:02:21.550> he'll<00:02:21.910> think<00:02:22.060> see<00:02:22.239> there

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
particularly well he'll think see there

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.360 
particularly well he'll think see there
you<00:02:22.569> go<00:02:22.780> if<00:02:23.410> we<00:02:23.620> can<00:02:23.709> see<00:02:23.799> the<00:02:23.920> seam<00:02:24.129> right

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
you go if we can see the seam right

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.699 
you go if we can see the seam right
there<00:02:24.549> see<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.849> just<00:02:25.030> fine<00:02:25.349> one<00:02:26.349> thing<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.620> is

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
there see it just fine one thing that is

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.020 
there see it just fine one thing that is
different<00:02:26.860> this<00:02:27.160> does<00:02:27.310> not<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.640> truly

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
different this does not have a truly

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.660 
different this does not have a truly
rounded<00:02:28.510> handle<00:02:28.920> it's<00:02:29.920> more<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.280> an<00:02:30.340> oval

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
rounded handle it's more of an oval

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.880 
rounded handle it's more of an oval
shape<00:02:30.940> if<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.209> can<00:02:31.360> see<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.750> there<00:02:32.049> I<00:02:32.260> like

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
shape if you can see that there I like

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.280 
shape if you can see that there I like
that<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.489> don't<00:02:33.549> like<00:02:33.879> it<00:02:33.910> um<00:02:34.299> might<00:02:35.140> be

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290

wrapped<00:03:28.569> very<00:03:28.840> nicely<00:03:28.989> with<00:03:29.290> this<00:03:29.380> green

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
wrapped very nicely with this green

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.370 
wrapped very nicely with this green
paracord<00:03:30.130> you<00:03:30.190> can<00:03:30.280> see<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.489> right<00:03:30.670> there

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
paracord you can see that right there

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
paracord you can see that right there
feels<00:03:32.380> fairly<00:03:32.590> good<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.889> hand<00:03:33.040> gives<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.280> lot

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
feels fairly good the hand gives a lot

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.099 
feels fairly good the hand gives a lot
better<00:03:33.700> traction<00:03:34.239> in<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.420> raw<00:03:34.569> metal<00:03:34.810> of

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
better traction in the raw metal of

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.650 
better traction in the raw metal of
course<00:03:35.440> but<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:36.459> adds<00:03:36.639> thickness<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.299> this

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
course but it adds thickness and this

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.990 
course but it adds thickness and this
thing<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.139> quite<00:03:38.919> a<00:03:38.980> bit<00:03:39.160> thick<00:03:39.310> on<00:03:39.489> its<00:03:39.639> own

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
thing is quite a bit thick on its own

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.580 
thing is quite a bit thick on its own
partially<00:03:40.389> due<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.750> shape<00:03:41.169> of<00:03:41.260> this<00:03:41.380> thing

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
partially due to the shape of this thing

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.379 
partially due to the shape of this thing
I<00:03:41.709> think<00:03:41.919> so<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.130> fills<00:03:42.340> in<00:03:42.459> hand<00:03:42.730> I've<00:03:43.120> got

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
I think so it fills in hand I've got

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.289 
I think so it fills in hand I've got
average<00:03:43.810> sized<00:03:44.049> hands<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.739> would<00:03:45.489> say<00:03:45.880> this<00:03:46.120> is

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
average sized hands I would say this is

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.629 
average sized hands I would say this is
on<00:03:46.419> the<00:03:46.510> upper<00:03:46.959> side<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.620> comfortable<00:03:48.370> as<00:03:48.459> far

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
on the upper side of comfortable as far

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.979 
on the upper side of comfortable as far
as<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.819> width<00:03:48.970> of<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.269> goes<00:03:49.450> as<00:03:49.660> far<00:03:49.840> as<00:03:49.900> me

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
as the width of it goes as far as me

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.830 
as the width of it goes as far as me
it's<00:03:50.109> fine<00:03:50.319> I<00:03:50.560> can<00:03:50.799> use<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.480> not<00:03:52.480> quite<00:03:52.720> as

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
it's fine I can use it not quite as

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.289 
it's fine I can use it not quite as
comfortable<00:03:53.109> as<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:53.709> would<00:03:53.889> expect<00:03:54.340> as<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:54.970> think

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
comfortable as I would expect as I think

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.520 
comfortable as I would expect as I think
maybe<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.569> little<00:03:55.840> bit<00:03:55.959> smaller<00:03:56.230> if<00:03:56.349> they<00:03:56.410> get

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
maybe a little bit smaller if they get

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.780 
maybe a little bit smaller if they get
rounded<00:03:56.829> out<00:03:56.980> make<00:03:57.190> a<00:03:57.220> little<00:03:57.340> bit<00:03:57.489> thinner

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
rounded out make a little bit thinner

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.879 
rounded out make a little bit thinner
here<00:03:58.090> might<00:03:58.690> be<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.810> little<00:03:58.930> better<00:03:59.079> I'm<00:03:59.650> sure

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
here might be a little better I'm sure

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.520 
here might be a little better I'm sure
we<00:04:00.269> thinner<00:04:01.269> with<00:04:01.480> paracord<00:04:01.959> off<00:04:02.109> but<00:04:02.349> you

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
we thinner with paracord off but you

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.069 
we thinner with paracord off but you
wouldn't<00:04:02.769> have<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:02.980> grip<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:03.780> maybe<00:04:04.780> taking

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
wouldn't have the grip so maybe taking

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.569 
wouldn't have the grip so maybe taking
the<00:04:05.139> pear-port<00:04:05.530> off<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:06.040> wrapping<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.400> with

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
the pear-port off and wrapping it with

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.190 
the pear-port off and wrapping it with
some<00:04:06.819> tennis<00:04:07.329> racket<00:04:07.630> tape<00:04:07.780> or<00:04:07.959> something

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
some tennis racket tape or something

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.990 
some tennis racket tape or something
like<00:04:08.290> that<00:04:08.349> if<00:04:09.040> you've<00:04:09.250> got<00:04:09.370> smaller<00:04:09.669> hands

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
like that if you've got smaller hands

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.990 
like that if you've got smaller hands
might<00:04:10.450> be<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.690> decent<00:04:11.139> idea<00:04:11.230> now<00:04:12.160> this<00:04:12.849> is

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
might be a decent idea now this is

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.610 
might be a decent idea now this is
secured<00:04:13.359> very<00:04:13.569> well<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:13.989> wrapped<00:04:14.139> very<00:04:14.380> tight

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
secured very well and wrapped very tight

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.740 
secured very well and wrapped very tight
with<00:04:14.799> paracord<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.370> like<00:04:15.489> that<00:04:15.670> a<00:04:15.700> lot<00:04:15.969> one

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
with paracord I like that a lot one

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.149 
with paracord I like that a lot one
thing<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:16.989> I<00:04:17.169> thought<00:04:17.349> was<00:04:17.500> interesting<00:04:17.650> and

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:18.159 
thing that I thought was interesting and

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.310 
thing that I thought was interesting and
didn't<00:04:18.579> necessarily<00:04:18.700> like

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
didn't necessarily like

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.830 
didn't necessarily like
little<00:04:20.590> hangtag<00:04:20.950> here<00:04:21.490> the<00:04:21.640> paracord<00:04:22.060> out<00:04:22.240> the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
little hangtag here the paracord out the

little hangtag here the paracord out the
backside<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:24.120> hollowness<00:04:25.120> of<00:04:25.240> the<00:04:25.300> grip

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
backside to hollowness of the grip

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.960 
backside to hollowness of the grip
that's<00:04:26.170> okay<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.530> can<00:04:26.650> get<00:04:26.890> to<00:04:27.040> it<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:27.250> cut

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
that's okay you can get to it and cut

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.610 
that's okay you can get to it and cut
off<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.210> knot<00:04:28.390> and<00:04:28.570> unwrap<00:04:29.080> this<00:04:29.290> thing<00:04:29.500> if

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
off the knot and unwrap this thing if

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.250 
off the knot and unwrap this thing if
you<00:04:29.710> need<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:31.240> get<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.390> your<00:04:31.540> paracord<00:04:32.020> but

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
you need to to get to your paracord but

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.620 
you need to to get to your paracord but
I<00:04:32.530> have<00:04:33.430> secured<00:04:33.760> other<00:04:33.940> paracord<00:04:34.420> something

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
I have secured other paracord something

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.970 
I have secured other paracord something
probably<00:04:34.900> not<00:04:35.110> going<00:04:35.260> to<00:04:35.350> use<00:04:35.470> this<00:04:35.620> amount<00:04:35.920> of

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
probably not going to use this amount of

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.080 
probably not going to use this amount of
prepare<00:04:36.220> for<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.430> don't<00:04:36.490> know<00:04:36.640> exactly<00:04:36.760> how

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
prepare for I don't know exactly how

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.320 
prepare for I don't know exactly how
much<00:04:37.390> that<00:04:37.690> is<00:04:37.900> but<00:04:38.160> one<00:04:39.160> thing<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.520> think<00:04:39.790> might

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
much that is but one thing I think might

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330 
much that is but one thing I think might
be<00:04:40.360> a<00:04:40.510> nice<00:04:40.630> addition<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:41.320> this<00:04:41.470> instead<00:04:42.190> of

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
be a nice addition to this instead of

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.640 
be a nice addition to this instead of
having<00:04:42.550> just<00:04:42.730> this<00:04:43.150> little<00:04:43.330> string<00:04:44.050> tag

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
having just this little string tag

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.440 
having just this little string tag
hanging<00:04:45.190> out<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.700> backside<00:04:45.910> which<00:04:46.300> I<00:04:46.390> don't

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
hanging out the backside which I don't

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.810 
hanging out the backside which I don't
think<00:04:46.630> looks<00:04:46.960> all<00:04:47.140> that<00:04:47.320> great<00:04:47.620> is<00:04:48.250> a<00:04:48.310> loop

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
think looks all that great is a loop

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.370 
think looks all that great is a loop
why<00:04:49.120> couldn't<00:04:49.330> you<00:04:49.450> made<00:04:49.660> this<00:04:49.810> paracord<00:04:50.350> a

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
why couldn't you made this paracord a

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.230 
why couldn't you made this paracord a
little<00:04:50.530> bit<00:04:50.620> longer<00:04:50.800> looped<00:04:51.520> it<00:04:51.640> around<00:04:51.730> since

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
little bit longer looped it around since

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.540 
little bit longer looped it around since
you<00:04:52.360> could<00:04:52.510> have<00:04:52.660> something<00:04:52.930> like<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.110> lanyard

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
you could have something like a lanyard

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.860 
you could have something like a lanyard
to<00:04:54.550> wrap<00:04:54.700> around<00:04:54.730> your<00:04:55.060> hand<00:04:55.330> when<00:04:55.480> your<00:04:55.570> baton

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
to wrap around your hand when your baton

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.960 
to wrap around your hand when your baton
something<00:04:56.260> like<00:04:56.410> that<00:04:56.650> or<00:04:57.460> just<00:04:57.520> using<00:04:57.820> this

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
something like that or just using this

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.850 
something like that or just using this
for<00:04:58.120> hibbity<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.540> use<00:04:58.720> I<00:04:58.900> think<00:04:59.170> turning<00:04:59.530> this

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.740 
for hibbity to use I think turning this
into<00:05:00.280> a<00:05:00.430> lanyard<00:05:00.700> would<00:05:01.090> be<00:05:01.210> a<00:05:01.240> much<00:05:01.570> better

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
into a lanyard would be a much better

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.830 
into a lanyard would be a much better
idea<00:05:01.900> overall<00:05:02.650> in<00:05:02.860> my<00:05:02.920> opinion<00:05:03.820> again<00:05:04.360> I've

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
idea overall in my opinion again I've

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.210 
idea overall in my opinion again I've
not<00:05:04.960> used<00:05:05.200> this<00:05:05.350> yet<00:05:05.560> but<00:05:05.710> that's<00:05:05.800> my<00:05:05.980> fir

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
not used this yet but that's my fir

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.130 
not used this yet but that's my fir
first<00:05:06.850> impressions<00:05:07.420> when<00:05:07.570> I<00:05:07.600> saw<00:05:07.810> this<00:05:07.990> thing

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
first impressions when I saw this thing

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.700 
first impressions when I saw this thing
Wow

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
Wow

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.650 
Wow
just<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.250> few<00:05:09.580> inches<00:05:09.760> more<00:05:09.970> pair<00:05:10.240> of<00:05:10.330> Khorkina

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
just a few inches more pair of Khorkina

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.330 
just a few inches more pair of Khorkina
had<00:05:10.870> something<00:05:11.140> even<00:05:11.290> more<00:05:11.530> workable<00:05:12.070> and

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
had something even more workable and

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.320 
had something even more workable and
more<00:05:12.940> utilitarian<00:05:13.450> so<00:05:14.160> anyway<00:05:15.180> looks<00:05:16.180> like<00:05:16.300> a

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
more utilitarian so anyway looks like a

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.240 
more utilitarian so anyway looks like a
nice<00:05:16.510> blade<00:05:16.780> overall<00:05:17.170> like<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:17.950> rest<00:05:18.100> of<00:05:18.160> the

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
nice blade overall like the rest of the

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.190 
nice blade overall like the rest of the
Condor<00:05:18.610> line<00:05:18.760> comes<00:05:19.660> with<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:19.840> very<00:05:20.020> nice

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
Condor line comes with a very nice

Condor line comes with a very nice
leather<00:05:20.410> sheath<00:05:20.740> very<00:05:21.670> different<00:05:22.030> than<00:05:22.150> the

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
Condor there on it just got your swivel

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.620 
Condor there on it just got your swivel

here on the back side with your loops
hopefully<00:05:29.050> you<00:05:29.110> see<00:05:29.290> that<00:05:29.470> right<00:05:29.650> there<00:05:29.710> just

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160

gravity is gonna hold this thing in the

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
most primarily but it's big enough and

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.170 
most primarily but it's big enough and
heavy<00:05:46.900> enough<00:05:47.140> of<00:05:47.350> a<00:05:47.410> blade<00:05:47.680> at<00:05:48.250> 1.4<00:05:48.940> pounds

heavy enough of a blade at 1.4 pounds
that<00:05:49.810> I'm<00:05:49.930> really<00:05:50.320> not<00:05:50.440> gonna<00:05:50.590> worry<00:05:50.830> about

that I'm really not gonna worry about

that I'm really not gonna worry about
this<00:05:51.130> thing<00:05:51.190> sliding<00:05:51.910> out<00:05:52.000> on<00:05:52.150> me<00:05:52.270> too<00:05:52.420> easy<00:05:52.630> if

this thing sliding out on me too easy if

this thing sliding out on me too easy if
this<00:05:53.290> did<00:05:53.440> happen<00:05:53.680> to<00:05:53.740> flip<00:05:53.920> upside<00:05:54.280> down<00:05:54.310> by

this did happen to flip upside down by

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.730 
this did happen to flip upside down by
some<00:05:55.060> strange<00:05:55.330> reason<00:05:55.660> might<00:05:56.080> it<00:05:56.170> fall<00:05:56.410> out<00:05:58.740> it

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
some strange reason might it fall out it

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.590 
some strange reason might it fall out it
might<00:05:59.980> it<00:06:00.550> could<00:06:00.820> especially<00:06:01.060> bang<00:06:01.420> up

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
might it could especially bang up

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.700 
might it could especially bang up
against<00:06:01.870> something<00:06:02.050> that<00:06:02.200> may<00:06:02.290> come<00:06:02.500> loose

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
against something that may come loose

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.530 
against something that may come loose
I'm<00:06:03.070> not<00:06:03.250> real<00:06:03.580> worried<00:06:03.910> about<00:06:04.090> that<00:06:04.330> with<00:06:04.510> a

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
I'm not real worried about that with a

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.870 
I'm not real worried about that with a
blade<00:06:04.780> this<00:06:04.960> size<00:06:05.230> this<00:06:05.590> length<00:06:05.890> probably<00:06:06.760> not

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
blade this size this length probably not

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.090 
blade this size this length probably not
gonna<00:06:06.970> flip<00:06:07.210> around<00:06:07.330> the<00:06:07.540> wrong<00:06:07.690> way<00:06:08.010> but<00:06:09.010> no

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
gonna flip around the wrong way but no

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.440 
gonna flip around the wrong way but no
other<00:06:09.280> way<00:06:09.400> to<00:06:09.460> secure<00:06:09.790> this<00:06:09.940> or<00:06:10.120> attach<00:06:10.300> it

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
other way to secure this or attach it

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.930 
other way to secure this or attach it
down<00:06:10.770> just<00:06:11.770> fits<00:06:12.010> in<00:06:12.100> there<00:06:12.190> by<00:06:12.310> friction<00:06:12.730> and

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
down just fits in there by friction and

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.060 
down just fits in there by friction and
it's<00:06:13.210> heavy<00:06:13.450> enough<00:06:13.510> to<00:06:13.660> hold<00:06:13.840> itself<00:06:14.110> in<00:06:14.350> big

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
it's heavy enough to hold itself in big

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.010 
it's heavy enough to hold itself in big
blade<00:06:15.340> not<00:06:15.820> for<00:06:16.030> your<00:06:16.150> average<00:06:16.330> user<00:06:16.690> I<00:06:16.870> would

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
blade not for your average user I would

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.470 
blade not for your average user I would
say<00:06:17.320> not<00:06:17.590> for<00:06:17.770> your<00:06:17.860> average<00:06:18.180> camping<00:06:19.180> trip

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
say not for your average camping trip

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.170 
say not for your average camping trip
this<00:06:19.660> is<00:06:19.900> for<00:06:20.050> some<00:06:20.170> serious<00:06:20.560> work<00:06:20.770> but<00:06:21.550> so<00:06:21.940> far

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
this is for some serious work but so far

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.970 
this is for some serious work but so far
I<00:06:22.420> like<00:06:22.630> it<00:06:22.690> the<00:06:23.380> only<00:06:23.500> thing<00:06:23.710> I'm<00:06:23.830> not

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 
I like it the only thing I'm not

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.470 
I like it the only thing I'm not
thrilled<00:06:24.310> about<00:06:24.460> with<00:06:24.760> is<00:06:24.880> the<00:06:25.030> price<00:06:25.240> tag

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
thrilled about with is the price tag

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.810 
thrilled about with is the price tag
about<00:06:26.110> $44<00:06:26.890> I<00:06:27.040> think<00:06:27.250> I<00:06:27.280> got<00:06:27.430> this<00:06:27.520> from<00:06:27.640> knife

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
about $44 I think I got this from knife

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.879 
about $44 I think I got this from knife
centre<00:06:28.120> 443<00:06:29.080> something

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
centre 443 something

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.520 
centre 443 something
basically<00:06:30.159> $44<00:06:30.939> most<00:06:31.539> places<00:06:31.870> online<00:06:32.020> list<00:06:32.409> is

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
basically $44 most places online list is

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.610 
basically $44 most places online list is
44<00:06:32.979> so<00:06:33.219> that's<00:06:33.819> pretty<00:06:34.120> pricey<00:06:34.629> in<00:06:34.930> my<00:06:35.110> line<00:06:35.349> of

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
44 so that's pretty pricey in my line of

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.700 
44 so that's pretty pricey in my line of
thinking<00:06:35.979> anyway<00:06:36.580> for<00:06:36.849> a<00:06:37.379> fixed<00:06:38.379> blade<00:06:38.530> like

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
thinking anyway for a fixed blade like

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.510 
thinking anyway for a fixed blade like
