00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
branches clean up to heavier stuff you

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.439 
branches clean up to heavier stuff you
can<00:01:00.539> see<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.870> limb<00:01:01.620> right<00:01:01.739> there<00:01:02.390> this<00:01:03.390> is

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
can see the limb right there this is

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.210 
can see the limb right there this is
about<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.899> size<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> wood<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
about the size of the wood that the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.080 
about the size of the wood that the
hoodlum<00:01:05.519> works<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.880> well<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:07.790> kukuri<00:01:08.790> machete

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
hoodlum works on well and kukuri machete

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.030 
hoodlum works on well and kukuri machete
from<00:01:09.270> cold<00:01:09.540> steel<00:01:09.810> while<00:01:10.260> more<00:01:10.500> powerful

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
from cold steel while more powerful

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.630 
from cold steel while more powerful
really<00:01:11.869> isn't<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.229> any<00:01:13.380> more<00:01:13.590> benefits<00:01:14.100> wood

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
really isn't of any more benefits wood

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.820 
really isn't of any more benefits wood
like<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:14.990> because<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> hoodlum<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.530> able<00:01:16.740> to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
like this because the hoodlum is able to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.800 
like this because the hoodlum is able to
cut<00:01:16.979> through<00:01:17.220> all<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.030> little<00:01:18.119> branches<00:01:18.659> on

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
cut through all the little branches on

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.800 
cut through all the little branches on
this<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:19.590> stroke<00:01:19.890> anyway<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.509> extra

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
this in one stroke anyway so the extra

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.620 
this in one stroke anyway so the extra
power<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:23.159> kukuri<00:01:23.490> machete<00:01:23.850> or<00:01:24.420> say<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
power of the kukuri machete or say the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.510 
power of the kukuri machete or say the
Chris<00:01:24.840> Kane<00:01:24.990> survival<00:01:25.439> tool<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:26.369> isn't

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
Chris Kane survival tool really isn't

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.330 
Chris Kane survival tool really isn't
coming<00:01:26.640> into<00:01:26.939> play<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.890> other<00:01:29.009> thing<00:01:29.220> is

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
coming into play and the other thing is

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.190 
coming into play and the other thing is
there's<00:01:29.610> no<00:01:29.700> issue<00:01:29.909> with<00:01:30.150> handle<00:01:30.659> ergonomics

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
there's no issue with handle ergonomics

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.410 
there's no issue with handle ergonomics
or<00:01:31.650> security<00:01:32.220> when<00:01:32.790> you're<00:01:32.909> working<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.180> small

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
or security when you're working on small

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.690 
or security when you're working on small
wood<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> hoodlum<00:01:34.890> because

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
wood like this with the hoodlum because

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.920 
wood like this with the hoodlum because
the<00:01:35.790> amount<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:35.970> force<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.390> are<00:01:36.420> using<00:01:36.810> it's

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the amount of force they are using it's

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.230 
the amount of force they are using it's
so<00:01:37.049> light<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:38.520> don't<00:01:38.610> really<00:01:38.790> feel<00:01:39.030> any

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
so light you don't really feel any

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.219 
so light you don't really feel any
issues<00:01:39.509> with<00:01:39.659> feedback<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.899> just<00:01:42.899> doing<00:01:43.110> this

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
issues with feedback so just doing this

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.920 
issues with feedback so just doing this
type<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.619> wood<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.040> mean<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.549> only<00:01:44.810> goes<00:01:45.810> up

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
type of wood I mean this is only goes up

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.310 
type of wood I mean this is only goes up
to<00:01:46.079> about<00:01:46.229> an<00:01:46.350> inch<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.950> half<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.310> diameter

the<00:01:56.969> hoodlum<00:01:57.270> kind<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.659> works<00:01:57.810> fairly<00:01:58.079> well

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the hoodlum kind of works fairly well

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.800 
the hoodlum kind of works fairly well
and<00:01:59.070> there's<00:01:59.579> no<00:01:59.700> real<00:01:59.880> advantage<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.420> taking

a blade it has a bit more power like

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.789 
a blade it has a bit more power like

something<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.459> cane<00:02:08.929> because<00:02:09.929> it

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
something like the cane because it

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.339 
something like the cane because it
really<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> much<00:02:10.590> benefit<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.220> working<00:02:11.700> with

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
really is a much benefit to working with

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.940 
really is a much benefit to working with
larger<00:02:13.349> blades<00:02:13.560> because

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
larger blades because

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.740 
larger blades because
hoodlum<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.310> handling<00:02:14.670> I'll<00:02:15.240> just<00:02:15.510> clean<00:02:15.720> up

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
hoodlum is handling I'll just clean up

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.470 
hoodlum is handling I'll just clean up
and<00:02:16.020> down<00:02:16.110> one<00:02:16.319> shop<00:02:16.560> anyway<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:18.030> only<00:02:18.150> thing

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
and down one shop anyway the only thing

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.880 
and down one shop anyway the only thing
that<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:18.630> found<00:02:18.930> was<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.200> again<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.739> I'll

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
that I found was that again and I'll

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.470 
that I found was that again and I'll
just<00:02:20.010> go<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.220> on<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.400> handle<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:21.770> can<00:02:22.770> see<00:02:26.480> so

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
just go in on the handle you can see so

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.880 
just go in on the handle you can see so
you<00:02:27.510> can<00:02:27.750> see<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:27.959> put<00:02:28.260> like<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> little<00:02:28.739> knot

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
you can see I put like a little knot

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.590 
you can see I put like a little knot
there<00:02:29.160> down<00:02:29.640> at<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.790> end<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.090> handle<00:02:30.420> and

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
there down at the end of the handle and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.570 
there down at the end of the handle and
that's<00:02:31.350> roughly<00:02:31.620> where<00:02:31.890> my<00:02:32.040> hand<00:02:32.370> would<00:02:32.550> be

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
that's roughly where my hand would be

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.740 
that's roughly where my hand would be
wait<00:02:33.569> at<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.810> end<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:36.239> problem<00:02:36.630> is

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
wait at the end of that the problem is

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.440 
wait at the end of that the problem is
though<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:36.930> found<00:02:37.290> again<00:02:37.970> I'm<00:02:38.970> tending<00:02:39.330> to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
though I found again I'm tending to

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.449 
though I found again I'm tending to
shift<00:02:39.690> back<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.200> almost<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.560> three<00:02:40.800> finger<00:02:41.010> trip

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
shift back to almost a three finger trip

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.400 
shift back to almost a three finger trip
because<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.209> blade<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.450> just<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:42.900> light<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
because the blade is just so light and

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.050 
because the blade is just so light and
that's<00:02:44.099> more<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.459> personal<00:02:44.819> preference

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
that's more of a personal preference

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.120 
that's more of a personal preference
issue<00:02:45.420> for<00:02:45.599> me<00:02:45.720> I'm<00:02:46.170> used<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.530> more<00:02:46.769> heavier

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
issue for me I'm used to more heavier

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.130 
issue for me I'm used to more heavier
blades<00:02:47.400> played<00:02:47.700> with<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.910> bit<00:02:48.060> more<00:02:48.090> heft<00:02:48.450> so

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
blades played with a bit more heft so

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.449 
blades played with a bit more heft so
I'm<00:02:49.260> just<00:02:49.410> trying<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.709> recapture<00:02:50.069> that<00:02:50.310> by

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
I'm just trying to recapture that by

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.090 
I'm just trying to recapture that by
shifting<00:02:50.519> back<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.110> hoodlum<00:02:52.440> but

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
shifting back and the hoodlum but

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.470 
shifting back and the hoodlum but
there's<00:02:53.250> really<00:02:53.400> no<00:02:53.610> need<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.850> be<00:02:54.060> doing<00:02:54.360> it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
there's really no need to be doing it

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.720 
there's really no need to be doing it
with<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.810> full<00:02:55.080> grip<00:02:55.319> right<00:02:55.920> up<00:02:56.040> close<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.580> the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
with a full grip right up close to the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.150 
with a full grip right up close to the
guard<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.450> still<00:02:57.720> has<00:02:57.840> enough<00:02:57.870> power<00:02:58.319> using

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
guard it still has enough power using

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.949 
guard it still has enough power using
the<00:02:59.250> tip<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.970> cut<00:03:00.000> through<00:03:00.330> this<00:03:00.510> wood<00:03:00.750> and

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
the tip to cut through this wood and

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.900 
the tip to cut through this wood and
that's<00:03:01.560> one<00:03:01.769> of<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.950> interesting<00:03:02.040> points<00:03:02.760> is

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
that's one of the interesting points is

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.590 
that's one of the interesting points is
that<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.930> tip<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:05.010> index<00:03:05.340> finger<00:03:05.459> on<00:03:05.910> the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
that the tip and the index finger on the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.570 
that the tip and the index finger on the
handle<00:03:06.989> are<00:03:07.319> two<00:03:07.530> pivot<00:03:07.860> points<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.310> that's

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
handle are two pivot points and that's

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.640 
handle are two pivot points and that's
usually<00:03:08.730> kind<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.180> rare<00:03:09.330> on<00:03:09.750> long<00:03:10.170> blades<00:03:10.440> like

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
usually kind of rare on long blades like

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.900 
usually kind of rare on long blades like
this<00:03:10.799> but<00:03:11.010> that's<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.280> way<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.519> woodland<00:03:11.790> is

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
this but that's the way the woodland is

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.860 
this but that's the way the woodland is
actually<00:03:12.209> balanced<00:03:14.269> so<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:15.299> move<00:03:15.450> down<00:03:15.600> some

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
actually balanced so I move down some

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.220 
actually balanced so I move down some
heavier<00:03:16.230> would<00:03:17.870> check<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.959> difference

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
heavier would check the difference

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.190 
heavier would check the difference
between<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.799> hoodlum<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:21.750> cold<00:03:21.959> steel

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
between the hoodlum and the cold steel

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.810 
between the hoodlum and the cold steel
cookery<00:03:22.620> machete<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:25.519> kakari<00:03:26.519> machete

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
cookery machete and kakari machete

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.750 
cookery machete and kakari machete
starts<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.209> pull<00:03:27.359> ahead<00:03:28.070> significantly<00:03:29.070> and

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
starts to pull ahead significantly and

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.420 
starts to pull ahead significantly and
would<00:03:30.060> about<00:03:30.989> this<00:03:31.170> size

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.120 

so<00:03:37.430> you<00:03:37.520> can<00:03:37.640> see<00:03:37.790> over<00:03:37.820> here<00:03:38.500> I've<00:03:39.500> used<00:03:39.560> scary

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
so you can see over here I've used scary

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.830 
so you can see over here I've used scary
machete<00:03:40.460> filling<00:03:41.120> out<00:03:41.210> this<00:03:41.390> tree

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
machete filling out this tree

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.980 
machete filling out this tree
and<00:03:42.020> I've<00:03:42.830> even<00:03:44.380> cut<00:03:45.380> off<00:03:45.410> ones<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:45.950> larger<00:03:46.990> Fork

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
and I've even cut off ones a larger Fork

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.310 
and I've even cut off ones a larger Fork
points<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:50.690> is<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.900> kind<00:03:51.050> of<00:03:51.110> size

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
points this is the kind of size

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.670 
points this is the kind of size
difference<00:03:52.870> branches<00:03:53.870> like<00:03:54.020> this<00:03:54.080> we<00:03:54.560> are

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
difference branches like this we are

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.730 
difference branches like this we are
starting<00:03:54.860> to<00:03:55.070> approach<00:03:55.310> about<00:03:55.580> two<00:03:55.790> inches

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
starting to approach about two inches

the<00:03:57.740> kakari<00:03:58.070> machete<00:03:58.430> really<00:03:58.880> starts<00:03:59.480> to

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
the kakari machete really starts to

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.960 
the kakari machete really starts to
benefit<00:03:59.840> over<00:04:00.020> a<00:04:00.050> hoodlum<00:04:00.850> because<00:04:01.850> the

benefit over a hoodlum because the

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.990 
benefit over a hoodlum because the
hoodlum<00:04:02.270> is<00:04:02.390> now<00:04:02.540> taking<00:04:03.230> multiple<00:04:03.590> chops

that's<00:04:12.710> mainly<00:04:12.890> because<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:13.400> can<00:04:13.520> bring<00:04:13.700> more

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
that's mainly because you can bring more

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.100 
that's mainly because you can bring more
power<00:04:14.120> in<00:04:14.330> which<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:14.570> can<00:04:14.660> swing<00:04:14.870> from<00:04:15.050> the

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
power in which you can swing from the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.590 
power in which you can swing from the
elbow<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.590> swing<00:04:15.770> from<00:04:15.890> shoulder<00:04:16.480> but<00:04:17.480> with

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
elbow and swing from shoulder but with

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.580 
elbow and swing from shoulder but with
the<00:04:17.660> hoodlum<00:04:17.930> you<00:04:17.989> really<00:04:18.170> can't<00:04:18.380> there's<00:04:18.530> no

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
the hoodlum you really can't there's no

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.060 
the hoodlum you really can't there's no
benefit<00:04:22.780> so<00:04:23.780> here's<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.080> Chris<00:04:24.260> Kane<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:25.010> the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
benefit so here's the Chris Kane and the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.850 
benefit so here's the Chris Kane and the
cold<00:04:25.310> steel<00:04:25.520> cookery<00:04:26.000> machete<00:04:26.330> you<00:04:26.710> can<00:04:27.710> see

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
cold steel cookery machete you can see

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.120 
cold steel cookery machete you can see
how<00:04:27.950> similar<00:04:28.220> they<00:04:28.460> are<00:04:28.490> in<00:04:29.180> overall<00:04:29.660> shape

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
how similar they are in overall shape

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.230 
how similar they are in overall shape
the<00:04:31.130> main<00:04:31.280> difference<00:04:31.640> is<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.760> much<00:04:32.030> larger

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
the main difference is the much larger

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.530 
the main difference is the much larger
handle<00:04:32.780> on<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.500> cane<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:35.090> when<00:04:35.270> I<00:04:35.300> want<00:04:35.480> to

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
handle on the cane and when I want to

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.970 
handle on the cane and when I want to
grip<00:04:35.690> forward<00:04:36.050> on<00:04:36.140> the<00:04:36.230> cold<00:04:36.440> steel<00:04:36.620> cookery

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
grip forward on the cold steel cookery

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.670 
grip forward on the cold steel cookery
machete<00:04:37.340> I<00:04:37.580> have<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.420> use<00:04:38.600> this<00:04:38.840> little<00:04:39.050> index

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
machete I have to use this little index

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.430 
machete I have to use this little index
finger<00:04:40.040> choil<00:04:40.660> when<00:04:41.660> I<00:04:41.690> want<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:41.930> grip<00:04:42.080> forward

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
finger choil when I want to grip forward

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.080 
finger choil when I want to grip forward
on<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.650> cane<00:04:42.890> I'm<00:04:43.160> actually<00:04:43.370> up<00:04:43.669> around<00:04:43.940> the

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
on the cane I'm actually up around the

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.409 
on the cane I'm actually up around the
handle<00:04:44.390> itself<00:04:44.660> much<00:04:45.350> more<00:04:45.590> comfortable<00:04:47.440> so

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
handle itself much more comfortable so

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.200 
handle itself much more comfortable so
that's<00:04:50.419> all<00:04:50.570> that<00:04:50.780> wood<00:04:50.930> cleaned<00:04:51.200> up<00:04:52.150> now<00:04:53.150> the

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
that's all that wood cleaned up now the

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.690 
that's all that wood cleaned up now the
branch<00:04:53.510> is<00:04:53.660> over<00:04:53.840> here<00:04:53.990> disposed<00:04:54.410> of<00:04:54.700> this

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
branch is over here disposed of this

branch is over here disposed of this
cleaned<00:04:55.970> up<00:04:56.180> so<00:04:56.840> speaking<00:04:57.140> about<00:04:57.290> the<00:04:57.410> two<00:04:57.560> of

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
cleaned up so speaking about the two of

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.880 
cleaned up so speaking about the two of
these<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:59.840> main<00:05:00.050> difference<00:05:00.380> comes<00:05:00.590> into

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
these the main difference comes into

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.170 
these the main difference comes into
when<00:05:01.010> you're<00:05:01.070> working<00:05:01.400> in<00:05:01.490> relatively<00:05:01.970> thick

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
when you're working in relatively thick

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.210 
when you're working in relatively thick
wood<00:05:02.390> like<00:05:03.140> bodemer<00:05:03.530> actually<00:05:03.800> resting<00:05:04.070> on

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
wood like bodemer actually resting on

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.250 
wood like bodemer actually resting on
right<00:05:04.430> there<00:05:04.669> the<00:05:05.240> cane<00:05:05.450> will<00:05:05.600> be<00:05:05.690> more<00:05:05.870> fluid

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
right there the cane will be more fluid

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.520 
right there the cane will be more fluid
the<00:05:06.710> kakari<00:05:07.220> machete<00:05:07.520> will<00:05:07.700> bind<00:05:07.910> a<00:05:08.030> little

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
the kakari machete will bind a little

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.990 
the kakari machete will bind a little
but<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:09.620> main<00:05:09.800> difference<00:05:09.830> for<00:05:10.340> me<00:05:10.490> is<00:05:10.760> in

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
but the main difference for me is in

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.480 
but the main difference for me is in
terms<00:05:11.240> of<00:05:11.510> comfort<00:05:12.050> or<00:05:12.530> just<00:05:12.830> pleasure<00:05:13.280> and

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
terms of comfort or just pleasure and

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.159 
terms of comfort or just pleasure and
actually<00:05:13.760> using<00:05:14.060> it<00:05:14.150> to<00:05:14.270> curry<00:05:14.540> machete<00:05:14.930> wall

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
actually using it to curry machete wall

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.380 
actually using it to curry machete wall
is<00:05:15.260> a<00:05:15.320> very<00:05:15.530> functional<00:05:15.830> tool<00:05:16.190> it<00:05:16.730> handles<00:05:17.180> all

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
is a very functional tool it handles all

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.990 
is a very functional tool it handles all
about<00:05:17.990> 50%<00:05:18.590> of<00:05:18.710> this<00:05:18.800> heavier<00:05:19.130> work<00:05:19.400> right

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
about 50% of this heavier work right

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.120 
about 50% of this heavier work right
alongside<00:05:20.240> to<00:05:20.570> Chris<00:05:20.750> cane<00:05:21.020> and<00:05:21.320> aside<00:05:22.100> from

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
alongside to Chris cane and aside from

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.830 
alongside to Chris cane and aside from
the<00:05:22.520> few<00:05:22.700> points<00:05:22.880> where<00:05:23.120> it<00:05:23.240> actually<00:05:23.479> bound<00:05:23.690> a

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
the few points where it actually bound a

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.200 
the few points where it actually bound a
little<00:05:24.050> bit<00:05:24.169> in<00:05:24.350> terms<00:05:25.100> of<00:05:25.340> chopper<00:05:25.790> chopping

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
little bit in terms of chopper chopping

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.780 
little bit in terms of chopper chopping
fatigue<00:05:26.660> rates<00:05:26.960> they<00:05:27.110> were<00:05:27.200> very<00:05:27.380> similar<00:05:27.790> but

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
fatigue rates they were very similar but

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.460 
fatigue rates they were very similar but
the<00:05:28.880> Chris<00:05:29.060> Cain<00:05:29.300> has<00:05:29.479> a<00:05:29.510> much<00:05:29.720> larger<00:05:29.930> handle

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
the Chris Cain has a much larger handle

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.159 
the Chris Cain has a much larger handle
the<00:05:31.250> extra<00:05:31.400> forward<00:05:32.000> weight<00:05:32.270> allows<00:05:32.840> me<00:05:33.050> to

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
the extra forward weight allows me to

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.840 
the extra forward weight allows me to
use<00:05:33.200> a<00:05:33.320> different<00:05:33.680> muscle<00:05:33.830> group<00:05:34.130> I<00:05:34.340> can<00:05:34.640> use

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
use a different muscle group I can use

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.000 
use a different muscle group I can use
more<00:05:35.090> of<00:05:35.120> my<00:05:35.300> shoulder<00:05:35.720> and<00:05:35.900> a<00:05:36.290> larger<00:05:36.710> sort<00:05:36.890> of

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
more of my shoulder and a larger sort of

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.570 
more of my shoulder and a larger sort of
swing<00:05:37.250> with<00:05:37.580> a<00:05:37.610> slower<00:05:37.910> sort<00:05:38.240> of<00:05:38.330> swing<00:05:38.570> so

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
swing with a slower sort of swing so

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.040 
swing with a slower sort of swing so
it's<00:05:40.580> a<00:05:40.640> much<00:05:40.790> more<00:05:40.970> enjoyable<00:05:41.150> experience<00:05:41.600> in

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
it's a much more enjoyable experience in

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.080 
it's a much more enjoyable experience in
terms<00:05:42.140> of<00:05:42.320> raw<00:05:42.500> functionality<00:05:43.310> they're

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
terms of raw functionality they're

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.850 
terms of raw functionality they're
extremely<00:05:44.630> close<00:05:44.900> and<00:05:45.110> as<00:05:45.350> I<00:05:45.410> said<00:05:45.470> with<00:05:45.770> the

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
extremely close and as I said with the

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.770 
extremely close and as I said with the
main<00:05:46.010> difference<00:05:46.310> being<00:05:46.460> binding<00:05:46.820> of<00:05:47.210> course

main difference being binding of course

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.060 
main difference being binding of course
decaying<00:05:48.080> there's<00:05:48.260> a<00:05:48.289> lot<00:05:48.440> stiffer<00:05:48.650> breaking

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070

decaying there's a lot stiffer breaking
a<00:05:49.130> firewood<00:05:49.490> and

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
a firewood and

but<00:05:57.409> in<00:05:57.499> terms<00:05:57.650> of<00:05:57.770> just<00:05:57.919> breaking<00:05:58.129> down<00:05:58.339> the

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
but in terms of just breaking down the

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.279 
but in terms of just breaking down the
wood<00:05:58.580> lending<00:05:58.879> it<00:05:58.939> out<00:05:59.029> felling<00:05:59.449> it<00:05:59.569> this<00:06:00.110> type

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
wood lending it out felling it this type

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.170 
wood lending it out felling it this type
of<00:06:00.319> stuff<00:06:00.620> they're<00:06:00.979> very<00:06:01.189> very<00:06:01.370> similar<00:06:01.759> again

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
of stuff they're very very similar again

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.480 
of stuff they're very very similar again
the<00:06:02.479> main<00:06:02.629> difference<00:06:02.990> is<00:06:03.139> the<00:06:03.169> handle<00:06:03.650> and<00:06:03.830> a

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
the main difference is the handle and a

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.189 
the main difference is the handle and a
much<00:06:04.669> heavier<00:06:04.939> cane<00:06:05.389> and<00:06:05.719> a<00:06:05.779> more<00:06:05.960> forward

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
much heavier cane and a more forward

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.049 
much heavier cane and a more forward
balance<00:06:06.710> allows<00:06:07.370> me<00:06:07.520> to<00:06:07.580> use<00:06:07.669> a<00:06:07.729> different

00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:08.059 
balance allows me to use a different

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:09.730 
balance allows me to use a different
muscle<00:06:08.210> group<00:06:08.539> so<00:06:08.960> the<00:06:09.050> fatigue<00:06:09.319> rate<00:06:09.589> in

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
muscle group so the fatigue rate in

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.200 
muscle group so the fatigue rate in
general<00:06:09.860> is<00:06:10.069> a<00:06:10.099> bit<00:06:10.219> lower<00:06:10.400> as<00:06:10.699> much<00:06:11.029> more

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
general is a bit lower as much more

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.059 
general is a bit lower as much more
comfortable<00:06:11.659> much<00:06:12.110> more<00:06:12.319> enjoyable<00:06:12.559> to<00:06:12.889> use

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:13.069 
comfortable much more enjoyable to use

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:14.499 
comfortable much more enjoyable to use
and<00:06:13.610> the<00:06:13.699> end<00:06:13.819> result<00:06:14.029> are<00:06:14.089> differences<00:06:14.389> as

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:14.509 
and the end result are differences as

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:15.640 
and the end result are differences as
well<00:06:14.599> like<00:06:14.749> the<00:06:14.809> sheath<00:06:14.990> on<00:06:15.110> the<00:06:15.199> cane<00:06:15.349> is<00:06:15.499> much

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
well like the sheath on the cane is much

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.559 
well like the sheath on the cane is much
better<00:06:15.800> a<00:06:16.610> bunch<00:06:16.939> of<00:06:17.029> other<00:06:17.180> things<00:06:17.360> you<00:06:17.449> can

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:17.569 
better a bunch of other things you can

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:18.999 
better a bunch of other things you can
see<00:06:17.659> the<00:06:17.719> tips<00:06:17.960> are<00:06:18.349> relatively<00:06:18.770> different

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 
see the tips are relatively different

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:21.429 
see the tips are relatively different
the<00:06:19.550> cane<00:06:19.729> has<00:06:19.909> a<00:06:19.939> much<00:06:20.180> heavier<00:06:20.719> shuffle

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:21.439 
the cane has a much heavier shuffle

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:23.679 
the cane has a much heavier shuffle
point<00:06:21.650> tip<00:06:21.889> much<00:06:22.789> better<00:06:22.999> for<00:06:23.300> digging<00:06:23.509> in

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:23.689 
point tip much better for digging in

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:25.809 
point tip much better for digging in
that<00:06:23.809> type<00:06:23.960> of<00:06:23.990> work<00:06:24.680> whereas<00:06:25.159> to<00:06:25.399> carry

that type of work whereas to carry

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:28.209 
that type of work whereas to carry
machete<00:06:26.120> has<00:06:26.719> a<00:06:26.749> much<00:06:26.990> point<00:06:27.259> ear<00:06:27.379> tip<00:06:27.620> so

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
machete has a much point ear tip so

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:29.769 
machete has a much point ear tip so
stabbing<00:06:28.639> penetration<00:06:29.120> is<00:06:29.180> much<00:06:29.210> higher<00:06:29.509> and

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:29.779 
stabbing penetration is much higher and

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:32.469 
stabbing penetration is much higher and
little<00:06:30.229> things<00:06:30.379> like<00:06:30.559> that<00:06:31.270> the<00:06:32.270> only

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
little things like that the only

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.570 
little things like that the only
complaint<00:06:33.020> I<00:06:33.199> have<00:06:33.409> about<00:06:33.740> the<00:06:34.159> cane<00:06:34.370> after

complaint I have about the cane after

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.600 
complaint I have about the cane after
working<00:06:34.849> with<00:06:34.999> it<00:06:35.680> recently<00:06:36.680> I<00:06:36.889> know<00:06:37.460> is<00:06:37.520> the

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
working with it recently I know is the

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.860 
working with it recently I know is the
same<00:06:37.759> thing<00:06:37.969> on<00:06:38.059> the<00:06:38.149> other<00:06:38.180> ones<00:06:38.449> that<00:06:38.569> I<00:06:38.659> had

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
same thing on the other ones that I had

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.839 
same thing on the other ones that I had
the<00:06:39.649> handle<00:06:39.979> comes<00:06:40.129> with<00:06:40.339> a<00:06:40.370> relatively<00:06:40.729> high

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849 
the handle comes with a relatively high

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:42.459 
the handle comes with a relatively high
polish<00:06:41.389> on<00:06:41.509> it<00:06:41.539> normally<00:06:41.990> that's<00:06:42.139> fairly

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:42.469 
polish on it normally that's fairly

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:44.860 
polish on it normally that's fairly
decent<00:06:42.939> but<00:06:43.939> today<00:06:44.240> there<00:06:44.479> was<00:06:44.569> some<00:06:44.749> snow

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
decent but today there was some snow

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.409 
decent but today there was some snow
coming<00:06:45.139> on<00:06:45.379> the<00:06:45.469> handle<00:06:45.860> my<00:06:46.759> hand<00:06:46.969> was<00:06:47.089> melting

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:47.419 
coming on the handle my hand was melting

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:49.839 
coming on the handle my hand was melting
snow<00:06:47.629> grip<00:06:48.499> was<00:06:48.649> getting<00:06:48.860> a<00:06:48.919> bit<00:06:49.069> wet<00:06:49.219> even

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:49.849 
snow grip was getting a bit wet even

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:51.189 
snow grip was getting a bit wet even
though<00:06:49.999> the<00:06:50.059> grip<00:06:50.240> got<00:06:50.389> a<00:06:50.419> very<00:06:50.599> nice<00:06:50.779> shape<00:06:51.020> to

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 
though the grip got a very nice shape to

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:54.129 
though the grip got a very nice shape to
it<00:06:51.229> in<00:06:52.069> general<00:06:52.460> is<00:06:52.550> moving<00:06:52.849> around<00:06:53.029> a<00:06:53.210> bit<00:06:53.509> too

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:54.139 
it in general is moving around a bit too

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.199 
it in general is moving around a bit too
much<00:06:54.319> for<00:06:54.379> me<00:06:54.649> so<00:06:54.830> I'd<00:06:55.370> like<00:06:55.520> this<00:06:55.699> handle<00:06:56.060> have

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:56.209 
much for me so I'd like this handle have

00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:57.489 
much for me so I'd like this handle have
a<00:06:56.240> bit<00:06:56.419> more<00:06:56.569> of<00:06:56.629> an<00:06:56.719> aggressive<00:06:56.779> texture<00:06:57.379> on

00:06:57.489 --> 00:06:57.499 
a bit more of an aggressive texture on

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:59.230 
a bit more of an aggressive texture on
it<00:06:57.529> that's<00:06:57.770> not<00:06:57.919> a<00:06:57.949> big<00:06:58.129> deal<00:06:58.310> I<00:06:58.520> can<00:06:59.029> rough<00:06:59.180> it

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 
it that's not a big deal I can rough it

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.540 
it that's not a big deal I can rough it
up<00:06:59.360> with<00:06:59.479> some<00:06:59.599> sandpaper<00:07:00.159> not<00:07:01.159> the<00:07:01.310> end<00:07:01.459> of

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.550 
up with some sandpaper not the end of

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.570 
up with some sandpaper not the end of
the<00:07:01.610> world<00:07:01.899> so<00:07:02.899> again<00:07:03.169> nice<00:07:04.039> little<00:07:04.279> stack<00:07:04.430> of

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
the world so again nice little stack of

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.010 
the world so again nice little stack of
wood<00:07:04.729> there<00:07:04.969> I<00:07:05.149> can<00:07:05.419> pick<00:07:05.539> that<00:07:05.569> up<00:07:05.719> later<00:07:05.959> on

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
wood there I can pick that up later on

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.829 
wood there I can pick that up later on
when<00:07:06.830> I'm<00:07:06.949> out<00:07:07.039> some<00:07:07.249> time<00:07:07.459> and<00:07:07.759> a<00:07:08.689> nice

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:08.839 
when I'm out some time and a nice

when I'm out some time and a nice

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:09.979 
enjoyable experience with tree

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:12.850 
enjoyable experience with tree
relatively<00:07:10.849> similar<00:07:11.060> but<00:07:11.860> relatively
