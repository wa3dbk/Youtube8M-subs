00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.410
 in this video it's about three rules 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.050
 which you should know him for a photo 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.050
 really cool to compose 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.840
 yes the composition and that's something 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.619
 very famous is there always say many 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.130
 people was that you composed well 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.869
 composition is actually wrong now 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.110
 composed or self-composed belief 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.210
 beautiful 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.070
 Definitely settle with three of them 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.660
 your picture can make it hornier if 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.370
 you keep to these rules but that 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.410
 good is really rules knows you can 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.850
 They also deliberately break the picture 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.800
 maybe even more interesting 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.680
 you get in the camera I'll show you 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.309
 many cameras have their live 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.750
 view and you can set lattice here 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.339
 by being live in the horny is the sixth 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.870
 even has such a cross lattice that has 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.970
 I believe the 600 that I or I have 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.949
 It never noticed it the first time 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.600
 this camera has turned on and 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.370
 I have activated this grid 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.070
 noticed this is the super-gau now has 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.809
 you almost all the lines you need 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.770
 for a good photo 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:08.170
 Let's start with the first rule 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.760
 first rule is probably the most often one hears 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.200
 sometimes also says golden cut 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.140
 where the golden cut yes so one 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.500
 weird mathematical formula is a + b 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.930
 by b is through whatever 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.700
 who knows only that one 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.539
 side should be bigger than the other 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.509
 side and then that is somehow 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.829
 harmonious and you often hear her say 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.680
 actually that one this screen 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.390
 behind or the picture in different 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.020
 Parts divides exactly in the new piece 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.759
 to be 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.039
 123 123 123 so nine and 13 33 and 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.020
 Now you can see the picture or the object 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.670
 you want to take pictures on the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.159
 man or that one steer the view 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.200
 want in one of these points is where 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.679
 Crosses one positioned end effect 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.560
 so roughly the golden cut or 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:56.170
 just how often does it pay attention 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.549
 For example, I have something up here 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.140
 for example, is always here 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.189
 down this this particle i do 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.780
 a bit lighter the exposure 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.740
 you can see that could be nice 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.740
 example here in the bottom 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.930
 third quasi are here 241 and has 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.060
 This is exactly where you put this bar 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.830
 It means a nice composition 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.630
 creates the quasi the probably on a permanent basis 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.310
 is can now do the same or above 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.290
 up here or down here 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.519
 or just directly on these lines 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.140
 on it comes probably on word two 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.060
 third rule and so on that one can 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.280
 also apply differently than over these 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.569
 lattice crosses with the lines 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.489
 This is often done in the 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.470
 Landscape photography , let's go again 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.810
 At the back of the display I would be here 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.130
 these lines and we have these lines 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.100
 here and in landscape photography 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.269
 it is often said that it is special 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.350
 harmonious if you either the 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.040
 horizon positioned in the upper line 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.510
 is called here 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.880
 if that's really cool 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.220
 from or at the bottom you became 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.400
 this time you know darker then you have 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.269
 up here, two thirds here a third 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.860
 instead of just being in the middle 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.840
 that means you do it 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.810
 somehow more interesting by doing that 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.459
 here or here positioned the famous 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.250
 two thirds rule in the 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.780
 landscape photography 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.640
 After these two rules with these lines 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.160
 of course they can be natural 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.709
 also the diagonal lines use for 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.250
 such a picture composition and find that 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.750
 I'm cool 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.190
 So why I do not know on the 600d 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.600
 also has or if there are other cameras too 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.739
 46 But the atzen I find that very 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.480
 very good is a used one too very 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.519
 Often we also have diagonally lying 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.519
 we can handle it 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.230
 such things that every line here every 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.430
 lines and would have diagonally which 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.489
 to the horizon for example on the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.010
 Diagonal line would be there then 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.090
 below the viewpoint or up here the 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.280
 I advise simply to serve 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.600
 Now you come here in the picture 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.190
 know exactly what a picture 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.530
 israel also made short light a 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.200
 bit sexy and what a blast 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.239
 moderate composition 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.639
 who exactly down here in the corner would be 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.410
 Of course, the sun would still be up here 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:04.609
 that we are such a composition that 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.319
 the dream composition of course it now 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.389
 consciously you can also use these 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.420
 line as helps accept and the whole 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:13.370
 just put a little bit higher 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.949
 and the view of the observer is very 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.940
 nice from top to bottom of the sky 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:22.410
 on the object below on the 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.440
 they govern everything in all three ways 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.360
 which one should keep in mind next to 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.450
 the rule of friends nervously informed 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.160
 and if you know these rules you can 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.660
 they also deliberately break and that 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.190
 is very very nice, or even aware of 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.100
 walls and control themselves 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.820
 I have this rule now 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.870
 followed, or perhaps made aware 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.280
 has gives the thumbs up if you 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.080
 to interest others as well as the topics 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.690
 post below in the comments which 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.580
 usually you use it most often post 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.990
 also like to bottom purely thumbs up 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.910
 subscribe subscribe 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.250
 share your friends and see you next 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.440
 I'm composing here now 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.440
 the ninth symphony of wars
