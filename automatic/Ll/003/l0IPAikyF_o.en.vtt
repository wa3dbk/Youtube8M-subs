00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.049
 a lot of attention because now it's time to talk 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.450
 from xbox one there has also been a lot 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.300
 debate a lot of controversy on the street about 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.759
 if the console can not show us 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.039
 almost never the 1080p resolution for 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.529
 can show games at 60 frames per 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.720
 second for example you have been questioned 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.910
 much to the console Microsoft is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.449
 He also said that when removing kinect it's worth 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.080
 that little part that 10% of gpu that 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.780
 released by microsoft since it would not be 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.370
 mandatory for developers is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.530
 he said that thanks to that then the games 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.570
 they would take advantage of a little more 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.329
 power of the console and they were going to be able 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.730
 achieve those resolutions that both 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.730
 the users of 1080p of 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.449
 resolution full hd voucher good attentive 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.390
 because blizzard says 1080p on xbox 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.010
 one are reached by the new sdk no 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.020
 by removing kinect is something that they have 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.820
 wanted to clarify and why do they say this to 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.280
 see even though there are developers 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.500
 who have tried using that extra 10% of 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.410
 gpu of the microsoft console 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.930
 neither managed to reach those drops of 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.450
 resolution they seek worth to maintain 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.950
 a good rate of images per second 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:21.100
 but apparently the new xbox sdk 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.550
 one the truth is that they are much improved 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.320
 It seems that they have been renovated a lot and 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.729
 they avoid bottlenecks that could 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.990
 have at the time of programming and others 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.540
 problems that they had to 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.240
 face the developers before 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.070
 Mr. mosqueira georges mosqueira for 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.070
 who does not know him is the chief designer 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.800
 of a title like devil 3 repair of 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.170
 souls ultimate and bosch edition the lord 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.270
 Mosqueira points out that both sony and 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.250
 microsoft have helped them a lot and that 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.280
 thanks to this devil 3 is going to receive 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.310
 in xbox one a launch patch that 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.649
 will allow the title to work at 1080p of 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.720
 resolution and this has nothing to do 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.509
 with free kinect or anything like that 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.369
 worth about 60 gigas of download 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.440
 digital version of playstation 4 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.570
 that has given so much to talk has wanted 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.399
 explain that it is due to the impossibility 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.739
 to be able to install only part of the game 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.480
 in consoles and that consequently 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.900
 they have 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.819
 to all languages ​​even if we do not go to 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.290
 use it in all languages I think 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.239
 that this is a planning failure 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.069
 Of course he explains that they are talking 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.110
 with sonny so that this is not so and 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.840
 to be able to leave it only in the 15 gb 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.019
 of the game with only one language but 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.019
 good until then, this is all 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.060
 what we know about this devil 3 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.670
 by the way it is already available so that 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.410
 who wants to buy it and I think that 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.510
 are more than interesting data those that 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.930
 this chief designer has left us 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.930
 game
