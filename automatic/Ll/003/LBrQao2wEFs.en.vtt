cell reception now in order for you to

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.060 
cell reception now in order for you to
get<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.240> depends<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.049> where<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.470> live<00:01:19.710> I

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070

live<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.790> New<00:01:20.880> York<00:01:21.090> City<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.689> basically<00:01:22.380> I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
live in New York City so basically I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.999 
live in New York City so basically I
guess<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:24.119> sprint<00:01:24.509> network<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:25.320> fully

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
guess the sprint network is fully

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.760 
guess the sprint network is fully
covered<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.759> New<00:01:26.909> York<00:01:27.090> City<00:01:27.409> you<00:01:28.409> may<00:01:28.560> get

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
covered in New York City you may get

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.890 
covered in New York City you may get
some<00:01:29.009> gaps<00:01:29.340> here<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.909> there<00:01:30.060> some<00:01:30.360> dead<00:01:30.570> spots

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
some gaps here and there some dead spots
