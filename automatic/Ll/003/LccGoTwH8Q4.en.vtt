00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
plane there'll always be times when we

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.620 
plane there'll always be times when we
will<00:01:32.840> be<00:01:33.640> making<00:01:34.640> decisions<00:01:34.940> that<00:01:35.330> some

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630

but<00:01:41.300> it<00:01:41.480> they<00:01:42.409> need<00:01:42.620> to<00:01:42.770> think<00:01:43.159> that<00:01:43.400> in

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
but it they need to think that in

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.920 
but it they need to think that in
