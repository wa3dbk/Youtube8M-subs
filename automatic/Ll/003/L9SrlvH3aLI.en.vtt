00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.559
 I can not because I'm cheerful because I have cheers. Maybe . I have a lot of time and nothing to do. 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:14.929
 I always touch this sound quality in the kitchen and it's hard for me . 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.929
 Oh, so I tried hard or imagined it. 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.539
 I think that the food is much tastier and more delicious than usual . 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.539
 Malyijyo get a limit of patience to find 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:31.230
 Eventually trap professors at the end of the day the project was aborted 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.950
 no.02 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.400
 And another person in trouble. Yes, Euro . 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.750
 Anyway 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:50.670
 The bake is in the morning 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.870
 I prepared a little bit like that coffee that was very steamy , 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.660
 You drank it in. 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:01.320
 Itjyo with that sword is of course quite a lot iteunikka 3 hammered it 5 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.820
 Little by little, without the prior drinking again and did just find it 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.590
 I think so 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:13.320
 In fact , it 's not a test people . 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.340
 And now one day when sometimes all the time nine plagues best figures yet they are coming Lotto 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.340
 I was honest. 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.550
 In the end, seven people except Professor Hansung Do and two European Commissioners 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.950
 I'm continuing the project . 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.820
 Ah 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:33.159
 In the fourth week, they also changed. 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.159
 100 won book for family gathering the next day 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.540
 I bp, which is the meeting place is the restaurant I have brilliant food stimulates the appetite 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.689
 By the way, the dish of the white lectern is somehow cha . 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:57.869
 Now that 's the habit for the project. 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:02:02.700
 First of all, those eating plans to develop on top of that 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:07.039
 Because the above very stimulating one night because only the fullness 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.039
 I've eaten so little salt. 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.180
 There are four . 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.860
 Lee Hee-joon won once, for about the same Do spoon rest is just visible to the bottom 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.710
 This atom that had no law 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.030
 But even now, 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.030
 The semester says it's hard. 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:34.459
 Colette Cern, the spec, and it's hard. 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:39.920
 For that it is already applying different times I called 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:44.290
 A little earlier for the first time a few beopjom a few more times to eat because eating snacks 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.290
 I think the giant half fullness and better 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.730
 4 words 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:57.240
 A little misunderstanding in four weeks changed drinking water 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.240
 So, can we keep this kind of diet in the future ? 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.950
 It's hard to do because it's a little bit hard to do, because our 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:11.500
 I need to see a doctor. 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:14.859
 When deoraguyo care if its really that nervous yeminhae So during those days 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:20.470
 A little difficult when you do not work on weekends 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:22.060
 This reduces the number of itgetda to this idea handudal degree plus one 3 months 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.530
 I have to try 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.760
 I do not know if it 's true that it's true to me 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:34.090
 I was thinking. 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:37.840
 Once I think about doing a little more than a month or two from now 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:43.440
 A four-week project with different ideas and experiences 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.440
 So what was the common change for them? 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:53.080
 I checked the final result. Let's start with the changes in the body. 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:58.990
 The total weight was 1 4kg two weeks eotneundeyo 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:03.460
 Among them, the gender is related to the illness and the evidence of the metabolism these days 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:09.880
 It is very important that the waist and hip ratio is 1 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:15.130
 Reduced about 4cm'm hip about 1 2cm recommended 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:18.810
 I have used individual differences depending on exercise, but overall body fat 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.810
 We've seen a lot of declines. 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:28.490
 If you continue to exercise your muscles while fasting, you will lose more muscle mass 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.490
 I can. 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:40.460
 So what would it be like to have a stomach health? 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.480
 If we look more often, our non-health problems such as heartburn will be worse. 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.740
 Before and after 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.740
 I went to check for violation. 

00:04:48.299 --> 00:04:52.679
 Doctors also should see Can I do it often inspection in four patients who can claim 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:55.069
 I purchased 

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:55.069
 4 cases 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.380
 One person could not prepare 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.380
 we 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:05.830
