00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
right now and when a new driver was

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.230 
right now and when a new driver was
released<00:01:31.920> for<00:01:32.249> that<00:01:32.399> particular<00:01:32.969> piece<00:01:33.210> of

released for that particular piece of

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.200 
released for that particular piece of
hardware<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.159> have<00:01:35.819> many

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
hardware so as you can see I have many

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.029 
hardware so as you can see I have many
outdated<00:01:36.869> drivers<00:01:37.229> let's<00:01:37.679> look<00:01:37.829> at<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
outdated drivers let's look at the

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.969 
outdated drivers let's look at the
overview<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.759> actually<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.780> 23<00:01:40.409> drivers<00:01:40.799> that

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
overview I actually have 23 drivers that

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.219 
overview I actually have 23 drivers that
are<00:01:41.069> out<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.340> date<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.700> 101<00:01:42.630> up-to-date

doesn't matter if you need the new

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.830 
doesn't matter if you need the new
driver<00:02:05.649> to<00:02:06.280> fix<00:02:06.579> a<00:02:06.789> current<00:02:07.149> hardware<00:02:07.479> problem

really<00:02:11.920> does<00:02:12.069> help<00:02:12.250> as<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:13.300> can<00:02:13.420> see<00:02:13.599> it's

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
really does help as you can see it's

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.020 
really does help as you can see it's

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
what it found I mean look at this this

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.240 
what it found I mean look at this this
particular<00:02:19.390> piece<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:19.900> hardware<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.890> current

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
particular piece of hardware the current

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.630 
particular piece of hardware the current
version<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.549> driver<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.420> was<00:02:23.290> from<00:02:23.640> 2006

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
version the driver I have was from 2006

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.119 
version the driver I have was from 2006
they<00:02:25.569> have<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.810> version<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.470> driver<00:02:26.680> from

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
they have a version of the driver from

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.910 
they have a version of the driver from
2009<00:02:27.940> can<00:02:28.629> you<00:02:28.750> imagine<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.349> updates<00:02:29.739> that

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
2009 can you imagine the updates that

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.150 
2009 can you imagine the updates that
have<00:02:30.010> been<00:02:30.310> made<00:02:30.730> since<00:02:31.150> 2006<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.290> 2009<00:02:32.830> I

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
have been made since 2006 and 2009 I

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.680 
have been made since 2006 and 2009 I
mean<00:02:33.730> they<00:02:33.849> could<00:02:34.030> have<00:02:34.120> found<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.420> lot<00:02:34.569> of

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
mean they could have found a lot of

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.990 
mean they could have found a lot of
things<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:35.470> will<00:02:35.620> tweak<00:02:35.920> my<00:02:36.099> hardware<00:02:36.489> make

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
things that will tweak my hardware make

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.699 
things that will tweak my hardware make
it<00:02:37.120> run<00:02:37.269> faster<00:02:37.380> there<00:02:38.380> could<00:02:38.500> have<00:02:38.530> been<00:02:38.680> a

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
it run faster there could have been a

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.530 
it run faster there could have been a
security<00:02:39.099> loophole<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:40.150> know<00:02:40.269> it<00:02:40.329> can<00:02:40.450> be

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
security loophole you know it can be

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.850 
security loophole you know it can be
causing<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:41.049> lot<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.290> problems<00:02:41.500> with<00:02:41.799> my

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
causing a lot of problems with my

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.440 
causing a lot of problems with my
computer<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.940> would<00:02:43.120> have<00:02:43.209> never<00:02:43.329> known

computer and I would have never known

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.509 
computer and I would have never known
because<00:02:44.049> you<00:02:44.739> know<00:02:44.890> these<00:02:45.069> hardware

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
because you know these hardware

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.369 
because you know these hardware
manufacturers<00:02:46.180> they<00:02:46.390> don't<00:02:46.599> make<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.900> easy<00:02:47.200> to

manufacturers they don't make it easy to

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.259 
manufacturers they don't make it easy to
find<00:02:47.680> their<00:02:47.920> drivers<00:02:48.280> if<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.910> don't<00:02:49.090> have<00:02:49.209> a

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
find their drivers if you don't have a

find their drivers if you don't have a
program<00:02:49.660> like<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:50.019> there's<00:02:50.709> really<00:02:50.890> no<00:02:51.160> way

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340

problems now the best thing about this

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.920 
problems now the best thing about this
program<00:03:09.010> is<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.880> can<00:03:09.910> actually<00:03:10.420> take<00:03:10.750> a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
program is you can actually take a

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.379 
program is you can actually take a

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
backup of your current drivers so if

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.970 
backup of your current drivers so if
you're<00:03:13.540> scared<00:03:13.840> it's<00:03:14.079> gonna<00:03:14.139> do<00:03:14.380> anything<00:03:14.859> to

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
you're scared it's gonna do anything to
