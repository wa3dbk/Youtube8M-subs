out and then also the roots so there's a
lot<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.000> there's<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.080> lot<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.380> roots<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:14.490> are

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
lot of there's a lot of roots that are

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.730 
lot of there's a lot of roots that are
in<00:00:14.730> here<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.150> just<00:00:15.179> need<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.599> get<00:00:15.780> those<00:00:16.350> out

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.229 
establish growth okay why don't you just
go<00:00:52.469> over<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> tiller<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.129> let's<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:54.030> turn

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
go over the tiller and let's can turn

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.420 
go over the tiller and let's can turn
that<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.590> find<00:00:55.829> learn<00:00:56.280> how<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that on that I can find learn how to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.060 
that on that I can find learn how to
turn<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.730> tiller<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.360> and<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.800> here's<00:01:01.980> what

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
turn that tiller on and so here's what

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.850 
turn that tiller on and so here's what
the<00:01:02.129> tiller<00:01:02.370> looks<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.820> everybody<00:01:03.860> Gaston

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the tiller looks like everybody Gaston

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.120 
the tiller looks like everybody Gaston
it's<00:01:05.220> got<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.570> got<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> simple<00:01:07.229> transmission<00:01:07.740> on

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
it's got a got a simple transmission on

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.480 
it's got a got a simple transmission on
it

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
it

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.050 
it
okay<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.960> way<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.260> works<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.700> put<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.970> in

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
okay the way it works is to put it in

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.020 
okay the way it works is to put it in
neutral

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
neutral

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.350 
neutral
gasps<00:01:17.960> on<00:01:18.290> crank<00:01:19.040> it<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.550> then<00:01:19.670> you've<00:01:19.820> got<00:01:20.030> a

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
gasps on crank it and then you've got a

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.800 
gasps on crank it and then you've got a
couple<00:01:21.050> of<00:01:21.290> speech<00:01:21.560> got<00:01:21.980> a<00:01:22.010> low<00:01:22.250> speed<00:01:22.810> and

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
couple of speech got a low speed and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.860 
couple of speech got a low speed and
you've<00:01:23.960> got<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.670> neutral<00:01:25.670> here<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:26.330> then

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
you've got a neutral here and then

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.280 
you've got a neutral here and then
you've<00:01:27.020> also<00:01:27.140> got<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.950> high<00:01:28.850> speed<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:32.290> that's

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
you've also got a high speed and that's

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.800 
you've also got a high speed and that's
high<00:01:33.590> high<00:01:34.400> is<00:01:34.460> really<00:01:34.970> for<00:01:35.150> just<00:01:35.180> getting<00:01:35.660> to

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
high high is really for just getting to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.900 
high high is really for just getting to
the<00:01:35.930> garden<00:01:36.290> not<00:01:36.410> for<00:01:36.620> children<00:01:36.800> so<00:01:37.790> you're

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
going to have it in neutral and then you

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.320 
going to have it in neutral and then you
put<00:01:39.680> it<00:01:39.800> in<00:01:39.920> low<00:01:40.420> two<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:42.710> go<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.820> when<00:01:44.000> your<00:01:44.120> ear

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
put it in low two to go so when your ear

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.720 
put it in low two to go so when your ear
in<00:01:44.450> high<00:01:44.660> you're<00:01:44.990> moving<00:01:45.530> okay<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.370> this<00:01:46.520> has

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
in high you're moving okay and this has

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.050 
in high you're moving okay and this has
a<00:01:46.930> simple<00:01:48.040> transmission<00:01:49.040> this<00:01:49.190> is<00:01:49.250> reverse<00:01:49.729> up

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
a simple transmission this is reverse up

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.020 
a simple transmission this is reverse up
here<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:51.320> down<00:01:51.650> here<00:01:51.680> is<00:01:52.190> forward<00:01:54.610> is<00:01:55.610> it<00:01:55.850> sort

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
here and down here is forward is it sort

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.410 
here and down here is forward is it sort
of<00:01:56.090> like<00:01:56.150> it's<00:01:56.570> like<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.720> car<00:01:57.020> then<00:01:57.290> kind<00:01:57.590> of<00:02:01.420> the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
of like it's like a car then kind of the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.270 
of like it's like a car then kind of the
blades<00:02:02.720> engaged<00:02:03.140> all<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.440> time<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.190> have

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.410 
it's got a little safety shield on it
here<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:12.410> tines<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.490> can<00:02:13.640> see<00:02:13.910> those<00:02:14.120> down

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
here the tines you can see those down

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.280 
here the tines you can see those down
here<00:02:14.890> are<00:02:15.890> pretty<00:02:16.130> sharp

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
here are pretty sharp

00:02:18.290 --> 00:05:37.830 
here are pretty sharp
and<00:02:18.409> they<00:02:18.739> don't<00:02:18.860> stop<00:02:19.069> never<00:02:20.060> stop

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.510 

and<00:05:38.840> so<00:05:39.110> how<00:05:39.289> many<00:05:39.500> times<00:05:39.830> will<00:05:40.039> you<00:05:40.100> do<00:05:40.310> this

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
and so how many times will you do this

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.460 
and so how many times will you do this
Shannon<00:05:41.060> because<00:05:41.389> what<00:05:41.600> you<00:05:41.990> have<00:05:42.169> to<00:05:42.259> do<00:05:42.350> it

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
Shannon because what you have to do it

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.650 
Shannon because what you have to do it
again<00:05:42.710> or<00:05:42.949> will<00:05:43.009> be<00:05:43.190> only<00:05:43.310> one<00:05:43.550> time<00:05:43.789> well<00:05:44.539> no

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
again or will be only one time well no

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.390 
again or will be only one time well no
this<00:05:44.960> is<00:05:45.139> fresh<00:05:45.410> ground<00:05:45.740> that's<00:05:45.919> never<00:05:46.160> been

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
this is fresh ground that's never been

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.969 
this is fresh ground that's never been
broken<00:05:46.669> before<00:05:46.970> so<00:05:47.449> it<00:05:47.780> needs<00:05:47.960> to<00:05:48.139> go<00:05:48.319> over<00:05:48.650> a

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
broken before so it needs to go over a

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.550 
broken before so it needs to go over a
couple<00:05:49.220> of<00:05:49.430> times<00:05:49.639> okay<00:05:50.300> start<00:05:51.050> out<00:05:51.169> shallow

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
couple of times okay start out shallow

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.499 
couple of times okay start out shallow
and<00:05:51.919> then<00:05:52.039> you<00:05:52.130> go<00:05:52.340> a<00:05:52.370> little<00:05:52.669> bit<00:05:52.880> deeper<00:05:53.060> down

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:53.509 
and then you go a little bit deeper down

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.710 
and then you go a little bit deeper down
to<00:05:53.860> about<00:05:54.860> six<00:05:55.190> inches<00:05:55.610> this<00:05:56.150> is<00:05:56.210> all<00:05:56.479> what<00:05:56.630> you
