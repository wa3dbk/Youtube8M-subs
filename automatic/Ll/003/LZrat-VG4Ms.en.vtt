square here we have it already trained

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.399 
square here we have it already trained
to<00:01:28.460> allow<00:01:29.460> us<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.790> push<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.119> object<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.900> now

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
to allow us to push the object and now

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.260 
to allow us to push the object and now
we'll<00:01:31.710> try<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> set<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.060> can

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
we'll try to set it up so that you can

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.679 
we'll try to set it up so that you can
pull<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.720> object<00:01:33.920> each<00:01:35.390> individual<00:01:36.390> action

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
pull the object each individual action

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.569 
pull the object each individual action
that<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.840> train<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.470> requires<00:01:38.220> eight

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
that you train it in requires eight

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.789 
that you train it in requires eight
seconds<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.600> think<00:01:40.200> about<00:01:40.439> doing<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
seconds for you to think about doing the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.280 
seconds for you to think about doing the
action<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.780> actually<00:01:43.079> lets<00:01:43.259> you

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
action and then it actually lets you

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.620 
action and then it actually lets you
perform<00:01:43.740> it

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:01.270 

as<00:01:50.630> we<00:01:50.990> are<00:01:51.079> doing<00:01:51.200> here<00:01:59.500> now<00:02:00.500> we<00:02:00.560> can<00:02:00.799> try<00:02:01.250> to

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
as we are doing here now we can try to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:17.680 
as we are doing here now we can try to
train<00:02:01.759> it<00:02:01.939> to<00:02:02.360> drop<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:03.500> device<00:02:16.540> again<00:02:17.540> the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
train it to drop the device again the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.360 
train it to drop the device again the
eight<00:02:17.870> second<00:02:18.290> period<00:02:18.950> in<00:02:19.069> which<00:02:19.190> you're

trying to think about the box being

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:30.759 
trying to think about the box being
dropped<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:28.540> now<00:02:29.540> we<00:02:29.599> can<00:02:30.170> actually<00:02:30.410> try<00:02:30.739> to

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
dropped and now we can actually try to

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.240 
dropped and now we can actually try to
do<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.130> there<00:02:31.430> goes<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:33.590> bar<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.099> you<00:02:34.220> see

with<00:02:48.890> is<00:02:49.780> interactive<00:02:50.780> game<00:02:51.079> so<00:02:51.829> we<00:02:52.670> can<00:02:52.810> see

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
with is interactive game so we can see

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.289 
with is interactive game so we can see
how<00:02:53.959> this<00:02:54.109> would<00:02:54.260> perform<00:02:54.709> in<00:02:54.889> a<00:02:54.980> in<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:56.090> game

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
how this would perform in a in a game

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.500 
how this would perform in a in a game
environment<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.790> we'll<00:02:58.790> show<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.299> to<00:02:59.420> you

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
environment and we'll show that to you

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.680 
environment and we'll show that to you
right<00:02:59.540> now<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:02.560> here's<00:03:03.560> our<00:03:03.859> game<00:03:04.310> world<00:03:04.690> it's

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
right now so here's our game world it's

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.050 
right now so here's our game world it's
not<00:03:05.780> exactly<00:03:06.200> cutting-edge<00:03:06.769> but<00:03:07.280> for<00:03:07.700> now<00:03:07.850> it

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
not exactly cutting-edge but for now it

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.699 
not exactly cutting-edge but for now it
will<00:03:08.290> will<00:03:09.290> have<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:09.470> do<00:03:11.440> here<00:03:12.440> we're

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
will will have to do here we're

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.020 
will will have to do here we're
controlling<00:03:13.569> using<00:03:14.569> WASD<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:16.459> mouse<00:03:16.639> for

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
controlling using WASD and the mouse for

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.490 
controlling using WASD and the mouse for
movement<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.480> looking<00:03:17.780> around<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.350> that's

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
movement and looking around so that's

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.729 
movement and looking around so that's
not<00:03:18.680> using<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:19.700> brainwaves<00:03:20.260> but<00:03:21.260> there<00:03:21.530> are

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
not using the brainwaves but there are

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.590 
not using the brainwaves but there are
certain<00:03:22.130> elements<00:03:22.220> that<00:03:22.700> we<00:03:23.000> will<00:03:23.209> be<00:03:23.329> able<00:03:23.450> to

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
certain elements that we will be able to

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.979 
certain elements that we will be able to
manipulate<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.709> blue<00:03:25.130> or<00:03:25.730> would<00:03:26.420> tail<00:03:26.780> on<00:03:26.959> it

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
manipulate the blue or would tail on it

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.220 
manipulate the blue or would tail on it
is<00:03:27.290> our<00:03:27.799> guide<00:03:28.130> that<00:03:28.880> we<00:03:29.239> need<00:03:29.569> to<00:03:29.690> follow<00:03:29.840> and

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
is our guide that we need to follow and

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.629 
is our guide that we need to follow and
here<00:03:30.920> this<00:03:31.040> first<00:03:31.370> exercise<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:33.370> trying<00:03:34.370> to

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
here this first exercise is trying to

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.640 
here this first exercise is trying to
get<00:03:34.730> rid<00:03:34.910> of<00:03:34.970> these<00:03:35.120> spheres<00:03:35.599> by<00:03:36.049> clenching

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
get rid of these spheres by clenching

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.540 
get rid of these spheres by clenching
your<00:03:36.859> teeth

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
your teeth

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.800 
your teeth
and<00:03:38.640> there<00:03:39.600> they<00:03:39.750> go<00:03:39.780> again<00:03:41.150> this<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.510> the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
and there they go again this is the the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.590 
and there they go again this is the the
first<00:03:43.110> tab<00:03:43.740> as<00:03:44.520> you<00:03:44.580> will<00:03:44.850> call<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.150> first<00:03:45.360> tab

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
first tab as you will call the first tab

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.580 
first tab as you will call the first tab
allowed<00:03:46.020> you<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.710> detected<00:03:48.590> different

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
allowed you to it detected different

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.140 
allowed you to it detected different
facial<00:03:49.860> expressions<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.490> this<00:03:50.610> is<00:03:50.790> one<00:03:51.120> of

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
facial expressions and this is one of

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.780 
facial expressions and this is one of
the<00:03:51.420> applications<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.740> punching<00:03:53.670> your

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
the applications of that punching your

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:01.060 
the applications of that punching your
teeth<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.150> making<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.630> orb<00:03:55.290> slide<00:03:55.710> away

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.570 

moving<00:04:02.070> on<00:04:02.510> we<00:04:03.510> have<00:04:03.750> our<00:04:04.050> second<00:04:04.530> guide<00:04:04.800> which

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
moving on we have our second guide which

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.110 
moving on we have our second guide which
is<00:04:06.180> going<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:07.580> allow<00:04:08.580> us<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.910> believe

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
is going to allow us to I believe

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.640 
is going to allow us to I believe
levitate<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:10.020> rock<00:04:10.550> so<00:04:11.550> now<00:04:11.700> he's<00:04:11.850> saying

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
levitate this rock so now he's saying

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.690 
levitate this rock so now he's saying
concentrate<00:04:13.650> on<00:04:14.360> what<00:04:15.360> I'm<00:04:15.600> doing<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:16.640> try<00:04:17.640> to

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
concentrate on what I'm doing and try to

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.949 
concentrate on what I'm doing and try to
emulate<00:04:18.180> me<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:20.280> first<00:04:20.580> he's<00:04:20.850> going<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.209> going

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
emulate me so first he's going to going

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:31.070 
emulate me so first he's going to going
to<00:04:22.020> show<00:04:22.080> us<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.680> rock<00:04:22.920> going<00:04:23.430> up<00:04:29.990> there<00:04:30.990> it

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
to show us the rock going up there it

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:38.270 
to show us the rock going up there it
goes

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.520 

now<00:04:40.440> he's<00:04:41.440> telling<00:04:41.770> us<00:04:41.890> to<00:04:43.380> concentrate<00:04:44.380> on

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
now he's telling us to concentrate on

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.780 
now he's telling us to concentrate on
the<00:04:44.620> same<00:04:44.830> action<00:04:45.310> and<00:04:45.490> try<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:45.940> perform<00:04:46.450> it

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
the same action and try to perform it

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.280 
the same action and try to perform it
just<00:04:48.790> like<00:04:48.970> we<00:04:49.150> saw<00:04:49.390> it<00:04:49.540> anything<00:04:49.810> if<00:04:50.170> you

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
just like we saw it anything if you

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.620 
just like we saw it anything if you
can't<00:04:50.500> make<00:04:50.680> it<00:04:50.830> happen<00:04:51.210> don't<00:04:52.210> worry<00:04:52.480> about

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
can't make it happen don't worry about

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.850 
can't make it happen don't worry about
it<00:04:52.930> just<00:04:53.050> keep<00:04:53.230> trying<00:04:53.580> this<00:04:54.580> is<00:04:54.730> probably<00:04:55.060> the

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
it just keep trying this is probably the

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.100 
it just keep trying this is probably the
part<00:04:56.860> of<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.100> game<00:04:57.280> word<00:04:57.580> it's<00:04:58.050> trying<00:04:59.050> to

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
part of the game word it's trying to

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.890 
part of the game word it's trying to
learn<00:04:59.350> your<00:04:59.410> brain<00:04:59.890> waves<00:05:00.100> so<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.580> can<00:05:00.900> perform

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
learn your brain waves so it can perform

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.150 
learn your brain waves so it can perform
what<00:05:02.590> it's<00:05:02.710> supposed<00:05:03.370> to<00:05:03.460> do<00:05:04.800> so<00:05:05.800> here<00:05:06.010> we're

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
what it's supposed to do so here we're

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.180 
what it's supposed to do so here we're
still<00:05:06.370> trying<00:05:06.700> to<00:05:06.790> levitate<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.510> rock<00:05:07.720> and

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
still trying to levitate the rock and

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.290 
still trying to levitate the rock and
it's<00:05:09.190> saying<00:05:09.400> don't<00:05:09.640> worry<00:05:09.760> you<00:05:09.970> can't<00:05:10.150> do<00:05:10.240> it

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
it's saying don't worry you can't do it

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.470 
it's saying don't worry you can't do it
out<00:05:10.390> there<00:05:10.600> it<00:05:10.660> goes<00:05:11.640> kind<00:05:12.640> of<00:05:12.730> drastic<00:05:12.970> jump

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
out there it goes kind of drastic jump

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:21.360 
out there it goes kind of drastic jump
foot<00:05:13.780> I<00:05:13.990> guess<00:05:14.830> we<00:05:15.040> got<00:05:15.460> it<00:05:19.650> so<00:05:20.650> moving<00:05:21.280> along

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
foot I guess we got it so moving along

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.240 
foot I guess we got it so moving along
the<00:05:21.640> path<00:05:21.670> following<00:05:22.540> order<00:05:22.830> blue<00:05:23.830> sphere

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
the path following order blue sphere

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.890 
the path following order blue sphere
we're<00:05:24.520> going<00:05:24.640> to<00:05:24.730> try<00:05:24.910> to<00:05:24.970> rebuild<00:05:25.480> this

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
we're going to try to rebuild this

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.560 
we're going to try to rebuild this
bridge<00:05:26.610> we're<00:05:27.610> using<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:28.000> same<00:05:28.180> technique

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
bridge we're using the same technique

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.080 
bridge we're using the same technique
and<00:05:29.100> again<00:05:30.100> this<00:05:30.190> part<00:05:30.430> is<00:05:30.550> done<00:05:30.730> with<00:05:30.940> the

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
and again this part is done with the

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.410 
and again this part is done with the
brain<00:05:31.300> waves<00:05:32.850> envisioning<00:05:33.850> the<00:05:34.000> bridge<00:05:34.210> going

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
brain waves envisioning the bridge going

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:46.510 
brain waves envisioning the bridge going
up<00:05:34.660> but<00:05:34.810> we<00:05:34.900> made<00:05:35.350> it<00:05:35.500> happen

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.520 

here<00:05:47.520> he's<00:05:47.760> telling<00:05:48.180> us<00:05:48.240> about<00:05:48.450> I<00:05:48.900> guess<00:05:49.290> the

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
here he's telling us about I guess the

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.290 
here he's telling us about I guess the
ancient<00:05:50.190> hero<00:05:50.400> that<00:05:50.580> was<00:05:50.670> able<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:51.030> lift

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
ancient hero that was able to lift

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.090 
ancient hero that was able to lift
mountains<00:05:51.690> so<00:05:52.140> I<00:05:52.170> guess<00:05:52.470> that's<00:05:52.650> what<00:05:52.890> we're

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
mountains so I guess that's what we're

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.440 
mountains so I guess that's what we're
going<00:05:53.550> to<00:05:53.610> be<00:05:53.700> trying<00:05:53.910> to<00:05:54.000> do<00:05:54.150> here<00:05:54.390> so<00:05:56.450> look

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
going to be trying to do here so look

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.930 
going to be trying to do here so look
he's<00:05:57.600> telling<00:05:58.020> us<00:05:58.050> to<00:05:58.200> concentrate<00:05:58.830> on<00:05:59.100> the

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
he's telling us to concentrate on the

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.720 
he's telling us to concentrate on the
mountain<00:06:00.300> in<00:06:00.480> the<00:06:00.540> background<00:06:00.870> and<00:06:01.440> so<00:06:02.430> if<00:06:02.580> we

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
mountain in the background and so if we

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.700 
mountain in the background and so if we
can<00:06:02.910> make<00:06:03.300> it<00:06:03.510> levitate<00:06:04.020> just<00:06:04.320> like<00:06:04.470> in<00:06:04.620> the

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
can make it levitate just like in the

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.520 
can make it levitate just like in the
rock<00:06:04.890> example<00:06:08.210> and<00:06:09.210> it<00:06:09.390> looks<00:06:09.540> like<00:06:09.630> we<00:06:10.170> got<00:06:10.350> it

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
rock example and it looks like we got it

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.650 
rock example and it looks like we got it
it's<00:06:11.070> pretty<00:06:11.280> quick<00:06:11.490> I<00:06:14.240> guess<00:06:15.240> we<00:06:15.360> must<00:06:15.540> have

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
it's pretty quick I guess we must have

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.840 
it's pretty quick I guess we must have
released<00:06:15.930> some<00:06:16.200> sort<00:06:16.800> of<00:06:16.890> spirits<00:06:17.310> with<00:06:17.580> those

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
released some sort of spirits with those

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:29.670 
released some sort of spirits with those
blue<00:06:18.720> spheres<00:06:18.990> floating<00:06:19.410> up

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:40.560 

and<00:06:29.889> now<00:06:30.729> our<00:06:30.940> next<00:06:31.500> exercise<00:06:34.560> here<00:06:39.570> he's

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
and now our next exercise here he's

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.969 
and now our next exercise here he's
going<00:06:40.840> to<00:06:40.960> tell<00:06:41.139> you<00:06:41.350> telling<00:06:41.620> us<00:06:41.680> to<00:06:41.740> try<00:06:41.949> to

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
going to tell you telling us to try to

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:44.969 
going to tell you telling us to try to
bend<00:06:42.280> this<00:06:42.430> tree<00:06:43.139> like<00:06:44.139> so<00:06:44.350> this<00:06:44.530> is<00:06:44.650> not<00:06:44.830> us

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
bend this tree like so this is not us

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:51.900 
bend this tree like so this is not us
this<00:06:45.220> is<00:06:45.370> him<00:06:45.580> demonstrating<00:06:50.639> so<00:06:51.639> this<00:06:51.789> is

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:51.910 
this is him demonstrating so this is

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.279 
this is him demonstrating so this is
very<00:06:52.030> similar<00:06:52.300> to<00:06:52.479> that<00:06:52.570> first<00:06:52.810> exercise

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:53.289 
very similar to that first exercise

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:56.010 
very similar to that first exercise
where<00:06:53.620> we<00:06:53.650> watch<00:06:53.919> him<00:06:54.130> do<00:06:54.280> it<00:06:54.430> and<00:06:54.610> now<00:06:55.020> we

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
where we watch him do it and now we

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.150 
where we watch him do it and now we
envision<00:06:56.470> the<00:06:56.590> same<00:06:56.800> thing<00:06:58.800> see<00:06:59.800> if<00:06:59.860> we<00:07:00.009> can

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 
envision the same thing see if we can

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:09.659 
envision the same thing see if we can
make<00:07:00.669> it<00:07:00.789> happen<00:07:07.410> now<00:07:08.410> let's<00:07:08.440> keep<00:07:09.100> trying<00:07:09.430> if

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:09.669 
make it happen now let's keep trying if

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:21.470 
make it happen now let's keep trying if
you<00:07:09.760> can't<00:07:09.970> get<00:07:10.150> it<00:07:10.240> at<00:07:10.360> first<00:07:10.539> you<00:07:10.750> try

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:21.480 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.540 

and<00:07:22.480> there<00:07:23.020> we<00:07:23.170> go

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550 
and there we go

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.630 
and there we go
looks<00:07:24.550> like<00:07:24.700> we<00:07:24.850> got<00:07:25.030> it<00:07:25.060> and<00:07:26.520> that<00:07:27.520> was

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:27.640 
looks like we got it and that was

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.270 
looks like we got it and that was
basically<00:07:27.850> it<00:07:28.180> the<00:07:28.660> epoch<00:07:29.380> from<00:07:29.680> and<00:07:29.980> motive

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.280 
basically it the epoch from and motive

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.640 
basically it the epoch from and motive
should<00:07:30.430> be<00:07:30.610> available<00:07:30.820> for<00:07:31.270> about<00:07:31.510> $300<00:07:32.380> in

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:32.650 
should be available for about $300 in

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.870 
should be available for about $300 in
most<00:07:32.890> markets<00:07:33.480> thanks<00:07:34.480> for<00:07:34.600> watching
