00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
one here so I'm pretty simple boss

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.219 
one here so I'm pretty simple boss
bother<00:01:52.820> in<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.180> updates<00:01:53.539> when<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.899> easiest

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
bother in the updates when the easiest

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.109 
bother in the updates when the easiest
here<00:01:55.100> we<00:01:55.220> have<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.340> third<00:01:55.640> car<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:58.119> laser

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
here we have a third car and a laser

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.590 
here we have a third car and a laser
robot<00:02:00.070> flying<00:02:01.070> thing<00:02:01.610> yeah<00:02:01.970> there<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.210> laser

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
robot flying thing yeah there you laser

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.330 
robot flying thing yeah there you laser
robot<00:02:03.049> flying<00:02:03.380> thing<00:02:03.649> I<00:02:03.799> think<00:02:04.009> that's<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.189> good

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
robot flying thing I think that's a good

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.249 
robot flying thing I think that's a good
definition<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.479> camera<00:02:05.840> in<00:02:05.960> this<00:02:06.080> level

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
definition and the camera in this level

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.719 
definition and the camera in this level
is<00:02:06.409> absolutely<00:02:06.920> awful<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.369> would<00:02:07.490> just<00:02:07.610> say

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
is absolutely awful I would just say

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:08.919 
is absolutely awful I would just say
that<00:02:07.909> now<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.239> is<00:02:08.360> probably<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.810> worst

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
that now this is probably the worst

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.380 
that now this is probably the worst
camera<00:02:09.860> angle<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.519> the<00:02:10.700> game<00:02:10.850> can<00:02:11.030> possibly

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
camera angle that the game can possibly

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.090 
camera angle that the game can possibly
have<00:02:11.600> for<00:02:11.810> any<00:02:11.900> level<00:02:12.319> because<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:12.800> like<00:02:12.950> it

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
have for any level because it's like it

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.620 
have for any level because it's like it
just<00:02:13.130> swings<00:02:13.580> around<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.060> place<00:02:14.269> and<00:02:14.480> it's

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
just swings around the place and it's

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.860 
just swings around the place and it's
really<00:02:15.140> really<00:02:15.440> annoying<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:16.430> yeah<00:02:17.239> dude<00:02:17.690> the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
really really annoying so yeah dude the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.600 
really really annoying so yeah dude the
really<00:02:18.410> job<00:02:18.680> with<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.920> camera<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.400> this

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
really job with a camera in this

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.280 
really job with a camera in this
applet<00:02:20.269> let's<00:02:20.450> say<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:20.750> it's<00:02:20.989> not<00:02:21.049> probably

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
applet let's say so it's not probably

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.140 
applet let's say so it's not probably
the<00:02:21.350> only<00:02:21.560> criticism<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.250> overhear<00:02:22.640> me

it's<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.530> stupid<00:02:48.920> camera<00:02:49.310> angle<00:02:49.609> that<00:02:49.700> McAfee

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
it's the stupid camera angle that McAfee

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.759 
it's the stupid camera angle that McAfee
makes<00:02:50.269> you<00:02:50.420> one<00:02:50.660> into<00:02:51.019> his<00:02:51.109> laser<00:02:51.380> which<00:02:51.739> is

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
makes you one into his laser which is

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.770 
makes you one into his laser which is
really<00:02:52.220> annoying<00:02:52.430> or<00:02:52.760> his<00:02:53.000> or<00:02:53.150> her<00:02:53.299> laser<00:02:53.540> are

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
really annoying or his or her laser are

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.780 
really annoying or his or her laser are
not<00:02:53.900> really<00:02:54.079> sure<00:02:54.230> for<00:02:54.680> its<00:02:54.920> laser<00:02:55.190> I'll

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
not really sure for its laser I'll

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.780 
not really sure for its laser I'll
probably<00:02:56.030> be<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.269> better<00:02:56.980> definition<00:02:57.980> but<00:02:58.549> yeah

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
probably be a better definition but yeah

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.440 
probably be a better definition but yeah
one<00:02:59.090> get<00:03:00.049> it<00:03:00.170> again<00:03:00.440> one<00:03:00.829> oh<00:03:01.299> there<00:03:02.299> we<00:03:02.420> go
