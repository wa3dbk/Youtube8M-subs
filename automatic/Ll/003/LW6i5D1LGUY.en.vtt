00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.590
 Hello dear reader 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.940
 site when seconds 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.220
 don't forget the facades of the houses today 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.600
 regular time percentage 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.929
 great 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.640
 Android smartphone experiment but you know 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.509
 sony ericsson company 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.509
 It is worth saying that it is very elegant 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.779
 but pavlova show 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.849
 how can 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.890
 vodka 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.760
 but it would still be better to look at 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.399
 snapshots 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.270
 but no doubt will 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.510
 in asset decree sizes 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.130
 this network segment 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.710
 the flagship smartphone of the past 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.370
 of the year 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.050
 sony ericsson 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.270
 as you can see 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.800
 new 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.140
 percent 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.040
 much more elegant he 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.600
 looks smaller 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600
 the thickness is also very cool playing 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.790
 besides open 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.820
 spread no one saw 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.660
 on the back 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.720
 fair 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.150
 lid which consists of such 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.290
 nice plastic like a soft touch 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.180
 but apparently if he is very similar 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.380
 percent 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.560
 camera interlocutors driving 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.510
 LED lights 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.490
 and a whole from a very much such a body process 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.800
 and what's called okay tailored 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.280
 small keys 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.799
 there is no button to control the volume 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:25.700
 camera 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.770
 that as we know we do not approve 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.440
 here the surface is varnished on 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.010
 bottom end so us 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.120
 and in general, here he leaves 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.620
 impression of course 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.940
 Markov enough screen 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.420
 and what's good inside 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.770
 inside is an android latest version 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.640
 denim brand 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.370
 by the way here is the feature 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.510
 turning off smartphones 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.480
 run gas will start tv 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.220
 which appeared some 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.770
 smartphone galaxy tab 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.770
 sorry fortune naxos tass 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.200
 inside 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.390
 We can not see 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.120
 all the same interface 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.460
 created by sony ericsson and tested on 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.659
 earlier xperia oak models which we saw 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.099
 in January 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.099
 here there are both advantages and 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.529
 deficiencies let's say the weather he 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:19.859
 looks nice but 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.329
 in its size 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.309
 pretty small is more in fashion now 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.619
 its dimensions kill clean 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:29.799
 let's say something right there 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.519
 this is being searched 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.169
 absolutely not used 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:35.639
 screen capabilities 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.429
 so consider it so big 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:40.299
 challenges will also be impossible 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.390
 and here we have here 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.659
 traditionally italian 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.659
 which reflects the activity 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.340
 bab contacts double action 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.149
 user that is back camera recording 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.279
 any message downloaded files 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:58.899
 Well, there is an address book that they see 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:00.399
 by the way here is almost the only major 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:01.929
 sees 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:03.779
 convenient to use 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:06.449
 call list contact list 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.009
 Elizovo everything is quite interesting 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:12.039
 well done here 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:14.379
 opportunity 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.379
 so first until the belly 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.199
 how does multitouch work 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.389
 here here 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.789
 if a 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:25.169
 choose 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.409
 if you choose 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.489
 all small screen then you can see how 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.729
 sees everything and the golden eagle crawling and the right 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:31.809
 random 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:34.449
 or in a special way choose any 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.649
 things that we would like to achieve 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.899
 that is, they make such a pinch 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:40.799
 multitouch movement 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.799
 and basically but on one screen the percentage 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:44.960
 become available 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.350
 everyone can see it 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.719
 quickly get to go to any 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.029
 it looks like a chip rather denied 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:52.549
 kitty use the same 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:53.729
 no one will do 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:55.870
 but sweetheart such an element 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.409
 these are the icons that we see 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.509
 and on the street 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:04.279
 the panels are all customizable that is 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:06.399
 you can remove everything 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:09.399
 Vitya cool animation soy 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.069
 m from the video to the communists 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:16.809
 this is all controlled by users 

00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:19.119
 still worth paying attention to the list 

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:20.539
 the application is not preinstalled 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.180
 already occupy three pages 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.490
 fourth stage applications 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.340
 installed by users 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.400
 there is a possibility 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.499
 custom moving icons 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:32.379
 here it is done like this 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:34.979
 there is a special key 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.860
 once again show 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.809
 can and 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:42.050
 transfer to others 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.050
 n desktops 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:50.960
 and there is the ability to sort 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.000
 applications 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.409
 clean floor using cleanliness 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.599
 for actually in some special way 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.279
 Here is a brief percentage 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:00.349
 what it looks like 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.009
 sony ericsson xperia read our review thanks for 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:03.110
 Attention
