 I introduced you to begin even 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.750
 does so for that will need 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.269
 a spatula 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.620
 then we are going to need little 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.080
 knife without sharp teeth we need 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.050
 also of a knife made after he goes 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.990
 we need a brush and he will us 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.090
 also need a pastry pencil so 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.269
 to make the marble pattern and on the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.830
 above the millefeuille then for this 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.560
 which is ingredients he will us 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.360
 you need three strips of dough 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.500
 puff 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.489
 here are three strips of puff pastry 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.120
 that I cooked just before so I 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.780
 found with a fork on plate 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.219
 covered with parchment paper and 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.660
 covered with another dish only for 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.020
 avoid the legs 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.090
 not too late rise is empty here 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.180
 then kind also needs cream 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.250
 pastry chef so she liter of cream 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.989
 pastry chef that I did the same before 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.520
 so we will not need everything 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.040
 but only one of the minutes this is 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.260
 not enough so once I have 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.320
 prepared I covered with a movie that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.800
 I pressed against the cream for 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.660
 avoid that these form a layer 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.619
 that's it then i'm going to need a 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:23.430
 apache for pie here 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:27.720
 and finally I see need frosting 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.740
 white at best getting ready before 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.940
 with icing sugar and water 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.960
 about 300 g of icing so from 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.259
 from now on we will be able to move on to 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.580
 first step 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.100
 he started by taking 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.840
 the pie mapping and we drop and 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.840
 slightly on the first phase 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.820
 the peso 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:11.880
 then we will catch the 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:22.670
 competition you ask me so deposited at 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:22.670
 middle of the dough is stretched 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.670
 we will repeat other operations for 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.000
 the next puff pastry sheet 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.190
 here I have deposited the second sheet 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:45.080
 gina peace with monaco start and we 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:47.080
 start again for us the cream then 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.630
 start from the middle of the dough 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.030
 same in stall so here I kept the 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.260
 puff pastry the most beautiful for the 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.510
 so on for the last step on 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.819
 the arrow on the same one we do not have with 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.090
 topping the task of finding a 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.090
 trade 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.900
 so here we have to call that's what 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:13.760
 will serve as a binder what they want 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:18.530
 read your puff pastry with our 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:26.569
 icing does not wash it hesitates it gives a 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:29.540
 little end to end on a dessert so 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:39.310
 here I am going to run an icing 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:39.310
 white spread 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.450
 then I made strokes at 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.450
 chocolate all the way 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.900
 to finish with my knife 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.720
 and in the sense 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.620
 So here we are we could see 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.630
 we had to finish there is quieter to 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.860
 in a job and he's ready to taste 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.860
 that's good appetite
