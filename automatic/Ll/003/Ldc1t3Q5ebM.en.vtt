well<00:00:14.910> what's<00:00:15.089> interesting<00:00:15.330> about<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.750> NGP<00:00:16.139> it

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
well what's interesting about the NGP it

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.230 
well what's interesting about the NGP it
actually<00:00:16.590> has<00:00:16.740> fewer<00:00:17.369> buttons<00:00:17.609> fewer

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
actually has fewer buttons fewer

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.240 
actually has fewer buttons fewer
physical<00:00:18.720> buttons<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.500> DualShock

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
physical buttons and the DualShock

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.820 
physical buttons and the DualShock
controller<00:00:20.279> right<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.869> what<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.199> do<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.470> is

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
controller right but what we do have is

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.099 
controller right but what we do have is
the<00:00:22.980> touchscreen<00:00:23.460> both<00:00:23.820> front<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.300> rear<00:00:24.420> so

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the touchscreen both front and rear so

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.259 
the touchscreen both front and rear so
we're<00:00:25.439> trying<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.800> incorporate<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
we're trying to incorporate that in a

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.790 
we're trying to incorporate that in a
lot<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.570> unique<00:00:27.810> ways<00:00:28.109> because<00:00:28.470> there's<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.680> lot

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
lot of unique ways because there's a lot

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.500 
lot of unique ways because there's a lot
of<00:00:28.830> ideas<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.490> how<00:00:29.670> touch<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.330> be

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
of ideas of how touch can be

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.799 
of ideas of how touch can be
incorporated<00:00:31.380> or<00:00:32.009> how<00:00:32.130> sixaxis<00:00:32.759> until<00:00:33.510> you

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
incorporated or how sixaxis until you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.200 
incorporated or how sixaxis until you
know<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:35.910> us<00:00:35.940> it's

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
know and it's just you know for us it's

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.610 
know and it's just you know for us it's
a<00:00:36.270> matter<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.570> getting<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.050> getting<00:00:37.350> that

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
a matter of getting it getting that

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.380 
a matter of getting it getting that
feature<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.040> there<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.489> trying<00:00:38.760> playing

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
feature in there and just trying playing

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.209 
feature in there and just trying playing
it<00:00:39.510> over<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> over<00:00:39.960> does<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.590> really<00:00:40.950> work

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
it over and over does this really work

here and just drag across the physical

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.310 
here and just drag across the physical
environment<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.860> Drake<00:01:05.070> following

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
environment and have Drake following

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.200 
environment and have Drake following

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
you can see them start moving over to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.540 
you can see them start moving over to
the<00:01:38.930> touch<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.440> start<00:01:39.800> using<00:01:39.979> that<00:01:40.100> more<00:01:40.399> up

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
the touch and start using that more up

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.910 
the touch and start using that more up
so<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.910> ability<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.570> like<00:01:41.720> integrate<00:01:42.289> to

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
so the ability to like integrate to

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.460 
so the ability to like integrate to
stick<00:01:43.220> motion<00:01:43.670> with<00:01:44.000> touch<00:01:44.270> with<00:01:44.750> six<00:01:45.080> axis

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
stick motion with touch with six axis

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.690 
stick motion with touch with six axis
and<00:01:45.680> having<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:45.979> just<00:01:46.160> fit<00:01:46.280> as<00:01:46.399> long<00:01:46.520> as<00:01:46.610> it

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
and having it just fit as long as it

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.950 
and having it just fit as long as it
feels<00:01:46.850> natural<00:01:47.119> as<00:01:47.390> long<00:01:47.509> as<00:01:47.600> it's<00:01:47.720> fun

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
feels natural as long as it's fun

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.810 
feels natural as long as it's fun
frankly<00:01:48.680> I<00:01:48.860> think<00:01:49.190> players<00:01:49.460> are<00:01:49.640> going<00:01:49.759> to

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
frankly I think players are going to

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.190 
frankly I think players are going to
like<00:01:49.940> it<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.240> just<00:01:50.479> keep<00:01:50.630> in<00:01:50.750> mind<00:01:50.930> that<00:01:51.020> what

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
like it and just keep in mind that what

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.900 
like it and just keep in mind that what
you're<00:01:51.320> seeing<00:01:51.560> right<00:01:51.680> now<00:01:51.890> is<00:01:52.039> our<00:01:52.520> first

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
you're seeing right now is our first

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.630 
you're seeing right now is our first
generation<00:01:53.630> in<00:01:53.840> gp-engine<00:01:54.380> what<00:01:55.070> we<00:01:55.280> can<00:01:55.490> do

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
generation in gp-engine what we can do

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.430 
generation in gp-engine what we can do
in<00:01:55.789> the<00:01:55.880> future<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:56.479> think<00:01:56.960> it's<00:01:57.110> only<00:01:57.229> going<00:01:57.380> to

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
in the future I think it's only going to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.710 
in the future I think it's only going to
be<00:01:57.530> limited<00:01:57.920> by<00:01:58.070> our<00:01:58.240> imaginations<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.509> what

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
be limited by our imaginations and what

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.210 
be limited by our imaginations and what
we<00:01:59.840> can<00:01:59.990> come<00:02:00.110> up<00:02:00.170> with<00:02:00.289> and<00:02:00.649> I<00:02:00.890> think<00:02:01.070> that's

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
we can come up with and I think that's

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.410 
we can come up with and I think that's
probably<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.550> most<00:02:01.700> important<00:02:02.210> thing<00:02:02.330> about

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
probably the most important thing about

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.440 
probably the most important thing about
NGP<00:02:02.869> is<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.770> really<00:02:04.009> does<00:02:04.250> enable<00:02:04.580> game

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
NGP is it it really does enable game

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.690 
NGP is it it really does enable game
developers<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:07.009> know<00:02:07.130> create<00:02:07.340> whatever

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
developers to you know create whatever

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.190 
developers to you know create whatever
it<00:02:07.940> I<00:02:07.970> mean<00:02:08.209> you've<00:02:08.330> seen<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.630> huge<00:02:09.019> variety

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
it I mean you've seen the huge variety

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.780 
it I mean you've seen the huge variety
that<00:02:09.619> we're<00:02:09.769> at<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:09.979> show<00:02:10.160> today<00:02:10.340> it's<00:02:10.640> like

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
that we're at the show today it's like

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.610 
that we're at the show today it's like
anything<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.510> can<00:02:11.690> imagine<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:12.140> can<00:02:12.230> do<00:02:12.440> you

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
anything you can imagine you can do you

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.110 
anything you can imagine you can do you
can<00:02:12.769> do<00:02:12.860> fun<00:02:13.100> little<00:02:13.250> short<00:02:13.519> games<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.880> can<00:02:14.030> do

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
can do fun little short games you can do

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.180 
can do fun little short games you can do
big<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.989> know<00:02:15.080> console<00:02:15.560> action<00:02:15.950> games

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
big you know console action games

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.580 
big you know console action games
equally<00:02:17.030> well<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.690> think<00:02:17.720> that's<00:02:18.049> what<00:02:18.230> has

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
equally well and I think that's what has

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:27.190 
equally well and I think that's what has
us<00:02:18.799> excited

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.260
