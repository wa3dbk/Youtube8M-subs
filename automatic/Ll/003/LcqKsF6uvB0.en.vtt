00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
different maps they will have um

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.860 
different maps they will have um
killstreaks<00:03:31.609> being<00:03:32.120> like<00:03:32.359> support

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
killstreaks being like support

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.259 
killstreaks being like support
killstreaks<00:03:33.609> meaning<00:03:34.609> that<00:03:34.730> they<00:03:34.910> will<00:03:35.090> get

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
killstreaks meaning that they will get

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.699 
killstreaks meaning that they will get
if<00:03:35.480> they<00:03:35.600> get<00:03:35.780> like<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.140> kill<00:03:36.410> streak

can get steady aim

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.460 
can get steady aim
whatever<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:47.020> um<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:48.700> lot<00:03:49.480> of<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.720> games<00:03:49.930> like

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
whatever so um a lot of the games like

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.500 
whatever so um a lot of the games like
for<00:03:50.830> this<00:03:50.950> one<00:03:51.130> example<00:03:51.430> there<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.150> no

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
for this one example there is no

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.440 
for this one example there is no
killstreaks<00:03:52.990> setup<00:03:53.740> so<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.430> very<00:03:54.850> easy<00:03:55.120> way<00:03:55.270> to

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
killstreaks setup so a very easy way to

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.690 
killstreaks setup so a very easy way to
get<00:03:55.720> that<00:03:55.900> challenge<00:03:56.500> which<00:03:56.740> I<00:03:56.980> never<00:03:57.340> wanted

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
get that challenge which I never wanted

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.920 
get that challenge which I never wanted
to<00:03:57.820> get<00:03:57.910> that<00:03:57.970> challenge<00:03:58.360> at<00:03:58.420> a<00:03:58.450> regular<00:03:58.780> game

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
to get that challenge at a regular game

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.280 
to get that challenge at a regular game
cuz<00:03:59.260> I<00:03:59.530> don't<00:04:00.370> like<00:04:00.640> sacrificing

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
cuz I don't like sacrificing

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.020 
cuz I don't like sacrificing
my<00:04:02.980> killstreaks<00:04:03.250> obviously<00:04:04.060> so<00:04:05.430> yeah<00:04:06.430> here<00:04:06.819> my

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
my killstreaks obviously so yeah here my

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.509 
my killstreaks obviously so yeah here my
friend<00:04:07.269> gets<00:04:07.390> to<00:04:07.510> moab<00:04:07.810> is<00:04:07.989> going<00:04:08.379> sane<00:04:08.590> but<00:04:09.459> uh

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
friend gets to moab is going sane but uh

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.160 
friend gets to moab is going sane but uh
um<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:12.459> can<00:04:12.640> get<00:04:12.819> that<00:04:12.849> kill<00:04:13.299> streak<00:04:13.569> you<00:04:13.989> have

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
um you can get that kill streak you have

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.580 
um you can get that kill streak you have
to<00:04:14.319> be<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:15.750> human<00:04:16.750> actually<00:04:17.199> you<00:04:17.259> don't<00:04:17.320> have<00:04:17.500> to

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
to be a human actually you don't have to

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.960 
to be a human actually you don't have to
be<00:04:17.709> human<00:04:18.009> but<00:04:18.130> it's<00:04:18.280> much<00:04:18.400> easier<00:04:18.430> to<00:04:18.729> be<00:04:18.940> a

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
be human but it's much easier to be a

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.670 
be human but it's much easier to be a
human<00:04:19.299> so<00:04:19.509> all<00:04:19.570> you<00:04:19.660> have<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.810> do<00:04:19.930> is<00:04:20.019> kill<00:04:20.380> 10

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
affected which is extremely easy and you

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.670 
affected which is extremely easy and you
get<00:04:24.699> that<00:04:24.850> challenge<00:04:25.419> there's<00:04:26.199> all

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
get that challenge there's all

you can complete but yeah um another
thing<00:04:34.630> is<00:04:35.050> for<00:04:35.560> example<00:04:35.650> if<00:04:35.949> you're<00:04:36.070> using<00:04:36.220> the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
thing is for example if you're using the
