00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.029
 our 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.360
 Bergkamen 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.710
 Yes 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.150
 certainly not because now beats up here because this is today on 4 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.930
 and find out with them something that is not Vienna what is 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.690
 actually typical German and Nietzsche dusted there we are at all 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.600
 agrees with the clichés that we all have in mind about ourselves 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.210
 tonight together with them also at home and our studio groups and 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.490
 Our celebrity guests find it true that we really are 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.220
 always so punctually so much actually so reliable 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.760
 we are busy washing the car and cleaning the stairs 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.829
 important with Abs garden door to look for the garden gnome 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.830
 a beautiful you can have completely relaxed ladies and gentlemen 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.170
 the home I want to explain it we are absolutely not a Christian we want 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.990
 do not know from him how many states Saarland reach 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.150
 we just want their personal preference and also 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.779
 Get to know warnings 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:46.150
 and who knows, maybe we will measure like that at the end of this show 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:49.510
 Modern German in 2005 really loves living 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.309
 and maybe a bit 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:52.599
 understandable Rome 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.229
 again a German virtue or one could rather say a German and 2 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:00.219
 s the TUM is making debt 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.049
 we are questionable 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.150
 they want to buy new furniture they would make debts for it 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:11.729
 Next to schools, you just do not go because of and if the old furniture 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:12.979
 are connected 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:17.309
 ten years, he is sure back numbers can see anyway I have no problem 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.309
 to get to the point 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.919
 8 seconds have now 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:28.589
 the debts for new ones 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:34.009
 now nobody wants to be 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.589
 under his debts 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:39.619
 that now leads somewhere else "but says possible takeover of 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:43.329
 honesty to our guests and I can now come soon episode 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.059
 can 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:45.089
 were installed 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.650
 I also did not pay back to hackers as much as possible 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.650
 my certainty you always like to read it 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.469
 well that's nice for the tax office with a year 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:00.859
 that use many months not only that stated 80 autumn should Lohan for the 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.029
 fourth place 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.779
 good to see and so he can be sure to say back for example the 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.999
 City people very decent life 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:11.650
 and all other fans are just survivors who say like you 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:14.230
 It was the fault of all of life's artists 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.230
 near several pipeline 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.150
 all life situations also say because he has no problem whatsoever on pump 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.319
 to buy 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.270
 But if I like to know who that is 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.289
 I have my 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.819
 Which of them has no problem with Israel Oranje? 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.659
 two did it 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.529
 10 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.239
 it just does not interest me, maybe it's just not me 

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:50.009
 a little bit 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.009
 The prosecution today likes to portray 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.150
 to the animals no problem with it nom 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.160
 but if that could now attack full debt and the 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.729
 Polin chances to pump and shake 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.180
 So small businesses have been lending themselves in which amount and amount 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.349
 because I made money and got through 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.469
 I would not have asked a problem about it and what do they do professionally as well as create 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:14.469
 for studying we are to be heard 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:27.649
 Therefore, the establishment of a broomstick Bachmann also a bit 

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:28.100
 money 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.250
 we are really happy Tim Wiese would come to us with us 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.750
 Such back there was interesting topic to the man friends lending money 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.750
 but the last pass speaks warmly thanks for the first time 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:50.330
 This may be because Thomas Helmers June in the EU 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.930
 where is and we never quite correct 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:53.889
 Marie Luisa 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.129
 Spiegel Online but expensive is they say no 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:57.259
 when I did 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:58.650
 at least not possible 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.419
 although he has 31 comments a house of a tire plant has a job on 1 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.970
 By the way, who offer his life we ​​come to life 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.130
 At that time, she said the "Bild" newspaper even though he was his son 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.890
 Money that Marilyn Monroe invests with the game to game and that's not 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:15.839
 necessary 

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:17.749
 the latter should be 

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:21.969
 also the weight German one in this first procedure with which I also 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:25.369
 See the result of our survey and then say the overwhelming 

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:28.369
 Majorities recognized such a market 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.270
 there is a long time for it there are two points 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:43.069
 and no problem is facing us but there is only one point was none 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.749
 absolute minority 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:46.099
 just look at that 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:48.830
 you just do not worry our finances are clear 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.629
 untypical 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:52.680
 But that's just because he knows that the next government 

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:53.919
 Everything is fine anyway
