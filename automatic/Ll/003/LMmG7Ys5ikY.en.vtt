00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.400
 i 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.840
 who made the center since papal 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.430
 did the center to Henry does not even know a 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.040
 very comfortable ball for him to give me the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.720
 could come back to me and it came 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.570
 asking and I said this is the opportunity 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.059
 of hitting the frame and I asked it like 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.280
 crazy a lot of times and it turned out that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.370
 throwing it put me an excellent pass and the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.140
 can put and the truth that is a ball 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.449
 perfect that comes back because no 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.320
 it comes neither very strong nor very soft 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:53.190
 It comes well and I do not think I see it and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.070
 I hit him hit him as he comes 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.410
 I sensed that I was going to score several goals 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.410
 people had told me I said this is 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.320
 the opportunity is here and seeing the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.240
 new then I still have a mind all 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.100
 after four years of the coup 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.009
 terminal mind everything like how was the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.009
 potato center and how henry sticks and 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.009
 as eladio charlo to monitor 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.440
 this was a huge happiness because 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.260
 as I said my first game in 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.360
 senior selection a match 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.280
 important that you had to earn it and that 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.530
 you had to score fast is the best goal 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.900
 that stuck with professional single I put 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.030
 two goals but but this one is the one that 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.960
 I like it better because I'll be a selection 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.950
 national and transcendence that the goal 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.230
 had and well that is having also if 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.390
 the truth that it is an honor to be with the 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.080
 fish competing for by going to the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.320
 next round 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.170
 the goal of the fish because it is also is 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.720
 very good and it means give me a lot because 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.720
 it was against mexico and it was a good goal 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.720
 and then in the end so that I win that 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.369
 people said that what goal wins no and I think 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.960
 that either goal is going to 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.149
 be very well represented in the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.740
 next round more than are goals 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.440
 chapines and then that beheaded that 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.120
 always support our world 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.120
