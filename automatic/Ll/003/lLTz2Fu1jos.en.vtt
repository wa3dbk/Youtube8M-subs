00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
and the reason I say that is because

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.670 
and the reason I say that is because
well<00:00:46.770> um<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.809> tells<00:00:48.989> us<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.469> they're

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
well um that just tells us that they're

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
well um that just tells us that they're
going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> be<00:00:49.980> releasing<00:00:50.550> these<00:00:50.760> mobs<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.719> well

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
going to be releasing these mobs as well

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.990 
going to be releasing these mobs as well
not<00:00:52.170> only<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.680> skins<00:00:53.129> but<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> mobs<00:00:53.699> will<00:00:53.879> be
