power<00:02:21.930> spies<00:02:22.170> are<00:02:22.290> responsible<00:02:22.800> is<00:02:22.890> it's

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
power spies are responsible is it's

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.920

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
components get clean energy so this

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.030

means<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.630> they're<00:02:28.200> eliminating<00:02:28.709> voltage

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
means that they're eliminating voltage

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.790

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
a clean DC power all right so now let's

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.460 
a clean DC power all right so now let's
talk<00:02:41.160> about<00:02:41.220> rails<00:02:41.610> for<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.880> little<00:02:42.000> bit<00:02:42.470> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
talk about rails for a little bit the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.620 
talk about rails for a little bit the
HDX<00:02:44.100> specification<00:02:44.820> for<00:02:44.970> power<00:02:45.209> supplies

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
HDX specification for power supplies

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.170 
HDX specification for power supplies

amps<00:02:48.569> of<00:02:48.720> power<00:02:49.280> for<00:02:50.280> safety<00:02:50.730> reasons<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:52.230> what

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
amps of power for safety reasons so what

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.580 
amps of power for safety reasons so what
is<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.890> rail<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.400> rail<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.120> basically<00:02:54.750> a

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
is a rail a rail is basically a

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.250 
is a rail a rail is basically a
separated<00:02:56.550> branch<00:02:57.269> inside<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:57.989> your<00:02:58.050> power

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
separated branch inside of your power

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.410 
separated branch inside of your power
supply<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.800> it's<00:02:58.920> isolated<00:02:59.459> from<00:02:59.519> other<00:02:59.850> rails

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
supply so it's isolated from other rails

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.870 
supply so it's isolated from other rails
this<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.530> comparable<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.250> in<00:03:02.519> your<00:03:02.640> house<00:03:02.850> you

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
this is comparable to in your house you

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.960 
this is comparable to in your house you
probably<00:03:03.360> have<00:03:03.569> a<00:03:04.160> circuit<00:03:05.160> breaker<00:03:05.280> with<00:03:05.940> a

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
probably have a circuit breaker with a

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.670 
probably have a circuit breaker with a
several<00:03:06.750> different<00:03:07.050> circuits<00:03:07.380> different

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
several different circuits different

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.140 
several different circuits different
parts<00:03:07.829> of<00:03:07.890> your<00:03:07.950> house<00:03:08.160> electrically<00:03:09.000> these

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
parts of your house electrically these

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.800 
parts of your house electrically these
are<00:03:09.269> not<00:03:09.420> connected<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.049> each<00:03:10.140> other<00:03:11.450> so<00:03:12.450> it

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
are not connected to each other so it

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.289 
are not connected to each other so it
works<00:03:13.320> very<00:03:13.530> similar<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.070> that<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.459> like<00:03:15.209> I

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
works very similar to that and like I

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.520 
works very similar to that and like I
said<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.600> reason<00:03:15.840> for<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.079> is<00:03:16.170> generally

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
said the reason for this is generally

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.130 
said the reason for this is generally
safety<00:03:16.980> sitting<00:03:17.730> too<00:03:18.269> much<00:03:18.510> more<00:03:18.780> amperage

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
safety sitting too much more amperage

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.110 
safety sitting too much more amperage
could<00:03:19.530> potentially<00:03:19.950> be<00:03:20.070> dangerous<00:03:20.120> because

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
could potentially be dangerous because

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.580 
could potentially be dangerous because
the<00:03:21.329> wires<00:03:21.510> would<00:03:21.690> get<00:03:21.810> pretty<00:03:22.019> hot<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:24.590> what

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
the wires would get pretty hot so what

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.479 
the wires would get pretty hot so what
this<00:03:25.709> means<00:03:25.980> is<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:26.130> when<00:03:26.370> you're

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
this means is that when you're

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.069 
this means is that when you're
connecting<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.880> components<00:03:27.360> you<00:03:27.720> now<00:03:27.870> not

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
connecting the components you now not

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.300 
connecting the components you now not
only<00:03:28.200> have<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.470> be<00:03:28.680> sure<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:29.190> your

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
only have to be sure that your

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
lot of video cards for example require

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.039 
lot of video cards for example require
far<00:03:52.019> more<00:03:52.079> than<00:03:52.609> 20<00:03:53.609> amps<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:54.030> current<00:03:54.239> so<00:03:54.870> how

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
far more than 20 amps of current so how

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.630 
far more than 20 amps of current so how
do<00:03:55.109> you<00:03:55.200> deal<00:03:55.320> with<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:56.190> answer<00:03:56.459> is<00:03:56.489> you

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
do you deal with that the answer is you

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.750 
do you deal with that the answer is you
have<00:03:56.730> multiple<00:03:56.910> rails<00:03:57.359> for<00:03:57.660> 12<00:03:57.959> volts<00:03:58.260> and

have multiple rails for 12 volts and

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.039 
have multiple rails for 12 volts and
often<00:03:59.760> two<00:03:59.910> or<00:03:59.940> three<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.420> maybe<00:04:00.510> each<00:04:00.780> one<00:04:00.959> is

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
running at 15 amps let's say so what you

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.770 
running at 15 amps let's say so what you
can<00:04:03.959> do<00:04:04.079> is<00:04:04.790> your<00:04:05.790> video<00:04:06.000> card<00:04:06.299> but<00:04:06.480> first<00:04:06.630> we

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
can do is your video card but first we

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.509 
can do is your video card but first we
first<00:04:07.200> off<00:04:07.380> be<00:04:07.500> getting<00:04:07.709> some<00:04:07.890> power<00:04:08.070> directly

different rails for example and let's
say<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.209> need<00:04:18.980> 30<00:04:19.980> amps<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.580> power<00:04:21.170> you<00:04:22.370> could

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.670 
say you need 30 amps of power you could
be<00:04:23.520> dividing<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.120> up<00:04:24.150> between<00:04:24.300> your<00:04:25.170> two<00:04:25.440> wires

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
but this can still be a little difficult

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.660 
but this can still be a little difficult

on the best way to do this is first of
all<00:04:34.560> you<00:04:34.800> can<00:04:34.950> often<00:04:35.130> look<00:04:35.670> up<00:04:35.820> the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
all you can often look up the

the rail divisions are and that might
help<00:04:42.390> you<00:04:42.510> out<00:04:42.630> a<00:04:42.660> little<00:04:42.810> bit<00:04:43.700> but<00:04:44.700> generally

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
help you out a little bit but generally

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.150 
help you out a little bit but generally

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
connected to and so as a result you just

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.430 
connected to and so as a result you just
plug<00:05:30.210> in<00:05:30.390> let's<00:05:30.630> say<00:05:30.690> your<00:05:30.810> video<00:05:30.990> card<00:05:31.230> for

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
plug in let's say your video card for

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.770 
plug in let's say your video card for
example<00:05:31.920> and<00:05:32.100> it'll<00:05:32.880> just<00:05:32.910> work<00:05:33.180> as<00:05:33.420> long<00:05:33.660> as

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
example and it'll just work as long as

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.420 
example and it'll just work as long as
you<00:05:33.900> have<00:05:34.080> the<00:05:34.110> right<00:05:34.440> amperage<00:05:34.920> for<00:05:35.310> that

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
you have the right amperage for that

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.360 
you have the right amperage for that
single<00:05:35.640> 12<00:05:35.970> volt<00:05:36.150> rail<00:05:36.330> on<00:05:36.750> your<00:05:36.990> power<00:05:37.170> supply

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
single 12 volt rail on your power supply

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.220 
single 12 volt rail on your power supply
so<00:05:38.370> my<00:05:38.610> personal<00:05:39.000> suggestion<00:05:39.360> is<00:05:39.690> get<00:05:40.200> a

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
so my personal suggestion is get a

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.140 
so my personal suggestion is get a
single<00:05:40.470> rail<00:05:40.830> power<00:05:41.070> supply<00:05:41.370> and<00:05:41.640> it<00:05:41.910> takes<00:05:42.090> a

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
single rail power supply and it takes a

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.030 
single rail power supply and it takes a
lot<00:05:42.270> of<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.390> guesswork<00:05:42.630> out<00:05:42.860> however<00:05:43.860> if<00:05:43.980> you

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
lot of the guesswork out however if you

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.260 
lot of the guesswork out however if you
don't<00:05:44.220> feel<00:05:44.370> comfortable<00:05:44.400> doing<00:05:44.790> that<00:05:45.000> you

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
don't feel comfortable doing that you

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.210 
don't feel comfortable doing that you
want<00:05:45.450> to<00:05:45.540> get<00:05:45.690> a<00:05:45.870> 3-volt<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.800> three<00:05:47.040> real

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
want to get a 3-volt the three real

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.100 
want to get a 3-volt the three real
power<00:05:47.460> supply<00:05:47.880> you<00:05:48.300> can't<00:05:48.510> do<00:05:48.660> that<00:05:48.780> just<00:05:48.960> make

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
power supply you can't do that just make

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.170 
power supply you can't do that just make
sure<00:05:49.320> that<00:05:49.860> you'll<00:05:50.010> be<00:05:50.160> able<00:05:50.190> to<00:05:50.430> hook<00:05:50.970> up<00:05:51.150> the

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
sure that you'll be able to hook up the

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.580 
sure that you'll be able to hook up the
connections<00:05:51.660> in<00:05:51.780> such<00:05:51.930> a<00:05:51.960> way<00:05:52.170> that<00:05:52.200> you'll<00:05:52.470> be

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
connections in such a way that you'll be

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.500 
connections in such a way that you'll be
getting<00:05:52.890> the<00:05:53.010> right<00:05:53.130> amount<00:05:53.190> of<00:05:53.430> amperage<00:05:53.760> for

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
getting the right amount of amperage for

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.790 
getting the right amount of amperage for
your<00:05:54.630> video<00:05:54.840> card<00:05:55.110> or<00:05:55.290> whatever<00:05:55.650> other

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
your video card or whatever other

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.580 
your video card or whatever other
component<00:05:56.280> you're<00:05:56.400> worried<00:05:56.610> about<00:05:57.380> so<00:05:58.380> that's

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
component you're worried about so that's

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.420 
component you're worried about so that's
basically<00:05:58.980> it<00:05:59.400> for<00:05:59.790> rails<00:06:00.720> um<00:06:01.340> another<00:06:02.340> thing

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
basically it for rails um another thing

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.770 
basically it for rails um another thing
can<00:06:02.610> be<00:06:02.640> a<00:06:02.730> little<00:06:02.880> confusing<00:06:03.030> so<00:06:03.420> you<00:06:03.600> have
