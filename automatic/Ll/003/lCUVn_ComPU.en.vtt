 This package is inside the YouTube cover, but always look at the function 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:17.610
 The stickers consist of four pieces that are made into a round shape that I want to be pretty 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.690

 So much so that if you look at the Korean language is now supported 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:54.390
 I always feel what is described in the mouse and look at the Korean writing only features 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:58.950
 Be not do what I used to use the software and what these parts 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:05.579

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.410
 That's why we do not need everything that is zero . 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.280
 Here is the end of the filter 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:46.019

 So inside the package is configured like this 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.890
 It looks like a real mouse . 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.709
 It's pretty and it's pretty tired. 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:08.800
 For some minutes, the fourth found 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.800
 Let's take a look at the celebration once . 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:25.700
 Now one yesterday, you see the changes that led you know why I let 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.830
 I'll explain . Oh, it's small enough to be a mouse. 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:32.990
 f Part 2 of 9 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:35.900
 But this will be the teeth that in the past all your muscle auto mouse that 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.140
 It's like a pen mouse. 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.140
 A worthy mouse is laser sensor 2 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:49.220
 He's now settling in 9005 in prison. 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:55.210
 Uh top ahkkan now be a little polyurethane urethane coated with the material 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:59.300
 The ghost is on the side, so put the mouse and the frame separately 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:04.590
 I can disconnect . Of course. 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:08.370
 I need to get rid of it. I do not have it now. There's a spiral process . 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:12.420
 I do not see the hairline on the fair line either. 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:15.060
 Do you see in the picture is ttaenggiji ahyika Hearer minute WAN Aunt

 I do not know why 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:24.390
 Where do you want to go? It's 50 million. 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:29.610
 Oh, I have a hairline on the side, and it's irritating inside. 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:36.390
 When the led lights up a little better, this is how it is composed 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:41.160
 If you look at the inside of the whole, it is quite transparent at the top, now transparent 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.120
 Now another prime top frames are attached so that structural 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.200
 It is. 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.730
 This is the leg that is shining from the inside. 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.550
 In translation 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:54.330
 Uh, and now you look back. 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:59.100
 through the button that allows you to change the dpi button tpa 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:02.520
 Because the b-side itself is high osd, 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.740
 You can look at the software page isnt not in the mouth 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.130
 You must see it. 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.190
 Now, 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:15.360
 Shaking the mouse so that you can hold it in the window 4 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:19.740
 Actually, I do not see such parts 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:23.490
 Due to the osd menu and the details changed, 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:28.199
 Subtitle such a part of you that you are using any profile 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:31.710

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:36.000
 Can not you use the color separately ? 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:41.490
 Unfortunately, the house has a memory configuration yedam 17 What Cheerleader 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.560
 A little bit of built-in part is that the usb control itself is one of its kind 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.669
 There is no body support but sweat 5 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:55.050
 There is no support, so there 's an extension of that . 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:07:00.000
 Yesterday I used a little silicon material to light the wheel lightly 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:04.560
 And the patch area looks a bit higher, but the actual mouse and size 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:09.840
 Because it is small, and when it 's done, I can not say this, so the finger copper wearer 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:13.680
 It also looks at the basis of eight people, but the great hand antenna What hanteneun 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.700
 I can see a mouse of that size that can not even make a fist 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.030
 It's a little too small to come out a little. 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:26.000
 I'm sorry I came out a little bit . 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:29.780
 Something like that to something more material part and the part description here is my 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.770
 I'm going to do it for you. 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.520

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:44.050
