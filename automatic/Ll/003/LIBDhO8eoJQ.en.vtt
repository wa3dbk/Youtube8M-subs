00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.390
 Hi guys, I'm fine, I'm a 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.920
 Momentary moment of this first video 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.250
 of the weekend to comment with 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.500
 You read my January 2013 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.770
 this video inspired by what I walked 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.630
 reading from the side of the blog or website 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.880
 so in January it was a month that 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.050
 it well above average than 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.489
 looking past but sanctioning were not 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.860
 shorter books 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.750
 then it is justified a little if I 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.910
 had read the densest a 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.400
 existence could not have read 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.470
 so many books in the month 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.300
 so let's start first book that 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.810
 I finished in January, this was the one from here. 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.910
 runaway of analysis 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.750
 pages see pm this book has three 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.470
 Tales 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.160
 the basic biju manoel and the fugitive is not 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.310
 I really liked it and I thought it was more 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.530
 consistent the work of the rings 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.660
 nor at least in these six tales 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.449
 here I did not see anything as soon as I 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.880
 aroused interest in reading is something of her 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.080
 again the first contact is well 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.300
 interesting 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.550
 are erotic tales is with that touch 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.310
 Exotic it is already a well - author 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:19.030
 known of this genre, nor the old 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.250
 But then, there was nothing that 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.030
 I would like to buy another book 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.710
 It's not bad, you know. One was a reading. 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.960
 It was worth it as an experiment, maybe 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.869
 future I look for something more 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.420
 then he kisses the french stefhany 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.659
 perkins i loved it was everything i 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.960
 I even imagined a story like 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.080
 this very young Haitian étienne and 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.119
 Ana are very captivating characters they 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.060
 some irritation sometimes because 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.299
 They do not make up their minds, but I think so. 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.159
 everything very coherent in this history and 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.170
 very slightly know when the staff 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.990
 said that getting rid of fluff does not understand 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.390
 How the book is cute, I do not know. 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.000
 I understood very well but after I read 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.280
 I understood very well what this means 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.409
 I will not write about year of the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.330
 children now because I want to read soon 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:13.150

 then he lomadee do carlos orsi 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.900
 Martin, this is a while, it's childish. 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.210
 of a Children's Fiction Story 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.770

 She gave me a lot and she caused a lot of 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.780
 irritation but he has several others 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.910
 aspects that make up for it 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.750
 There is a certain mystery to curiosity. 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.190

 This one is the same author of the cabin. 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.390
 this book follows the same path 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.669
 then it has that touch religiosity and 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.500
 spirituality behind it found 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.060
 I started very promising and found until 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.940
 I start it more interesting than 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.130
 hut that already has hell neither had 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.169

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:23.110
 This book started to stay this way. 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.410
 half -notion began to follow for a 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.210
 Strange road in general I liked the 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.190
 hut than this but I 'll write 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.849
 about it on the blog so if you like it 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.890
 a book for those who like themes with 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.060
 High stock helps religiosity and 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.120
 spirituality 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.400
 You do not like this theme or will you? 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.470
 looking for is really a book for who 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.880
 like the subject 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.410
 I'll see if I can write about the 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.840
 next week on the blog I think I'm going 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.849
 write about next week 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.370
 then he passion drugs and rock'n'roll 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:57.099
 I do not like the technical level 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:00.220
 of this book I had high expectations 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:02.800
 and today, this reading 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.169
 but I did not like the character 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.020
 the main vick was a corner and 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.090
 characters were the characters were 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.060
 big problem of my month 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.000
 I really did not like the 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.420
 her behavior I did not like the 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.260
 I did not like the ending story. 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:24.660
 so I like the theme, do not talk 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.120
 what about the hawks air only what is life like 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.880
 that these people make them 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.810
 They deal with this I liked it but all the rest I 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.470
 I did not like it 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:36.090
 so I do not do not indicate tatlin that 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.370
 book is very well evaluated has lots of 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.530
 people who like it then if you want to read 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.890
 I say you do a search on the 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:46.050
 google about his reviews about 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:49.620
 other places because I did not like it 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:54.270
 indicate okay this is something very particular 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:56.310
 so it's cheer bc leaves with you and 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.310
 then he had no month as per one 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.270
 Just the moment, andre 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.550
 probably this is the video of 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.930
 next week because I did the review 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.419
 of the first volume which is a look of 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:09.030
 love video so I'll continue to 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:10.950
 video series this book follows the 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.140
 same way as the first one I found 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.360
 who has more story and taco the plot 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.669
 It's not so much about sex and everything and even 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.190
 I made some markings on top and side 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:23.340
 but I did not like the landmarks that is the 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.140
 main character sullivan's brother 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.240
 I did not like it, the book is 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:31.950
 landmarks did not so my style knows 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.540
 So I found him a bit of a bit of a bitch. 

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.250
 I thought it was very kitschy. 

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.070
 so I did not like the book in that 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.110
 I sense the legal book and everything is a lot 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.780
 People who like the landmarks but I 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:46.650
 I did not like the style of man he is. 

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:48.750
 You know him to speak but everything else is a 

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:51.630
 cool book if you started the p bv series 

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.850
 continue then these were my 

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.370
 Letters are meant to be as fast as I can. 

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:59.810
 I read a sorceress and the wardrobe and 

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.810
 I'm struggling with the franchises.
