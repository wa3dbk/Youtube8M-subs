00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hey this is incredibly delicious 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.020
 smoked barbecue almonds and we the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.460
 I'll show you this in the wake 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.179
 by barbecue from Rheinhessen 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.179
 have lots of fun with it 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.850
 Here are the whole thing that I am 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.220
 will need to transform the barbie 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.960
 the chemical has just reached 180 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.630
 Just before and there I am the almonds 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.510
 I would like to smoke the chips here 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.750
 dream we set by akm then 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.460
 there are 600 grams of almonds then 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.739
 Let's do a little bit of peanut oil 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.390
 need and come as a spice mixture 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.930
 that pippa or from barbie doll to 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.940
 commitment 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.070
 then we only need one more shell 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.860
 and a spoon to mix and then 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.850
 I would say let's go 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.920
 First of all, I have the 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.920
 Wechselbad gramm here in this 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.560
 filled container and then comes now 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.680
 a little bit of the peanut oil above 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.680
 about it 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.920
 Guess enough that if you then you 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:32.920
 spoon of schnapps that all almonds are gone with 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.190
 are just so the robot belongs 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.450
 Already better off next 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.070
 then I grab the spice mixture 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.440
 this is as said that pippa of 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.940
 Cash pid is there from anchor herb 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.320
 a relatively sharp mixture that is 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.300
 so if you like the almonds too 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.710
 wanted to make children now it would be 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.110
 maybe not the optimal variant 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.880
 but I like very sharp and therefore 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.970
 is that wonderful and then I have 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:05.170
 the almonds here and now it's spreading 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:08.250
 if he is the first layer on it 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.250
 perform once 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.530
 and on we go the almonds are now 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.970
 I'm ready to go 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.470
 short aside and we saw 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.930
 here is even more on the table and 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.730
 Although I have here so that a 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.100
 so it was wanted 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.299
 the extension ring from the smog into the 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.350
 I will use it because if that 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.480
 almonds are on it 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.190
 the smoke can really be super good by that 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.380
 the almonds optimally with the smoke 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.610
 if you can do that 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.080
 not now I do not know who so 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.670
 a pizza sheet or something like that 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.470
 Even holes just have it with the smoke 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.880
 draw not only on the side over 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.720
 but really everywhere 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.519
 came through 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.780
 that would really recommend then 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.190
 we will barbecue indirectly that is 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.140
 So here are the broken stones and 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.489
 the normal grill grates and then 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.120
 Let's prepare the grill for that 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.850
 smoke in front 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.170
 here are chips we set as 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.239
 First we will now be the rage ships 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.340
 hang up I said earlier in 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.780
 Water soaked just so 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.780
 do not start burning immediately 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.090
 then come the petrified grill 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.980
 then this is where the shell of 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.300
 fangs already start to smoke 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.300
 then the almonds are distributed 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.969
 that fits perfectly in 600 grams 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:09.760
 and then cover a good one 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.829
 quarter of an hour later the temperature in the 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.959
 Grill is not over 130 degrees 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.760
 been only for you ever as 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.519
 Note, he said 180 degrees preheat 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.160
 reaching as if I said so 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:27.430
 Good hour later we have the 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:31.150
 almonds once in just over 20 minutes 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.740
 later our almonds are ready 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.139
 look absolutely awesome and 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.120
 smell absolutely fantastic and the 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.419
 I take the grill and let it go 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.190
 the times cool down so look thieves have 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.960
 because now finished and people I can 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.690
 They say they smell fantastic and 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.340
 Now is the time to try 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:56.740
 Here are the almonds time to try 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:58.539
 the city always so walled I love yes 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.080
 So you have a certain sugar market 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.810
 around 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.180
 but those absolutely sugarless here 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.770
 fantastic make-up is also correct 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.940
 nice out there and the chef they did 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.050
 not so wild actually almost 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.669
 suitable for children could yes 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.960
 try out 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.590
 you should be absolutely fantastic 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.510
 imitate 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.979

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.510
