00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.140

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.799
 a sony the same take because of it 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.290
 is the dark green leafy vegetables 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.299
 especially especially the wild green on 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.399

 Number 2 are teenies kiwis are very 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.500
 Rich in vitamin C and in principle 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.360
 here you all vitamin C rich 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.600
 foods as well as oranges or 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.730
 red pepper red paprika or whole 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.040
 many other fruits and vegetables 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.970
 but especially kiwi very very high 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.150
 and vitamin c vitamin c is totally good 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.070
 suitable to help her young 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.540
 to keep elastic beautiful skin 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.570
 that's why second name here 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.480
 kiwis in third place 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.390
 very simple and easy water you have to 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.580
 you one of the biggest problems of the 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.680
 Humanity is so persistent here 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.209
 dehydrated it will drink so little 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.910
 and then especially in you a lot of salty 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.680
 Things about you take alcohol at the coffee 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.239
 the borders to him pull the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.360
 that's why there is so much water 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.890
 important a lot you over here 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.019
 that integrate especially when so warm 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.670
 summer is just now because of that 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.100
 The raw food is so fantastic because of the 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.280
 raw food most of the raw fruits 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.810
 and vegetables receive 80 70 80 90 percent 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.190
 water 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.360
 the best it was also because it fresh 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.400
 filtered water as you plant 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.739
 So that's why raw food is back 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.079
 but especially to mention socially 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.220
 especially also lift the dehydrating 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.690
 use before I continue with now 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.470
 the other two foods the 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.049
 still missing here 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.070
 it's not about these five 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.269
 Food is a constant too 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.690
 if you consume all the time 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.540
 In addition, you eat unhealthy junk food 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.549
 eats meat is gluten is white 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.410
 sugar to you take dairy products 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.760
 All day we consumed a lot 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.280
 to do too much in the western world 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.930
 especially in Germany so I say 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.310
 as someone who really is the whole world 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.870
 travels all the time and really 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.280
 distinguish Germany from Germany 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.170
 nutrition really on the whole 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.900
 not very healthy, especially with something 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.940
 asia compares main to mine 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.459
 at least it does not work 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.510
 therefore especially food 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.680
 but mainly has to 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.680
 I give a council 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.269
 let this acid forming 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.909
 toxic foods away showing 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.579
 The best advice you can give it 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:21.489
 just like white sugar sugar 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.870
 alcohol red meat or I would 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.330
 say wrong general we are 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.970
 vegetarian dairy especially 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.620
 cow milk products that are the times 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.560
 would like to mention main foods here 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.850
 the absolutely salt salt white that 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.940
 refined salt and refined sugar 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:40.449
 These are all toxic foods, the 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.440
 especially in excess consumed to one 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.840
 contribute to a faster aging process 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.289
 and as a last final I like here like 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.479
 I mention nuts all the way 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.860
 Coconut oil and coconut products being 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.280
 The coconut is not actually in the 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.990
 conventional sense - but would have to 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.960
 both the coconut oil also in the 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.199
 special are these omega 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.150
 fatty acids that also contribute to it 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.400
 that nutrients absorb well at all 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.199
 you can be beautiful 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.690
 keep it smooth in the river keep it 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.340
 the oils and americas are in charge 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.590
 So that's why I just like that here 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.979
 Also, of course, with nuts 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.419
 and coconut fat, especially in moderation 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.110
 So should not be consumed 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.910
 exaggerated 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.330
 that was my five foods we 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:31.150
 help to get a nice skin for 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.889
 I was happy for you 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.160
 to be able to be as said with us 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.510
 the birth preparation in full swing 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.680
 but I still feel like you 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.330
 since I'll probably make a video of us 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.190
 the baby is in the world and to say 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.750
 you like our birth against and how that 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.700
 everything went so am looking forward to you 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.860
 stay connected and know this 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.630
 because they have so many people 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.139
 share in our life and we share 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.450
 like to somehow like to share because we 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.849
 To inspire you to be healthier 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.349
 your dreams do not live in the 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.760
 Most of all, it does not have to be a mill 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:02.169
 if you are unhappy with it since then 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.479
 you enjoy it then it is good 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.919
 but there are many people with that 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.470
 I'm in contact with those who are unhappy 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.270
 to be tired 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.039
 the things to get prefers from 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.360
 not really society 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.160
 are happy and there are 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.919
 alternative as it is in such a family 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.880
 the absolutely alternative lives and lives up 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:23.120
 very high level 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.610
 yes inspire as in health in 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.460
 relating to my passion to live 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.260
 what we do what we clarify with what 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.670
 we make our money others 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.770
 inspire people and we do 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.510
 that does not do it with a full full 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.210
 from the people of the round of my soul 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:42.010
 thanks for watching sva see you soon 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.010
 again typical makes it good
