00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.710
 we are in Rotterdam with the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.300
 top scorer of the premier league because that 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.920
 has a very big one besides soccer 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.400
 passion and that is 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.400
 basketball 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.019
 why basketball was good at just being 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.890
 that I just have nice fun spots 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.140
 in a bit of a little actually 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.390
 I have followed a little bit in the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.280
 actually very intensive in recent years 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.960
 next time a bit and i like it there 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.790
 no road let the cake look but well 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.260
 prefer haasje get it at home 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.600
 of rather go after school lesson 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.920
 a soccer game 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.760
 I honestly think you 'd rather name 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.520
 was cool because i got into much specter vs 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.020
 a football and explain what happened 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.059
 more in a competition anyway 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.199
 so you often have their scores ability that 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.010
 got junks have things that just a lot 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.660
 more 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.660
 are much more fun than I like football 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.840
 nice this guy who stand 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.369
 yes two greats may well say well 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.939
 if it is we have a length of 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.950
 the wash yes in length certainly and you mbe 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.360
 played it played after I guitar 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.729
 stopped and I have some nice years with it 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.920
 made of course there you go irons 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.520
 shoot and then you can from cisco this 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.200
 seven or so what in fact just a who 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.640
 on which the dribbles see 2l with that container 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.229
 for emma 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.060
 oh yeah do this alone camera no 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.740
 I really don't do it and I have coaching 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.119
 they never called fleece well god 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.220
 good shape 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.270
 he is still a very own shop 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.950
 brown comma 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.950
 I only have one action 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.920
 well you have a son jordan but like 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.369
 you get a boy again 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.030
 yes michael trance i said there is 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.740
 michael 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.330
 yes but then my girlfriend said why 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.340
 do you have my cow come to say michael 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.300
 yes I was just looking document 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.690
 about michael jordan 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.560
 when they are jordan heavy 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.600
 nice 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.640
 John Kramer also sounds with one 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.420
 had a name without knowing we or 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.420
 a boy of girl 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.130
 when I sail and start it is not super 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.380
 large or super wide or super strong 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.970
 know someone who is strong but while 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.100
 Footballer is just a physical one 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.380
 sport is so then you would expect that 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.320
 Putin ice is white must beech 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.460
 against defenders who are taller 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.440
 I think his 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.480
 have a muscle mass you see he what 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.400
 is smarter then broom thus far 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.660
 more the and your muscle mass 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.970
 I would only like to be more inspiring 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.700
 the gap and minutes are mine 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.530
 he speeds precisely because that is then 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.300
 again the female he makes it 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.720
 you can of course train like this 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.340
 you don't lose your speed 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.350
 there is however an explosive 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:27.160
 so the muscle mass that you carry is not 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:29.260
 so that you become slower even though you would 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.790
 He there you go fit 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.990
 well i looked angry at it regularly 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.930
 football and I listened to the 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.680
 discussions and feyenoord has a striker 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.630
 so i want michiel kramer is good 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.080
 busy her is from london 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.650
 I think it is about Mr van Yellow 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.600
 to decide that 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.070
 rheezerveen that everyone there continuously 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.660
 has finally expected 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.430
 everyone is a bit broad people 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.770
 may be that is just annoying because 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.870
 everyone you push a certain angle yes 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.060
 the one you did n't ask for yourself 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.770
 I did not ask for this yes so it goes 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.640
 it all a cup 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.640
