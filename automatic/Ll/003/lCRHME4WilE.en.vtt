00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
nevermind he has shrunk every single

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.020 
nevermind he has shrunk every single
apocalypse<00:00:06.420> tanks<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.830> just<00:00:08.099> crazy<00:00:08.400> that

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
apocalypse tanks that is just crazy that

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.959 
apocalypse tanks that is just crazy that
is<00:00:09.150> really<00:00:09.389> nice<00:00:09.510> my<00:00:09.690> crowing<00:00:09.990> by<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.170> Matisse

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
is really nice my crowing by a Matisse

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.580 
is really nice my crowing by a Matisse
he's<00:00:11.969> got<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:13.370> bunch<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.549> crab<00:00:14.820> copters

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
he's got a bunch of crab copters

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.480 
he's got a bunch of crab copters
shrinking<00:00:16.590> those<00:00:16.710> apocalypse<00:00:17.250> tank<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
shrinking those apocalypse tank so the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.950 
shrinking those apocalypse tank so the
positives<00:00:17.970> tanks<00:00:18.210> amazingly<00:00:18.690> have<00:00:18.840> to

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
positives tanks amazingly have to

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.380 
positives tanks amazingly have to
retreat<00:00:19.640> only<00:00:20.640> because<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.119> crowd

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
retreat only because of the crowd

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.670 
retreat only because of the crowd
copters<00:00:21.720> otherwise<00:00:21.960> they<00:00:22.170> definitely<00:00:22.470> have

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
copters otherwise they definitely have

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.240 
copters otherwise they definitely have
the<00:00:22.800> advantage<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.460> armor<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.630> firepower<00:00:25.250> but

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the advantage in armor and firepower but

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.070 
the advantage in armor and firepower but
that's<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.849> question<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.269> my<00:00:27.449> crowing<00:00:27.689> now<00:00:27.810> is

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
that's the question of my crowing now is

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.560 
that's the question of my crowing now is
that<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.560> choir<00:00:28.800> copters<00:00:29.310> they're<00:00:30.300> trying<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
that the choir copters they're trying to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.269 
that the choir copters they're trying to
freeze<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.050> apocalypse<00:00:31.529> tanks<00:00:31.830> now<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.189> that

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
freeze the apocalypse tanks now and that

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.139 
freeze the apocalypse tanks now and that
takes<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.610> longer<00:00:32.820> time<00:00:33.200> so<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:35.100> time<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
takes a longer time so that time that it

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.090 
takes a longer time so that time that it
takes<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.420> freeze<00:00:36.750> an<00:00:36.870> apocalypse<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.590> quite

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
takes to freeze an apocalypse is quite

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.410 
takes to freeze an apocalypse is quite
deadly<00:00:39.440> because<00:00:40.610> that<00:00:41.610> means<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> quadcopter

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
deadly because that means the quadcopter

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.420 
deadly because that means the quadcopter
is<00:00:42.450> busy<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.050> can't<00:00:43.260> shrink<00:00:43.469> units<00:00:44.010> so

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
is busy and it can't shrink units so

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.729 
is busy and it can't shrink units so
crack<00:00:45.390> Raptors<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:46.230> effective<00:00:46.410> when

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
crack Raptors are really effective when

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.069 
crack Raptors are really effective when
they<00:00:46.860> shrink<00:00:47.270> but<00:00:48.270> they're<00:00:48.450> freezing<00:00:48.690> thing

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
they shrink but they're freezing thing

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.569 
they shrink but they're freezing thing
takes<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:49.710> long<00:00:49.800> time<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.370> here's<00:00:50.520> of

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
takes really long time so here's of

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.970 
takes really long time so here's of
indicators<00:00:51.000> we're<00:00:51.239> waiting<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.690> bomb<00:00:51.980> these

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
indicators we're waiting to bomb these

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.250 
indicators we're waiting to bomb these
hammer<00:00:53.460> tanks<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.629> hammer<00:00:54.809> tanks<00:00:55.079> pretty

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
hammer tanks the hammer tanks pretty

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.229 
hammer tanks the hammer tanks pretty
much<00:00:55.440> oh<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> see<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.129> lasers<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.000> there's<00:00:57.120> an

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
much oh I see the lasers and there's an

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.779 
much oh I see the lasers and there's an
athena<00:00:57.570> cannon<00:00:58.309> that<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> make

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
athena cannon that is going to make

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.490 
athena cannon that is going to make
mincemeat<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.449> those<00:01:00.629> hammer<00:01:00.840> tanks<00:01:01.199> here

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
mincemeat of those hammer tanks here

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.280 
mincemeat of those hammer tanks here
come<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.680> crop<00:01:02.129> ters<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.840> they're<00:01:03.840> basically

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
come the crop ters and they're basically

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.340 
come the crop ters and they're basically
making<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:05.040> cleaning<00:01:06.000> cleanup<00:01:06.420> duty<00:01:06.720> shall

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
making just cleaning cleanup duty shall

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.670 
making just cleaning cleanup duty shall
we<00:01:07.380> say<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:11.450> that<00:01:12.450> means<00:01:12.659> matey's<00:01:13.260> gun<00:01:13.470> for

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
we say so that means matey's gun for

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:23.610 
we say so that means matey's gun for
tier<00:01:13.860> 3<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.310> well<00:01:14.689> he's<00:01:15.689> gone<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:17.780> cena<00:01:18.780> can

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.880 

so<00:01:24.620> let's<00:01:25.420> see<00:01:26.420> what<00:01:26.570> happens<00:01:26.840> is<00:01:26.990> a<00:01:27.170> I<00:01:27.440> guess

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
so let's see what happens is a I guess

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.070 
so let's see what happens is a I guess
it's<00:01:28.100> apocalypse<00:01:28.790> tanks<00:01:29.120> versus<00:01:29.630> uh<00:01:30.640> yeah

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
it's apocalypse tanks versus uh yeah

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.400 
it's apocalypse tanks versus uh yeah
crier<00:01:33.080> copters<00:01:34.240> from<00:01:35.240> jabs<00:01:35.540> some<00:01:36.050> rip<00:01:36.200> tides

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
crier copters from jabs some rip tides

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.660 
crier copters from jabs some rip tides
and<00:01:36.620> Athena<00:01:37.780> but<00:01:38.780> basically<00:01:38.960> apocalypse

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
and Athena but basically apocalypse

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.570 
and Athena but basically apocalypse
versus<00:01:40.670> allies<00:01:41.740> this<00:01:42.740> is<00:01:42.860> like<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.130> classic

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
versus allies this is like the classic

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.610 
versus allies this is like the classic
thing<00:01:43.730> like<00:01:43.940> can<00:01:44.150> Russian<00:01:44.570> brute<00:01:44.990> force<00:01:45.320> and

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
thing like can Russian brute force and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.340 
thing like can Russian brute force and
armor<00:01:46.100> connect<00:01:46.430> crush<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:47.810> know<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.020> Allies

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
armor connect crush you know the Allies

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.290 
armor connect crush you know the Allies
technology<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:49.310> all<00:01:49.370> the<00:01:49.460> fancy<00:01:49.700> stuff<00:01:50.060> like

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
technology and all the fancy stuff like

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.840 
technology and all the fancy stuff like
that<00:01:51.130> guess<00:01:52.130> we're<00:01:52.250> gonna<00:01:52.310> see<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.610> answer

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
that guess we're gonna see the answer

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.700 
that guess we're gonna see the answer
pretty<00:01:53.000> soon<00:01:53.950> here<00:01:54.950> come<00:01:55.990> crofters<00:01:56.990> but<00:01:57.440> here

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
pretty soon here come crofters but here

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.890 
pretty soon here come crofters but here
had<00:01:57.890> bullfrogs<00:01:58.390> taking<00:01:59.390> care<00:01:59.540> of<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.690> crack

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
had bullfrogs taking care of the crack

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.450 
had bullfrogs taking care of the crack
coppers<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.590> crack<00:02:00.830> copters<00:02:01.220> have<00:02:01.340> to

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
coppers the crack copters have to

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.890 
coppers the crack copters have to
retreat<00:02:01.760> back<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.270> camp<00:02:02.450> shrink<00:02:02.810> the

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
retreat back and the camp shrink the

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.540 
retreat back and the camp shrink the
apocalypse<00:02:03.380> which<00:02:04.160> means<00:02:04.370> now<00:02:04.490> the

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
apocalypse which means now the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.420 
apocalypse which means now the
apocalypse<00:02:04.820> can<00:02:05.270> can<00:02:05.930> push<00:02:06.170> forward<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.770> guess

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
apocalypse can can push forward I guess

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
apocalypse can can push forward I guess
that's<00:02:07.580> what's<00:02:07.760> going<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:07.940> happen<00:02:08.119> very<00:02:08.240> soon

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
that's what's going to happen very soon

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.510 
that's what's going to happen very soon
anyway<00:02:08.780> but<00:02:09.649> unfortunately<00:02:10.070> the<00:02:10.130> bullfrogs

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
anyway but unfortunately the bullfrogs

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.670 
anyway but unfortunately the bullfrogs
have<00:02:10.760> to<00:02:10.850> kind<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.090> stay<00:02:11.240> back<00:02:11.450> because<00:02:11.900> well

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
have to kind of stay back because well

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.380

or<00:03:04.159> shrunk<00:03:04.670> but<00:03:05.450> there's<00:03:05.599> just<00:03:05.659> so<00:03:06.109> many<00:03:06.260> of

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
or shrunk but there's just so many of

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.990 
or shrunk but there's just so many of
them<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:06.859> think<00:03:07.159> it's<00:03:07.280> hard<00:03:07.489> to<00:03:07.609> microwave

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
them that I think it's hard to microwave

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.619 
them that I think it's hard to microwave
them<00:03:08.120> perhaps<00:03:09.549> any<00:03:10.549> cannons<00:03:10.939> are<00:03:11.209> taking<00:03:11.599> care

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
them perhaps any cannons are taking care

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.670 
them perhaps any cannons are taking care
of<00:03:11.810> some<00:03:12.230> of<00:03:12.379> the<00:03:13.030> apocalypse<00:03:14.030> tanks<00:03:14.299> I<00:03:14.389> think

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
of some of the apocalypse tanks I think

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.379 
of some of the apocalypse tanks I think
the<00:03:15.680> point<00:03:16.010> is<00:03:16.159> is<00:03:16.310> that<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.730> crop<00:03:17.150> is<00:03:17.239> trying

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
the point is is that the crop is trying

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.000 
the point is is that the crop is trying
to<00:03:17.450> freeze<00:03:17.689> down<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.019> apocalypse<00:03:18.500> tanks<00:03:18.799> so

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
to freeze down the apocalypse tanks so

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.429 
to freeze down the apocalypse tanks so
that<00:03:19.159> the<00:03:19.220> Athena<00:03:19.489> Canada<00:03:19.819> can<00:03:19.939> take<00:03:20.060> them<00:03:20.180> out

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:20.439 
that the Athena Canada can take them out

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.809 
that the Athena Canada can take them out
but<00:03:21.439> it's<00:03:21.650> just<00:03:21.829> not<00:03:21.889> working<00:03:22.189> because<00:03:22.519> the

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
but it's just not working because the

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.909 
but it's just not working because the
apocalypse<00:03:23.269> tanks<00:03:23.540> now<00:03:23.659> our<00:03:23.840> normal<00:03:24.620> some<00:03:24.829> of
