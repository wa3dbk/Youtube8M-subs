is<00:00:13.910> called<00:00:14.120> decryption<00:00:14.690> and<00:00:14.809> it's<00:00:15.259> a<00:00:15.290> really

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
is called decryption and it's a really

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.260 
is called decryption and it's a really
really<00:00:15.620> unique<00:00:16.009> modes<00:00:16.340> air<00:00:16.550> to<00:00:16.820> watch<00:00:16.970> dogs

really unique modes air to watch dogs

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.000 
really unique modes air to watch dogs
and<00:00:17.539> it's<00:00:17.660> a<00:00:17.690> lot<00:00:17.840> of<00:00:17.930> fun<00:00:18.080> and<00:00:18.320> it's<00:00:18.890> basically

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
and it's a lot of fun and it's basically

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.400 
and it's a lot of fun and it's basically
a<00:00:19.279> team-based<00:00:19.820> game<00:00:20.150> I<00:00:20.300> think<00:00:20.570> in<00:00:20.689> these<00:00:20.810> some

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
a team-based game I think in these some

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.140 
a team-based game I think in these some
the<00:00:21.500> gameplay<00:00:21.830> jacana<00:00:22.100> seen<00:00:22.250> on<00:00:22.369> screen<00:00:22.490> and<00:00:23.029> I

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
the gameplay jacana seen on screen and I

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.820 
the gameplay jacana seen on screen and I
should<00:00:23.330> play<00:00:23.480> with<00:00:23.689> a<00:00:23.750> vikkstar<00:00:24.410> who<00:00:24.560> sit<00:00:24.800> next

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
should play with a vikkstar who sit next

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.189 
should play with a vikkstar who sit next
to<00:00:25.070> me<00:00:25.100> and<00:00:25.310> jackfrags<00:00:26.150> who<00:00:26.539> was<00:00:26.720> won<00:00:26.900> over<00:00:26.930> as

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
to me and jackfrags who was won over as

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.200 
to me and jackfrags who was won over as
well<00:00:27.349> as<00:00:27.529> so<00:00:28.250> I<00:00:28.279> guess<00:00:28.609> we<00:00:28.789> were<00:00:28.910> kind<00:00:29.180> of

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
well as so I guess we were kind of

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.880 
well as so I guess we were kind of
versus<00:00:29.750> each<00:00:29.840> other<00:00:30.050> and<00:00:30.230> sometimes<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.740> same

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
versus each other and sometimes the same

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.740 
versus each other and sometimes the same
team<00:00:31.070> and<00:00:31.310> there's<00:00:31.910> also<00:00:32.090> some<00:00:32.330> gameplay<00:00:32.719> of

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
team and there's also some gameplay of

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.270 
team and there's also some gameplay of
me<00:00:33.050> playing<00:00:33.350> with<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:33.559> guys<00:00:33.739> who<00:00:34.070> actually

managed to peel that off but I managed
to<00:01:11.140> save<00:01:11.410> myself<00:01:11.650> he<00:01:12.040> was<00:01:12.160> gonna<00:01:12.250> run<00:01:12.490> me<00:01:12.580> over

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
to save myself he was gonna run me over

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.070 
to save myself he was gonna run me over
right<00:01:12.910> there<00:01:13.060> by<00:01:13.180> man<00:01:13.330> should<00:01:13.540> sleep<00:01:13.720> up<00:01:13.870> just

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
right there by man should sleep up just

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.870 
right there by man should sleep up just
before<00:01:14.200> he<00:01:14.380> did<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:15.070> that<00:01:15.160> was<00:01:15.250> a<00:01:15.280> very<00:01:15.340> lucky

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
before he did so that was a very lucky

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.210 
before he did so that was a very lucky
escape<00:01:15.910> so<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:16.990> basic<00:01:17.320> idea<00:01:17.350> of<00:01:17.680> decryption

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
escape so the basic idea of decryption

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.050 
escape so the basic idea of decryption
I'm<00:01:18.310> gonna<00:01:18.430> show<00:01:18.580> you<00:01:18.610> guys<00:01:18.730> what<00:01:18.970> it<00:01:19.030> looks

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
I'm gonna show you guys what it looks

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.280 
I'm gonna show you guys what it looks
like<00:01:19.270> let's<00:01:19.480> start<00:01:19.690> of<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.810> match<00:01:19.900> where<00:01:20.200> the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
like let's start of the match where the

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.810 
like let's start of the match where the
file<00:01:20.500> is<00:01:20.530> in<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.860> center<00:01:21.220> of<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.430> map<00:01:21.610> and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
file is in the center of the map and

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.820 
file is in the center of the map and
you're<00:01:22.360> kind<00:01:22.510> of<00:01:22.570> like<00:01:22.690> head-to-head<00:01:23.320> with

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
you're kind of like head-to-head with

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.500 
you're kind of like head-to-head with
another<00:01:24.100> team<00:01:24.370> to<00:01:24.400> try<00:01:24.730> and<00:01:24.850> get<00:01:24.970> your<00:01:25.180> hands

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
another team to try and get your hands

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.540 
another team to try and get your hands
on<00:01:25.630> this<00:01:25.810> file<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.500> when<00:01:26.800> you<00:01:26.890> hold<00:01:27.100> it<00:01:27.340> you'll

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
on this file and when you hold it you'll

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.220 
on this file and when you hold it you'll
see<00:01:27.730> the<00:01:27.850> top<00:01:28.030> left<00:01:28.270> hand<00:01:28.420> screen<00:01:28.840> there's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
see the top left hand screen there's

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.660 
see the top left hand screen there's
kind<00:01:29.410> of<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.530> percentage<00:01:30.040> so<00:01:30.280> you<00:01:30.370> want<00:01:30.550> to

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
kind of a percentage so you want to

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.400 
kind of a percentage so you want to
decrypt<00:01:31.090> it<00:01:31.270> two<00:01:31.630> hundred<00:01:31.720> percent<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.350> you

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
decrypt it two hundred percent and you

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.560 
decrypt it two hundred percent and you
win<00:01:32.650> am<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.550> longer<00:01:33.790> you<00:01:34.030> hold<00:01:34.060> on<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
win am so the longer you hold on to the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.750 
win am so the longer you hold on to the
file<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.710> more<00:01:36.040> it'll<00:01:36.130> go<00:01:36.280> up<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.580> it'll

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
file and the more it'll go up and it'll

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.160 
file and the more it'll go up and it'll
actually<00:01:36.910> got<00:01:37.150> faster<00:01:37.660> if<00:01:37.810> you've<00:01:37.930> got<00:01:38.050> your

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
actually got faster if you've got your

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.990 
actually got faster if you've got your
teammates<00:01:38.590> next<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.010> you<00:01:39.100> so<00:01:39.310> it's<00:01:39.760> totally

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
teammates next to you so it's totally

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.219 
teammates next to you so it's totally
worth<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.360> have<00:01:40.420> your<00:01:40.570> teammates<00:01:41.020> and

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
worth it to have your teammates and

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.410 
worth it to have your teammates and
stand<00:01:42.130> value<00:01:42.460> that<00:01:42.640> rather<00:01:42.910> than<00:01:43.030> run<00:01:43.300> off

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
stand value that rather than run off

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.140 
stand value that rather than run off
free<00:01:43.690> roaming<00:01:43.900> by<00:01:44.110> themselves<00:01:44.940> so<00:01:45.940> it's<00:01:45.970> a

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
free roaming by themselves so it's a

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.550 
free roaming by themselves so it's a
very<00:01:46.180> very<00:01:46.510> team<00:01:46.780> based<00:01:46.990> game<00:01:47.229> and<00:01:47.410> if<00:01:47.470> you've

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
very very team based game and if you've

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.810 
very very team based game and if you've
got<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.740> bad<00:01:47.920> team<00:01:48.190> you're<00:01:48.490> probably<00:01:48.640> gonna

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
got a bad team you're probably gonna

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.240 
got a bad team you're probably gonna
have<00:01:49.000> a<00:01:49.060> bad<00:01:49.300> time<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:50.830> was<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:50.950> lot<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.160> fun

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
have a bad time so it was a lot of fun

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.740 
have a bad time so it was a lot of fun
playing<00:01:51.610> list<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.060> believe<00:01:52.270> there's<00:01:52.479> a<00:01:52.570> few

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
playing list and I believe there's a few

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.690 
playing list and I believe there's a few
different<00:01:52.840> set<00:01:53.320> classes<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.340> can<00:01:54.490> use

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
different set classes you can use

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.760 
different set classes you can use
there's<00:01:54.970> like<00:01:55.060> a<00:01:55.150> sniper<00:01:55.300> class<00:01:55.600> an<00:01:55.930> SMG<00:01:56.380> class

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
there's like a sniper class an SMG class

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.100 
there's like a sniper class an SMG class
I<00:01:57.009> think<00:01:57.190> he<00:01:57.280> actually<00:01:57.460> unlock<00:01:57.880> more<00:01:58.090> but<00:01:59.020> the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
I think he actually unlock more but the

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.240 
I think he actually unlock more but the
sniper<00:01:59.350> one<00:01:59.619> was<00:01:59.800> probably<00:02:00.009> one<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.160> my

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
sniper one was probably one of my

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.980 
sniper one was probably one of my
favorites<00:02:00.759> it<00:02:01.119> took<00:02:01.300> me<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.479> little<00:02:01.600> while<00:02:01.690> to

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
favorites it took me a little while to

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.870 
favorites it took me a little while to
kind<00:02:02.229> of<00:02:02.380> gauge<00:02:02.740> how<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.130> use<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.460> sniper<00:02:03.700> and

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
kind of gauge how to use the sniper and

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.640 
kind of gauge how to use the sniper and
watch<00:02:04.030> dogs<00:02:04.330> you<00:02:04.840> kind<00:02:05.050> of<00:02:05.080> have<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.259> be<00:02:05.410> very

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
watch dogs you kind of have to be very

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.040 
watch dogs you kind of have to be very
an<00:02:06.060> accurate<00:02:07.060> like<00:02:07.180> this<00:02:07.390> when<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:07.810> first

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
an accurate like this when I first

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.270 
an accurate like this when I first
started<00:02:08.170> using<00:02:08.410> this<00:02:08.560> maker<00:02:08.770> I<00:02:08.890> was<00:02:09.009> trying<00:02:09.190> to

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
started using this maker I was trying to

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.610 
started using this maker I was trying to
like<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.550> my<00:02:09.970> head<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.360> person<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:10.899> but<00:02:11.560> you

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
like a my head of the person and but you

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.560 
like a my head of the person and but you
basically<00:02:11.860> have<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.130> aim<00:02:12.370> perfectly<00:02:13.360> on<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
basically have to aim perfectly on the

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.530 
basically have to aim perfectly on the
person<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.260> hit<00:02:14.410> them<00:02:15.030> when<00:02:16.030> i<00:02:16.060> first<00:02:16.330> started

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
person to hit them when i first started

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.940 
person to hit them when i first started
using<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.870> sniper<00:02:17.110> actually<00:02:17.590> felt<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:17.860> was

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
using the sniper actually felt it was

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.950 
using the sniper actually felt it was
quite<00:02:18.160> overpowered<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:19.420> was<00:02:19.569> getting<00:02:19.780> one

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
quite overpowered and I was getting one

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.809 
quite overpowered and I was getting one
hit<00:02:20.140> kills<00:02:20.410> on<00:02:20.620> basically<00:02:20.950> everybody<00:02:21.400> so<00:02:21.670> it

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
hit kills on basically everybody so it

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.280 
hit kills on basically everybody so it
felt<00:02:22.030> really<00:02:22.180> wet<00:02:22.390> good<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.870> then<00:02:23.140> those

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
felt really wet good and then those

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.630 
felt really wet good and then those
other<00:02:23.350> games<00:02:23.560> were<00:02:23.770> had<00:02:23.950> where<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.250> was<00:02:24.340> taking

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
other games were had where it was taking

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.370 
other games were had where it was taking
me<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.760> couple<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.240> shots<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.569> kill<00:02:25.690> people<00:02:26.050> em

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
me a couple of shots to kill people em

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.530 
me a couple of shots to kill people em
so<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.340> didn't<00:02:27.700> feel<00:02:27.819> as<00:02:28.060> good<00:02:28.270> as<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.480> did

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
so it didn't feel as good as it did

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.809 
so it didn't feel as good as it did
before<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.050> but<00:02:29.710> it<00:02:29.830> really<00:02:30.370> just<00:02:30.520> depends<00:02:30.760> on

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
before and but it really just depends on

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.010 
before and but it really just depends on
the<00:02:30.910> map<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.240> think<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.480> guns<00:02:31.660> are<00:02:31.780> pretty<00:02:31.960> well

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
the map I think the guns are pretty well

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.890 
the map I think the guns are pretty well
balanced<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.650> they're<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.880> SMGs<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.840> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
balanced and they're the SMGs and the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.120 
balanced and they're the SMGs and the
salt<00:02:35.080> rifles<00:02:35.380> are<00:02:35.470> really<00:02:35.650> good<00:02:35.770> in<00:02:35.800> sort<00:02:36.069> of

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
salt rifles are really good in sort of

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.720 
salt rifles are really good in sort of
close<00:02:36.340> quarter<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:37.290> ranges<00:02:38.290> obviously<00:02:38.730> but

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
close quarter and ranges obviously but

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.920 
close quarter and ranges obviously but
if<00:02:39.790> you've<00:02:39.880> got<00:02:40.000> really<00:02:40.180> good<00:02:40.360> hand<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.870> eye

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
if you've got really good hand and eye

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.570 
if you've got really good hand and eye
coordination<00:02:41.200> zai<00:02:41.740> can<00:02:41.890> imagine<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.340> sniper

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
coordination zai can imagine the sniper

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.040 
coordination zai can imagine the sniper
rifle<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.030> gonna<00:02:43.180> be<00:02:43.240> pretty<00:02:43.390> powerful<00:02:43.810> in
