00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
not going to be that great of a turnout

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.729 
not going to be that great of a turnout
and<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:03.000> think<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.540> they<00:03:03.660> did<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.870> bringing

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
and I think that they did a bringing

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.220 
and I think that they did a bringing
amazing<00:03:05.519> job<00:03:05.760> with<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.000> multiplayer<00:03:06.450> whilst

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
amazing job with the multiplayer whilst

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.030 
amazing job with the multiplayer whilst
it's<00:03:07.590> very<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.780> guess<00:03:09.780> short-lived<00:03:10.440> for<00:03:10.829> some

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
it's very I guess short-lived for some

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.420 
it's very I guess short-lived for some
people<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:12.019> there<00:03:13.019> is<00:03:13.199> a<00:03:13.230> very<00:03:13.440> lack<00:03:13.739> of

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
people and there is a very lack of

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.119 
people and there is a very lack of
modes<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.879> maps<00:03:14.939> I<00:03:15.359> think<00:03:15.659> they<00:03:15.780> did<00:03:15.930> a

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
modes and maps I think they did a

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.170 
modes and maps I think they did a
absolutely<00:03:17.129> great<00:03:17.640> job<00:03:17.939> with<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
absolutely great job with the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.319 
absolutely great job with the
multiplayer<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:19.739> like<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.849> said<00:03:20.909> I<00:03:21.030> can<00:03:21.209> almost

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
multiplayer and like I said I can almost

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.580 
multiplayer and like I said I can almost
guarantee<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.989> there's<00:03:22.170> going<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.349> be<00:03:22.379> more

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
guarantee that there's going to be more

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.979 
guarantee that there's going to be more
maps<00:03:22.799> in<00:03:23.069> terms<00:03:23.519> of<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.730> game<00:03:23.879> modes<00:03:24.090> there<00:03:24.780> is

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
maps in terms of the game modes there is

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.349 
maps in terms of the game modes there is
no<00:03:25.319> doubt<00:03:25.920> in<00:03:25.950> my<00:03:26.340> mind<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:27.000> we're<00:03:27.209> going<00:03:27.299> to

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
no doubt in my mind that we're going to

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.209 
no doubt in my mind that we're going to
get<00:03:27.510> new<00:03:27.689> game<00:03:27.930> modes<00:03:28.140> why<00:03:28.439> when<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:28.980> hover

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:29.219 
get new game modes why when you hover

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.780 
get new game modes why when you hover
over<00:03:29.609> the<00:03:30.329> game<00:03:30.540> modes<00:03:30.780> in<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:32.430> multiplayer

over the game modes in the multiplayer

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.009 
over the game modes in the multiplayer
like<00:03:32.939> when<00:03:33.090> you're<00:03:33.209> going<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.480> find<00:03:33.689> a<00:03:33.840> match

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
like when you're going to find a match

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.050 
like when you're going to find a match
and<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.769> go<00:03:34.950> down<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.400> game<00:03:35.609> mode<00:03:35.790> when<00:03:35.969> it

explosive<00:05:30.360> gel<00:05:30.540> to<00:05:30.720> blow<00:05:31.110> up<00:05:31.320> walls<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:32.010> take

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
explosive gel to blow up walls to take

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.060 
explosive gel to blow up walls to take
down<00:05:32.790> walls<00:05:33.120> or<00:05:33.510> certain<00:05:34.230> walls<00:05:34.440> that<00:05:34.620> is<00:05:34.830> and

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
down walls or certain walls that is and

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.790 
down walls or certain walls that is and
it<00:05:35.730> can<00:05:35.880> open<00:05:36.270> up<00:05:36.360> like<00:05:36.600> a<00:05:36.780> small<00:05:37.200> new<00:05:37.410> area<00:05:37.740> of

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
it can open up like a small new area of

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.280 
it can open up like a small new area of
the<00:05:37.980> map<00:05:38.160> or<00:05:38.540> you<00:05:39.540> know<00:05:39.630> it<00:05:39.840> could<00:05:39.930> just<00:05:40.080> be<00:05:40.170> a

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
the map or you know it could just be a

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.430 
the map or you know it could just be a
new<00:05:40.530> take<00:05:40.800> down<00:05:41.040> variation<00:05:41.780> that<00:05:42.780> obviously

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
new take down variation that obviously

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.930 
new take down variation that obviously
hasn't<00:05:43.710> been<00:05:43.950> introduced<00:05:44.400> at<00:05:44.580> you<00:05:44.700> could<00:05:44.820> just

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
hasn't been introduced at you could just

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.150 
hasn't been introduced at you could just
use<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.300> explosive<00:05:45.930> gel<00:05:46.140> to<00:05:46.770> take<00:05:46.980> down

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
use the explosive gel to take down

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.770 
use the explosive gel to take down
enemies<00:05:47.520> you<00:05:47.640> can't<00:05:47.850> use<00:05:48.150> it<00:05:48.360> on<00:05:48.480> a<00:05:48.510> wall<00:05:48.750> or

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
enemies you can't use it on a wall or

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.960 
enemies you can't use it on a wall or
anything<00:05:49.320> like<00:05:49.350> that<00:05:49.500> so<00:05:50.400> that<00:05:50.700> would<00:05:50.850> be

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
anything like that so that would be

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.460 
anything like that so that would be
really<00:05:51.150> cool<00:05:51.270> you<00:05:51.450> know<00:05:51.540> an<00:05:51.720> enemy's<00:05:52.020> walking

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
really cool you know an enemy's walking

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.930 
really cool you know an enemy's walking
around<00:05:52.650> that<00:05:52.770> wall<00:05:53.010> and<00:05:53.250> you<00:05:53.670> use<00:05:53.820> your

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
around that wall and you use your

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.280 
around that wall and you use your
explosive<00:05:54.390> gel<00:05:54.510> you<00:05:54.630> take<00:05:54.810> them<00:05:54.930> down<00:05:55.110> that

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
explosive gel you take them down that

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.570 
explosive gel you take them down that
that's<00:05:55.680> just<00:05:56.040> that<00:05:56.190> would<00:05:56.310> be<00:05:56.400> really

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
that's just that would be really

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.050 
that's just that would be really
freaking<00:05:56.940> cool<00:05:58.280> and<00:05:59.280> yeah<00:05:59.520> that's<00:05:59.730> that's

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
freaking cool and yeah that's that's

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.850 
freaking cool and yeah that's that's
just<00:06:00.300> about<00:06:00.480> it<00:06:00.540> in<00:06:00.780> terms<00:06:00.930> of<00:06:01.080> my<00:06:01.230> ideas<00:06:01.680> for

down below and once guy guys I know you
are<00:06:26.160> thinking<00:06:26.370> that<00:06:26.730> the<00:06:26.880> multiplayer<00:06:27.300> is

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
are thinking that the multiplayer is

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.510 
are thinking that the multiplayer is
very<00:06:27.630> dead<00:06:27.900> at<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.200> moment<00:06:28.230> but<00:06:29.010> just<00:06:29.250> keep

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
very dead at the moment but just keep

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.730 
very dead at the moment but just keep
backing<00:06:29.880> out<00:06:30.270> and<00:06:30.450> researching<00:06:31.320> for<00:06:31.500> games

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
backing out and researching for games

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.460 
backing out and researching for games
that<00:06:32.310> is<00:06:32.460> what<00:06:32.610> I<00:06:32.640> do<00:06:32.790> and<00:06:33.180> eventually<00:06:33.330> it<00:06:33.960> may

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
that is what I do and eventually it may

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.440 
that is what I do and eventually it may
take<00:06:34.740> about<00:06:34.980> five<00:06:35.490> minutes<00:06:35.880> to<00:06:36.060> ten<00:06:36.300> minutes

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
take about five minutes to ten minutes

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.600 
take about five minutes to ten minutes
you<00:06:37.020> will<00:06:37.170> find<00:06:37.470> a<00:06:37.560> full<00:06:37.740> lobby<00:06:37.980> no<00:06:38.220> problem

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
you will find a full lobby no problem

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.950 
you will find a full lobby no problem
because<00:06:38.880> what<00:06:39.060> the<00:06:39.180> multiplayer<00:06:39.510> is<00:06:39.690> doing

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
because what the multiplayer is doing

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.570 
because what the multiplayer is doing
right<00:06:40.140> now<00:06:40.260> and<00:06:40.440> I<00:06:40.830> don't<00:06:40.890> think<00:06:41.190> it's<00:06:41.370> doing

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
right now and I don't think it's doing

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.760 
right now and I don't think it's doing
it<00:06:41.700> on<00:06:41.790> purpose<00:06:41.820> is<00:06:42.300> sometimes<00:06:43.080> it'll<00:06:43.350> just

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
it on purpose is sometimes it'll just

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.370 
it on purpose is sometimes it'll just
put<00:06:44.040> you<00:06:44.220> in<00:06:44.400> dead<00:06:44.640> lobbies<00:06:45.090> by<00:06:45.450> yourself<00:06:46.080> and

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
put you in dead lobbies by yourself and

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.700 
put you in dead lobbies by yourself and
that<00:06:46.920> is<00:06:47.130> something<00:06:47.790> I<00:06:47.970> hopefully<00:06:48.360> they<00:06:48.510> fix

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
that is something I hopefully they fix

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.130 
that is something I hopefully they fix
but<00:06:49.710> like<00:06:50.490> I<00:06:50.610> said<00:06:50.670> just<00:06:50.850> keep<00:06:51.300> researching

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.140 
but like I said just keep researching

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.410 
but like I said just keep researching
for<00:06:52.500> games<00:06:52.740> don't<00:06:53.190> wait<00:06:53.550> in<00:06:53.760> a<00:06:53.850> lobby<00:06:54.060> and

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:54.420 
for games don't wait in a lobby and

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.450 
for games don't wait in a lobby and
expect<00:06:54.840> a<00:06:54.960> bunch<00:06:55.140> of<00:06:55.230> people<00:06:55.440> to<00:06:55.530> join<00:06:55.740> because

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 
expect a bunch of people to join because

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.240 
expect a bunch of people to join because
it's<00:06:56.640> doing<00:06:57.000> it<00:06:57.120> for<00:06:57.240> everybody<00:06:57.420> else<00:06:57.750> where

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.250 
it's doing it for everybody else where

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.920 
it's doing it for everybody else where
they<00:06:59.250> search<00:06:59.490> for<00:06:59.520> a<00:06:59.760> game<00:06:59.970> and<00:07:00.180> they<00:07:00.600> get<00:07:00.750> put

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
they search for a game and they get put

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.780 
they search for a game and they get put
in<00:07:01.020> the<00:07:01.080> lobby<00:07:01.290> by<00:07:01.500> themselves<00:07:01.890> back<00:07:02.520> out

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790 
in the lobby by themselves back out

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.330 
in the lobby by themselves back out
research<00:07:03.690> over<00:07:04.410> and<00:07:04.530> over<00:07:04.620> again<00:07:04.860> until<00:07:05.130> you

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
research over and over again until you

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.150 
research over and over again until you
find<00:07:05.820> a<00:07:06.030> full<00:07:06.810> enough<00:07:07.050> lobby<00:07:07.320> and<00:07:07.680> then
