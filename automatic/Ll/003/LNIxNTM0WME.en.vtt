is<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.650> 28<00:00:23.130> millimeters<00:00:23.670> lower<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.570> gets

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
is this 28 millimeters lower and it gets

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.480 
is this 28 millimeters lower and it gets
much<00:00:24.900> sharper<00:00:25.260> light<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.920> get<00:00:26.039> sharper

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
much sharper light to get sharper
