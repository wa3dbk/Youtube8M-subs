00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
know it's just not something exclusive

know it's just not something exclusive
to<00:02:33.150> wildstar<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.660> could<00:02:33.990> just<00:02:34.170> go<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.380> Wow<00:02:34.740> for

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
to wildstar I could just go to Wow for

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.370 
to wildstar I could just go to Wow for
it<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> new<00:02:36.150> experience<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:37.200> is

it but this is a new experience this is

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.870 
it but this is a new experience this is
something<00:02:37.709> different<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:38.280> something<00:02:38.340> that

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
something different and something that

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.880 
something different and something that
looks<00:02:39.330> different<00:02:39.870> than<00:02:40.020> what<00:02:40.410> I've<00:02:40.500> played<00:02:40.770> in

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
looks different than what I've played in

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.280 
looks different than what I've played in
the<00:02:41.010> past<00:02:41.250> albeit<00:02:41.940> it's<00:02:42.090> somewhat<00:02:42.840> similar<00:02:43.260> to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
the past albeit it's somewhat similar to

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.199 
the past albeit it's somewhat similar to
World<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.890> Warcraft<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.850> much<00:02:45.030> more

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
World of Warcraft it's a much more

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.270 
World of Warcraft it's a much more
cartoony<00:02:45.810> style<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.650> will<00:02:46.830> freely<00:02:47.130> admit

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
cartoony style and I will freely admit

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.550 
cartoony style and I will freely admit
that<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.330> not<00:02:48.480> my<00:02:48.630> preferred<00:02:49.050> visual

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
that this is not my preferred visual

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.360 
that this is not my preferred visual
style<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:50.130> video<00:02:50.250> game<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:50.850> really<00:02:51.720> at<00:02:52.410> first<00:02:53.130> I

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
style of video game I really at first I

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.310 
style of video game I really at first I
said<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.700> might<00:02:54.269> not<00:02:54.360> even<00:02:54.510> play<00:02:54.720> wildstar

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
said I might not even play wildstar

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.630 
said I might not even play wildstar
because<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:55.800> wasn't<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.220> appealing<00:02:56.519> to

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
because it just wasn't that appealing to

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.160 
because it just wasn't that appealing to
me<00:02:56.760> but<00:02:57.030> after<00:02:57.269> applying<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.750> for<00:02:57.989> some<00:02:58.140> time

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
me but after applying it for some time

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.680 
me but after applying it for some time
it's<00:02:58.769> grown<00:02:59.340> on<00:02:59.370> me<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.970> that's<00:03:00.120> not<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.360> cop

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
it's grown on me and that's not a cop

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.270 
it's grown on me and that's not a cop
out<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.050> say<00:03:01.230> well<00:03:01.470> if<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.680> guys<00:03:01.860> give<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.160> a

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
out to say well if you guys give it a

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.610 
out to say well if you guys give it a
bunch<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.580> time<00:03:02.850> you'll<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.690> get<00:03:03.870> used<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.440> it

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
bunch of time you'll just get used to it

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.380 
bunch of time you'll just get used to it
maybe<00:03:05.160> that's<00:03:05.430> what<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.910> maybe<00:03:06.150> I've<00:03:06.360> just

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
nothing all that special and I didn't

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.800 
nothing all that special and I didn't
take<00:03:59.190> time<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.670> read<00:03:59.850> the<00:03:59.880> quest<00:04:00.269> so<00:04:00.600> maybe

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
take time to read the quest so maybe

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.350 
take time to read the quest so maybe
that's<00:04:01.110> my<00:04:01.410> fault<00:04:01.440> right<00:04:02.400> maybe<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.120> don't

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
maybe I don't think it's all that

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.789 
maybe I don't think it's all that
special<00:04:05.940> because<00:04:06.209> i<00:04:06.510> didn't<00:04:07.079> get<00:04:07.170> invested

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799

anymore but at this point in time I'm
really<00:05:51.030> excited<00:05:51.390> I<00:05:51.690> think<00:05:52.230> I'm<00:05:52.320> gonna<00:05:52.410> have<00:05:52.590> a

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
really excited I think I'm gonna have a

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.470 
really excited I think I'm gonna have a
lot<00:05:52.890> of<00:05:52.920> fun<00:05:53.280> when<00:05:53.490> the<00:05:53.610> game<00:05:53.760> launches<00:05:53.970> and

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
lot of fun when the game launches and

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.650 
lot of fun when the game launches and
even<00:05:54.930> if<00:05:55.050> that<00:05:55.080> fun<00:05:55.470> only<00:05:55.740> lasts<00:05:55.980> for<00:05:56.160> a<00:05:56.310> month

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
even if that fun only lasts for a month

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.320 
even if that fun only lasts for a month
that's<00:05:57.660> okay<00:05:58.170> and<00:05:58.500> I<00:05:59.220> think<00:05:59.280> really<00:05:59.880> the<00:06:00.120> point

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
that's okay and I think really the point

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.060 
that's okay and I think really the point
of<00:06:00.510> me<00:06:00.660> making<00:06:00.870> this<00:06:01.080> video<00:06:01.260> is<00:06:01.440> to<00:06:01.590> let<00:06:01.890> other

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
of me making this video is to let other

of me making this video is to let other
people<00:06:02.460> know<00:06:02.490> that<00:06:02.700> I<00:06:03.180> think<00:06:03.780> that<00:06:03.990> whole

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
people know that I think that whole

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.140 
people know that I think that whole
process<00:06:04.410> of<00:06:04.890> getting<00:06:05.040> hyped<00:06:05.400> about<00:06:05.640> a<00:06:05.790> game

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
process of getting hyped about a game

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.600 
process of getting hyped about a game
getting<00:06:06.780> excited<00:06:07.350> about<00:06:07.470> a<00:06:07.590> game<00:06:07.860> even<00:06:08.340> if

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
getting excited about a game even if

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.950 
getting excited about a game even if
you're<00:06:08.760> not<00:06:08.790> going<00:06:09.060> to<00:06:09.120> be<00:06:09.210> playing<00:06:09.450> in<00:06:09.660> a<00:06:09.750> year

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
you're not going to be playing in a year

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.500 
you're not going to be playing in a year
from<00:06:09.990> now<00:06:10.200> I<00:06:10.560> think<00:06:11.460> that's<00:06:11.670> just<00:06:11.880> fine<00:06:12.150> if

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
from now I think that's just fine if

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.150 
from now I think that's just fine if
you're<00:06:12.930> having<00:06:13.200> a<00:06:13.410> good<00:06:13.560> time<00:06:13.800> if<00:06:14.040> you're

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
you're having a good time if you're

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.130 
you're having a good time if you're
enjoying<00:06:14.550> the<00:06:14.760> experience<00:06:15.000> even<00:06:15.690> if<00:06:15.960> it's

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
enjoying the experience even if it's

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.740 
enjoying the experience even if it's
only<00:06:16.290> for<00:06:16.440> a<00:06:16.680> week<00:06:17.150> what's<00:06:18.150> wrong<00:06:18.360> with<00:06:18.420> that

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
only for a week what's wrong with that

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.210 
only for a week what's wrong with that
where's<00:06:19.080> the<00:06:19.200> down<00:06:19.500> in<00:06:19.710> that<00:06:19.860> where's<00:06:20.130> that

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
where's the down in that where's that

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.940 
where's the down in that where's that
where's<00:06:20.370> the<00:06:20.580> negative<00:06:21.060> in<00:06:21.210> that<00:06:21.390> I'm<00:06:22.170> and<00:06:22.500> I

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
where's the negative in that I'm and I

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.100 
where's the negative in that I'm and I
suppose<00:06:23.610> someone<00:06:24.210> could<00:06:24.330> come<00:06:24.600> back<00:06:24.750> out<00:06:24.960> me

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
suppose someone could come back out me

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.200 
suppose someone could come back out me
and<00:06:25.140> say<00:06:25.410> well<00:06:25.920> the<00:06:26.070> negative<00:06:26.460> is<00:06:26.580> that<00:06:26.610> you're

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
and say well the negative is that you're

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.640 
and say well the negative is that you're
getting<00:06:27.480> hyped<00:06:27.840> about<00:06:27.990> games<00:06:28.350> that<00:06:28.560> are

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
getting hyped about games that are

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.380 
getting hyped about games that are
ultimately<00:06:28.740> crappy<00:06:29.550> and<00:06:29.760> then<00:06:29.850> you're<00:06:30.000> giving

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
ultimately crappy and then you're giving

strike lightning I'm well aware of that
fact<00:06:53.190> that<00:06:53.430> I<00:06:53.490> think<00:06:53.730> other<00:06:53.880> people<00:06:54.240> should<00:06:54.480> be

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
fact that I think other people should be

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.140 
fact that I think other people should be
as<00:06:54.750> well<00:06:54.990> and<00:06:55.410> just<00:06:55.920> because<00:06:56.220> a<00:06:56.250> game<00:06:56.490> isn't

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150 
as well and just because a game isn't

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.450 
as well and just because a game isn't
the<00:06:57.210> best<00:06:57.450> game<00:06:57.750> ever<00:06:57.930> made<00:06:58.160> doesn't<00:06:59.160> mean<00:06:59.250> it

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
the best game ever made doesn't mean it

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.220 
the best game ever made doesn't mean it
shouldn't<00:06:59.880> be<00:07:00.060> a<00:07:00.090> game<00:07:00.360> that<00:07:00.540> people<00:07:01.020> can

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
shouldn't be a game that people can

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.350 
shouldn't be a game that people can
enjoy<00:07:01.410> even<00:07:02.370> if<00:07:02.490> it<00:07:02.580> is<00:07:02.700> only<00:07:02.880> for<00:07:03.030> a<00:07:03.270> short

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.900 
enjoy even if it is only for a short
period<00:07:03.690> of<00:07:03.990> time<00:07:04.050> and<00:07:04.440> all<00:07:04.890> of<00:07:05.010> that<00:07:05.130> said<00:07:05.370> who
