the<00:00:18.460> fact<00:00:18.610> that<00:00:18.730> everybody<00:00:19.029> asks<00:00:19.509> me<00:00:19.570> this

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
the fact that everybody asks me this

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.470 
the fact that everybody asks me this
question<00:00:19.810> all<00:00:20.560> the<00:00:20.619> time<00:00:20.800> it<00:00:21.130> has<00:00:21.279> to<00:00:21.490> have<00:00:21.700> it

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
question all the time it has to have it

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.990 
question all the time it has to have it
could<00:00:22.630> have<00:00:22.779> been<00:00:22.930> an<00:00:23.080> easy<00:00:23.579> way<00:00:24.579> to<00:00:24.610> go<00:00:24.910> about

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
could have been an easy way to go about

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.120 
could have been an easy way to go about
things<00:00:25.149> right<00:00:25.689> actually<00:00:26.649> honest<00:00:26.860> you<00:00:26.980> know<00:00:27.099> I

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
things right actually honest you know I

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.659 
things right actually honest you know I
think<00:00:27.250> nothing<00:00:27.970> is<00:00:28.239> ever<00:00:28.300> easy<00:00:29.040> especially<00:00:30.040> I

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
think nothing is ever easy especially I

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.790 
think nothing is ever easy especially I
mean<00:00:31.570> on<00:00:31.989> one<00:00:32.200> level<00:00:32.380> the<00:00:32.529> film<00:00:32.710> industry

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
mean on one level the film industry

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.530 
mean on one level the film industry
itself<00:00:33.309> is<00:00:33.520> a<00:00:33.550> very<00:00:33.940> difficult<00:00:34.090> place<00:00:34.510> to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
itself is a very difficult place to

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.110 
itself is a very difficult place to
navigate<00:00:34.660> and<00:00:35.290> it<00:00:36.040> would<00:00:36.309> happen<00:00:36.460> so<00:00:36.790> for<00:00:37.000> me

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
navigate and it would happen so for me

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.720 
navigate and it would happen so for me
too<00:00:37.329> for<00:00:38.320> many<00:00:38.440> reasons<00:00:38.860> you<00:00:38.980> mean<00:00:39.219> they<00:00:39.670> don't

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
too for many reasons you mean they don't

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.010 
too for many reasons you mean they don't
know<00:00:39.910> how<00:00:40.000> many<00:00:40.120> i<00:00:40.180> want<00:00:40.300> to<00:00:40.390> get<00:00:40.480> into<00:00:40.660> buddy

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
know how many i want to get into buddy

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.250 
know how many i want to get into buddy
no<00:00:41.650> not<00:00:41.890> necessarily<00:00:42.220> easy<00:00:42.490> so<00:00:43.210> in<00:00:43.630> fact<00:00:43.870> that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
no not necessarily easy so in fact that

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.470 
no not necessarily easy so in fact that
was<00:00:44.410> encouraging<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.910> was<00:00:46.090> a<00:00:46.120> good<00:00:46.270> thing

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
was encouraging it was a good thing

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.730 
was encouraging it was a good thing
because<00:00:46.630> i<00:00:46.780> thought<00:00:47.020> okay<00:00:47.260> so<00:00:47.320> i'm<00:00:47.500> gonna<00:00:47.590> be

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
because i thought okay so i'm gonna be

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.510 
because i thought okay so i'm gonna be
easy<00:00:47.920> anyway<00:00:48.430> so<00:00:49.090> might<00:00:49.750> as<00:00:49.810> well<00:00:50.079> take<00:00:50.230> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
easy anyway so might as well take the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.460 
easy anyway so might as well take the
difficult<00:00:51.520> road<00:00:51.700> because<00:00:52.090> at<00:00:52.960> least<00:00:53.170> that

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
difficult road because at least that

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.990 
difficult road because at least that
might<00:00:53.710> get<00:00:53.920> me<00:00:53.980> to<00:00:54.340> a<00:00:54.370> destination<00:00:54.640> that

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
might get me to a destination that

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.180 
might get me to a destination that
nobody<00:00:55.329> else<00:00:55.450> has<00:00:55.540> been<00:00:55.750> but<00:00:56.500> your<00:00:56.770> family<00:00:56.980> is
