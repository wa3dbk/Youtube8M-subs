00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.380 
significance of 23 well in high school
and<00:02:51.080> I<00:02:51.200> played<00:02:51.440> with<00:02:51.470> my<00:02:51.620> brother<00:02:52.030> my<00:02:53.030> favorite

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
and I played with my brother my favorite

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.290 
and I played with my brother my favorite
number<00:02:53.630> was<00:02:53.750> 45<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.380> his<00:02:55.160> favorite<00:02:55.519> number<00:02:55.760> 45

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
number was 45 and his favorite number 45

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.320 
number was 45 and his favorite number 45
but<00:02:56.870> we<00:02:56.989> were<00:02:57.080> on<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.260> same<00:02:57.290> teams<00:02:57.709> so<00:02:58.580> he<00:02:59.150> had

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
but we were on the same teams so he had

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.930 
but we were on the same teams so he had
seniority<00:02:59.540> he<00:03:00.019> had<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.860> option<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.400> we're<00:03:01.580> 45

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
seniority he had the option and we're 45

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.620 
seniority he had the option and we're 45
so<00:03:02.300> I<00:03:02.360> just<00:03:02.650> figured<00:03:03.650> 23<00:03:04.340> was<00:03:04.489> half<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:04.850> 45<00:03:05.209> 22

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
so I just figured 23 was half of 45 22

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.740 
so I just figured 23 was half of 45 22
and<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.780> half<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:06.110> guy<00:03:06.380> grabbed<00:03:06.739> 23<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.750> 23

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
and a half so I guy grabbed 23 and 23

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.759 
and a half so I guy grabbed 23 and 23
its<00:03:08.870> kind<00:03:09.019> of<00:03:09.079> stuck<00:03:09.290> with<00:03:09.410> me<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.650> whole<00:03:09.709> time
