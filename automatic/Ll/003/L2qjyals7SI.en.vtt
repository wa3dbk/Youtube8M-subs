some of the key features of the synergy

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.540 
some of the key features of the synergy
this<00:00:34.090> year<00:00:34.329> you<00:00:34.870> got<00:00:35.019> the<00:00:35.229> smooth<00:00:36.010> skin<00:00:36.190> panel

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
this year you got the smooth skin panel

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.669 
this year you got the smooth skin panel
on<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:36.789> front<00:00:36.850> here<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:38.199> smooth<00:00:38.440> skin

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:38.679 
on the front here the smooth skin

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:40.380 
on the front here the smooth skin
basically<00:00:39.159> stop<00:00:39.429> swing<00:00:39.729> getting<00:00:40.030> into<00:00:40.269> the

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
basically stop swing getting into the

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.329 
basically stop swing getting into the
wetsuit<00:00:40.960> so<00:00:41.620> should<00:00:41.949> it<00:00:42.039> be<00:00:42.100> one<00:00:42.190> of<00:00:42.280> those

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
wetsuit so should it be one of those

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:44.309 
wetsuit so should it be one of those
cold<00:00:42.670> windy<00:00:42.999> days<00:00:43.210> or<00:00:43.510> you're<00:00:43.659> going<00:00:43.809> in<00:00:43.929> speed

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:44.319 
cold windy days or you're going in speed

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:46.229 
cold windy days or you're going in speed
on<00:00:44.559> a<00:00:44.649> let's<00:00:45.039> say<00:00:45.069> for<00:00:45.280> example<00:00:45.309> a<00:00:45.699> water<00:00:45.940> ski

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
on a let's say for example a water ski

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.849 
on a let's say for example a water ski
it's<00:00:46.960> going<00:00:47.109> to<00:00:47.170> salt<00:00:47.319> wing<00:00:47.469> getting<00:00:47.679> through

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
it's going to salt wing getting through

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.139 
it's going to salt wing getting through
there<00:00:48.069> but<00:00:48.249> it's<00:00:48.489> also<00:00:48.639> going<00:00:48.789> to<00:00:48.850> protect

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
there but it's also going to protect

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.789 
there but it's also going to protect
your<00:00:49.269> kidneys<00:00:49.629> on<00:00:49.780> your<00:00:49.899> back<00:00:50.079> because<00:00:50.649> it's

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:50.799 
your kidneys on your back because it's

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:54.209 
your kidneys on your back because it's
on<00:00:51.039> the<00:00:51.129> back<00:00:51.219> panels<00:00:51.609> here<00:00:53.039> these<00:00:54.039> were<00:00:54.159> a

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
on the back panels here these were a

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.309 
on the back panels here these were a
flat<00:00:54.639> lock<00:00:54.850> construction<00:00:55.600> which<00:00:55.929> basically

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:56.319 
flat lock construction which basically

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:59.250 
flat lock construction which basically
means<00:00:56.649> we<00:00:56.979> have<00:00:57.069> a<00:00:57.129> quick<00:00:57.280> look<00:00:57.309> inside<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
means we have a quick look inside the

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.840 
means we have a quick look inside the
two<00:00:59.469> pieces<00:00:59.769> of<00:00:59.799> material<00:01:00.010> have<00:01:00.519> been<00:01:00.549> pulled

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
two pieces of material have been pulled

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.789 
two pieces of material have been pulled
together<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.839> they've<00:01:01.989> been<00:01:02.109> stitched<00:01:02.499> it

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
together and they've been stitched it

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.430 
together and they've been stitched it
creates<00:01:03.159> that<00:01:03.309> a<00:01:03.369> flat<00:01:04.030> stitching<00:01:04.750> line<00:01:04.960> which

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
creates that a flat stitching line which

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.380 
creates that a flat stitching line which
basically<00:01:05.830> means<00:01:06.070> it<00:01:06.310> won't<00:01:06.490> rub<00:01:06.790> against<00:01:07.180> you

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
basically means it won't rub against you

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.030 
basically means it won't rub against you
and<00:01:07.600> i<00:01:07.810> won't<00:01:07.990> cause<00:01:08.200> you<00:01:08.230> any<00:01:08.350> rashes<00:01:08.890> when

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
and i won't cause you any rashes when

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.640 
and i won't cause you any rashes when
you<00:01:09.100> got<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.280> wetsuit<00:01:09.610> on<00:01:09.760> a<00:01:10.720> very<00:01:11.140> simple<00:01:11.440> zip

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
you got the wetsuit on a very simple zip

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.650 
you got the wetsuit on a very simple zip
system<00:01:12.010> up<00:01:12.100> back<00:01:12.310> here<00:01:12.550> as<00:01:12.790> a<00:01:13.150> little<00:01:13.480> piece<00:01:13.630> of

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
system up back here as a little piece of

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.320 
system up back here as a little piece of
velcro<00:01:13.960> here<00:01:14.320> so<00:01:14.500> when<00:01:14.620> the<00:01:14.710> zips<00:01:14.920> fully<00:01:15.220> up<00:01:15.400> it

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
velcro here so when the zips fully up it

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.090 
velcro here so when the zips fully up it
stops<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.750> zip<00:01:16.930> coming<00:01:17.290> down<00:01:17.500> so<00:01:17.950> if<00:01:18.010> you're

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
stops the zip coming down so if you're

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.650 
stops the zip coming down so if you're
going<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.280> fall<00:01:18.430> off<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:18.910> wait<00:01:19.090> borrow<00:01:19.360> your
