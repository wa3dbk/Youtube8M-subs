00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.820
 It is a three-dimensional, 3D cord knitting method that can be easily knitted. 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.260
 It will be a thicker and firmer cord. 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.020
 Measure approximately twice as many threads of the required length, 

00:00:18.613 --> 00:00:21.893
 Take a thread slightly longer than 2 times 

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:24.823
 I will start knitting from there. 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.040
 Have a thread slightly longer than twice the required length, 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.460
 Weaving the first eye of the crochet. 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.500
 From behind the thread, put a crochet, 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.260
 Pull to the front and rotate from the bottom to the right. 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.460
 Take a thread and pull it out. 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.300
 I will start knitting from here. 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.360
 With a string of twice the required length down, 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.580
 I have a thread. 

00:00:52.014 --> 00:00:54.374
 Insert a crochet from behind the upper thread, 

00:00:54.374 --> 00:00:57.514
 Lift the lower thread over the needle, 

00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:01.046
 I will put it on the other side of the taut thread. 

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:06.994
 With two threads on the needle, hang the threads on the needle 

00:01:06.994 --> 00:01:10.234
 Pull out the two threads on the needle. 

00:01:10.294 --> 00:01:12.714
 First, I did. 

00:01:12.714 --> 00:01:18.694
 Next, hang the lower thread on the needle from the other side 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.880
 While leaving two threads on the needle, hang the top thread on the needle, 

00:01:23.887 --> 00:01:28.427
 Pull out the two threads on the needle. 

00:01:28.694 --> 00:01:31.614
 The second one was done. 

00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:37.373
 In the same way, put the lower thread from the other side to the needle, 

00:01:37.793 --> 00:01:42.673
 Hang the upper thread on the needle and pull out the 2 threads. 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.420
 It becomes a three-dimensional code. 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.100
 Likewise, from the other side of the upper thread 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.960
 Spread the lower thread, 

00:01:57.494 --> 00:02:01.254
 Pull out with the upper thread. 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.260
 Repeat this. 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.660
 The code looks like a square. 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.440
 The thread on the needle and the thread picked up from below 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.820
 If aligned at the same height, it will weave beautifully. 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.580
 A three-dimensional 3D code has been created.
