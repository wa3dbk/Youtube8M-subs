so<00:03:17.850> we're<00:03:18.240> gonna<00:03:18.330> get<00:03:18.450> into<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:18.900> as<00:03:19.080> well

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
so we're gonna get into that as well

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.350 
so we're gonna get into that as well
Sumeria<00:03:19.980> remember<00:03:20.280> those<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:20.550> for<00:03:20.730> some<00:03:20.910> area

Sumeria remember those in for some area

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.020 
Sumeria remember those in for some area
so<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.140> teaching<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.710> the<00:03:22.890> European<00:03:23.490> Jews<00:03:23.790> is

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
so the teaching of the European Jews is

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.890 
so the teaching of the European Jews is
more<00:03:24.330> like<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.630> Samaritan<00:03:25.530> or<00:03:25.770> a<00:03:26.600> comes<00:03:27.600> and
