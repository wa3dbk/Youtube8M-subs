 mechanical keyboard mechanical keyboard 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.220
 mechanical luck the city more boring 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.840

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.910
 ok ok I want that in the story 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.750
 of the keyboard there have been models sometimes 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.780
 a little weird or just who 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.090
 useless or just to 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.539
 work 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.800
 here is my old keyboard a causa network 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:46.000

 horrible 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.660
 no seriously I do not know what he 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.100
 fuck inside to make it a 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.770
 end it seems that an internal mechanism 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.539
 to buyers with this ever-so-much noise 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.090
 is that there is nothing yes yes there is a 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.679
 mechanism inside then since 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.289
 the keyboard story we have everything 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.970
 slowly started to evolve we are 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.290
 party mechanical keyboards law 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.739
 still call who has a dozen 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.630
 years ago was only keyboards 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.880
 mechanical and then slowly we have 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.190
 started to evolve towards keyboards that 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.220
 operate with impulses 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.530
 electric like this then one day 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.410
 do not know why there are some 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.810
 years ago that's a guy who said to himself 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.209
 if we came back saint quentin 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.830
 it would be playing out of the old 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.500
 mechanical keyboard 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.989

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.819
 slim pants for boys that 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.300
 existed years ago and you do not know 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.890
 why now they have come back 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.230
 not that you not make you this purpose there 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.090

 you're weird not frankly that's 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.739
 the kind of keyboard that coke in tulle 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.569
 use everyone leaves a time 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.230

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.720
 friends and your mother who lands for 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.220
 to say that she hear you from home 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.480
 so with the city and even the stuff 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.340
 wolf is when you're on the team 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.620

 teammates too they are fed up 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.920
 and more to the mouth with your keyboard 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.650
 what else should I admit that the design he 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.780
 is but she not bad a kind of gap 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.970
 and what does not hold lipids a 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.340
 rectangle the resorbs the q2 also this 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:36.100
 kind of keyboard or you do not have that one 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.810
 cable to connect time to 4 4 for 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.520
 me every city when I make them a 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.790
 tonal month 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.220
 two edges vsb because now a 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.680
 keyboard alone is not enough and he 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.180
 We have to put a usb over 1the harbor 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.190
 must also put jack input 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.990
 people to plug your headphones into the 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:58.390
 keyboard on the keyboard what's the point 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.750
 is useless I lean the month teil 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.460
 now 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.140
 in any case if it is to break the 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.820
 people's ears as much do it with 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.800
 quality material 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.750
 obviously when I serve razer they are 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.150
 very strong with the iralde bundle often 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.410
 Boxing stuff that's worthless 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.040
 do not even know where he has good news 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.040
 there is advertising 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.810
 and 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.210
 there's just and stickers I like 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.210
 the stickers 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.700
 in joke truce a keyboard mode 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.550
 mechanical it still changes you the 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.130
 life after we can always discuss 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.610
 riser some are for some are 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.860
 against bah yes yes in any case the price 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.920
 is still excessively expensive for 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.740
 a keyboard that will not revolutionize 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.180
 still your way of playing but will 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.810
 still give you sensations 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.640
 rather nice willy when you play 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.180
 that's all for this credit is boxing 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.580
