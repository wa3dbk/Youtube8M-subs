00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260 

I<00:00:00.089> believe<00:00:00.960> if<00:00:01.350> you<00:00:01.589> take<00:00:01.890> her<00:00:02.129> into<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.790> stereo

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
I believe if you take her into a stereo

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.590 
I believe if you take her into a stereo
mode<00:00:03.620> your<00:00:04.620> damage<00:00:05.069> depends<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.060> damages<00:00:06.509> you

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
mode your damage depends the damages you

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.450 
mode your damage depends the damages you
doing<00:00:06.870> hysteria<00:00:07.290> mode<00:00:07.560> depends<00:00:08.040> on<00:00:08.189> the

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
doing hysteria mode depends on the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.160 
doing hysteria mode depends on the
weapons<00:00:08.880> that<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.450> melee<00:00:09.750> weapons<00:00:10.050> that

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
you brought with you so for instance I

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.240 
you brought with you so for instance I
have<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.389> do<00:00:12.540> lockers<00:00:12.990> which<00:00:13.679> are<00:00:13.889> which<00:00:14.219> have

have the do lockers which are which have

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.599 
have the do lockers which are which have
really<00:00:14.730> good<00:00:14.880> crit<00:00:15.179> chance<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.250> I've<00:00:17.250> seen

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
really good crit chance and so I've seen

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.700 
really good crit chance and so I've seen
that<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.029> what<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.660> crit<00:00:19.020> chance<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.470> moves

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
that that what that crit chance it moves

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.320 
that that what that crit chance it moves
on<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.100> hysteria<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.820> every<00:00:21.029> time<00:00:21.210> you

down duration so if I didn't have this
on<00:01:45.600> there<00:01:45.840> probably<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.250> whole<00:01:47.460> mission

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
on there probably like the whole mission

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.050

but even though you know this game is
pretty<00:01:53.760> fast<00:01:54.090> two<00:01:54.360> days<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.619> run

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
pretty fast two days so you can run

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.039 
pretty fast two days so you can run
sprint<00:01:56.850> through<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.090> mission<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.750> there's<00:01:57.900> no

any former you're not any format any um
fusion<00:04:36.160> cores<00:04:36.479> so<00:04:37.479> this<00:04:37.750> is<00:04:37.930> there<00:04:38.199> but<00:04:38.889> it

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
fusion cores so this is there but it

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.210 
fusion cores so this is there but it
does<00:04:39.190> help<00:04:39.520> I<00:04:39.760> can<00:04:40.180> see<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.389> significant

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
does help I can see the significant

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.960 
does help I can see the significant

difference in the speed it makes it

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.510 
difference in the speed it makes it
faster<00:04:46.449> maybe<00:04:47.350> not<00:04:47.560> that<00:04:47.710> much<00:04:47.889> faster<00:04:48.340> but

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
faster maybe not that much faster but

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.990 
faster maybe not that much faster but
the<00:04:49.180> annoying<00:04:49.600> stomp<00:04:49.900> cheese<00:04:50.699> isn't<00:04:51.699> as<00:04:51.789> bad
