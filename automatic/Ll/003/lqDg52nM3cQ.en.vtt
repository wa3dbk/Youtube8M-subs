pencil then take a little sharper one
and<00:01:10.359> go<00:01:11.359> over<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:12.609> mean<00:01:13.609> it<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:14.719> know<00:01:14.869> and<00:01:15.140> get

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
and go over it mean it you know and get

your get your image transfer it on there
now<00:01:19.189> you<00:01:19.250> can<00:01:19.609> see<00:01:19.909> that<00:01:20.749> it<00:01:20.960> doesn't<00:01:21.530> transfer

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
now you can see that it doesn't transfer

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.450 
now you can see that it doesn't transfer
you<00:01:22.670> know<00:01:22.789> to<00:01:22.850> too<00:01:23.630> dark<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.560> only<00:01:24.890> problem<00:01:25.310> is

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
you know to too dark the only problem is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.149 
you know to too dark the only problem is
you're<00:01:26.060> indenting<00:01:26.659> in<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.929> paper<00:01:27.200> pretty

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
you're indenting in the paper pretty

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.760 
you're indenting in the paper pretty
deep<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:28.880> your<00:01:29.210> your<00:01:29.630> paint<00:01:29.929> will<00:01:30.200> run<00:01:30.439> into

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
deep so your your paint will run into

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.419 
deep so your your paint will run into
that<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:33.200> next<00:01:33.590> method<00:01:33.799> is<00:01:34.130> this

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
that the next method is this

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.380 
that the next method is this
old-fashioned<00:01:35.329> grid<00:01:35.689> method<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.439> this<00:01:37.340> is<00:01:37.609> a

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
old-fashioned grid method and this is a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.669 
old-fashioned grid method and this is a
two<00:01:38.929> inch<00:01:39.140> squares<00:01:39.560> one<00:01:40.159> two<00:01:40.429> three<00:01:40.850> four<00:01:41.179> five

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
two inch squares one two three four five

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.289 
two inch squares one two three four five
then<00:01:42.679> you<00:01:42.890> have<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:44.469> take<00:01:45.469> your<00:01:45.679> ruler<00:01:46.299> then

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
then you have to take your ruler then

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.410 
then you have to take your ruler then
you<00:01:47.389> take<00:01:47.600> your<00:01:47.630> ruler<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.999> you<00:01:49.999> have<00:01:50.240> to

decide

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.690 
decide
oh<00:01:51.460> let's<00:01:52.460> see<00:01:52.700> this<00:01:52.939> is<00:01:53.179> 11<00:01:53.719> inches<00:01:53.929> so<00:01:54.439> I<00:01:54.770> want

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
oh let's see this is 11 inches so I want

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.679 
oh let's see this is 11 inches so I want
a<00:01:56.060> little<00:01:56.899> more<00:01:57.200> than<00:01:57.560> 2<00:01:57.799> inches<00:01:57.829> on<00:01:58.639> here<00:01:59.299> it

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
a little more than 2 inches on here it

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.629 
a little more than 2 inches on here it
kind<00:01:59.960> of<00:02:00.020> becomes<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.530> mathematical<00:02:01.340> problem

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639 
kind of becomes a mathematical problem

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.569 
kind of becomes a mathematical problem
especially<00:02:02.539> if<00:02:02.899> you<00:02:03.049> have<00:02:03.289> a<00:02:03.319> big<00:02:03.679> sheet<00:02:04.009> like

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
is so right now I've got this bar isn't

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.190 
is so right now I've got this bar isn't
this<00:02:50.440> diagonal<00:02:51.160> line<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.610> diagonal<00:02:52.209> line<00:02:52.330> so

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
this diagonal line that diagonal line so

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.320 
this diagonal line that diagonal line so
I'm<00:02:53.260> going<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.440> take<00:02:53.590> my<00:02:53.799> ruler<00:02:54.069> again<00:02:57.150> be<00:02:58.150> sure

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
I'm going to take my ruler again be sure

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.520 
I'm going to take my ruler again be sure
you<00:02:58.450> have<00:02:58.630> something<00:02:58.900> hard<00:02:59.260> underneath<00:02:59.920> it

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
you have something hard underneath it

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.229 
you have something hard underneath it
I'm<00:03:02.530> going<00:03:02.709> to<00:03:02.769> go<00:03:02.890> from<00:03:03.130> corner<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.549> corner<00:03:03.670> on

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
I'm going to go from corner to corner on

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:13.860 
I'm going to go from corner to corner on
here<00:03:07.349> corner<00:03:08.349> to<00:03:08.500> corner<00:03:08.709> on<00:03:09.040> this<00:03:09.280> one

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.320 

and<00:03:13.959> this<00:03:14.590> may<00:03:14.800> look<00:03:15.069> just<00:03:15.489> like<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.940> squares

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
and this may look just like the squares

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.009 
and this may look just like the squares
but<00:03:17.319> it<00:03:17.650> does<00:03:17.980> proportions<00:03:18.879> so<00:03:19.209> you<00:03:19.660> don't

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
but it does proportions so you don't

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.670 
but it does proportions so you don't
have<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.560> measure<00:03:21.430> anything<00:03:22.300> you<00:03:23.260> don't<00:03:23.410> have

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
have to measure anything you don't have

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.130 
have to measure anything you don't have
to<00:03:23.830> know<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.040> it's<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.840> twelve<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:26.110> half

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
to know that it's a twelve and a half

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.250 
to know that it's a twelve and a half
inches<00:03:26.680> long<00:03:27.459> what<00:03:28.150> long<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.810> eight<00:03:29.050> inches

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
inches long what long and eight inches

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.630 
inches long what long and eight inches
wide<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:30.129> your<00:03:30.340> image<00:03:30.730> is<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.900> know<00:03:32.640> maybe

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
wide and your image is you know maybe

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.330 
wide and your image is you know maybe
it's<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.120> three<00:03:34.989> by<00:03:35.170> five<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.890> you've<00:03:36.069> got<00:03:36.250> to

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
it's a three by five and you've got to

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.360 
it's a three by five and you've got to
figure<00:03:36.489> all<00:03:36.819> that<00:03:36.849> out<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:38.230> you've<00:03:38.530> got<00:03:38.860> right

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
figure all that out so you've got right

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.300 
figure all that out so you've got right
now<00:03:39.580> your<00:03:39.849> diagonals<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.950> then<00:03:41.950> you<00:03:42.129> made

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
now your diagonals and then you made

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.030 
now your diagonals and then you made
another<00:03:42.700> square<00:03:43.180> here<00:03:43.629> so<00:03:43.810> we're<00:03:44.739> gonna<00:03:44.860> do

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
another square here so we're gonna do

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.259 
another square here so we're gonna do
the<00:03:45.160> same<00:03:45.400> thing<00:03:45.459> on<00:03:45.760> our<00:03:45.970> big<00:03:46.180> paper<00:03:48.120> there<00:03:49.120> go

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
the same thing on our big paper there go

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:57.270 
the same thing on our big paper there go
from<00:03:49.510> corner<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:49.900> corner

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.830 

I'm<00:03:57.910> corner-to-corner<00:03:59.910> doesn't<00:04:00.910> matter<00:04:01.180> what

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
I'm corner-to-corner doesn't matter what

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.990 
I'm corner-to-corner doesn't matter what
shape<00:04:02.560> or<00:04:02.860> size<00:04:03.370> your<00:04:03.790> paper<00:04:04.030> is<00:04:04.450> it<00:04:05.380> will

shape or size your paper is it will

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.490 
shape or size your paper is it will
proportionally<00:04:08.910> transfer<00:04:09.910> it<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.300> I<00:04:11.050> really

proportionally transfer it and I really

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.059 
proportionally transfer it and I really
enjoy<00:04:11.950> this<00:04:12.220> method<00:04:12.730> because<00:04:13.560> I'm<00:04:14.560> not<00:04:14.860> an

drawer<00:04:17.919> how's<00:04:18.280> that<00:04:22.080> so<00:04:23.160> now<00:04:24.160> we've<00:04:24.340> got<00:04:24.550> the

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
drawer how's that so now we've got the

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.670 
drawer how's that so now we've got the
same<00:04:24.940> thing<00:04:25.180> on<00:04:25.330> our<00:04:25.480> image<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.440> same

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
same thing on our image and the same

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.180 
same thing on our image and the same
thing<00:04:26.919> on<00:04:27.010> our<00:04:27.070> paper<00:04:27.630> if<00:04:28.630> you<00:04:29.380> want<00:04:29.890> to<00:04:29.980> make

thing on our paper if you want to make

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.670 
thing on our paper if you want to make
it<00:04:30.400> small<00:04:30.850> if<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.390> want<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.720> you<00:04:32.200> know<00:04:32.320> say<00:04:32.650> oh

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
gosh I can't I can't draw I can't draw

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.320 
gosh I can't I can't draw I can't draw
this<00:04:38.610> triangle<00:04:39.610> on<00:04:39.970> here<00:04:40.720> I<00:04:40.900> need<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:41.680> smaller

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
this triangle on here I need it smaller

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.970 
this triangle on here I need it smaller
then<00:04:43.330> you<00:04:43.630> can<00:04:43.810> just<00:04:44.110> make<00:04:44.770> these<00:04:45.510> boxes

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
then you can just make these boxes

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:55.279 
then you can just make these boxes
smaller

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.399 

okay<00:04:55.710> then<00:04:56.550> over<00:04:56.999> here<00:04:57.029> because<00:04:57.930> this<00:04:58.199> isn't

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
okay then over here because this isn't

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.549 
okay then over here because this isn't
this<00:04:58.770> is<00:04:59.039> the<00:04:59.159> more<00:04:59.399> detailed<00:04:59.969> area<00:05:00.509> of<00:05:00.629> my<00:05:00.869> my

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:01.559 
this is the more detailed area of my my

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:07.459 
this is the more detailed area of my my
drawing<00:05:02.599> my<00:05:03.599> image<00:05:03.990> I<00:05:04.169> mean<00:05:05.899> then<00:05:06.899> I'm<00:05:07.289> going

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
drawing my image I mean then I'm going

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:15.230 
drawing my image I mean then I'm going
to<00:05:07.589> take<00:05:09.770> this<00:05:11.509> and

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:30.020 

I<00:05:15.330> said<00:05:15.960> isn't<00:05:16.169> it<00:05:16.580> no<00:05:17.580> we<00:05:18.330> didn't<00:05:18.509> do<00:05:18.599> this<00:05:18.780> one

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.870 

so<00:05:30.630> you<00:05:30.750> could<00:05:31.140> get<00:05:31.350> it<00:05:31.470> down<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:31.790> quarter<00:05:32.790> of

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
so you could get it down to quarter of

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.930 
so you could get it down to quarter of
an<00:05:33.000> inch<00:05:33.230> squares<00:05:34.230> if<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:34.740> want<00:05:34.980> speci<00:05:35.700> now<00:05:35.880> we

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
an inch squares if you want speci now we

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.180 
an inch squares if you want speci now we
have<00:05:36.210> a<00:05:36.240> square<00:05:36.450> again<00:05:36.720> so<00:05:37.230> we<00:05:37.410> could<00:05:37.650> put<00:05:38.160> a

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
have a square again so we could put a

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.020 
have a square again so we could put a
diagonal<00:05:38.640> there<00:05:39.230> and<00:05:40.230> put<00:05:41.130> a<00:05:41.160> diagonal<00:05:41.610> there

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
my image on here and then we're going to

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:59.210 
my image on here and then we're going to
start<00:05:50.640> doing<00:05:50.880> some<00:05:51.000> painting<00:05:51.480> techniques

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.800 

okay<00:05:59.970> this<00:06:00.330> is<00:06:00.540> a<00:06:00.570> kneaded<00:06:01.020> eraser<00:06:01.680> and

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
okay this is a kneaded eraser and

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.660 
okay this is a kneaded eraser and
there's<00:06:03.810> a<00:06:03.900> lot<00:06:04.200> of<00:06:04.380> graphite<00:06:04.980> on<00:06:05.220> the<00:06:05.400> paper

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
there's a lot of graphite on the paper

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.150 
there's a lot of graphite on the paper
right<00:06:06.030> now<00:06:06.090> so<00:06:06.990> I'm<00:06:07.380> going<00:06:07.560> to<00:06:07.620> just<00:06:07.830> touch

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
some of it to get some of that off

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.470 
some of it to get some of that off

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
because you don't want that mixing with

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.230 
because you don't want that mixing with
your<00:06:12.720> paint<00:06:13.020> so<00:06:13.860> once<00:06:14.160> I<00:06:14.340> get<00:06:14.520> my<00:06:14.670> image<00:06:15.030> on

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.650 
paper like this this is erasable but you

all the excess graphite that was on here

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.980 
all the excess graphite that was on here
so<00:07:55.830> it<00:07:55.980> doesn't<00:07:56.010> mix<00:07:56.490> with<00:07:56.640> my<00:07:56.880> paint<00:07:57.210> all

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:57.990

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.680 
so it doesn't mix with my paint all
right<00:07:58.230> so<00:07:58.650> we've<00:07:59.400> gone<00:07:59.640> over<00:07:59.700> how<00:08:00.090> to<00:08:00.150> transfer

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:00.690
