00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hey guys in this video I'm going to go

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:02.869 
hey guys in this video I'm going to go
over<00:00:01.740> technique<00:00:02.370> that<00:00:02.580> I've<00:00:02.669> been<00:00:02.790> getting

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
over technique that I've been getting

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.490 
over technique that I've been getting
tons<00:00:03.240> of<00:00:03.360> questions<00:00:03.480> on<00:00:03.870> since<00:00:04.110> I<00:00:04.200> started

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
tons of questions on since I started

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.110 
tons of questions on since I started
posting<00:00:04.650> on<00:00:04.920> YouTube<00:00:05.250> I've<00:00:05.609> used<00:00:05.819> it<00:00:05.940> in<00:00:06.029> a

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
posting on YouTube I've used it in a

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.700 
posting on YouTube I've used it in a
bunch<00:00:06.299> of<00:00:06.390> my<00:00:06.509> songs<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.109> like<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.410> refer<00:00:07.680> to

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
bunch of my songs and I like to refer to

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.129 
bunch of my songs and I like to refer to
it<00:00:07.890> as<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.309> sprint<00:00:11.599> somewhere<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.690> run<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.990> is

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
it as the sprint somewhere to run to is

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.839 
it as the sprint somewhere to run to is
a<00:00:13.170> song<00:00:13.440> recently<00:00:13.710> where<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.370> use<00:00:14.670> this

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
a song recently where I use this

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.609 
a song recently where I use this
technique<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:16.109> lot<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.260> people<00:00:16.529> are

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
technique and a lot of people are

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.859 
technique and a lot of people are
getting<00:00:16.710> stumped<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.340> tabs<00:00:17.609> as<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.750> is

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
getting stumped in the tabs as it is

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.300 
getting stumped in the tabs as it is
something<00:00:19.230> that's<00:00:19.380> really<00:00:19.590> impossible<00:00:19.920> to

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
something that's really impossible to

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.790 
something that's really impossible to
tap<00:00:20.699> out<00:00:20.880> I've<00:00:21.630> also<00:00:21.810> been<00:00:22.020> using<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.500> ton<00:00:22.769> of

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
tap out I've also been using it a ton of

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.700 
tap out I've also been using it a ton of
my<00:00:22.949> flat<00:00:23.189> guitar<00:00:23.519> songs<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:27.289> actually<00:00:28.289> learn

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
my flat guitar songs I actually learn

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.169 
my flat guitar songs I actually learn
the<00:00:28.740> technique<00:00:29.220> through<00:00:29.519> trying<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.910> find<00:00:30.119> new

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the technique through trying to find new

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.600 
the technique through trying to find new
ways<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.750> place<00:00:30.990> flat<00:00:31.320> guitar<00:00:31.710> rather<00:00:32.369> than

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
ways to place flat guitar rather than

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.010 
ways to place flat guitar rather than
the<00:00:32.730> traditional<00:00:32.910> ways<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.600> would<00:00:33.690> find<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:33.989> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the traditional ways you would find on a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.720 
the traditional ways you would find on a
bass<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.500> since<00:00:34.890> then<00:00:35.070> I've<00:00:35.219> moved<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.700> a

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
bass and since then I've moved it to a

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.069 
bass and since then I've moved it to a
bunch<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.090> other<00:00:36.180> things<00:00:36.480> other<00:00:36.660> than<00:00:36.750> just

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
bunch of other things other than just

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.650 
bunch of other things other than just
slap<00:00:40.399> and<00:00:41.399> I've<00:00:41.760> really<00:00:42.030> fallen<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.329> love<00:00:42.510> with

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
slap and I've really fallen in love with

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.590 
slap and I've really fallen in love with
it<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.379> here's<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.890> lesson<00:00:44.190> video<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.730> what<00:00:45.420> I'm

the description for this lesson we're

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.979 
the description for this lesson we're
only<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.210> concentrate<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.750> what's

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
only going to concentrate on what's

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.180 
only going to concentrate on what's
going<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> right<00:01:01.680> hand

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
going on with the right hand

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.729 
going on with the right hand
so<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.879> your<00:01:03.000> left<00:01:03.180> hand<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.930> barely<00:01:04.379> go

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
so have your left hand just barely go

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.950 
so have your left hand just barely go
over<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> strings<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.820> mute<00:01:06.000> them<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.450> you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
over the strings and mute them and you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.630 
over the strings and mute them and you
can<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.260> keep<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.530> there<00:01:07.740> for<00:01:08.070> now<00:01:08.100> there's<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
can just keep it there for now there's a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.039 
can just keep it there for now there's a
whole<00:01:08.820> lot<00:01:08.970> going<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> right<00:01:09.810> hand

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
whole lot going on with the right hand

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.520 
whole lot going on with the right hand
here<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.680> moves<00:01:10.770> by<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.310> quickly<00:01:12.530> so

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
here and it moves by really quickly so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.780 
here and it moves by really quickly so
we're<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.100> dissect<00:01:14.310> this

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
we're really going to dissect this

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.700 
we're really going to dissect this
technique<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.540> learn<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.869> step<00:01:15.990> by<00:01:16.110> step<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
technique and learn it step by step and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.710 
technique and learn it step by step and
even<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.400> my<00:01:17.430> perspective<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.299> almost<00:01:18.479> looks

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
even to my perspective it almost looks

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.080 
even to my perspective it almost looks
like<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.869> circular<00:01:19.380> blur<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.610> kind<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.850> looks

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
like a circular blur so it kind of looks

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.660 
like a circular blur so it kind of looks
and<00:01:21.390> sounds<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.530> those<00:01:22.710> old<00:01:22.920> cartoons<00:01:23.159> back

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and sounds like those old cartoons back

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.830 
and sounds like those old cartoons back
when<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> characters<00:01:24.299> would<00:01:24.450> sprint<00:01:25.640> and

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
when the characters would sprint and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.789 
when the characters would sprint and
that's<00:01:27.840> why<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> started<00:01:28.320> calling<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.680> that

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
that's why I started calling it that

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.830 
that's why I started calling it that
this<00:01:29.250> technique<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.790> achieved<00:01:30.180> creating<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
this technique is achieved creating a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.350 
this technique is achieved creating a
triplet<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.619> thumb<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.549> ring<00:01:32.939> then

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
triplet with the thumb then ring then

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.480 
triplet with the thumb then ring then
middle<00:01:33.600> finger<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.170> we're<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.159> start

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
middle finger so we're going to start

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.520 
middle finger so we're going to start
with<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> thumb<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:36.570> first<00:01:36.869> take<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.259> thumb

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
with the thumb now first take the thumb

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.890 
with the thumb now first take the thumb
into<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.250> fretboard<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.659> we're<00:01:39.780> going

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
into the fretboard and then we're going

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.060 
into the fretboard and then we're going
to<00:01:39.930> do<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> flick<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.590> wrist

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
to do a flick of the wrist

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.500 
to do a flick of the wrist
to<00:01:41.850> hit<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> thumb<00:01:42.329> into<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> strings

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.440 

and<00:01:48.350> let<00:01:49.280> gravity<00:01:49.490> do<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:49.850> lot<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.300> work<00:01:50.420> for

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
and let gravity do a lot of the work for

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.720 
and let gravity do a lot of the work for
you<00:01:50.900> but<00:01:51.260> as<00:01:51.380> little<00:01:51.830> energy<00:01:52.190> into<00:01:52.400> this<00:01:52.520> as

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
you but as little energy into this as

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.460 
you but as little energy into this as
possible<00:01:52.940> because<00:01:53.600> this<00:01:53.810> conservation<00:01:54.200> of

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
possible because this conservation of

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.870 
possible because this conservation of
energy<00:01:54.560> is<00:01:54.830> really<00:01:55.160> going<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.310> help<00:01:55.550> out<00:01:55.700> once

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
energy is really going to help out once

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.910 
energy is really going to help out once
you<00:01:55.970> get<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.180> higher<00:01:56.330> speeds<00:01:56.540> also<00:01:57.260> playing

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
you get to higher speeds also playing

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.920 
you get to higher speeds also playing
with<00:01:58.130> your<00:01:58.280> thumb<00:01:58.460> like<00:01:58.610> this<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.510> really

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
with your thumb like this is a really

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.810 
with your thumb like this is a really
foreign<00:02:00.320> way<00:02:00.530> of<00:02:00.680> playing<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.310> most<00:02:01.490> guitar

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
foreign way of playing to most guitar

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.030 
foreign way of playing to most guitar
players<00:02:02.090> so<00:02:02.810> really<00:02:03.110> practice<00:02:03.530> this<00:02:03.710> for<00:02:03.770> a

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
players so really practice this for a

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.530 
players so really practice this for a
while<00:02:04.250> until<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:04.700> become<00:02:04.970> comfortable<00:02:05.180> with

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
while until you become comfortable with

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.060 
while until you become comfortable with
it<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:05.810> it's<00:02:06.140> really<00:02:06.410> going<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.680> help<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:07.010> out

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
it and it's really going to help you out

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.859 
it and it's really going to help you out
later<00:02:07.490> on<00:02:07.700> then<00:02:08.420> once<00:02:08.570> you're<00:02:08.690> comfortable

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
later on then once you're comfortable

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.210 
later on then once you're comfortable
hitting<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.440> strings<00:02:09.710> with<00:02:09.830> your<00:02:09.980> thumb

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
hitting the strings with your thumb

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.860 
hitting the strings with your thumb
we're<00:02:10.640> going<00:02:10.820> to<00:02:10.880> bring<00:02:11.030> in<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.270> ring<00:02:11.480> finger

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
we're going to bring in the ring finger

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.350 
we're going to bring in the ring finger
and<00:02:12.020> after<00:02:12.680> we<00:02:12.800> hit<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.100> thumb<00:02:13.310> down<00:02:13.520> on<00:02:13.820> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
and after we hit the thumb down on the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.270 
and after we hit the thumb down on the
upstroke<00:02:14.990> while<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.740> thumb<00:02:15.920> is<00:02:16.070> getting

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
upstroke while the thumb is getting

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.770 
upstroke while the thumb is getting
ready<00:02:16.460> to<00:02:16.520> hit<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.820> string<00:02:17.030> again<00:02:17.120> we're

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
ready to hit the string again we're

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.360 
ready to hit the string again we're
going<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.110> flick<00:02:18.380> our<00:02:18.560> ring<00:02:18.770> finger<00:02:18.800> into<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
going to flick our ring finger into the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:31.390 
going to flick our ring finger into the
fretboard<00:02:28.960> again<00:02:29.960> uses<00:02:30.350> little<00:02:30.800> energy<00:02:31.280> as

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
fretboard again uses little energy as

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.080 
fretboard again uses little energy as
you<00:02:31.430> can<00:02:31.790> remember<00:02:32.300> it's<00:02:32.510> all<00:02:32.690> in<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.930> wrist

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.190 

sometimes<00:02:38.090> your<00:02:38.300> fingers<00:02:38.570> will<00:02:38.690> hit<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.840> random

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
sometimes your fingers will hit a random

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.140 
sometimes your fingers will hit a random
note<00:02:39.410> as<00:02:39.620> it's<00:02:40.310> being<00:02:40.430> smashed<00:02:40.730> against<00:02:41.090> the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
note as it's being smashed against the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.080 
note as it's being smashed against the
fret<00:02:41.420> board<00:02:42.310> but<00:02:43.310> don't<00:02:43.490> be<00:02:43.610> afraid<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.970> this

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
fret board but don't be afraid of this

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.120 
fret board but don't be afraid of this
this<00:02:44.480> randomness<00:02:44.990> actually<00:02:45.470> really<00:02:45.770> adds<00:02:45.980> a

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
this randomness actually really adds a

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.470 
this randomness actually really adds a
lot<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.580> especially<00:02:46.910> when<00:02:47.180> you're<00:02:47.300> playing

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
lot and especially when you're playing

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.020 
lot and especially when you're playing
something<00:02:47.720> like<00:02:47.900> slap<00:02:51.730> then<00:02:52.730> once<00:02:52.880> you've

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
something like slap then once you've

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.550 
something like slap then once you've
gotten<00:02:53.300> really<00:02:53.510> comfortable<00:02:54.110> with<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.320> thumb

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
gotten really comfortable with the thumb

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.020 
gotten really comfortable with the thumb
and<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.740> ring<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.220> you've<00:02:55.610> played<00:02:55.820> around

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
and the ring and you've played around

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.240 
and the ring and you've played around
with<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.300> a<00:02:56.360> lot<00:02:56.570> then<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.410> can<00:02:57.590> bring<00:02:57.800> in<00:02:57.980> the

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
with it a lot then you can bring in the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.030 
with it a lot then you can bring in the
middle<00:02:58.550> finger<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:59.120> create<00:02:59.270> a<00:02:59.420> triplet<00:03:00.040> so

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
middle finger to create a triplet so

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.750 
middle finger to create a triplet so
it's<00:03:01.220> thumb<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:01.940> then<00:03:02.870> on<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.050> way<00:03:03.200> up<00:03:03.760> to

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
it's thumb and then on the way up to

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.520 
it's thumb and then on the way up to
three<00:03:05.420> with<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.140> ring<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.770> middle<00:03:07.550> so<00:03:08.360> 1<00:03:08.690> 2<00:03:09.110> 3

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
three with the ring and middle so 1 2 3

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.890 
three with the ring and middle so 1 2 3
1<00:03:10.010> 2<00:03:10.430> 3<00:03:12.550> and<00:03:13.550> I'm<00:03:13.730> exaggerating<00:03:14.030> my<00:03:14.450> motions<00:03:14.810> a

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
1 2 3 and I'm exaggerating my motions a

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.750 
1 2 3 and I'm exaggerating my motions a
lot<00:03:15.050> now<00:03:15.320> so<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.739> you<00:03:15.860> guys<00:03:16.010> can<00:03:16.220> understand

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
lot now so that you guys can understand

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.729 
lot now so that you guys can understand
it<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.030> see<00:03:17.180> what<00:03:17.300> I'm<00:03:17.390> doing<00:03:17.690> but<00:03:18.380> remember

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
it and see what I'm doing but remember

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.710 
it and see what I'm doing but remember
use<00:03:18.890> as<00:03:19.040> little<00:03:19.220> energy<00:03:19.430> as<00:03:19.700> possible<00:03:20.300> it's<00:03:20.570> a

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
use as little energy as possible it's a

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.360 
use as little energy as possible it's a
Down<00:03:20.900> stroke<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.470> an<00:03:21.590> up<00:03:21.739> stroke<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.340> just

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
Down stroke and an up stroke and just

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.880 
Down stroke and an up stroke and just
flicking<00:03:23.360> your<00:03:23.630> fingers<00:03:24.050> into<00:03:24.350> it<00:03:24.470> on<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.770> way

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
flicking your fingers into it on the way

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:40.559 
flicking your fingers into it on the way
up

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.280 

and<00:03:41.730> that's<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.879> sprint<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.420> now<00:03:43.989> I<00:03:44.019> can<00:03:44.260> use

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
and that's the sprint and now I can use

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.780 
and that's the sprint and now I can use
it<00:03:44.409> to<00:03:44.560> throw<00:03:44.799> some<00:03:44.980> quick<00:03:45.189> triplets<00:03:45.609> into

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
it to throw some quick triplets into

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.979 
it to throw some quick triplets into
that<00:03:45.909> flat<00:03:46.150> guitar<00:03:46.480> we<00:03:46.599> were<00:03:46.659> playing<00:03:46.900> earlier

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.319 

or<00:03:53.099> use<00:03:54.099> it<00:03:54.219> with<00:03:54.340> chords<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.879> get<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.030> strong

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
or use it with chords to get a strong

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:03.270 
or use it with chords to get a strong
flamenco<00:03:55.870> effect<00:04:01.530> or<00:04:02.530> find<00:04:02.769> your<00:04:02.890> own<00:04:03.010> way<00:04:03.159> how
