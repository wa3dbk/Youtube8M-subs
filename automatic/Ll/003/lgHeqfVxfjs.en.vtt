we're<00:00:00.570> going<00:00:00.690> to<00:00:00.750> take<00:00:00.840> a<00:00:00.900> look<00:00:01.020> at<00:00:01.140> an

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:01.230 
we're going to take a look at an

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.490 
we're going to take a look at an
application<00:00:01.380> called<00:00:01.890> graph<00:00:02.220> calc<00:00:03.140> it<00:00:04.140> has

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
application called graph calc it has

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.629 
application called graph calc it has
some<00:00:05.490> really<00:00:05.700> powerful<00:00:06.000> tools<00:00:06.720> it<00:00:07.529> includes<00:00:08.460> a

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
some really powerful tools it includes a

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.759 
some really powerful tools it includes a
basic<00:00:09.030> calculator<00:00:09.540> but<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.139> really<00:00:10.469> shines

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
basic calculator but it really shines

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.470 
basic calculator but it really shines
when<00:00:11.010> comes<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.460> graphing<00:00:11.880> functions<00:00:12.090> and

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
when comes to graphing functions and

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.480 
when comes to graphing functions and
equations<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:13.860> could<00:00:14.070> click<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.400> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
equations we could click on the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.670 
equations we could click on the

now<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.100> you've<00:01:11.250> ever<00:01:11.369> used<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.790> graphing

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
now if you've ever used a graphing

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.910 
now if you've ever used a graphing
calculator<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.659> know<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.380> kind<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
calculator you know it can be kind of a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.859 
calculator you know it can be kind of a
pain<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.700> make<00:01:14.820> your<00:01:14.970> window<00:01:15.240> fit<00:01:15.479> your<00:01:15.630> graph

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
pain to make your window fit your graph

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.920 
pain to make your window fit your graph
graph<00:01:16.680> calc<00:01:17.150> overcomes<00:01:18.150> us<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> great

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
graph calc overcomes us with a great

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.780 
graph calc overcomes us with a great
interface<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.950> allows<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.490> use<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
interface that allows you to use the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.899 
interface that allows you to use the
ipod<00:01:21.119> pinch<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.780> zoom<00:01:21.950> either<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:23.490> out<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
ipod pinch and zoom either in or out to

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.899 
ipod pinch and zoom either in or out to
make<00:01:24.360> your<00:01:24.509> window<00:01:24.750> fit<00:01:25.110> your<00:01:25.320> graph<00:01:25.560> or<00:01:25.909> you

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
make your window fit your graph or you

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.429 
make your window fit your graph or you
just<00:01:27.000> use<00:01:27.330> your<00:01:27.360> finger<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.750> drag<00:01:28.080> your<00:01:28.259> graph

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
just use your finger to drag your graph

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.210 
just use your finger to drag your graph
over<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:29.009> i'm<00:01:29.159> doing<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.070> also

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
over like i'm doing here so we can also

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.499 
over like i'm doing here so we can also
zoom<00:01:32.369> out<00:01:33.860> or<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:35.610> can<00:01:35.759> zoom<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:37.159> scroll

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
zoom out or we can zoom in and scroll

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.580 
zoom out or we can zoom in and scroll
let's<00:01:39.509> go<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.750> zoom<00:01:39.900> out<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.350> see<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
let's go and zoom out so we can see the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.719 
let's go and zoom out so we can see the
whole<00:01:40.740> function<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.869> if<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:43.049> double<00:01:43.560> tap<00:01:43.829> we

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
whole function here if we double tap we

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.149 
whole function here if we double tap we
can<00:01:44.990> have<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.470> an<00:01:46.560> option<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.040> make

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
can have it have an option here to make

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.730 
can have it have an option here to make
it<00:01:47.250> snapped<00:01:47.490> intersections<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.470> it

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
it snapped intersections we can and it

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.359 
it snapped intersections we can and it
will<00:01:49.770> show<00:01:50.040> us<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:51.680> intersections<00:01:52.680> there<00:01:52.860> if

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
will show us the intersections there if

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.670 
will show us the intersections there if
we<00:01:54.360> tap<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.930> if<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.110> tap<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.590> it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
we tap on it so if we tap here on it

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.280 
we tap on it so if we tap here on it
between<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> lower<00:01:57.000> left<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> red<00:01:58.079> line

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
between the lower left with a red line

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.929 
between the lower left with a red line
the<00:01:58.439> green<00:01:58.590> light<00:01:58.710> week<00:01:58.890> or<00:01:59.100> where<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.759> green

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
the green light week or where the green

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.240 
the green light week or where the green
line<00:02:00.090> meets<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.930> access<00:02:01.320> there<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:01.710> up<00:02:01.770> here

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
line meets the access there or up here

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.920 
line meets the access there or up here
where<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> red<00:02:02.880> every<00:02:03.090> line<00:02:03.270> meet<00:02:03.420> again<00:02:03.689> and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
where the red every line meet again and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.280 
where the red every line meet again and
shows<00:02:04.920> us<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.219> values<00:02:05.610> there<00:02:05.990> we<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.170> also

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
shows us the values there we can also

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.669 
shows us the values there we can also
trace<00:02:07.920> with<00:02:08.789> our<00:02:08.970> finger<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:10.140> can't<00:02:10.379> see<00:02:10.560> this

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
trace with our finger you can't see this

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.320 
trace with our finger you can't see this
very<00:02:11.009> well<00:02:11.190> but<00:02:11.310> I'm<00:02:11.400> moving<00:02:11.730> my<00:02:11.760> finger<00:02:12.120> cam

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
very well but I'm moving my finger cam

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.559 
very well but I'm moving my finger cam
like<00:02:12.569> this

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
like this

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.199 
like this
so<00:02:13.989> we<00:02:14.049> do<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.379> again<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:15.640> shows<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:16.030> the

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
so we do that again it shows you the

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.300 
so we do that again it shows you the
values<00:02:16.510> there<00:02:16.749> you<00:02:17.680> do<00:02:17.799> it<00:02:17.920> on<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.099> green<00:02:18.249> line

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
values there you do it on the green line

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.399 
values there you do it on the green line
