demo here I know a lot of people
criticizing<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.080> newly<00:00:10.950> released<00:00:11.309> HP

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
criticizing the newly released HP

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.230 
criticizing the newly released HP
TouchPad<00:00:12.300> for<00:00:13.200> not<00:00:13.320> having<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.679> lot<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.889> apps

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
TouchPad for not having a lot of apps

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.859 
TouchPad for not having a lot of apps
but<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.839> believe<00:00:16.910> some<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> reason<00:00:18.570> why<00:00:18.690> you

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
but I believe some of the reason why you

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.840 
but I believe some of the reason why you
don't<00:00:19.050> need<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.289> lot<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.500> apps<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.609> touchpad

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
don't need a lot of apps on the touchpad

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.769 
don't need a lot of apps on the touchpad
is<00:00:21.359> because<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.590> attached<00:00:22.890> fat<00:00:23.240> can<00:00:24.240> do<00:00:24.449> more

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
is because the attached fat can do more

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.630 
is because the attached fat can do more
than<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.470> HP<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.970> for<00:00:27.300> example<00:00:27.859> I<00:00:28.859> mean

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
than the HP can so for example I mean

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.820 
than the HP can so for example I mean
sorry<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.420> touchpad<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.289> do<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> lot<00:00:31.769> more

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
sorry the touchpad can do a lot more

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.670 
sorry the touchpad can do a lot more
than<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.000> ipad<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.020> that's<00:00:34.350> why<00:00:34.620> you

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
than the ipad can and that's why you

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.709 
than the ipad can and that's why you
don't<00:00:34.829> need<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.100> have<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> lot<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.579> apps<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.210> the

animation and it looks nice so that is
one<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.209> reason<00:04:21.600> why<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:21.780> think<00:04:22.229> you<00:04:22.830> don't

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
one of the reason why I think you don't

one of the reason why I think you don't
need<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.550> lot<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:24.030> apps<00:04:24.360> on<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:25.260> touch<00:04:25.800> pad

need a lot of apps on the touch pad

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.029 
need a lot of apps on the touch pad
because<00:04:26.789> you<00:04:27.270> can<00:04:27.419> achieve<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:28.229> lot<00:04:28.470> of<00:04:28.800> things

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
because you can achieve a lot of things

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.550 
because you can achieve a lot of things
on<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.490> touch<00:04:29.729> pad<00:04:29.760> with<00:04:30.720> that<00:04:30.900> having<00:04:31.229> a<00:04:31.320> nap

on the touch pad with that having a nap

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.370 
on the touch pad with that having a nap
and<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:32.340> think<00:04:32.699> HP<00:04:33.690> needs<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.080> come<00:04:34.229> like
