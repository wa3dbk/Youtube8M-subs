00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.170
 Y 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.470
 hello what's up kids and we're 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.119
 new and today we bring a little trick to 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.770
 get a bike that can not be 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.529
 buy in another as you see out there by 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.690
 no side on the map new person in 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.430
 no side 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.370
 The first thing I had to do was 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.809
 location is framed 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.809
 there on the map that has shown 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.780
 as you can see a little different 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.850
 and now we're heading to a circuit 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:06.670
 the steps that are here and what we do 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.409
 we take and we got off the bike and 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.950
 automatically person must enter 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.110
 the game we give to the host or even 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.040
 I hope you want more inscriptions 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.890
 fast and once you leave you look for 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.930
 there it is but it goes responds to the motorcycle 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.080
 out there the street 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.420
 of same put in front 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.420
 we quickly assembled what it does 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.970
 that allows the amount of the lows of 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.580
 put the locator and ensure that it does not 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.830
 we do step by step it will not leave us 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.150
 duplicate the unexplained 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.150
 put the organizer 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.040
 and nothing once I'm here and what 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.070
 how much you heard we put locator and 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.830
 the insurance and nothing and we can prepare you 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.710
 you can put a lot of it 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.860
 wheel modifications of this painting of 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.710
 Make up particular squad 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.030
 military on moto2 and almost everything can 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.140
 put I do not understand why they do not put this 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.710
 motorcycle so you can buy good with 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.620

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.340

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.270
