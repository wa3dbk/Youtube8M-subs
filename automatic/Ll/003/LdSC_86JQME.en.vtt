00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.600
 The staff is all right here, Rafael 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.869
 radio rush news and today is here again 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.150
 with ax saw 1 860 inec in the video 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.279
 last made a boxing it and now it's 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.050
 people's time sees it in action 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.990
 for that we are here with the trio 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:37.500
 iprohpar of 79 77 39 attacking in 4.2 32 gb 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.239
 memory ddr3 two thousand and 400 mhz per 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.460
 about 80 go to refrigerate the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.340
 processor is a ramp at 4 extreme 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.040
 to call everything, then I'll go 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.670
 to play a game almost 3 nelly we can 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.680
 see also the metro connected in the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.780
 outlet is the input 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.970
 of energy from the foot source and there 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.460
 The reason is that we ask the attention of 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.760
 I vote it's here I left this camera 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.759
 positioned provatti metro a team of 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.130
 image of her that we can now 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.320
 put a real-time video showing 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.290
 in these data and the law also on the other side 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.320
 We 'll have the contest monitor. 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.920
 link or getting worse too, so let's go 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.260
 test this source now with almost 3 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.760
 The only people who want you are 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.760
 who already has almost depleted 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.689
 always have a gp2 strained by 3 in 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.060
 so we are control and transparent 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.149
 using almost his full potential. 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.039
 93% are climbing very well nor here in the 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.259
 three countries can see that the 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.710
 legislation at the highest level and 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:47.770
 1,500 hf in memory using a total of 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.469
 seven thousand six hundred mega I think 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.549
 absurd perhaps if it is not the tambo tÃ¡ 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:58.149
 so respectful Fariana 1561 feels little 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.140
 the average of 80 so you have to show 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.780
 for you 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.229
 You can see that all is maximum 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:10.539
 keeping at very high to late fz6 that 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.380
 place with the 1988 x in all old is here 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.530
 on the side 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.970
 we'll have a link steed here already 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.290
 Show us some data from the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.540
 source such as temperature 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.390
 her that is 31 degrees 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.290
 her fan is running in 1320 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.390
 rpm 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.549
 here we have the energy input to 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.160
 the fact that the 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.200
 setting is okay and consuming 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.420
 inefficiency that shows here in this 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.769
 big but I'll leave it recording via 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.120
 software this here too 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.700
 so we can see in time 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.500
 because how does the configuration only 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.810
 behaving even if the data that the 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.600
 we can collect is CONSEG 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.920
 here only as an example to realize the 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.400
 3 1 and 2 is the gps connector on the motherboard in 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.849
 633 the first appeared at 76 34 to 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.170
 second 79 80 and a5 and a6 are the third 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.970
 section 70 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.190
 so let's go to the game and let's see how it is 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.190
 the source behaves this configuration 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.240
 kiss 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.290
 is then that's it personal power come 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.380
 here is for celio when the system with 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.300
 certain clearance in a source effort does not 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.400
 arrived even if there is a lot and here already 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.710
 can see the system in Aragon is the 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.020
 shame of the 70's turned off in that 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.060
 off is totally the second third 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.190
 see it and the course module and links and 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.350
 had not shown before that I showed 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.450
 just not boxing you turn on the source and another 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.220
 side you're not receiving is that you can only 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.410
 have denied this flashing light on 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.930
 orange and green means that it is 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.640
 processing on the computer 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.500
 then we can also see the tension 12 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.870
 volts that we saw in the video she almost 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.230
 not ranged it stands between 12 twelve overall 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.360
 is really a very small variation 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.580
 movement over a house there of 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.450
 So we can measure some 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.370
 difference 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.190
 and the water consumption of the machine is still 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.930
 It is not that it's a 195 vaz okay thing 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.520
 showing for Sergio is such a person. 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.460
 to finish we just milan 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.590
 beats subway 195 to 200 consumption classes 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.320
 is approximately the same value 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.970
 that we have here on the link horse is 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.520
 besides we can see the consumption 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.730
 internal of the machine 184 waves in the essence 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.520
 it is 90% with poor campaign now 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.290
 hold it is turning it on 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.960
 from time to time to take a deep breath 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.479
 back to the environmental passive stage 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.130
 completely off in the vicinity of the 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.800
 a little higher here comes forth 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.290
 also stopped but they did not have 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.000
 consumption in people's 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.220
 because they are most of the time 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.169
 connected is not only the first is connected 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.020
 step by its energy generated by the lots 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.640
 neither oe pps itself is also 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.620
 running very little power is 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.050
 evaluating a little here we have 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.800
 it is fear of the elections not a little bit 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:09.700
 current positions 24 pin pins is not 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.440
 the main team and leaving the video for 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.560
 here you can see here in our 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.290
 test machine or ax 1 861 with the 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.750
 machine on hia 21 also off 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.700
 It's kind of like the source is really very 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.850
 strong it can take configuration 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.440
 without slackening her attention to 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.419
 people can see that the voltage of the 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.210
 network came to fall from 110 got to stay 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:33.280
 close to 105 106 volts and yet 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.060
 the source managed to hold the 12 or super 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.520
 it was right, right? 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.110
 then any instability in the machine 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.610
 Ok, that's it, everybody, you liked it. 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.889
 video clip I liked you sign up for 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.970
 our channel is to continue your 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:45.650
 facebook, this is it 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.639
 Thanks guys for the next video one 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.639
 hug, I went
