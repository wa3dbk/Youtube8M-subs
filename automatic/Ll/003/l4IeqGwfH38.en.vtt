mirror finish with that you know I bet
you<00:02:41.800> you<00:02:41.920> could<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.570> know<00:02:43.660> let<00:02:43.870> me<00:02:43.930> play

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
you you could and you know let me play

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.480 
you you could and you know let me play
with<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.470> little<00:02:44.500> more<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.040> I'll<00:02:45.100> show<00:02:45.460> you

with it a little more and I'll show you

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.790 
with it a little more and I'll show you
in<00:02:45.700> another<00:02:45.790> video<00:02:46.270> sometimes<00:02:46.990> what<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.620> learn

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
in another video sometimes what I learn

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.380 
in another video sometimes what I learn
how<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:47.950> use<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.400> darn<00:02:48.610> thing<00:02:48.850> this<00:02:49.210> is

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
how to use the darn thing this is

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.090 
how to use the darn thing this is
actually<00:02:49.720> kind<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:49.960> cool<00:02:50.230> because<00:02:50.500> they<00:02:50.920> call

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
actually kind of cool because they call

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.140 
actually kind of cool because they call
it<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.370> Z<00:02:51.700> Krew<00:02:52.240> or<00:02:52.860> see-through<00:02:53.940> as<00:02:54.940> you're

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
it a Z Krew or see-through as you're

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.610 
it a Z Krew or see-through as you're
using<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:56.020> can<00:02:56.440> see<00:02:56.710> right<00:02:57.100> through<00:02:58.620> the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
using this you can see right through the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.040 
using this you can see right through the
grinding<00:03:00.040> wheel<00:03:00.250> with<00:03:01.150> these<00:03:01.300> little<00:03:01.540> cuts<00:03:01.780> in

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
grinding wheel with these little cuts in

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.130 
grinding wheel with these little cuts in
it<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.250> can<00:03:03.400> see<00:03:03.610> as<00:03:03.730> you're<00:03:03.910> grinding<00:03:04.450> you

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
it so you can see as you're grinding you

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.480 
it so you can see as you're grinding you
can<00:03:05.320> actually<00:03:05.620> look<00:03:05.800> right<00:03:06.040> through<00:03:06.250> that

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
can actually look right through that

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.070 
can actually look right through that
disc<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.120> can<00:03:07.330> see<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.750> metal

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
disc and you can see the metal

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.260 
disc and you can see the metal
underneath<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.740> is<00:03:08.830> that<00:03:08.980> wheels<00:03:09.190> turning<00:03:09.760> so

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
underneath it is that wheels turning so

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.120 
underneath it is that wheels turning so
you<00:03:10.390> can<00:03:10.540> see<00:03:10.750> exactly<00:03:11.140> where<00:03:11.440> your<00:03:11.470> grind<00:03:11.890> and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
you can see exactly where your grind and

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.940 
you can see exactly where your grind and
exactly<00:03:12.670> what<00:03:12.850> you're<00:03:13.060> doing

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
exactly what you're doing

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.550 
exactly what you're doing
that<00:03:14.950> will<00:03:15.070> be<00:03:15.160> fun<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.430> play<00:03:15.580> with<00:03:15.760> later<00:03:16.560> this

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
that will be fun to play with later this

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.780 
that will be fun to play with later this
other<00:03:17.739> one<00:03:17.860> is<00:03:18.040> their<00:03:18.930> c3<00:03:19.930> ceramic<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:20.890> their

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
other one is their c3 ceramic and their

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.830 
other one is their c3 ceramic and their
touting<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.570> being<00:03:22.900> contaminant<00:03:23.890> free<00:03:24.840> so

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
touting it is being contaminant free so

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.930 
touting it is being contaminant free so
like<00:03:26.020> you're<00:03:26.230> doing<00:03:26.590> aluminum<00:03:27.310> or<00:03:27.760> you're

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
like you're doing aluminum or you're

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.640 
like you're doing aluminum or you're
doing<00:03:28.150> stainless<00:03:28.900> or<00:03:29.080> something<00:03:29.350> like<00:03:29.470> that

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
doing stainless or something like that

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.690 
doing stainless or something like that
and<00:03:29.800> then<00:03:29.890> you're<00:03:30.010> going<00:03:30.100> to<00:03:30.190> come<00:03:30.310> back<00:03:30.340> and

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
and then you're going to come back and

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.449 
and then you're going to come back and
dig<00:03:30.940> over<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.390> top<00:03:31.570> of<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:33.010> won't

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
dig over the top of it this won't

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.500 
dig over the top of it this won't
believe<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:35.610> contamination<00:03:36.610> left<00:03:36.820> over<00:03:37.150> then

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
believe the contamination left over then

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.150 
believe the contamination left over then
you<00:03:37.600> have<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.840> go<00:03:37.930> back<00:03:38.110> and<00:03:38.290> scrub<00:03:38.560> off<00:03:38.739> clean

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
you have to go back and scrub off clean

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.520 
you have to go back and scrub off clean
off<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.670> get<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:39.880> clean<00:03:40.090> again<00:03:40.239> before<00:03:41.200> you<00:03:41.380> do

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530
