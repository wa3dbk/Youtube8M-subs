 service providers in addition to a 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.610
 Good guide requires luck to see

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.660
 months will make nayarit his house is to come 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.879
 one day the whale can be 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.520
 only as a trunk or only 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.739

 teaching his baby to jump and also 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.820
 I've had to see whale jumping over 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.160
 a whale this at the same time or 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.610
 Sometimes the mother breeds it at the same 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.010
 suddenly appear imposing 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.120
 quiet and oblivious of what happens to his 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.890
 around 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.110
 they swim near the boats and in 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.510
 chances take momentum to jump 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.399
 up to three meters out of the water 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.920
 let's look at the horizon 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.240
 look for the blows that is the trail that 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.090
 they leave the whales so to speak 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.539
 because they go out to breathe then where 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.000
 the breath we located a bit with what 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.979
 it's the compass and we start running towards 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.020
 she despite the beauty of this 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.090
 show whale watching 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.740
 has lost public due to another 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.740
 natural attraction more 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.400
 more visits what the islands are 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.530
 marietas but in the same way they are 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.630
 offered tourists the ride to see 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.790
 whales and chose to do both 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.380
 things in one travel well 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.330
 bay of flags the municipalities of 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.430
 Compostela and San Blas harbor the 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.770
 humpback whale from December and up 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.270
 early April it is important to take 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.009
 account that the providers of 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.530
 service must have the permits 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.330
 necessary issued by the semarnat and 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.490
 that could otherwise be done 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.420
 creditors to fines that reach 15 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.490
 thousand pesos 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.770
 Authorized vessels must 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.690
 carry a lilac flag with her 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.300
 you can be sure that the speedboat 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.489
 sure your operator is trained and 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.160
 will protect these animals throughout 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.380
 moment the humpback whale is 100% 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.750
 Mexican since it was born on the shores of 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.550
 country so do not miss the opportunity to 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.800
 look closely at these mammals that 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.450
 will be passing through nayarit with a 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.620
