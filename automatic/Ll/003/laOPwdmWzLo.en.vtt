little less formal and a lot more

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.599 
little less formal and a lot more
unscripted<00:00:15.690> now<00:00:16.410> unfortunately<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.190> project

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
unscripted now unfortunately the project

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.070 
unscripted now unfortunately the project
that<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.760> was<00:00:17.970> working<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.600> little<00:00:18.900> bit

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
that I was working on a little bit

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.260 
that I was working on a little bit
earlier<00:00:19.590> this<00:00:19.800> week<00:00:20.039> didn't<00:00:20.490> quite<00:00:20.760> pan<00:00:21.000> out

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
earlier this week didn't quite pan out

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.790 
earlier this week didn't quite pan out
the<00:00:21.660> script<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.050> he<00:00:22.140> didn't<00:00:22.470> turn<00:00:22.619> out<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the script that he didn't turn out the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.830 
the script that he didn't turn out the
way<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.220> wanted<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.300> they<00:00:24.510> figured

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
way that I wanted it to and they figured

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.929 
way that I wanted it to and they figured
that<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.080> could<00:00:25.230> probably<00:00:25.500> wait<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.640> didn't

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
that it could probably wait so I didn't

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.550 
that it could probably wait so I didn't
want<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.359> skip<00:00:27.630> out<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.050> leave<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.410> guys

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
with absolutely nothing this week so I

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.420 
with absolutely nothing this week so I
figured<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.410> would<00:00:31.529> go<00:00:31.830> ahead<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.219> cover

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
figured that I would go ahead and cover

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.190 
figured that I would go ahead and cover
some<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.059> topics<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.750> they<00:00:33.870> went

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
some of the topics that they went

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.650 
some of the topics that they went
through<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.710> dev<00:00:35.130> stream<00:00:35.430> 39<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.510> guys

through and showed us a few new things

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.029 
through and showed us a few new things
with<00:00:56.969> another<00:00:57.510> arc<00:00:57.840> wings<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.410> there<00:00:58.859> are

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
with another arc wings so there are

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.040 
with another arc wings so there are
going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.340> two<00:00:59.579> arc<00:00:59.879> wings<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.359> launch<00:01:00.629> one

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
going to be two arc wings on launch one

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.389 
going to be two arc wings on launch one
that<00:01:01.289> seems<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.559> little<00:01:01.649> bit<00:01:01.890> more<00:01:01.920> defensive

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
that seems a little bit more defensive

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.359 
that seems a little bit more defensive
and<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.359> seems<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.840> little<00:01:03.870> bit<00:01:04.140> more

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
and one that seems a little bit more

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.130 
and one that seems a little bit more
offensive<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.850> thing<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.299> note<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.750> all

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
offensive one thing to note is that all

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.410 
offensive one thing to note is that all
arc<00:01:07.500> wings<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.220> all<00:01:08.430> arc<00:01:08.729> length<00:01:08.970> weapons

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
arc wings and all arc length weapons

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.990 
arc wings and all arc length weapons
will<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:10.110> new<00:01:10.500> mods<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.490> are<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:11.909> to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
will have new mods so they are going to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.640 
will have new mods so they are going to
be<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> separate<00:01:12.450> matza<00:01:12.900> than<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.439> have

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
be a separate matza than what we have

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.490 
be a separate matza than what we have
now<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.460> would<00:01:14.729> suggest<00:01:15.110> farming<00:01:16.110> up<00:01:16.259> some

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
now so I would suggest farming up some

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.830 
now so I would suggest farming up some
fusion<00:01:16.710> cores<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.400> grabbing<00:01:18.299> some<00:01:18.540> fusion

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
fusion cores or grabbing some fusion

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.080 
fusion cores or grabbing some fusion
fodder<00:01:19.290> now<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.310> guys<00:01:20.460> are<00:01:20.759> curious

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
fodder now if you guys are curious

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.149 
fodder now if you guys are curious
however<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.900> did<00:01:21.930> watch<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.380> dev<00:01:22.740> stream<00:01:23.009> I'm

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
however and did watch the dev stream I'm

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.859 
however and did watch the dev stream I'm
kind<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.729> getting<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.119> feel<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.630> more

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
kind of getting a feel for the more

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.810 
kind of getting a feel for the more
defensive<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> two<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.250> felt<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.640> its

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
defensive one of the two I felt like its

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.760 
defensive one of the two I felt like its
ability<00:01:27.210> set<00:01:27.420> was<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.990> little<00:01:28.259> bit<00:01:28.500> better

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
ability set was just a little bit better

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.590 
ability set was just a little bit better
and<00:01:29.040> maybe<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.490> bit<00:01:29.759> more<00:01:30.000> weapon

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and maybe a little bit more weapon

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.200 
and maybe a little bit more weapon
focused<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.290> opposed<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.400> offensive<00:01:33.060> one

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
focused as opposed to the offensive one

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.580 
focused as opposed to the offensive one

ability focused but unfortunately it is
a<00:01:36.810> moot<00:01:37.079> point<00:01:37.110> until<00:01:37.829> all<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.220> stuff<00:01:38.490> comes

a moot point until all that stuff comes

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.450 
a moot point until all that stuff comes

up<00:01:55.439> our<00:01:55.770> warframes<00:01:56.399> now<00:01:57.030> they're<00:01:57.299> saying<00:01:57.570> that

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
up our warframes now they're saying that

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.870 
up our warframes now they're saying that
you'll<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.320> able<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.710> access<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.250> ultimate<00:01:59.700> at

you'll be able to access the ultimate at

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.480 
you'll be able to access the ultimate at
about<00:02:00.090> rank<00:02:00.420> 15<00:02:01.170> which<00:02:01.770> makes<00:02:02.009> me<00:02:02.159> think<00:02:02.189> that

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
about rank 15 which makes me think that

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.249 
about rank 15 which makes me think that
we'll<00:02:02.610> probably<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:03.060> ability<00:02:03.509> 1<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.930> ranked

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
we'll probably have ability 1 and ranked

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.150 
we'll probably have ability 1 and ranked
0<00:02:04.619> ability<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.579> at<00:02:05.790> rank<00:02:06.180> 5<00:02:06.630> ability<00:02:07.320> 3<00:02:07.619> at<00:02:07.829> rank

assuming there's gonna be a whole slew

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.780 
assuming there's gonna be a whole slew
of<00:03:07.060> them<00:03:07.210> so<00:03:07.600> yes<00:03:08.290> start<00:03:08.920> forming<00:03:09.280> those<00:03:09.400> cores

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
of them so yes start forming those cores

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.300 
of them so yes start forming those cores
and<00:03:10.090> start<00:03:10.480> firing<00:03:10.720> those<00:03:11.020> cores<00:03:11.380> now

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
and start firing those cores now

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.000 
and start firing those cores now
now<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:13.090> next<00:03:13.440> mind-blowing<00:03:14.440> thing<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:14.920> is

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
keeps going and going and going but I'm

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.790 
keeps going and going and going but I'm
really<00:03:22.600> really<00:03:22.750> excited<00:03:22.930> for<00:03:23.380> this<00:03:23.440> one<00:03:23.590> and

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
really really excited for this one and

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.050 
really really excited for this one and
this<00:03:23.950> is<00:03:24.010> syndicates

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
this is syndicates

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.790 
this is syndicates
so<00:03:25.600> syndicates<00:03:26.170> are<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.380> faction<00:03:26.770> system

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
so syndicates are the faction system

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.440 
so syndicates are the faction system
that<00:03:27.190> they've<00:03:27.310> been<00:03:27.489> talking<00:03:27.730> about<00:03:28.000> for<00:03:28.390> a

that they've been talking about for a
while<00:03:28.690> where<00:03:29.080> you'll<00:03:29.200> build<00:03:29.440> faction<00:03:29.980> what

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
while where you'll build faction what

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.530 
while where you'll build faction what
certain<00:03:30.400> syndicates<00:03:30.910> as<00:03:31.060> long<00:03:31.239> as<00:03:31.420> you're

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
certain syndicates as long as you're

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.810 
certain syndicates as long as you're
wearing<00:03:31.780> their<00:03:32.050> sigils<00:03:32.560> now<00:03:33.160> there<00:03:33.310> are<00:03:33.489> six

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
wearing their sigils now there are six

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.400 
wearing their sigils now there are six
syndicates<00:03:34.360> in<00:03:34.480> all<00:03:34.630> and<00:03:34.810> they<00:03:34.870> all<00:03:35.050> seem<00:03:35.380> to

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
syndicates in all and they all seem to

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.590 
syndicates in all and they all seem to
have<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.650> tiered<00:03:36.040> system<00:03:36.130> as<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.880> their<00:03:37.030> awards
