00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.280
 923 collection 6 wonderful colors 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.920
 metallic with which you can make 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.450
 beautiful designs or simple enameled 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.850
 Come with me to meet her and let yourself be enchanted 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.830
 for him to eat well this time I'm going 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.470
 to make you a fantastic design 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.239
 using the colors of the collection 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.950
 923 of the cover this is a design 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.660
 inspired by the ideal music for 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.180
 any season, come with me 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.880
 perform it step by step 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.220
 very well let's start working a 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.900
 Once we perform the lengthening with 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.120
 acrylic makeup I will start to 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.520
 work with the cover we started putting 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.470
 the base with the brush we apply a 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.200
 small amount and now I will use 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.379
 a saber brush for gel and let's 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.850
 begin to take it to the entire surface 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.239
 in this way we are going to get a 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.580
 ultra light layer we are going to introduce in 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.280
 The mini led lamp for 30 seconds 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.410
 let's start our design in this 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.990
 I will use the cover 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.690
 electrifying I'm going to start applying 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.640
 a layer of cuticle to tip covering 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.830
 the whole surface I recommend that the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.840
 First layer is ultra thin for 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.930
 avoid run-off or contractions 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.690
 of the product 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.000
 We introduce to the led mini lamp equal 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.790
 for 30 seconds 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.890
 I'm going to apply a second layer of the tone 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.440
 electrifying of the cover this is going to be 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.479
 a slightly thicker layer with which 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.060
 let's completely unify the tone 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.920
 we cover equally from lateral to lateral and from 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.510
 cuticle to tip it is important that 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.580
 take care that the product does not touch the 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.530
 skin on the sides or the area of 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.570
 cuticle 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.840
 we introduce to the lamp the same during 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.939
 30 seconds 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.399
 Once we apply the color we will 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.229
 apply a layer of shine before 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.579
 start painting remember that the 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.979
 system the cover you have to be 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.990
 complete in its three steps before 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.210
 we apply design covering 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.920
 cuticle to tip and lateral to lateral 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.950
 we must take care that the application is 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.630
 completely couple we introduce to the 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.720
 Mini led lamp for 60 seconds 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.540
 now we are going to use the cover solution 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.750
 to eliminate the initial layer let's not be 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.310
 and we use a gauze to clean the 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.310
 inhibition layer completely 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.079
 Now we are going to use acrylic paint 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.959
 black and the brush for freehand 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.629
 number 4 we are going to start creating some 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.470
 lines start from one side we copy the 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:45.110
 line back and forth and ended in 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.540
 the other side I'll continue with a 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.459
 line plus time is important here 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.299
 try that lines that at the most 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.299
 similar possible 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.230
 we make a third equal line 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.690
 following the pattern of the first 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.560
 finished with a fourth line there is that 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.319
 try to be as thin all 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.630
 I'm going to use black paint now 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.970
 acrylic paint and change the brush 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.849
 to number 1 we're going to start doing 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.849
 some musical notes start by drawing a 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.930
 purely curved line and two lines 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.569
 down 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.490
 the first shorter and the second a 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.500
 little bit longer 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.840
 I'm going to use the brush tipper 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.910
 number 1 same with black paint and let's go 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.630
 to make two dots at the end of 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.630
 our lines 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.000
 I'm going to do one more by drawing a line 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.920
 We make a line slightly 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.410
 curved starting with the first and with 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.150
 the punteador we are going to make a circulito 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.150
 a little bit bigger 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.239
 we're going to use the same dotting and we're going to 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:59.769
 trace some points with paint 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.769
 black between the lines 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.250
 ok since I dry the paint now I'm going to 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.950
 use the finalizing shine and 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.870
 We completely cover our design 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.150
 when we make designs with paint 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.030
 You can use resin brush to 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.579
 secure the paint on your base 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.120
 let's introduce to the lamp during 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.120
 60 seconds 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.550
 Now let's apply oil with a smell 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.880
 watermelon in the cuticle area to 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.580
 moisturize and we will use the cover 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.280
 solution and clean the initial layer with 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.140
 a gaza we clean the excess oil and 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.140
 we press to get the brightness 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.710
 Very good friends, we have finished 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.510
