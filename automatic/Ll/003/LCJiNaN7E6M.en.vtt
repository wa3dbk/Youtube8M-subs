almost show like golf ball with a powder

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.670 
almost show like golf ball with a powder
inside<00:00:47.910> when<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.239> hit<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.420> very<00:00:48.690> hard<00:00:48.899> it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
inside when you hit it very hard it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.580

becomes a white cow instantly disappear

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.369 
becomes a white cow instantly disappear
so<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.860> put<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.340> opponent's<00:00:53.789> tee

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
so you put it on your opponent's tee

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.060 
so you put it on your opponent's tee
unsuspectingly<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.680> course<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:55.920> get

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
unsuspectingly and of course they get

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.729 
unsuspectingly and of course they get
quite<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> shot<00:00:56.550> when<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.730> happens<00:00:57.289> this<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.530> I

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
quite a shot when it happens this one I

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.110 
quite a shot when it happens this one I
think<00:00:58.859> was<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> key<00:00:59.309> fob<00:00:59.489> originally<00:00:59.969> because

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
think was a key fob originally because

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.549 
think was a key fob originally because
when<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.329> take<00:01:00.480> off<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.660> top<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.170> becomes<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
when you take off the top it becomes a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.770 
when you take off the top it becomes a
little<00:01:01.829> telescope<00:01:02.640> by<00:01:03.210> which<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.629> look

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.469 
little telescope by which you can look
at<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:05.280> green<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.549> recedes<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.240> spot

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
at the green and recedes you can spot

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.120 
at the green and recedes you can spot
your<00:01:06.600> ball<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> rough<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.979> nice

in<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.120> dark<00:02:30.329> so<00:02:30.599> you<00:02:30.659> can<00:02:30.780> see<00:02:30.930> what<00:02:31.079> you're

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
in the dark so you can see what you're

doing even more jerky perhaps is this
one<00:02:34.200> here<00:02:34.500> they<00:02:34.920> call<00:02:35.159> it<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.370> unwary<00:02:35.760> fairy

into the sand into a bunker pick this up

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.709 
into the sand into a bunker pick this up
potato<00:05:23.900> and<00:05:24.259> it<00:05:24.379> is<00:05:25.009> this<00:05:25.159> your<00:05:25.370> ball<00:05:25.550> it<00:05:26.389> make

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
potato and it is this your ball it make

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:29.800 
potato and it is this your ball it make
a<00:05:26.750> good<00:05:26.960> laugh<00:05:27.310> but<00:05:28.310> it<00:05:28.430> behaves<00:05:28.729> in<00:05:28.939> as<00:05:29.210> well

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
a good laugh but it behaves in as well

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.990 
a good laugh but it behaves in as well
as<00:05:29.900> any<00:05:30.080> go<00:05:30.169> for<00:05:30.469> this<00:05:31.250> one<00:05:31.310> I've<00:05:31.580> never<00:05:31.729> tried

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
as any go for this one I've never tried

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.490 
as any go for this one I've never tried
but<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.240> idea<00:05:32.479> is<00:05:32.509> a<00:05:32.569> nice<00:05:32.779> one<00:05:32.990> it's<00:05:33.169> a<00:05:33.259> golf

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
but the idea is a nice one it's a golf

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.379 
but the idea is a nice one it's a golf
ball<00:05:33.740> with<00:05:33.919> a<00:05:33.949> drove<00:05:34.279> or<00:05:34.460> parachute<00:05:34.940> behind<00:05:35.240> it

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
ball with a drove or parachute behind it

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.200 
ball with a drove or parachute behind it
the<00:05:36.050> idea<00:05:36.319> is<00:05:36.500> it<00:05:36.770> it<00:05:37.279> will<00:05:37.550> if<00:05:37.819> you<00:05:37.969> try<00:05:38.150> to

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
the idea is it it will if you try to

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.450 
the idea is it it will if you try to
drive<00:05:38.509> it<00:05:38.569> hard<00:05:38.930> on<00:05:39.199> a<00:05:39.259> tee<00:05:39.560> instead<00:05:40.250> of<00:05:40.339> going

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
drive it hard on a tee instead of going

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.040 
drive it hard on a tee instead of going
70<00:05:40.819> yards<00:05:41.120> which<00:05:41.240> it<00:05:41.360> might<00:05:41.479> with<00:05:41.659> a<00:05:41.690> good<00:05:41.870> hard

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
70 yards which it might with a good hard

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.990 
70 yards which it might with a good hard
drive<00:05:42.289> it<00:05:42.440> will<00:05:42.529> go<00:05:42.620> 1/10<00:05:43.039> of<00:05:43.129> that<00:05:43.190> 7<00:05:43.639> yards

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
drive it will go 1/10 of that 7 yards

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.689 
drive it will go 1/10 of that 7 yards
and<00:05:44.779> this<00:05:44.870> parachute<00:05:45.500> acts<00:05:45.740> as<00:05:45.949> a<00:05:45.979> as<00:05:46.279> a

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
and this parachute acts as a as a

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.119 
and this parachute acts as a as a
braking<00:05:47.060> device<00:05:47.150> but<00:05:48.139> activate<00:05:48.560> consistently

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.129 
braking device but activate consistently

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:50.469 
braking device but activate consistently
so<00:05:49.460> you<00:05:49.550> can<00:05:49.669> turn<00:05:49.819> your<00:05:49.879> little<00:05:50.240> backyard

so you can turn your little backyard

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.920 
so you can turn your little backyard

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
into a enormous gulf of course but of

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.730 
into a enormous gulf of course but of
course<00:05:54.080> it's<00:05:54.229> not<00:05:54.289> a<00:05:55.599> seat<00:05:56.599> that's<00:05:56.750> a<00:05:56.930> lot<00:05:57.139> but

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
course it's not a seat that's a lot but

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.290 
course it's not a seat that's a lot but
oh<00:05:59.169> of<00:06:00.169> course<00:06:00.439> the<00:06:00.650> screen<00:06:00.889> one<00:06:01.159> but<00:06:01.430> we<00:06:02.120> put

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
oh of course the screen one but we put

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.869 
oh of course the screen one but we put
it<00:06:02.389> on<00:06:02.479> the<00:06:02.569> tier<00:06:02.779> when<00:06:02.930> you<00:06:02.990> tap<00:06:03.199> it<00:06:03.289> like<00:06:03.439> that

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
it on the tier when you tap it like that

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:07.089 
it on the tier when you tap it like that
screams<00:06:04.879> what<00:06:05.210> else<00:06:05.360> could<00:06:05.569> the<00:06:05.629> ballroom<00:06:06.110> so

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
screams what else could the ballroom so

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:08.950 
screams what else could the ballroom so
there<00:06:07.310> are<00:06:07.430> many<00:06:07.550> many<00:06:07.789> strange<00:06:08.389> ideas<00:06:08.810> I'm

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
there are many many strange ideas I'm

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.450 
there are many many strange ideas I'm
sure<00:06:09.169> there's<00:06:09.409> another<00:06:09.620> two<00:06:10.069> dozen<00:06:10.219> if<00:06:10.430> you

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
sure there's another two dozen if you

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.129 
sure there's another two dozen if you
