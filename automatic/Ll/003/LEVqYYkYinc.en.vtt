marks basically I gained weight not

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.530

because<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.049> trial<00:01:16.350> or<00:01:16.590> anything<00:01:16.830> but

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
because of a trial or anything but

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.210 
because of a trial or anything but
because<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.570> my<00:01:18.930> bad<00:01:19.140> eating<00:01:19.409> habits<00:01:19.590> which

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
because of my bad eating habits which

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.070 
because of my bad eating habits which
habits<00:01:20.820> which<00:01:21.000> caused<00:01:21.210> me<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.570> gain<00:01:21.840> weight

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
habits which caused me to gain weight

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.899 
habits which caused me to gain weight
which<00:01:22.680> caused<00:01:22.979> me<00:01:23.220> then<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.610> stretch

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
which caused me then to have stretch

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.399 
which caused me then to have stretch
marks<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.360> places<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.900> didn't<00:01:25.110> think<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.350> was

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
marks in places I didn't think I was

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.890 
marks in places I didn't think I was
supposed<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.920> stretch<00:01:26.159> marks<00:01:26.900> anywho

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
supposed to have stretch marks anywho

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.370 
supposed to have stretch marks anywho
that's<00:01:28.110> probably<00:01:28.590> TMI<00:01:28.890> but<00:01:29.780> I've<00:01:30.780> been<00:01:31.140> doing

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
that's probably TMI but I've been doing

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.679 
that's probably TMI but I've been doing
my<00:01:31.470> best<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:32.820> experiments

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
my best to just do experiments

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.600 
my best to just do experiments
originally<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.290> started<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:34.860> an<00:01:34.979> experiment

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
originally I started with an experiment

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.810 
originally I started with an experiment
um<00:01:36.140> comparing<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.409> think<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.920> was<00:01:38.040> biotin<00:01:38.790> and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
um comparing I think it was biotin and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.539 
um comparing I think it was biotin and
cocoa<00:01:39.479> butter<00:01:39.600> then<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.650> realized<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
cocoa butter then I realized that the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.460 
cocoa butter then I realized that the
cocoa<00:01:41.880> butter<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.270> not<00:01:42.479> working<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.380> I

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
cocoa butter was not working so then I

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.290 
cocoa butter was not working so then I
spent<00:01:43.829> good<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
spent good for the

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.050 
spent good for the
to<00:01:45.420> using<00:01:46.200> biotin<00:01:46.800> then<00:01:47.370> I<00:01:47.400> realized<00:01:47.940> that

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
to using biotin then I realized that

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.530 
to using biotin then I realized that
biotin<00:01:48.780> was<00:01:49.050> not<00:01:49.380> working<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:50.520> me<00:01:50.580> so<00:01:51.510> I

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
biotin was not working for me so I

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
potent hard-to-find like this is what

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.740 
potent hard-to-find like this is what
took<00:02:58.890> me<00:02:59.100> so<00:02:59.370> long<00:02:59.400> to<00:03:00.090> get<00:03:00.330> this<00:03:00.510> recipe

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
took me so long to get this recipe

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.050 
took me so long to get this recipe
together<00:03:01.170> because<00:03:02.010> one<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.459> ingredients

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
together because one of the ingredients

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.699 
together because one of the ingredients
it<00:03:03.150> took<00:03:03.270> me<00:03:03.450> seven<00:03:03.810> weeks<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.410> get<00:03:04.560> it

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
it took me seven weeks to get it

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.550 
it took me seven weeks to get it
imported<00:03:05.370> from<00:03:05.670> overseas<00:03:05.959> seven<00:03:06.959> weeks<00:03:07.350> to

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
imported from overseas seven weeks to

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.979 
imported from overseas seven weeks to
all<00:03:07.830> so<00:03:08.070> it's<00:03:08.160> really<00:03:08.340> really<00:03:08.610> difficult<00:03:08.989> for

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
all so it's really really difficult for

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.110 
all so it's really really difficult for
me<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.070> get<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.310> together<00:03:11.640> but<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.000> know

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
me to get this together but you know

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.420 
me to get this together but you know
what<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.510> put<00:03:12.720> my<00:03:12.840> all<00:03:13.080> into<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.920> made<00:03:14.400> sure

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
what I put my all into it and made sure

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.030 
what I put my all into it and made sure
that<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.850> had<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.300> down<00:03:15.690> pat<00:03:16.080> reason<00:03:16.650> being<00:03:16.800> is

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
that I had this down pat reason being is

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.830 
that I had this down pat reason being is
because<00:03:17.070> I<00:03:17.430> was<00:03:17.610> doing<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:17.970> for<00:03:18.120> myself

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
because I was doing it for myself

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.100 
because I was doing it for myself
first<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.350> all<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.709> then<00:03:20.220> when<00:03:20.580> my<00:03:21.110> family

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.790 
member I'm not going to mention her name
tried<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.600> she's<00:03:24.989> like<00:03:25.140> oh<00:03:25.290> my<00:03:25.590> goodness
