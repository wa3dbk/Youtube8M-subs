if you're a scuba diver it's really the
ideal<00:01:31.910> scenario<00:01:32.150> because<00:01:32.810> just<00:01:33.620> step<00:01:33.800> down

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
ideal scenario because just step down

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.280 
ideal scenario because just step down
those<00:01:34.160> steps<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:34.790> you're<00:01:35.420> into<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.750> ocean<00:01:36.050> so

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
those steps and you're into the ocean so

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.460 
those steps and you're into the ocean so
I<00:01:36.350> have<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.560> look<00:01:36.710> at<00:01:36.830> this

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.040 

now<00:01:41.070> if<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.430> was<00:01:41.550> nice<00:01:41.700> weather<00:01:41.910> it<00:01:42.810> would<00:01:42.900> be

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
now if it was nice weather it would be

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.700 
now if it was nice weather it would be
perfect

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
perfect

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.270

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
but well it's not and actually this is

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.800 
but well it's not and actually this is
probably<00:01:47.580> better<00:01:47.730> weather<00:01:47.970> for<00:01:48.240> I'm<00:01:48.480> still
