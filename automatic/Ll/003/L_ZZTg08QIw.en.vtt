three mangoes and then this is some
coconut<00:02:12.110> meat<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.530> would<00:02:13.160> think<00:02:13.190> this<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.460> the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.760 
coconut meat I would think this is the
meat<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:13.910> like<00:02:14.150> one<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.750> two<00:02:14.780> coconuts
