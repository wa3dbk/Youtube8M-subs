00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.529
 good I 'm going with a smiling face of 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.790
 reem lamerat that had been questioned on 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.780
 dock more than a year and a half ago 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.740
 now who has gone through 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.300
 difficult times since it's been 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.320
 arrived at the Olympic castres already on behalf 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.179
 supporters makes a great pleasure 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.800
 for you you see yourself on the same cases 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.320
 if we see how you feel like that 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.949
 is fine but costs I feel between 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.939
 5,10 this was it was difficult 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.619
 but now it's gone beyond 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.269
 called provinces of the two meetings 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.769
 and go through the match between hopes 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.270
 facing the rochelle then good there 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.860
 now in glasgow how are you 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.809
 felt on on the ground 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.670
 take your bearings a little bit because 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.680
 it's been some time and a little 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.059
 fourriques because there is no doubt that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.550
 I've been waiting for that since my wine so at 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.289
 start a little run everywhere and not 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.000
 necessarily to do things in the good 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.410
 order 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.750
 but soon it's rodez it's 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.550
 like the bike 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.980
 six months after a workout is everything 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.559
 only interest climbs and were 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.010
 revanchists still not the same 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.090
 Toulouse and organize these is 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.040
 complicated anyway for a player 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.170
 to have this bad luck that follow you 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.909
 these painful 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.909
 after that happens to a lot of you like 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.530
 his hut 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.409
 the critics even gave a cd but 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.329
 kana outstanding career passed by 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:28.659
 there so I was impatient to come back 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:34.630
 but a passage almost obliged 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:37.810
 now professional career is 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.310
 what precisely of the number of 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.810
 the team and guys are almost ready 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.429
 how does he see begging asking 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.950
 this fear of healing on the way 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.130
 it was really well surrounded I could 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:53.259
 some guys say for sure that I 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.329
 loose a club like 4 because because 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.329
 that this is a very family club and 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:05.829
 we are very close to each other 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:07.200
 staff I felt we were waiting for me 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:16.390
 so I gave up 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:22.720
 I continued to work on arrival 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.010
 200 patients are stowed Sunday 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.900
 and glasgow 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.340
 I see how we stone Antoine 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.280
 you are preparing this because we have 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.470
 little more folk going there 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.940
 only niches 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:40.330
 it is my displacement but especially 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:42.910
 possible and the match if the logan 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.680
 these guys and in the end the win is there 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.450
 it's true that on the beginning of the week 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.150
 we did not talk too much about the match 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:54.430
 I spent more we talked about the match 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.840
 come on it's good we won but 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.769
 compacted 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.970
 we attack alone the next to jean bouin 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.189
 today these lawsuits in a rock 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:13.549
 two days of training 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:13.549

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.200
 two weeks for me to play high 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.150
 your sense we are going to need all the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.319
 world 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.269
 are you talking about deadlines 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.330
 arrive from the cantons 14 years and earlier 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:52.690
 possible competition with 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:54.250
 reception of the racing metro and Toulouse 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.680
 that you know who is rising 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.090
 match for a lot but precisely to 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.530

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.250

 that's how I 'll tell you all this 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:36.680
