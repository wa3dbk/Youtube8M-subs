00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.420
 tricks 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.850
 I found the car's finish pretty 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.110
 The panel has an automatic 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.750
 half has a bit more of a bearer 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.760
 You can see it's fine. 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.970
 the banks of this model that we took 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.840

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.660

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.360
 ranking security requirements 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.640
 fitch 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.860

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.850
 driver in the case of the steering wheel and 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.890
 passenger 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.040
 just above the port throughout the year in the 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.930
 panel on the back of the car can 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.090
 see that he is pretty handsome leather seats 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.400
 and the more interesting the banks are 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.470
 then split if you have any 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.320
 a little bigger luggage you have the option 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.670
 to be lowering the part of the bank is 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.010
 loading here also for the part of the 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.620
 front and beauty a good thing also that 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.380
 some cases do not have and I do not wheel 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.180
 fitch does not miss first is the backrest of 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.370
 head for third seat passenger 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.320
 from behind and also the direction of three 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.200
 points that we have already seen that some 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.780
 cars leaving is're a cool thing 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.300
 also because you can see is the space 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.720
 three adults comfortably 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.730
 car and here he does not have that part 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.040
 little bigger than it gets in the way of those who go 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:41.570
 in the back seat are another point 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.850
 positive of the car, you can see the 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:47.150
 car finishes are well made with 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:50.750
 accurate locks is the seat was 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:53.420
 color has stitched lines that leaves the 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.490
 car even more charming then in the 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.740
 how positive of the car beyond space 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.130
 inside them are the finishes 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.130
 very good
