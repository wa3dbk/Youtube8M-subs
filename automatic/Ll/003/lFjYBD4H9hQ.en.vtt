00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
missile troops into a giant battalion

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.130 
missile troops into a giant battalion
square<00:01:26.369> where<00:01:27.369> he<00:01:27.970> could<00:01:28.180> place<00:01:28.390> his<00:01:28.630> cover<00:01:28.960> II

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
square where he could place his cover II

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.550 
square where he could place his cover II
and<00:01:29.409> key<00:01:30.280> units<00:01:30.670> inside<00:01:31.030> so<00:01:31.690> that<00:01:31.870> as<00:01:32.050> these

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
and key units inside so that as these

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.450 
and key units inside so that as these
walls<00:01:32.950> were<00:01:33.280> breached<00:01:33.640> as<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.390> infantry

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
walls were breached as the infantry

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.670 
walls were breached as the infantry
repelled<00:01:36.460> cover<00:01:37.390> units<00:01:37.750> that<00:01:37.930> came<00:01:38.320> in<00:01:38.530> and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
repelled cover units that came in and

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.060 
repelled cover units that came in and
those<00:01:39.580> walls<00:01:39.820> could<00:01:39.940> be<00:01:40.060> reinforced<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
those walls could be reinforced and it

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.380 
those walls could be reinforced and it
made<00:01:42.280> it<00:01:42.430> very<00:01:42.460> very<00:01:42.790> difficult<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:43.240> fight

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
made it very very difficult to fight

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.120 
made it very very difficult to fight
against<00:01:43.780> any<00:01:44.200> it<00:01:44.440> was<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.560> very<00:01:44.799> effective

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
against any it was a very effective

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.560 
against any it was a very effective
tactic<00:01:45.700> so<00:01:45.850> I'm<00:01:45.940> going<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.150> try<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.299> break

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
tactic so I'm going to try and break

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:54.940 
tactic so I'm going to try and break
this<00:01:46.720> down<00:01:46.960> with<00:01:47.400> my<00:01:48.400> coverage<00:01:48.820> heavy<00:01:49.030> force

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.050 

alright<00:01:55.549> let's<00:01:55.850> go

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.080 

I<00:02:01.119> see<00:02:01.720> what<00:02:01.840> they're<00:02:01.960> up<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.549> I'm<00:02:03.549> formula

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
I see what they're up to I'm formula

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.430 
I see what they're up to I'm formula
there's<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.689> battalion<00:02:05.140> square

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
there's a battalion square

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.800 
there's a battalion square
I'm<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.250> try<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.550> break<00:02:08.970> down<00:02:09.000> their

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
I'm going to try and break down their

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.940 
I'm going to try and break down their
war

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.900

the<00:02:34.480> charging<00:02:34.870> coloration<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.380> easily<00:02:35.800> get

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
the charging coloration to easily get

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.170 
the charging coloration to easily get
into<00:02:36.100> those<00:02:36.250> conditions

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
into those conditions

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.240 
into those conditions
oh<00:02:38.239> yes

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.130 

while<00:02:45.250> you're<00:02:45.520> engaged<00:02:45.700> there<00:02:46.210> you<00:02:46.630> can<00:02:46.930> go<00:02:47.080> to

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
while you're engaged there you can go to

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.320 
while you're engaged there you can go to
breach<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.860> school

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.929 

see<00:02:51.990> if<00:02:52.080> we<00:02:52.230> can<00:02:52.440> destroy<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.070> area

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:55.939 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.130 

yo

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.860 

I'm<00:02:59.590> going<00:02:59.770> to<00:02:59.860> try<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.010> push<00:03:00.280> through<00:03:00.310> that
