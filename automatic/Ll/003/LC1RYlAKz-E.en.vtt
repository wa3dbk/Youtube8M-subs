and as you know Michael says this is for

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.450 
and as you know Michael says this is for
Michael<00:01:18.810> these<00:01:19.810> blades<00:01:20.259> are<00:01:20.590> extremely<00:01:21.250> dull

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
Michael these blades are extremely dull

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.660 
Michael these blades are extremely dull
and<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.420> angle<00:01:22.930> is<00:01:24.570> totally<00:01:25.570> wrong<00:01:26.190> so<00:01:27.190> we<00:01:27.580> are

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
and the angle is totally wrong so we are

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.270 
and the angle is totally wrong so we are
prepping<00:01:28.000> toes

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.610 

any<00:01:32.550> comments<00:01:33.210> from<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.480> camera<00:01:33.960> person

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.820 

they<00:01:38.160> say<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.730> you're<00:01:38.880> supposed<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.830> hold

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.960 
they say that you're supposed to hold
firmly<00:01:41.370> and<00:01:41.550> you<00:01:41.730> can<00:01:41.880> put<00:01:42.060> pressure<00:01:42.360> down<00:01:42.600> but

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
firmly and you can put pressure down but

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.580 
firmly and you can put pressure down but
because<00:01:44.970> these<00:01:45.300> are<00:01:45.360> new<00:01:45.660> diamond<00:01:45.990> cutters

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.620 
they also say that it could have kicked
back<00:01:49.050> so<00:01:49.440> right<00:01:49.800> now<00:01:50.060> this<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.300> brand<00:01:51.540> new

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
machine so it isn't necessary to do that
