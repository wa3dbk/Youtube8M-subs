candles<00:02:03.780> do<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> memory<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:04.979> let's<00:02:05.189> say

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
candles do have a memory so let's say

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.340 
candles do have a memory so let's say
you<00:02:05.310> got<00:02:05.460> brand<00:02:05.700> new<00:02:05.759> candle<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.259> know

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
you got brand new candle you you know

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.029 
you got brand new candle you you know
lit<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.310> for<00:02:08.819> about<00:02:08.910> an<00:02:09.090> hour<00:02:09.709> going<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.800> create

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
lit it for about an hour going to create

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.530 
lit it for about an hour going to create
kind<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.520> maybe<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.879> small

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
kind of a maybe a small

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.899 
kind of a maybe a small
hole<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:13.110> your<00:02:13.370> candle<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.579> then<00:02:14.700> when<00:02:14.819> you

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
hole in your candle and then when you

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.869 
hole in your candle and then when you
light<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.150> again<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.719> next<00:02:15.750> time<00:02:16.609> it's<00:02:17.609> going

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
light it again the next time it's going

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.640 
light it again the next time it's going
to<00:02:18.030> produce<00:02:18.209> another<00:02:18.719> smaller<00:02:19.140> hole<00:02:19.439> within

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
to produce another smaller hole within

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.099 
to produce another smaller hole within
that<00:02:19.980> smaller<00:02:20.400> hole<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:21.420> makes<00:02:21.629> sense<00:02:21.810> and

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
that smaller hole that makes sense and

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.470 
that smaller hole that makes sense and
so<00:02:23.040> when<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.459> light<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.790> candle<00:02:24.120> if<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.269> let

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
so when you light the candle if you let

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.149 
so when you light the candle if you let
it<00:02:24.569> burn<00:02:24.719> for<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.019> good<00:02:25.170> three<00:02:25.379> to<00:02:25.409> four<00:02:25.739> hours

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
it burn for a good three to four hours

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.490 
it burn for a good three to four hours
then<00:02:26.670> usually<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.359> whole<00:02:27.599> top<00:02:27.840> layer<00:02:28.170> is

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
then usually that whole top layer is

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.160 
then usually that whole top layer is
going<00:02:28.829> to<00:02:28.920> become<00:02:29.250> sort<00:02:29.909> of<00:02:29.970> liquefied<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
going to become sort of liquefied and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.899 
going to become sort of liquefied and
that's<00:02:31.829> where<00:02:31.950> all<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.159> scent<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.670> really

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
that's where all that scent is really

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.240 
that's where all that scent is really
coming<00:02:33.150> from<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:33.870> then<00:02:34.409> when<00:02:34.769> you<00:02:34.859> blow<00:02:35.069> it

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
coming from and then when you blow it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.550 
coming from and then when you blow it
out<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.730> hardens<00:02:36.000> again<00:02:36.390> it's<00:02:36.780> going<00:02:37.470> to

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
out and it hardens again it's going to

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.789 
out and it hardens again it's going to
look<00:02:37.739> just<00:02:37.769> like<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:38.549> as<00:02:38.939> you<00:02:39.090> can<00:02:39.209> see<00:02:39.450> and
