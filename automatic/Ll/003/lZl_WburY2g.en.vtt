00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
35 to 60 miles an hour and again we

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.930 
35 to 60 miles an hour and again we
could<00:03:16.230> have<00:03:16.379> gusts<00:03:16.739> up<00:03:16.829> to<00:03:16.859> 60<00:03:17.400> miles<00:03:17.609> an<00:03:17.849> hour

at<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.239> coast<00:03:18.480> in<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.720> valleys<00:03:19.230> 80<00:03:19.709> in

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
at the coast in the valleys 80 in

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.610 
at the coast in the valleys 80 in
isolated<00:03:21.030> Mountain<00:03:21.389> locations<00:03:21.840> so<00:03:22.290> again

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
isolated Mountain locations so again

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.199 
isolated Mountain locations so again
those<00:03:22.739> are<00:03:22.949> sustained<00:03:23.400> winds<00:03:23.669> and<00:03:23.940> those<00:03:24.030> are

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
those are sustained winds and those are

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.659 
those are sustained winds and those are
gusts<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.019> this<00:03:25.560> will<00:03:25.739> take<00:03:25.919> us<00:03:26.069> into<00:03:26.190> Friday

gusts and this will take us into Friday

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.069 
gusts and this will take us into Friday
where<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.120> windy<00:03:27.480> weather<00:03:27.599> will<00:03:27.930> continue

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
where the windy weather will continue

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.259 
where the windy weather will continue
through<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.709> afternoon<00:03:29.040> hours<00:03:29.459> we<00:03:30.120> might

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
through the afternoon hours we might

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.599 
through the afternoon hours we might
even<00:03:30.299> see<00:03:30.659> a<00:03:30.690> few<00:03:30.750> raindrops<00:03:31.530> on<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:31.980> backside

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
even see a few raindrops on the backside

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.399 
even see a few raindrops on the backside
of<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:33.000> loss<00:03:33.209> of<00:03:33.389> some<00:03:33.629> moisture<00:03:33.810> will<00:03:34.230> be

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
of the loss of some moisture will be

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.649 
of the loss of some moisture will be
getting<00:03:34.620> pulled<00:03:34.949> into<00:03:35.159> the<00:03:35.609> Southland<00:03:36.060> not

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
getting pulled into the Southland not

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.229 
getting pulled into the Southland not
enough<00:03:37.139> moisture<00:03:37.980> we<00:03:38.400> do<00:03:38.639> need<00:03:38.819> more<00:03:39.000> than

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
enough moisture we do need more than

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.550 
enough moisture we do need more than
that<00:03:39.359> because<00:03:39.569> again<00:03:39.840> those<00:03:40.079> fire<00:03:40.319> weather

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
that because again those fire weather

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.339 
that because again those fire weather
watches<00:03:40.949> will<00:03:41.129> be<00:03:41.310> high<00:03:41.549> with<00:03:42.479> the<00:03:42.780> windy<00:03:43.139> dry

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
watches will be high with the windy dry

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.559 
watches will be high with the windy dry
conditions<00:03:44.099> let's<00:03:44.639> take<00:03:44.909> a<00:03:44.940> look<00:03:45.239> at<00:03:45.419> the

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
conditions let's take a look at the

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.809 
conditions let's take a look at the
temperatures<00:03:46.199> today<00:03:47.010> we<00:03:47.280> were<00:03:47.430> right<00:03:47.669> around

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
temperatures today we were right around

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.149 
temperatures today we were right around
average<00:03:48.359> tomorrow<00:03:49.049> we're<00:03:49.620> actually<00:03:49.739> going<00:03:50.069> to

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
average tomorrow we're actually going to

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.339 
average tomorrow we're actually going to
start<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.549> cool<00:03:50.879> things<00:03:51.209> down<00:03:51.659> so<00:03:51.959> it's<00:03:52.229> gonna

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
start to cool things down so it's gonna

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.349 
start to cool things down so it's gonna
be<00:03:52.530> cool<00:03:52.769> in<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.129> windy<00:03:53.489> temperatures

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
be cool in the windy temperatures

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.780 
be cool in the windy temperatures
tonight<00:03:54.510> into<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.290> 50s<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:55.979> 60s<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.639> want

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
tonight into the 50s and the 60s I want

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.039 
tonight into the 50s and the 60s I want
to<00:03:56.849> show<00:03:56.970> you<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.209> weather<00:03:57.359> set<00:03:57.659> up<00:03:57.750> this<00:03:57.870> is

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
to show you the weather set up this is

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.369 
to show you the weather set up this is
why<00:03:58.379> we're<00:03:59.340> having<00:04:00.000> these<00:04:00.239> very<00:04:00.479> strong<00:04:00.959> winds

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
why we're having these very strong winds

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.860 
why we're having these very strong winds
we've<00:04:01.709> got<00:04:01.949> a<00:04:01.979> ridge<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.370> high<00:04:03.000> pressure<00:04:03.030> but

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
we've got a ridge of high pressure but

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.490 
we've got a ridge of high pressure but
that<00:04:04.169> is<00:04:04.500> just<00:04:05.129> out<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.819> our<00:04:06.090> west<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:06.810> this

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
that is just out to our west so this

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.530 
that is just out to our west so this
area<00:04:07.799> of<00:04:07.949> low<00:04:08.129> pressure<00:04:08.159> is<00:04:08.609> dropping<00:04:08.909> in<00:04:09.419> and

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
area of low pressure is dropping in and

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.809 
area of low pressure is dropping in and
is<00:04:09.690> dropping<00:04:10.229> in<00:04:10.379> just<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.949> our<00:04:11.099> East<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.760> the

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
is dropping in just to our East and the

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.390 
is dropping in just to our East and the
problem<00:04:12.299> is<00:04:12.510> is<00:04:12.720> we're<00:04:13.379> squeezed<00:04:14.040> right

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
problem is is we're squeezed right

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.610 
problem is is we're squeezed right
between<00:04:14.609> these<00:04:15.120> two<00:04:15.180> systems<00:04:16.109> so<00:04:16.289> that's<00:04:16.409> why

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
between these two systems so that's why

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.990 
between these two systems so that's why
the<00:04:16.680> wind<00:04:17.039> is<00:04:17.159> going<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.430> start<00:04:17.639> to<00:04:17.729> pick<00:04:17.849> up

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
the wind is going to start to pick up

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.659 
the wind is going to start to pick up
the<00:04:18.150> other<00:04:18.299> problem<00:04:18.780> is<00:04:18.900> is<00:04:19.079> this<00:04:19.650> low<00:04:20.039> instead

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
the other problem is is this low instead

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.000 
the other problem is is this low instead
of<00:04:20.789> just<00:04:20.970> moving<00:04:21.359> on<00:04:21.659> out<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.380> causing<00:04:22.740> winds

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
of just moving on out and causing winds

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.190 
of just moving on out and causing winds
for<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.400> short<00:04:23.700> period<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.090> time<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.570> is<00:04:24.870> gonna

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
for a short period of time it is gonna

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.810 
for a short period of time it is gonna
stall<00:04:25.590> out<00:04:25.620> just<00:04:26.370> sit

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
stall out just sit

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.420 
stall out just sit
right<00:04:27.090> over<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.630> basin<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:28.260> again<00:04:28.620> we've<00:04:29.400> got

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
right over the basin so again we've got

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.970 
right over the basin so again we've got
these<00:04:29.730> winds<00:04:30.630> these<00:04:30.960> very<00:04:31.230> strong<00:04:31.530> winds<00:04:31.920> over

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
these winds these very strong winds over

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.650 
these winds these very strong winds over
a<00:04:32.130> prolonged<00:04:32.340> period<00:04:32.880> of<00:04:32.910> time<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.360> that<00:04:33.480> will

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
a prolonged period of time and that will

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.570 
a prolonged period of time and that will
be<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.930> problem<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.560> again<00:04:35.100> we've<00:04:35.250> got<00:04:35.280> that

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
be the problem and again we've got that

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.910 
be the problem and again we've got that
cooler<00:04:35.880> air<00:04:36.180> moving<00:04:36.600> in<00:04:36.810> as<00:04:37.050> well<00:04:37.410> let's<00:04:37.680> take

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
cooler air moving in as well let's take

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.950
