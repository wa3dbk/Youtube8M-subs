00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
three different tones now we place

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.359 
three different tones now we place
another<00:01:18.780> non<00:01:19.140> precious<00:01:19.560> metal<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> place

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
another non precious metal in the place

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.850 
another non precious metal in the place
of<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:21.180> euro<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.810> make<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> condition<00:01:22.560> more

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.390 
of one euro to make the condition more
difficult<00:01:24.020> now<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.500> left<00:01:25.710> our<00:01:25.890> gold<00:01:26.130> coin

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
difficult now we left our gold coin

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:35.210 
difficult now we left our gold coin
between<00:01:26.610> non<00:01:27.390> precious<00:01:27.840> ones<00:01:33.680> as<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:35.040> see

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
between non precious ones as you can see

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.219 
between non precious ones as you can see
we<00:01:35.520> receive<00:01:35.850> two<00:01:36.060> different<00:01:36.390> tones<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:36.900> both

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
we receive two different tones as both

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.399 
we receive two different tones as both
precious<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.829> non<00:01:38.070> precious<00:01:38.900> now<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.170> am

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
precious and non precious now I am

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.620 
precious and non precious now I am
turning<00:01:40.680> off<00:01:40.950> non-precious<00:01:41.670> metals<00:01:42.119> option

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
turning off non-precious metals option

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.130 
turning off non-precious metals option
using<00:01:43.110> IV<00:01:43.470> filtering<00:01:43.979> feature<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.820> device

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.590 

and<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:48.310> am<00:01:48.520> making<00:01:48.850> another<00:01:49.000> pass<00:01:50.250> as<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:52.450> can

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
and I am making another pass as you can

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.450 
and I am making another pass as you can
see<00:01:52.810> we<00:01:53.050> eliminated<00:01:53.590> non-precious<00:01:54.010> metals

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
see we eliminated non-precious metals

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.710 
see we eliminated non-precious metals
and<00:01:54.640> we<00:01:55.060> only<00:01:55.300> receive<00:01:55.720> tone<00:01:55.990> for<00:01:56.260> gold<00:01:56.470> now

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.719 

now<00:02:01.720> we<00:02:02.080> reactivate<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.950> ID<00:02:03.130> filtering

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
now we reactivate the ID filtering

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.700 
now we reactivate the ID filtering
feature<00:02:03.940> on<00:02:04.240> our<00:02:04.510> device<00:02:04.930> and<00:02:05.140> switch<00:02:05.500> the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
feature on our device and switch the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.800

device<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:06.250> another<00:02:06.580> mode<00:02:09.119> namely<00:02:10.119> two-tone

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
device to another mode namely two-tone

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.900 
device to another mode namely two-tone
mode<00:02:11.050> we<00:02:11.470> are<00:02:11.500> repeating<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.160> same<00:02:12.460> test<00:02:12.760> in

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
mode we are repeating the same test in

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.320 
mode we are repeating the same test in
this<00:02:13.209> mode<00:02:15.000> as<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:17.620> can<00:02:17.800> see<00:02:18.010> we<00:02:18.400> received<00:02:19.000> the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
this mode as you can see we received the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.150 
this mode as you can see we received the
different<00:02:19.690> tone<00:02:19.840> for<00:02:20.230> precious<00:02:20.560> cold<00:02:20.890> coin

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
different tone for precious cold coin

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.580 
different tone for precious cold coin
and<00:02:21.490> another<00:02:21.910> different<00:02:22.330> tone<00:02:22.510> for<00:02:22.840> iron<00:02:23.200> in

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
and another different tone for iron in

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.100 
and another different tone for iron in
the<00:02:23.800> two-tone<00:02:24.160> mode<00:02:24.459> now<00:02:25.420> we<00:02:25.780> are<00:02:25.900> eliminating

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
the two-tone mode now we are eliminating

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.380 
the two-tone mode now we are eliminating
non-precious<00:02:26.920> metals<00:02:27.400> by<00:02:27.550> activating<00:02:28.150> ID

and retrying the process as you can see

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.440 
and retrying the process as you can see
we<00:02:35.620> eliminated<00:02:36.190> non-precious<00:02:36.640> metals<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.239> we

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
we eliminated non-precious metals and we

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.790 
we eliminated non-precious metals and we
only<00:02:37.660> receive<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.530> tone<00:02:38.800> for<00:02:39.220> gold<00:02:39.430> now<00:02:43.800> now

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
only receive a tone for gold now now

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.960 
only receive a tone for gold now now
let's<00:02:45.250> make<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.640> bit<00:02:45.670> more<00:02:46.030> difficult

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
let's make it a bit more difficult

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.520 
let's make it a bit more difficult
we<00:02:48.970> created<00:02:49.330> an<00:02:49.570> overlapping<00:02:50.080> metal

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
we created an overlapping metal

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.650 
we created an overlapping metal
