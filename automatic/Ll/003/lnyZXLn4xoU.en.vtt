00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:14.199
 we have already seen how we represent the whole numbers in juti memory 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:15.219
 samos 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.650
 positional voting 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.860
 we use all are complement two after representing negative integers 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.789
 and the value of a good depends on its position 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.960
 so if the positions 0 or one or two 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.249
 3 4 n the value of a 

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:36.809
 resignation binary table positions 2 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.410
 elevated to the position 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.540
 one here the values 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.149
 2 to 0 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.879
 which is the position they want said 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.579
 and instead this one here 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.200
 its value that is 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.650
 two at two 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.730
 what is 2 raised to the position that we have 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.640
 but what about those numbers that also have a fractional part 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.640
 let's start by remembering something we learned in elementary school in the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.090
 elemental school 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:17.640
 when we represented firefighters in a decimal system like this 2418 eat 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.080
 29 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.090
 has a fractional part two tenths and 9 hundredths 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.100
 let's see in more detail what a world means in each of the positions 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.159
 of this number on the screen 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.140
 1 the first position has a value that spies at 0 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.939
 that added 1 one in this second position has a value that 10 to 1 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.490
 what is 10 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.619
 and a monkey in the third position is worth 10 room 3 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.260
 very well and what do they tell me 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.510
 of this number that is here 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.910
 or from this number that is here that are to the right of that point which the 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.630
 value of those good numbers following the same logic we say one here 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.210
 ou not here have a value that also depends on the position what is the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.740
 position of its tips 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.800
 this 8 is in position zero this position a position toxqui 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.609
 position 3 which position 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:14.759
 one here 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:15.979
 not worth 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:20.869
 10 kala minus 1 a tenth and one in this position of 9 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.319
 not in vain 10 at least 2 one hundredth 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.920
 well then it makes sense that we define the opposition of 1x1 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:35.969
 position minus one and this is the position minus two and so we perpetuate 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.969
 the convention that the value of a wedding possessions 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:39.989
 10 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.699
 the decimal system 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:43.730
 elevated to opposition 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.140
 de s de iz y cto 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.720
 and what do they tell me about that point in Spanish is a comma 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.969
 Well, that point 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:57.689
 content to call it the decimal point hello com to designate in Spanish 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.699
 very well we remember what we saw in school 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.179
 elementary 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:07.129
 but with binary numbers in a binary system the number could be represented 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.059
 A) Yes 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:11.459
 1 0 0 1 a point 1 0 1 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:13.830
 and what does this mean 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:21.130
 good if we define the positions as position zero 1 2 3 and position minus 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.460
 1-2 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.240
 - 3 we can say that motivate 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.800
 2 to 0 that the world here would be worth 2 to 1 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:35.829
 one here would be 2 to 2 and one equals two to 3 and I was left with those three 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.949
 good digits one here 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:43.279
 one here one here have values ​​that also depend on the minus position 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.469
 some less possible in the three 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:50.279
 well how does it motivate room -1 which is a means 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.389
 one in this position 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:59.589
 it would be worth 2 years ago that it is a quarter and this one from here the lithosphere -3 that 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:02.589
 it's a little paco 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:05.309
 we already see where the thing is going 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:09.699
 we can represent numbers that have a whole part and that have a part 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.289
 which is fractional in this way 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:14.659
 very well 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.120
 and this point 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.120
 well if we call the other point decimal point 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.430
 it is justice that we call this binary point 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.779
 little machinery 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:26.779
 in Spanish 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:29.930
 the value of this amount 3 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.270
 1 east 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.169
 an 8 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.430
 and this is 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.550
 a medium 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.939
 and this one here 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:45.469
 is an eighth and we add it and we know that number is 9 points 6 2 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:47.620
 decimal notation 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.030
 that's what this represents in binary 9 points 6 2 and with simat envelope and 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.160
 We have written our first issue with a fraction part
