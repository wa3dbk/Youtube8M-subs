demonstrate for you today how to set a

demonstrate for you today how to set a
body<00:00:10.860> grip<00:00:11.130> trap<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.270> a<00:00:12.750> 110<00:00:13.380> by<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.830> grip

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
body grip trap this is a 110 by the grip

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.980 
body grip trap this is a 110 by the grip
trap<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:15.030> reason<00:00:15.360> it's<00:00:15.510> called<00:00:15.600> the<00:00:15.840> body

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
trap the reason it's called the body

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.519 
trap the reason it's called the body
grip<00:00:16.260> trap<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.770> because<00:00:17.099> when<00:00:17.849> it<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.029> set<00:00:18.529> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
grip trap is because when it is set the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.679 
grip trap is because when it is set the
animal<00:00:19.890> goes<00:00:20.070> through<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.640> trap<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.300> it

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
animal goes through the trap and it

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.920 
animal goes through the trap and it
closes<00:00:22.110> down<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:23.390> catches<00:00:24.390> them<00:00:24.540> that<00:00:24.750> way

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
closes down and catches them that way

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.890 
closes down and catches them that way
the<00:00:25.710> idea<00:00:26.009> is<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.759> lethal<00:00:27.090> trap<00:00:27.329> and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
the idea is that it's a lethal trap and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.690 
the idea is that it's a lethal trap and
it<00:00:28.079> catches<00:00:28.259> them<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.009> base<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.489> head

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
it catches them the base of the head

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.160 
it catches them the base of the head
base<00:00:30.149> of<00:00:30.329> the<00:00:30.419> neck<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.070> causes<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> quick

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
base of the neck and causes a quick

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.810 
base of the neck and causes a quick
quick<00:00:34.170> kill<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.010> quick<00:00:35.190> humane<00:00:35.579> type

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
quick kill so it's a quick humane type

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.299 
quick kill so it's a quick humane type
of<00:00:35.970> trap<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.590> to<00:00:37.590> show<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.980> different

provides them what looks to be an
opening<00:01:45.890> for<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> animal<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.520> pass<00:01:47.849> through

opening for the animal to pass through
and<00:01:48.569> yet<00:01:48.750> they<00:01:48.899> will<00:01:49.020> catch<00:01:49.229> themselves<00:01:49.709> on

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
and yet they will catch themselves on

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.849 
and yet they will catch themselves on
that<00:01:49.859> on<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:51.420> dog<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:52.020> these<00:01:52.259> type<00:01:52.469> of<00:01:52.500> traps

that on the dog on these type of traps

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.249 
that on the dog on these type of traps
there<00:01:53.130> are<00:01:53.250> three<00:01:53.429> different<00:01:53.579> notches<00:01:54.259> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
there are three different notches the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.569 
there are three different notches the
first<00:01:55.469> notch<00:01:55.709> is<00:01:55.950> going<00:01:56.129> to<00:01:56.250> give<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
first notch is going to give the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.300 
first notch is going to give the
tightest<00:01:56.969> set<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.319> also<00:01:58.500> notice<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.009> it

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
tightest set you can also notice that it

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.580 
tightest set you can also notice that it
adjusts<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:01.079> trigger<00:02:01.530> wires<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.670> inside

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
adjusts the trigger wires to the inside

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.020 
adjusts the trigger wires to the inside
that<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.799> be<00:02:04.950> an<00:02:05.039> advantage<00:02:05.129> if<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.759> under

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
that can be an advantage if you under

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.089 
that can be an advantage if you under
set<00:02:06.239> in<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.479> current<00:02:06.840> where<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.679> animal<00:02:07.979> is

coming<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.610> they<00:02:09.329> will<00:02:09.539> hit<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.319> trigger<00:02:10.560> wire

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
coming up they will hit the trigger wire

these<00:02:13.739> traps<00:02:14.040> cool<00:02:14.340> very<00:02:14.879> quickly<00:02:15.349> sometimes

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
these traps cool very quickly sometimes

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.520 
these traps cool very quickly sometimes
you<00:02:16.680> can<00:02:16.829> miss<00:02:16.980> them<00:02:17.129> if<00:02:17.310> it's<00:02:17.459> not<00:02:17.640> set

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
you can miss them if it's not set

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.410 
you can miss them if it's not set
properly<00:02:19.670> if<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.730> get<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.269> outside

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
properly if you get to the outside

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.650 
properly if you get to the outside
setting<00:02:22.079> then<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.160> have<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.519> widest<00:02:23.849> base<00:02:24.090> on

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
setting then you have the widest base on

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.500 
setting then you have the widest base on
the<00:02:24.900> trap<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:26.250> when<00:02:26.519> it<00:02:26.670> has<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.970> widest<00:02:27.269> base

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
the trap and when it has the widest base

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.629 
the trap and when it has the widest base
its<00:02:28.170> more<00:02:28.440> stable<00:02:28.889> if<00:02:29.010> you're<00:02:29.160> setting<00:02:29.489> down

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:29.639 
its more stable if you're setting down

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.819 
its more stable if you're setting down
in<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.940> bottom<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.359> a<00:02:30.480> run<00:02:30.690> or<00:02:31.319> in<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.560> bottom

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
in the bottom of a run or in the bottom

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.780 
in the bottom of a run or in the bottom
of<00:02:31.889> the<00:02:31.950> creek<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:33.590> it's<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.280> trap<00:02:35.609> is

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
of the creek so it's it's the trap is

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.559 
of the creek so it's it's the trap is
less<00:02:36.000> tipping

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.470 

the<00:02:38.989> concept<00:02:39.439> with<00:02:39.560> ease<00:02:39.709> then<00:02:39.999> is<00:02:40.999> to<00:02:41.180> have<00:02:41.329> it

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
the concept with ease then is to have it

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.920 
the concept with ease then is to have it
set<00:02:41.659> like<00:02:41.689> so<00:02:42.129> what<00:02:43.129> I<00:02:43.159> like<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.430> do<00:02:43.730> is<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.719> just

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
set like so what I like to do is to just

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.489 
set like so what I like to do is to just
slightly<00:02:45.620> move<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:47.239> trigger<00:02:47.480> wire<00:02:47.749> so<00:02:48.469> that

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:48.499 
slightly move the trigger wire so that

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:51.369 
slightly move the trigger wire so that
it<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:48.980> still<00:02:49.219> set<00:02:49.489> which<00:02:50.389> you'll<00:02:50.599> notice<00:02:50.749> the

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
it is still set which you'll notice the

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.979 
it is still set which you'll notice the
movement<00:02:51.590> in<00:02:51.859> the<00:02:51.920> trigger<00:02:52.159> wire<00:02:52.599> that<00:02:53.599> is<00:02:53.780> so

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
movement in the trigger wire that is so

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.500 
movement in the trigger wire that is so
that<00:02:54.530> when<00:02:54.769> an<00:02:54.950> animal<00:02:55.310> confronts<00:02:56.090> this<00:02:56.239> with

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
that when an animal confronts this with

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.209 
that when an animal confronts this with
what<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.019> typically<00:02:57.439> their<00:02:57.620> nose<00:02:57.859> to<00:02:57.889> the

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.219 
what is typically their nose to the

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.759 
what is typically their nose to the
front<00:02:58.459> of<00:02:58.549> their<00:02:58.700> head<00:02:58.989> they<00:02:59.989> will<00:03:00.170> sense<00:03:00.500> that

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
front of their head they will sense that

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.099 
front of their head they will sense that
there's<00:03:01.129> some<00:03:01.400> movement<00:03:01.819> and<00:03:02.030> they<00:03:02.840> won't<00:03:03.049> be

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
there's some movement and they won't be

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.319 
there's some movement and they won't be
scared<00:03:03.439> to<00:03:03.530> push<00:03:03.680> on<00:03:03.889> through<00:03:04.099> if<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.939> is<00:03:05.090> set

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
scared to push on through if it is set

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.020 
scared to push on through if it is set
so<00:03:05.659> that<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.959> trigger<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.439> rigid<00:03:07.030> they

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
so that the trigger is rigid they

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.149 
so that the trigger is rigid they
confront<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:09.319> it<00:03:09.530> feels<00:03:09.680> like<00:03:09.889> it's

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
confront that and it feels like it's

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.240 
confront that and it feels like it's
hard<00:03:10.400> they<00:03:10.760> may<00:03:10.969> just<00:03:11.239> stop<00:03:11.959> back<00:03:12.560> off<00:03:12.829> or<00:03:13.129> go

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
hard they may just stop back off or go

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.439 
hard they may just stop back off or go
around<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:14.500> then<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.680> idea<00:03:16.010> is<00:03:16.310> that<00:03:17.150> when

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:17.449 
around and then the idea is that when

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.089 
around and then the idea is that when
the<00:03:17.569> animal<00:03:17.870> goes<00:03:18.019> through<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.650> fires<00:03:18.889> the

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
the animal goes through it fires the

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:30.400 
the animal goes through it fires the
trap<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.150> closes<00:03:20.540> on<00:03:20.629> them

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.470
