00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.049
 MÃ¶ller 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:13.799
 7 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.859
 so we are told Fro for the well-being 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.989
 the NATO usual certificate for advanced 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.869
 To fold first, the two kept to the left 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.060
 they parted like that 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.019
 and like Klatten here 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.430
 the character up and that just around 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.530
 and then you would have the tooth on it 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.120
 It just so happens 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.120
 you have to pay attention to the next step 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.650
 Graze the pages and work out how it looks like 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.050
 next 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.470
 this is part 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.990
 as influenced and fixed 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.470
 Left 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.290
 here to the front 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.980
 then percent is here on hold at the same time 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.320
 how comes to the right 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.610
 at last one did not divorce one up 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.740
 and it looks like this 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.750
 under cravings 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.750
 because the BlizzCon 20 is back 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.460
 and thus mostly completely undone give 2 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.040
 whose move and Uli I say 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.930
 to have the first or in the first one holds the whole nation 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.290
 it just works back it means the part comes here 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.490
 up 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.490
 the left and business law on 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 then you have it whole 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.650
 then it is quite good that we have two here if 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.650
 and we do the same as in the beginning just played that is 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.620
 Ling not that one here so the animal did not take 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.290
 and then strive with this newspaper 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.610
 how so 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.150
 and Claudius Kranz 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.120
 deletes the second goal by spite of complaints 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.919
 is an almost equal - salary 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.859
 Percent increases holding the solved down and 15 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.049
 that space has to do what we need to solve 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.299
 the defendant 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.239
 the band hall sponsor 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.429
 Clamp it down 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.429
 then that will often work and pulled up 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.409
 and to about Linz 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.429
 Quasthoff Toronto 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:34.249
 to the right 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:35.869
 after 7 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:39.989
 and now comes in 18 the Christian Democrat have made only backwards 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.419
 we have to be wrong about that 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.999
 and push the percent to the left for us 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:49.809
 at least 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.039
 Starting position brought
