 cheese cake is fast enough on the top 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.800
 at the same time sticky normand one can 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.860
 see that and not very very very firm 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.720
 now here I'll leave it in the oven 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.730
 of course the oven off for two 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.380
 hours then after leaving the 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.320
 cheesecake for at least two hours 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.960
 we can of course and now I have it 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.250
 put in the fridge for at least eight hours 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.110
 otherwise a whole night it will still be 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.940
 better in bigger more stolen was 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.270

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.270
 billion 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.500
 so after demolishing the cheesecake 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.550
 of his circle 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.870

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.570
 carefully on the listened with strawberries 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.680
 balls had to cut the strawberries into 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:32.600

 then concerning the mold 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.700
 finally the circle I used I do not 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.530
 would rather advise using a mold 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.040
 hinged is much more practical 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.390
 to take off the mold then for the 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.280

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.180
 let nature like that is very very 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.590
 good otherwise if not to convey the 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.650
 pour a little caramel over the 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.570
 chocolate or a blow him 13 for example 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.010
