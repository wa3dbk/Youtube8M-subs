this Riveter get that stock cool holder
off<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.560> had<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:11.040> bend<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.400> out<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.700> way

yeah<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.740> uses<00:01:14.460> those<00:01:14.670> Phillips<00:01:15.210> screws<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.170> I

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
yeah it uses those Phillips screws so I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.300 
yeah it uses those Phillips screws so I
kind<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.890> stripped<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.509> then<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:19.310> clean

everywhere<00:02:38.750> then<00:02:38.990> it<00:02:39.350> leaked<00:02:39.950> from<00:02:40.130> the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
everywhere then it leaked from the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.750 
everywhere then it leaked from the
dipstick<00:02:40.850> for<00:02:40.910> some<00:02:41.450> reason<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.580> people

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
dipstick for some reason you the people

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.090 
dipstick for some reason you the people
say<00:02:44.000> that's<00:02:44.060> back<00:02:44.630> pressure<00:02:44.960> but<00:02:45.410> I've<00:02:45.860> always

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
say that's back pressure but I've always

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.970 
say that's back pressure but I've always
changed<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:47.050> PVC<00:02:48.050> valve<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.620> everything

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
changed the PVC valve and everything

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.300 
changed the PVC valve and everything
cleaned<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:50.410> that's<00:02:51.410> probably<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:52.070> valve

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
cleaned it that's probably the valve

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.480 
cleaned it that's probably the valve
cover<00:02:52.780> even<00:02:53.780> gluing<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.320> down<00:02:54.350> doesn't<00:02:55.220> help

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
cover even gluing it down doesn't help

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.630 
cover even gluing it down doesn't help
enough<00:02:55.820> I<00:02:56.060> got<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.390> broken<00:02:56.660> bolt<00:02:57.340> valve<00:02:58.340> cover

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
enough I got a broken bolt valve cover

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.120 
enough I got a broken bolt valve cover
bolt<00:02:58.940> down<00:02:59.150> there<00:02:59.360> so<00:02:59.510> that<00:02:59.540> didn't<00:02:59.960> help<00:03:00.140> and

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.990 

and<00:03:04.130> see<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.760> probably<00:03:05.720> can't<00:03:05.989> see<00:03:07.000> there's

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
and see you probably can't see there's

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.970 
and see you probably can't see there's
metal<00:03:08.630> shavings<00:03:08.930> back<00:03:09.500> here

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
metal shavings back here

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.940 
metal shavings back here
that's<00:03:10.220> from<00:03:10.459> there<00:03:11.260> sure<00:03:12.260> that's<00:03:12.530> from<00:03:12.709> the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
that's from there sure that's from the

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.479 
that's from there sure that's from the
flywheel<00:03:13.670> starter<00:03:14.420> months<00:03:14.860> got<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:15.920> real<00:03:16.280> bad

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
flywheel starter months got a real bad

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.740 
flywheel starter months got a real bad
spot<00:03:17.170> so<00:03:18.170> uh<00:03:18.610> now<00:03:19.610> I<00:03:19.640> need<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.820> new<00:03:19.910> clutch<00:03:20.270> but

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
spot so uh now I need a new clutch but

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.240 
spot so uh now I need a new clutch but
right<00:03:20.959> now<00:03:21.140> I'm<00:03:21.410> just<00:03:21.590> worried<00:03:21.830> about<00:03:21.920> getting

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
right now I'm just worried about getting

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.210 
right now I'm just worried about getting
the<00:03:22.489> engineer<00:03:22.910> started<00:03:23.870> up<00:03:24.200> break<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.070> in

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
the engineer started up break it in

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.390 
the engineer started up break it in
drive<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.330> for<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:26.540> few<00:03:26.750> miles<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.320> then<00:03:27.620> uh<00:03:27.650> it

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
drive it for a few miles and then uh it

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.250 
drive it for a few miles and then uh it
doesn't<00:03:28.760> bother<00:03:28.880> me<00:03:29.060> I'll<00:03:29.330> just<00:03:29.630> drop<00:03:30.020> the

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
doesn't bother me I'll just drop the

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.350 
doesn't bother me I'll just drop the
transmission<00:03:30.950> again<00:03:31.070> plus<00:03:31.970> I'll<00:03:32.120> probably

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
transmission again plus I'll probably

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.729 
transmission again plus I'll probably
anything<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.930> think<00:03:32.989> I<00:03:33.200> need<00:03:33.350> to<00:03:33.380> get<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.590> new

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
anything I think I need to get a new

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.280 
anything I think I need to get a new
input<00:03:33.920> shaft<00:03:34.430> because<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:34.870> test<00:03:35.870> fit<00:03:36.080> of<00:03:36.110> that

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
input shaft because I test fit of that

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.310 
input shaft because I test fit of that
input<00:03:36.500> bearing<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.850> just<00:03:38.510> goes<00:03:39.080> right

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
input bearing and it just goes right

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.640 
input bearing and it just goes right
over<00:03:39.380> that<00:03:39.650> input<00:03:40.160> shaft<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:41.530> doesn't<00:03:42.530> really

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
over that input shaft and doesn't really

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.949 
over that input shaft and doesn't really
fit<00:03:43.130> on<00:03:43.370> it<00:03:43.550> I<00:03:43.760> don't<00:03:44.239> know<00:03:44.480> if<00:03:44.630> it's<00:03:44.780> supposed

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
fit on it I don't know if it's supposed

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.250 
fit on it I don't know if it's supposed
to<00:03:45.050> be<00:03:45.200> semi<00:03:46.040> tight<00:03:46.340> tight<00:03:46.820> or<00:03:47.150> loose<00:03:47.450> like<00:03:48.080> it

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
to be semi tight tight or loose like it

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.170 
to be semi tight tight or loose like it
was<00:03:48.459> so<00:03:49.459> I'll<00:03:49.550> probably<00:03:49.700> have<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:49.970> order

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
was so I'll probably have to order

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
was so I'll probably have to order
another<00:03:50.380> input<00:03:51.380> shaft<00:03:51.860> and<00:03:52.310> then<00:03:53.150> other<00:03:54.050> than

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
another input shaft and then other than

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.199 
another input shaft and then other than
that<00:03:54.320> other<00:03:54.560> than<00:03:54.800> they're<00:03:55.070> a<00:03:55.370> little<00:03:56.000> bit<00:03:56.120> of

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
that other than they're a little bit of

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.050 
that other than they're a little bit of
low<00:03:56.390> leakage<00:03:56.600> and<00:03:57.019> it<00:03:57.739> does<00:03:58.010> burn<00:03:58.610> a<00:03:58.670> little

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
low leakage and it does burn a little

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.670 
low leakage and it does burn a little
last<00:03:59.239> time<00:03:59.420> I<00:03:59.450> did<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.780> compression<00:04:00.290> check<00:04:00.470> it

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
last time I did the compression check it

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.180 
last time I did the compression check it
was<00:04:00.830> 160<00:04:01.519> on<00:04:01.640> all<00:04:01.790> four<00:04:02.060> cylinders<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:03.650> a

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
was 160 on all four cylinders so a

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.199 
was 160 on all four cylinders so a
rebuild<00:04:04.910> would<00:04:05.480> not<00:04:05.720> hurt

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.580 

that's<00:04:09.760> it's<00:04:10.760> out<00:04:11.030> I'm<00:04:11.870> not<00:04:12.109> really<00:04:12.140> gonna

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
that's it's out I'm not really gonna

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.520 
that's it's out I'm not really gonna
miss<00:04:12.859> her<00:04:13.040> one<00:04:13.909> thing<00:04:14.060> I<00:04:14.150> did<00:04:14.359> do<00:04:14.569> I<00:04:14.780> used<00:04:15.200> I

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
miss her one thing I did do I used I

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.759 
miss her one thing I did do I used I
used<00:04:15.859> the<00:04:16.459> bracket<00:04:17.030> after<00:04:17.120> 1.3<00:04:17.900> alternator

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
used the bracket after 1.3 alternator

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.620 
used the bracket after 1.3 alternator
cuz<00:04:19.070> it's<00:04:19.280> actual<00:04:20.769> steel<00:04:21.769> welded<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:23.240> I've

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
cuz it's actual steel welded and I've

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.180 
cuz it's actual steel welded and I've
looked<00:04:23.870> cleaner<00:04:24.199> and<00:04:24.410> it<00:04:24.500> weighed<00:04:24.650> a<00:04:24.680> lot<00:04:24.800> less

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
looked cleaner and it weighed a lot less

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.480 
looked cleaner and it weighed a lot less
than<00:04:25.220> this<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.789> guess<00:04:26.120> is<00:04:26.330> cast<00:04:26.630> steel<00:04:26.900> so<00:04:27.800> it

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
than this I guess is cast steel so it

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.640 
than this I guess is cast steel so it
bolted<00:04:28.820> up<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.180> only<00:04:29.330> difference<00:04:29.690> is<00:04:29.900> is<00:04:30.199> this

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
bolted up the only difference is is this

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.620 
bolted up the only difference is is this
third<00:04:30.919> hole<00:04:31.130> you'll<00:04:31.490> just<00:04:31.699> have<00:04:31.850> to<00:04:32.090> on<00:04:32.479> that

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
third hole you'll just have to on that

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.710 
third hole you'll just have to on that
1.3<00:04:33.080> but<00:04:33.919> it<00:04:34.430> works<00:04:34.639> just<00:04:34.850> fine<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.330> obviously

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
1.3 but it works just fine and obviously

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.529 
1.3 but it works just fine and obviously
you<00:04:36.530> can<00:04:36.710> still<00:04:36.979> use<00:04:37.190> this<00:04:37.430> one<00:04:37.699> it's<00:04:38.000> just<00:04:38.270> a

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
you can still use this one it's just a

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:43.860 
you can still use this one it's just a
little<00:04:38.930> bit<00:04:39.050> different<00:04:39.729> then<00:04:40.729> I<00:04:40.759> had<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.180> really

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
little bit different then I had a really

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.150 
little bit different then I had a really
Riis<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:45.130> clutch<00:04:45.840> cable<00:04:46.840> bracket<00:04:47.170> mine

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
Riis the clutch cable bracket mine

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.400 
Riis the clutch cable bracket mine
wasn't<00:04:48.490> automatic<00:04:49.030> take<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:50.110> off<00:04:50.230> at

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
wasn't automatic take that off at

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.390 
wasn't automatic take that off at
voltage<00:04:50.740> right<00:04:50.920> on<00:04:51.100> I<00:04:52.020> use<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.200> 1.6<00:04:53.800> outlet

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400

table<00:04:54.820> and<00:04:54.940> head<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.210> use<00:04:55.480> it<00:04:57.030> other<00:04:58.030> than

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
table and head and use it other than

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.070 
table and head and use it other than
that<00:04:58.360> and<00:04:58.660> then<00:04:58.990> I<00:04:59.140> got<00:04:59.320> a<00:04:59.380> had<00:04:59.860> to<00:04:59.890> use<00:05:00.190> the

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
that and then I got a had to use the

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.480 
that and then I got a had to use the
bulbs<00:05:02.080> off<00:05:02.230> this<00:05:02.410> water<00:05:02.680> pump<00:05:02.920> and<00:05:03.190> then<00:05:03.310> I'll

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
bulbs off this water pump and then I'll

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.330 
bulbs off this water pump and then I'll
take<00:05:03.790> this<00:05:04.090> off<00:05:04.390> and<00:05:04.690> use<00:05:05.560> it<00:05:05.770> that's<00:05:05.920> still

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
take this off and use it that's still

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.520 
take this off and use it that's still
good<00:05:06.640> it's<00:05:06.820> not<00:05:06.940> that<00:05:07.150> old

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
good it's not that old

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.500 
good it's not that old
the<00:05:08.530> one<00:05:08.710> that's<00:05:08.860> in<00:05:09.040> it's<00:05:09.250> all<00:05:09.460> corroded<00:05:10.120> a

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
the one that's in it's all corroded a

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.690 
the one that's in it's all corroded a
little<00:05:10.750> bit<00:05:11.130> other<00:05:12.130> than<00:05:12.280> that<00:05:12.460> I<00:05:12.490> don't

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
little bit other than that I don't

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.730 
little bit other than that I don't
really<00:05:12.850> have<00:05:13.060> to<00:05:13.240> take<00:05:13.600> off<00:05:13.840> a<00:05:13.870> lot<00:05:14.290> and<00:05:14.530> the

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
really have to take off a lot and the

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.410 
really have to take off a lot and the
kit<00:05:14.980> says<00:05:15.250> you<00:05:15.430> don't<00:05:15.520> have<00:05:15.670> to<00:05:15.820> reuse<00:05:16.060> these

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
kit says you don't have to reuse these

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.570 
kit says you don't have to reuse these
dowel<00:05:16.720> pins<00:05:17.080> or<00:05:17.350> anything<00:05:17.530> so<00:05:18.040> that's<00:05:18.280> pretty

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
dowel pins or anything so that's pretty

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.160 
dowel pins or anything so that's pretty
neat

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
neat

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.550 
neat
the<00:05:20.170> only<00:05:20.320> other<00:05:20.530> thing<00:05:20.890> is<00:05:21.900> since<00:05:22.900> a<00:05:23.020> spacer

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
the only other thing is since a spacer

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.400 
the only other thing is since a spacer
is<00:05:24.220> about<00:05:24.670> three<00:05:24.880> times<00:05:25.060> as<00:05:25.270> thick<00:05:25.570> as<00:05:25.870> the

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
is about three times as thick as the

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.580 
is about three times as thick as the
stock<00:05:26.710> spacer<00:05:27.960> I'm<00:05:28.960> wondering<00:05:29.380> how<00:05:29.530> that

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
stock spacer I'm wondering how that

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.020 
stock spacer I'm wondering how that
affects<00:05:30.190> the<00:05:30.430> input<00:05:30.910> shaft<00:05:31.120> going<00:05:31.810> into<00:05:32.140> the

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
affects the input shaft going into the

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.880 
affects the input shaft going into the
flywheel<00:05:34.030> if<00:05:34.510> that<00:05:34.780> if<00:05:34.930> it<00:05:35.110> pulls<00:05:35.350> it<00:05:35.530> out<00:05:35.650> too

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
flywheel if that if it pulls it out too

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.070 
flywheel if that if it pulls it out too
much<00:05:36.130> or<00:05:36.340> not<00:05:36.520> but<00:05:36.790> I<00:05:36.820> guess<00:05:37.750> it<00:05:37.900> doesn't

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
much or not but I guess it doesn't

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.600 
much or not but I guess it doesn't
affect<00:05:38.440> it<00:05:38.530> too<00:05:38.710> much<00:05:38.950> since<00:05:39.220> everyone's

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
affect it too much since everyone's

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.740 
affect it too much since everyone's
running<00:05:39.850> the<00:05:40.090> kit<00:05:40.560> huh<00:05:44.460> it<00:05:45.460> uh<00:05:45.670> it<00:05:46.330> came<00:05:46.540> out

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
running the kit huh it uh it came out

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.320 
running the kit huh it uh it came out
pretty<00:05:46.900> easy<00:05:47.200> just<00:05:47.980> after<00:05:48.310> I<00:05:48.340> remember<00:05:48.820> to<00:05:48.940> let

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
pretty easy just after I remember to let

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.280 
pretty easy just after I remember to let
the<00:05:49.510> flywheel<00:05:49.960> desk<00:05:50.260> I<00:05:50.440> run<00:05:50.710> it<00:05:51.630> but<00:05:52.630> uh<00:05:52.660> no

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
the flywheel desk I run it but uh no

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.890 
the flywheel desk I run it but uh no
pulls<00:05:53.860> out<00:05:54.010> just<00:05:54.250> fine<00:05:54.370> and<00:05:54.670> then<00:05:55.420> I<00:05:55.480> when<00:05:55.870> I

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
pulls out just fine and then I when I

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.170 
pulls out just fine and then I when I
put<00:05:56.230> it<00:05:56.350> in<00:05:56.500> believe<00:05:56.890> it<00:05:57.010> or<00:05:57.130> not<00:05:57.280> that<00:05:57.340> thing<00:05:57.850> I

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
put it in believe it or not that thing I

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.690 
put it in believe it or not that thing I
don't<00:05:58.450> even<00:05:58.510> have<00:05:58.780> to<00:05:58.960> adjust<00:05:59.260> the<00:05:59.700> input

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
don't even have to adjust the input

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.610 
don't even have to adjust the input
shaft<00:06:00.910> nothing<00:06:01.480> the<00:06:01.600> thing<00:06:01.840> after<00:06:02.170> we<00:06:02.320> got<00:06:02.470> the

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
shaft nothing the thing after we got the

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.590 
shaft nothing the thing after we got the
studs<00:06:02.950> in<00:06:03.160> it<00:06:03.190> just<00:06:03.550> slipped<00:06:03.820> right<00:06:03.970> on<00:06:04.240> so

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
studs in it just slipped right on so

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.710 
studs in it just slipped right on so
maybe<00:06:05.050> I<00:06:05.200> got<00:06:05.410> lucky<00:06:05.620> I<00:06:06.010> don't<00:06:06.940> know<00:06:07.030> but<00:06:07.540> uh<00:06:07.570> I

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
maybe I got lucky I don't know but uh I

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.060 
maybe I got lucky I don't know but uh I
didn't<00:06:08.410> have<00:06:08.470> to<00:06:08.590> fart<00:06:08.860> with<00:06:08.980> the

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
didn't have to fart with the

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.390 
didn't have to fart with the
transmission<00:06:09.580> to<00:06:09.790> nothing<00:06:10.150> and<00:06:11.040> all<00:06:12.040> I<00:06:12.190> did

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
transmission to nothing and all I did

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.980 
transmission to nothing and all I did
was<00:06:12.550> just<00:06:12.700> support<00:06:13.180> it<00:06:13.240> on<00:06:13.360> a<00:06:13.390> block<00:06:13.720> and<00:06:13.900> a

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
was just support it on a block and a

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.700 
was just support it on a block and a
jack<00:06:14.260> you<00:06:14.590> just<00:06:14.770> kept<00:06:15.010> your<00:06:15.070> level<00:06:15.810> just<00:06:16.810> stuck

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
jack you just kept your level just stuck

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.640 
jack you just kept your level just stuck
the<00:06:17.830> engine<00:06:18.100> on<00:06:18.190> it<00:06:18.510> yeah<00:06:19.510> now<00:06:20.080> I<00:06:20.110> just<00:06:20.230> got<00:06:20.530> to

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
the engine on it yeah now I just got to

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.770 
the engine on it yeah now I just got to
mess<00:06:20.800> with<00:06:20.980> the<00:06:21.070> mounts<00:06:21.430> and<00:06:22.150> get<00:06:22.270> the<00:06:22.420> fuel

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
mess with the mounts and get the fuel

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.050 
mess with the mounts and get the fuel
lines<00:06:23.020> hooked<00:06:23.290> up<00:06:23.560> and<00:06:23.830> then<00:06:24.010> I'll<00:06:24.730> do<00:06:24.970> the

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
lines hooked up and then I'll do the

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.300 
lines hooked up and then I'll do the
wire<00:06:25.240> harness<00:06:25.630> last<00:06:25.870> since<00:06:26.410> I<00:06:26.560> got<00:06:26.680> to<00:06:26.830> do<00:06:26.980> a

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
wire harness last since I got to do a

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.360 
wire harness last since I got to do a
few<00:06:27.670> extra<00:06:27.880> things<00:06:28.000> to<00:06:28.330> it<00:06:28.560> but<00:06:29.560> uh<00:06:29.590> and<00:06:30.100> then<00:06:30.280> I

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
few extra things to it but uh and then I

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.680 
few extra things to it but uh and then I
got<00:06:30.550> to<00:06:30.670> figure<00:06:31.060> out<00:06:31.090> where<00:06:31.270> I'm<00:06:31.360> gonna<00:06:31.480> put

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
got to figure out where I'm gonna put

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.630 
got to figure out where I'm gonna put
the<00:06:32.250> the<00:06:33.960> the<00:06:34.960> charcoal<00:06:35.410> canister<00:06:35.680> the<00:06:36.340> stock

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:36.640 
the the the charcoal canister the stock

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.380 
the the the charcoal canister the stock
tractor<00:06:37.330> it<00:06:37.390> fit<00:06:37.660> right<00:06:37.870> here<00:06:38.190> I<00:06:39.190> guess<00:06:40.000> I'll

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
tractor it fit right here I guess I'll

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.590 
tractor it fit right here I guess I'll
try<00:06:40.630> to<00:06:40.720> make<00:06:40.990> it<00:06:41.170> fit<00:06:41.620> I<00:06:42.100> don't<00:06:42.700> know<00:06:42.850> I'll<00:06:43.420> get

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
try to make it fit I don't know I'll get

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.120 
try to make it fit I don't know I'll get
the<00:06:43.690> radiator<00:06:44.020> and<00:06:44.290> see<00:06:44.530> what<00:06:44.680> it<00:06:44.770> looks<00:06:44.920> like

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
the radiator and see what it looks like

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.880 
the radiator and see what it looks like
and<00:06:46.000> then<00:06:46.270> I<00:06:46.300> guess<00:06:46.930> I'll<00:06:47.110> chop<00:06:47.470> this<00:06:47.680> off

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:47.890 
and then I guess I'll chop this off

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.190 
and then I guess I'll chop this off
because<00:06:48.130> I'm<00:06:48.370> gonna<00:06:48.550> reuse<00:06:48.880> the<00:06:49.150> stock<00:06:49.900> airbox
