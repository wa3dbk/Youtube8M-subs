friggin tails out of it I can get basic
functionality<00:05:02.140> out<00:05:02.290> of<00:05:02.440> it<00:05:02.560> like<00:05:02.860> you<00:05:03.340> know

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
functionality out of it like you know

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.180 
functionality out of it like you know
texts<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.570> things<00:05:05.350> like<00:05:05.560> that<00:05:05.800> but

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
texts and things like that but

everything you have to do is sort of

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.200 
everything you have to do is sort of
counterintuitive<00:05:09.100> you<00:05:09.640> have<00:05:09.790> to<00:05:09.880> go<00:05:10.000> round

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
counterintuitive you have to go round

and around in circles two or three times

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.220 
and around in circles two or three times
before<00:05:12.340> it<00:05:12.640> spots<00:05:12.970> what<00:05:13.150> you've<00:05:13.270> done<00:05:13.450> even<00:05:14.140> if

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
before it spots what you've done even if

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.080 
before it spots what you've done even if
those<00:05:14.440> three<00:05:14.770> or<00:05:14.830> four<00:05:14.980> times<00:05:15.190> you<00:05:15.460> do<00:05:15.610> exactly

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
those three or four times you do exactly

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.870 
those three or four times you do exactly
the<00:05:16.419> same<00:05:16.450> process<00:05:17.290> over<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:18.250> over<00:05:18.430> and<00:05:18.760> over

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
the same process over and over and over

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.720 
the same process over and over and over
again<00:05:19.120> and<00:05:19.419> the<00:05:19.600> fine<00:05:19.840> it<00:05:20.020> goes<00:05:20.169> oh<00:05:20.380> oh<00:05:20.650> good<00:05:21.550> it

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
again and the fine it goes oh oh good it

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.000 
again and the fine it goes oh oh good it
I<00:05:21.910> mean<00:05:22.570> seriously<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:23.110> logical<00:05:23.620> lack<00:05:23.830> of

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
I mean seriously the logical lack of

I mean seriously the logical lack of
logic<00:05:24.100> on<00:05:24.400> this<00:05:24.550> thing<00:05:24.760> is<00:05:24.880> more<00:05:25.030> twisted<00:05:25.419> than

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
logic on this thing is more twisted than

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.710 
logic on this thing is more twisted than
