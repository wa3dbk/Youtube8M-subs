the<00:00:44.100> thickness<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.640> believe<00:00:44.930> then<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.989> just

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the thickness I believe then you just

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.540 
the thickness I believe then you just
cut<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.379> with<00:00:46.469> scissors<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.010> then<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.430> get

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
cut it with scissors and then you get

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.540 
cut it with scissors and then you get
some<00:00:47.879> jb<00:00:48.300> weld<00:00:48.450> which<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.870> epoxy<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.399> not

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
some jb weld which is epoxy but it's not

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.250 
some jb weld which is epoxy but it's not
just<00:00:50.670> regular<00:00:50.850> epoxy<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.660> high-temperature

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
just regular epoxy it's high-temperature

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.590 
just regular epoxy it's high-temperature
epoxy<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.070> called<00:00:53.250> jb<00:00:53.699> weld<00:00:54.140> that<00:00:55.140> goes<00:00:55.440> on

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
epoxy it's called jb weld that goes on

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.020 
epoxy it's called jb weld that goes on
very<00:00:57.800> liberally<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:59.100> over<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.579> place<00:00:59.789> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030

to put some black RTV silicone around it
around<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.080> water<00:01:19.350> part<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> two<00:01:20.490> sides

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
around the water part so the two sides

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.539 
around the water part so the two sides
there<00:01:21.000> water<00:01:21.299> water<00:01:22.200> put<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.130> around<00:01:23.369> there

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
you need to seal the water part because

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.560 
you need to seal the water part because
it<00:01:28.950> always<00:01:29.100> leaks<00:01:29.430> from<00:01:29.579> there<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.030> then

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
it always leaks from there and then

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.850 
it always leaks from there and then

you<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.280> get<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.750> gasket<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.899> stick<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.409> that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
you can get the gasket to stick in that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.850 
you can get the gasket to stick in that
place<00:01:49.890> while<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.700> put<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> new<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.860> so

I<00:02:36.020> think<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:37.610> old<00:02:37.760> Chrysler<00:02:38.120> one<00:02:38.480> has<00:02:38.660> this

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
I think the old Chrysler one has this

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.100 
I think the old Chrysler one has this
right<00:02:39.110> here<00:02:39.350> which<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.740> tube<00:02:40.510> for<00:02:41.510> outlet

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
right here which is a tube for outlet

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.010 
right here which is a tube for outlet
for<00:02:42.290> water<00:02:42.500> for<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.920> heater<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.840> new<00:02:44.840> one

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
for water for the heater the new one

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.480 
for water for the heater the new one
didn't<00:02:45.470> have<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.040> new<00:02:46.130> one<00:02:46.280> had<00:02:46.460> a

didn't have that the new one had a

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.700 
didn't have that the new one had a
larger<00:02:46.910> size<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.540> larger<00:02:47.900> size<00:02:48.080> is<00:02:48.350> not<00:02:48.500> gonna

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
larger size and larger size is not gonna

hex head on it to get it off so I'm not

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.970 
hex head on it to get it off so I'm not
sure<00:02:58.970> what<00:02:59.060> I'm<00:02:59.150> gonna<00:02:59.240> do<00:02:59.680> what<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:00.710> think<00:03:00.800> I'm

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
sure what I'm gonna do what I think I'm

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.710 
sure what I'm gonna do what I think I'm
gonna<00:03:01.070> do<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.400> use<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.730> 5/8<00:03:02.090> one<00:03:02.240> that<00:03:02.390> came<00:03:02.540> on

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
gonna do is use the 5/8 one that came on

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.650 
gonna do is use the 5/8 one that came on
the<00:03:02.810> intake<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.910> get<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:04.940> reducer<00:03:05.510> it's<00:03:05.630> a

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
the intake and get a reducer it's a

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.950 
the intake and get a reducer it's a
little<00:03:05.870> plastic<00:03:06.080> coupling<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.480> 5/8<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.840> with

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
little plastic coupling so 5/8 it with

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.500 
little plastic coupling so 5/8 it with
some<00:03:09.110> 5/8<00:03:09.470> tubing<00:03:09.890> then<00:03:10.700> use<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.030> adapter

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
some 5/8 tubing then use the adapter

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.390 
some 5/8 tubing then use the adapter
then<00:03:12.110> go<00:03:12.200> back<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.500> 1/2<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.950> then<00:03:13.010> that'll<00:03:13.250> go

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
then go back to 1/2 and then that'll go

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.729 
then go back to 1/2 and then that'll go
into<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.870> has<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.140> go<00:03:15.260> over<00:03:15.440> here<00:03:15.590> into

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
into the that has to go over here into

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.610 
into the that has to go over here into
the<00:03:15.890> heater<00:03:16.300> thing<00:03:17.300> right<00:03:18.700> there<00:03:20.440> all<00:03:21.440> right

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
the heater thing right there all right

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.930 
the heater thing right there all right
well<00:03:21.770> I'm<00:03:21.830> gonna<00:03:21.920> start<00:03:22.160> reassembly<00:03:22.580> now<00:03:22.700> so

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
well I'm gonna start reassembly now so

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.330 
well I'm gonna start reassembly now so
here<00:03:23.239> it<00:03:23.300> goes
