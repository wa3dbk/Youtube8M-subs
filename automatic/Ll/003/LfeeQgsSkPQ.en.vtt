00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.900
 but we continue our journey within energy sources 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.149
 renewable in the company of der lizenz inette managing director of each 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.840
 comfort to you first of all thank you for hosting your network your company operates 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.949
 for 50 years in this 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.050
 sector wants to tell us what your specifications are 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.280
 our company, the company that at 50 years of history liked at 50 years takes care of 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.810
 of energy valorisation 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.259
 of what today is a famous term that sharpened biomass 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.259
 specifically the energy valorization mentioned 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.150
 solid wastes of agricultural products therefore specifically or waste wood 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.600
 mainly 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.390
 pruning and urban green waste 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.700
 and wood of the various forms skin barks. 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.900
 he is entrusted with these products and we buy from 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.960
 produce energy that can be electricity 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.070
 Thermal 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.850
 with two two two cornerstones in the most efficient way then produce the 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.569
 most data is possible 

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:01.159
 and in an ecological way then. by minimizing emissions into 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.820
 atmosphere that are released by these plants 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.930
 this is why the kyoto protocol among other things obliged to reduce the emission 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.909
 of this 2 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.449
 in the atmosphere, however, we know that you have wood is a material 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.240
 I have 2 October 3 in fact it is we say to that point of view the source 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.360
 renewable for excellence because wood 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.530
 the high school mail 2 that release the combustion process meanwhile is 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.430
 the one that stored the plant of its life cycle 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.480
 and in any case the quantity that would still be issued if the wood 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.439
 was left 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.580
 a kiss on the territory was used for other purposes 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.890
 therefore the use of wood as an energy source is for certain loves 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.570
 hell way to close the circle race 2 then in wood that is minolta ancestors 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.170
 to the primary energy source today was only to use 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.930
 that source we say old 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.720
 labrodor winemaking and mobile energy and an even more ecological way 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.340
 at night also a material that is readily available of that surprise 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.440
 also team 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.880
 exact this is an important point because often the conception 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.479
 wood plant 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.800
 sideral the idea that the need to move the woodland throw it down the plants 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.390
 via woodwinds for our dishes see the bought of the maintenance of the 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.569
 territory that otherwise would not have done 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.260
 it is recovered with an installation where maybe we will talk about it later from 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.969
 bale pruning of olive trees pruning the vines therefore it is 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.560
 an important material that all of Italy donated is Italic 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.499
 but everywhere I repeat 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:30.479
 is a material that laughs produced by the maintenance of the territory not from 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:35.479
 deforestation I have this idea is a bit apocalyptic that often come 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.699
 pass our sector 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.900
 it is important to pass this message that it is therefore a 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:45.289
 waste material in quotation marks that comes. also forestry activity 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:49.159
 investigates this beautiful prediction that we see here is a new project of that i 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.679
 consortia is accupannu 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:52.460
 he wants to tell us about euros 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.810
 about the rejection of our new store lol iris the redemption of the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.639
 state 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.880
 for what we are trying to do just to give 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.859
 a new life what the Roman hotel discards 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.770
 this plant, as born, was born in Puglia 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.470
 doin also in cyan incredible availability of pruning the olive trees finished 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.789
 olive tree maintenance 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:15.469
 which are currently used as they had burned us then fields with 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:17.599
 pollution problems 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.889
 and obviously without powers to be exploited from the energy point of view 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.759
 this plant therefore starts from the combustion of these by olive tree pruning 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.879
 and from the combustion he could of the olive was produced electricity that 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.239
 laughs then put on the net 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.379
 of the network we say elettrical and is managed by hyenas 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:38.120
 which then produces thermal energy worth of this forklift truck plant 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.069
 heating 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.489
 so the concept of state of the state is what was a gap that before 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.169
 was abandoned in the field and create cost problems as the name implies 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.339
 combustivel produce electrical energy keith thermal energy there 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:52.079
 for the use of the country 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.819
 specifically the plant of the municipality of Calimera is one of the series plants that 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:56.780
 we are doing 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.839
 in Italy 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:01.579
 always starting from the local biomass here come to Puglia we will leave from 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:02.769
 olive tree pruning 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.909
 re where there is on dvd we will bring you the pruning of vineyards where the woods are 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.669
 we will bring the maintenance of the woods here for you I give it a local resource 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.009
 available on site 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:16.079
 - still ecological for another region which is products like saying a 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.220
 kilometers the 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.779
 I was as shoes produced I try from the territory 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.779
 that is the basic philosophy of these plants because obviously 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.749
 from the ecological economic point of view the new material must be ready 

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:30.199
 shit that there should be transported 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.129
 from distant places we would fall the principle of the cer ecology code but that 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:35.669
 of economy 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.110
 of the plant have eigenvalues ​​carrying these plants which 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.960
 and allow you to keep the territory of added value in the sense that if 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.199
 this plant had to produce the same energy with oil and gas 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.840
 then the financial resources should be designed 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.900
 civita volley air pipeline spoiler 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.520
 in this case we see then to enhance a local resource 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.290
 pd we also believe that we are induced to say that the local economy is not working 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.000
 negligible
