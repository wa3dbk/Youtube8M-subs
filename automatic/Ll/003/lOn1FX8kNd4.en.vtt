00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
really exciting but it was also very

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.080 
really exciting but it was also very
very<00:00:58.090> challenging<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.760> know<00:01:00.880> if<00:01:00.940> you've<00:01:01.060> got

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
very challenging you know if you've got

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.960 
very challenging you know if you've got
to<00:01:01.300> make<00:01:01.450> a<00:01:01.480> city<00:01:02.250> where<00:01:03.250> do<00:01:03.340> you<00:01:03.399> begin<00:01:03.550> is

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
to make a city where do you begin is

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.209 
to make a city where do you begin is
just<00:01:04.890> usually<00:01:05.890> a<00:01:05.920> city<00:01:06.189> is<00:01:06.399> based<00:01:07.180> around

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
just usually a city is based around

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.950 
just usually a city is based around
ography<00:01:09.219> so<00:01:09.460> but<00:01:10.119> we<00:01:10.210> have<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.450> create<00:01:10.600> all<00:01:10.869> the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
ography so but we have to create all the

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.359 
ography so but we have to create all the
dream<00:01:11.109> photography<00:01:11.560> as<00:01:11.649> well<00:01:11.710> so<00:01:12.069> where<00:01:12.249> the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
hills go where all the mountains go

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.539 
hills go where all the mountains go
where<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.569> parts<00:01:17.109> of<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.289> city<00:01:17.469> goes<00:01:17.799> you

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
where the parts of the city goes you

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.340

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359 
so many different things to think of

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.749 
so many different things to think of
when<00:01:22.539> you're<00:01:22.630> creating<00:01:22.929> a<00:01:22.959> city<00:01:23.200> it's<00:01:23.759> it's

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
when you're creating a city it's it's

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.109 
when you're creating a city it's it's
pretty<00:01:25.030> daunting<00:01:25.209> task<00:01:26.459> there<00:01:27.459> the<00:01:27.579> team<00:01:27.819> did

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
pretty daunting task there the team did

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.379 
pretty daunting task there the team did
an<00:01:28.270> amazing<00:01:28.569> job<00:01:28.810> on<00:01:29.229> on<00:01:29.829> designing<00:01:30.549> it<00:01:30.729> the

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:31.389 
an amazing job on on designing it the

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:33.359 
an amazing job on on designing it the
road<00:01:31.600> layouts<00:01:32.079> just<00:01:32.679> all<00:01:32.829> these<00:01:32.950> things<00:01:33.249> you

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
road layouts just all these things you

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.849 
road layouts just all these things you
have<00:01:33.399> to<00:01:33.549> think<00:01:33.759> of<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:35.229> it<00:01:35.319> makes<00:01:35.499> sense<00:01:35.679> for

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:35.859 
have to think of so it makes sense for

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:36.989 
have to think of so it makes sense for
the<00:01:35.950> player<00:01:36.189> so<00:01:36.459> they<00:01:36.549> know<00:01:36.609> where<00:01:36.850> they're

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:36.999 
the player so they know where they're

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:38.010 
the player so they know where they're
going<00:01:37.149> and<00:01:37.420> so<00:01:37.630> on

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
going and so on

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.899 
going and so on
and<00:01:38.590> we<00:01:38.889> played<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.279> a<00:01:39.399> fair<00:01:39.579> amount<00:01:39.759> of<00:01:39.819> the

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
and we played it a fair amount of the

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.489 
and we played it a fair amount of the
game<00:01:40.090> so<00:01:40.299> far<00:01:40.329> and<00:01:40.600> we've<00:01:40.899> noticed<00:01:41.079> there's<00:01:41.439> a

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:41.499 
game so far and we've noticed there's a

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:43.889 
game so far and we've noticed there's a
lot<00:01:41.590> of<00:01:41.770> like<00:01:42.459> recognizable<00:01:43.209> landmarks<00:01:43.719> I

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
lot of like recognizable landmarks I

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.779 
lot of like recognizable landmarks I
think<00:01:44.109> there's<00:01:44.229> an<00:01:44.409> albatross<00:01:45.069> Island<00:01:45.639> in<00:01:45.759> the

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
think there's an albatross Island in the

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.999 
think there's an albatross Island in the
game<00:01:46.029> which<00:01:46.240> seems<00:01:46.929> to<00:01:47.079> be<00:01:47.200> inspired<00:01:47.590> by

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
game which seems to be inspired by

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.249 
game which seems to be inspired by
Alcatraz<00:01:48.549> he<00:01:49.479> tell<00:01:49.659> us<00:01:49.779> a<00:01:49.840> little<00:01:49.929> bit<00:01:50.049> more

Alcatraz he tell us a little bit more

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.449 
Alcatraz he tell us a little bit more
about<00:01:50.439> like<00:01:50.649> what<00:01:50.709> kind<00:01:50.979> of<00:01:51.009> landmarks

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
about like what kind of landmarks

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.089 
about like what kind of landmarks
inspire<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:52.060> legacy<00:01:52.599> yeah<00:01:53.560> we<00:01:53.740> definitely

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099 
inspire the legacy yeah we definitely

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:56.069 
inspire the legacy yeah we definitely
wanted<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.399> include<00:01:54.939> lots<00:01:55.359> of<00:01:55.479> recognizable

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
wanted to include lots of recognizable

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.820 
wanted to include lots of recognizable
places<00:01:56.200> in<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.859> city<00:01:57.069> when

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
places in the city when

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.850 
places in the city when
when<00:01:58.070> we<00:01:58.220> were<00:01:58.310> creating<00:01:58.760> it<00:01:58.910> so<00:01:59.150> we<00:01:59.360> did<00:01:59.860> we

separate<00:06:48.400> devices<00:06:48.670> it's<00:06:49.060> got<00:06:49.300> a<00:06:49.810> map<00:06:50.850> so<00:06:51.850> you

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
separate devices it's got a map so you

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.750 
separate devices it's got a map so you
can<00:06:52.060> need<00:06:52.420> to<00:06:52.720> have<00:06:53.350> a<00:06:53.380> look<00:06:53.530> around<00:06:53.560> so<00:06:53.980> to<00:06:54.160> set
