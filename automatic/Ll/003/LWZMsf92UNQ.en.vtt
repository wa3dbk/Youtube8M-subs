00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
villager now i don't know where this was

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.420 
villager now i don't know where this was
just<00:03:10.120> because<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.720> texture<00:03:11.590> itself<00:03:11.920> or<00:03:12.250> it

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
just because of the texture itself or it

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.120 
just because of the texture itself or it
was<00:03:12.670> actually<00:03:13.330> a<00:03:13.360> blacksmith<00:03:14.140> villager<00:03:14.650> so

was actually a blacksmith villager so

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.100 
was actually a blacksmith villager so
that<00:03:15.280> means<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.580> we<00:03:15.760> could<00:03:15.940> have<00:03:16.209> more<00:03:16.870> than

one villager available and if they do i

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.660 
one villager available and if they do i

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
wither boss painting i don't think that

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.700

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
they would have put this in there and

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.680 
they would have put this in there and
just<00:04:24.040> not<00:04:24.580> really<00:04:24.850> give<00:04:25.030> us<00:04:25.150> a<00:04:25.240> hint<00:04:25.419> that

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
just not really give us a hint that

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.810

there<00:04:25.870> will<00:04:26.020> be<00:04:26.169> a<00:04:26.200> wither<00:04:26.470> boss<00:04:26.590> but<00:04:27.580> they<00:04:27.700> are

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
there will be a wither boss but they are

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.640 
there will be a wither boss but they are
keeping<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.300> tight<00:04:28.660> lid<00:04:28.720> on<00:04:28.960> that<00:04:29.229> we've<00:04:29.440> not

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
keeping a tight lid on that we've not

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.529 
keeping a tight lid on that we've not

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
speculation about golden carrots but

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.920 
speculation about golden carrots but
when<00:04:47.130> we<00:04:47.250> did<00:04:47.460> see<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:47.760> creative<00:04:48.300> interface

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
and hovering over a carrot it confirm

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.930 
and hovering over a carrot it confirm
that<00:04:52.380> golden<00:04:52.800> carrots<00:04:53.190> will<00:04:53.460> be<00:04:53.610> available

that golden carrots will be available

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.300 
that golden carrots will be available
and<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:55.140> reason<00:04:55.410> why<00:04:55.500> people<00:04:55.680> really<00:04:56.100> didn't

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
and the reason why people really didn't

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.070 
and the reason why people really didn't
understand<00:04:56.820> if<00:04:56.970> they<00:04:57.090> would<00:04:57.300> be<00:04:57.450> introduced

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
understand if they would be introduced

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.410 
understand if they would be introduced
it's<00:04:58.710> because<00:04:59.070> when<00:04:59.280> 40<00:04:59.610> studios<00:04:59.970> showed<00:05:00.270> us<00:05:00.390> a

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
it's because when 40 studios showed us a

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.990 
it's because when 40 studios showed us a
