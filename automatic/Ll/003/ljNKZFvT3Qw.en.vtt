00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.820
 that you pass kids as you see I brought myself to 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.620
 that at the end the two quarters 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.360
 because I want to leave this rather for 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.030
 strain the soft one was encouraged to notice what 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.710
 nice is the aquarium the truth that already 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.630
 I say one of these little ones right away 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.160
 you fill them with something that a big one already 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.560
 you can spend the money and the money and the 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.210
 money is not going to sit down in life and one 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.519
 of these little ones with little money between 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.080
 comillas you just arrive there is 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.970
 the lawn I will make a short summary 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.080
 before telling what I'm going to do but 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.420
 if you have read it in the title of 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.460
 avaesen tweet 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.750
 and it is that here the little tree is that 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.820
 love is a soft coral 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.760
 Well, I'm going to take it with the scissors and 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.340
 let's cut a branch the spread 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.309
 it's just like the sign I imagine it gives 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.080
 practically plague for which we are going to 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.820
 cut a little arm and we're going to take it to 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.910
 big because I think it's a very coral 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.440
 nice to bring it into the big 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.989
 even here to put it somewhere else 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.309
 put it for example here that comes out another 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.010
 tree just like this one would be 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.739
 pretty cool so I'm going to cut the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.830
 branches and let's see how the 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.020
 project is complained about this coral so 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.930
 I'm going to cut now I'm going to cut what 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.759
 is the recording and then I continue with the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.229
 already cut video is very simple 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.300
 I'm not going to teach it because with both 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.890
 hands I can not but it's just to catch 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.570
 the scissors there for example you see a 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.979
 Rama and Szalai, I counted the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.200
 scissors you take that twig you leave it and 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.940
 nothing and that grip so let's see 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.190
 how is the experiment this as you see 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.530
 nothing has been left remaining superchulo 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.300
 is aquarium water in one thing what 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.610
 would teach in passing if you realize 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.050
 remove the algae but is that the algae 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.060
 I have decided to put them here 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.980
 there are the algae and if you realize 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.920
 with a fluorescent of these small 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.440
 I already have light for the algae and I have already 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.390
 made the refuge of macroalgae in the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.580
 zoom that comes integrate the sera 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.080
 it's a good idea I imagine that what 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.020
 it will have done a lot of people too but 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.400
 well there I can have the algae and that 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.840
 is going to make me get off at all 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.300
 nitrates the phosphates whatever there is 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.740
 around here it will lower me and it does not make me 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.720
 aquarium that algae used to be 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.369
 here hanging around so nothing guys 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.950
 I hope you like it as 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.570
 staying good I'm around here as 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.880
 It was expected to be a soft color 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.820
 very similar to anemones in that 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.709
 have you felt the scissors has been retracted and 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.650
 It has been more difficult to cut give 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.150
 account and just cut this area there 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.570
 already be retracted the tree remember 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.739
 as it was less than half a minute ago 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.840
 but to give a little back to the video 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.630
 you will see it totally as I have 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.820
 left the bit of it has been retracted 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.670
 barbarity does not even seem to have 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.650
 trunk I say is an experiment let's 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.440
 see I imagine that it's the same as the signal 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.200
 there's going to be no problem and we're going to 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.700
 see these days if we get that grip 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.519
 there the little tree and we already have two 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.440
 little trees if it grabs then nothing we already know 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.620
 how easy it is to complain about this coral 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.870
 soft but 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.850
 sure you're tiles do not know will not 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.500
 to have a lot of mystery 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.120
 but the only advice I can give you 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.610
 is that if you are going to cut a soft color 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.290
 do it as quickly as possible because 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.550
 retract then you will be very difficult 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.490
 cut it 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.830
 so we'll see anything these days 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.110
 evolving the little tree 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.670
 I imagine that tomorrow this will be left 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.020
 to be so withdrawn right now seems like a 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.660
 broccoli 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.380
 Well nothing, guys, hello 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.380
 see you later
