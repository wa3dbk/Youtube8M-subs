00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
okay so you remember our major scales

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.390 
okay so you remember our major scales
have<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.319> pattern<00:00:04.650> whole<00:00:04.859> step<00:00:05.100> whole<00:00:05.339> step

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
whole whole half okay and if we remember

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.240 
whole whole half okay and if we remember
for<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.019> E<00:00:13.049> major<00:00:13.320> scale<00:00:13.530> let's<00:00:13.980> use<00:00:14.130> our

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
for the E major scale let's use our

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.070 
for the E major scale let's use our
intervals<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.759> create<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.240> one<00:00:15.389> again<00:00:15.599> we

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
intervals to create that one again we

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.140 
intervals to create that one again we
had<00:00:16.289> e<00:00:18.500> F<00:00:19.500> sharp<00:00:20.390> whole<00:00:21.390> step<00:00:21.449> away<00:00:21.840> G<00:00:22.619> sharp

whole whole half whole whole whole half
to<00:00:42.870> get<00:00:42.960> back<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.379> octave<00:00:43.649> okay<00:00:43.920> that's

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
to get back to the octave okay that's

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.160 
to get back to the octave okay that's
just<00:00:44.700> one<00:00:44.969> octave<00:00:45.360> now<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:45.809> want<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.110> have

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
just one octave now we want to have

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.810 
just one octave now we want to have
those<00:00:46.350> same<00:00:46.649> notes<00:00:46.829> an<00:00:47.039> octave<00:00:47.160> up<00:00:47.550> from<00:00:47.700> each

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
those same notes an octave up from each

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.310 
those same notes an octave up from each
of<00:00:47.969> them<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.690> want<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.930> do<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.260> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
of them but I want to do this in a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:58.790 
of them but I want to do this in a
proper<00:00:49.530> fingering<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:57.500> here's<00:00:58.500> what<00:00:58.680> this

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
proper fingering so here's what this

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.200 
proper fingering so here's what this
would<00:00:58.949> look<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.160> let's<00:00:59.579> explain<00:00:59.940> what<00:01:00.000> just

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
would look like let's explain what just

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.840 
would look like let's explain what just
happened<00:01:00.660> okay<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.620> played<00:01:01.800> e<00:01:02.070> F<00:01:02.309> sharp<00:01:02.370> G

sharp a B C sharp d sharp and E like

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.899 
sharp a B C sharp d sharp and E like
before<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:08.310> now<00:01:08.630> we're<00:01:09.630> gonna<00:01:09.750> keep<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:09.990> e

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
before but now we're gonna keep going e

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.240 
before but now we're gonna keep going e
F<00:01:11.909> sharp<00:01:12.090> G<00:01:12.720> sharp<00:01:13.619> first<00:01:14.520> fret<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.729> hey

F sharp G sharp first fret of hey

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.330 
F sharp G sharp first fret of hey
remember<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:19.340> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
remember this is just like the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.060 
remember this is just like the
beginnings<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.090> major<00:01:21.930> movable<00:01:22.920> major

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
beginnings of a major movable major

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.580 
beginnings of a major movable major
scale<00:01:23.780> but<00:01:24.780> now<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> D<00:01:25.259> string

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
scale but now on the D string

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.969 
scale but now on the D string
now<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.790> B<00:01:27.600> well<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.409> need<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> get<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.799> see

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
now it's B well we need to get to see

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.880 
now it's B well we need to get to see
you<00:01:29.040> sharp<00:01:30.200> let's<00:01:31.200> move<00:01:31.380> with<00:01:31.500> our<00:01:31.619> first

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
you sharp let's move with our first

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.760 
you sharp let's move with our first
finger<00:01:32.130> because<00:01:32.610> play<00:01:33.329> C<00:01:33.570> sharp<00:01:33.600> d<00:01:34.200> sharp<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
finger because play C sharp d sharp and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.280 
finger because play C sharp d sharp and
end<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.460> E<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.540> we<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:36.869> want<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.049> find<00:01:37.200> that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
end on E so we really want to find that

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.560 
end on E so we really want to find that
as<00:01:37.470> convenient<00:01:37.979> place<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.430> move<00:01:38.579> which<00:01:39.390> would

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
as convenient place to move which would

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
as convenient place to move which would
be<00:01:39.720> after<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.200> B

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.179 

we<00:01:44.590> could<00:01:44.740> also<00:01:44.950> move<00:01:45.310> earlier<00:01:46.030> e<00:01:46.560> F<00:01:47.560> sharp<00:01:47.829> G

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
we could also move earlier e F sharp G

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.440 
we could also move earlier e F sharp G

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.359 
finger up like D sharp on the a string 6
fret<00:01:55.020> then<00:01:56.020> play<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.380> movable<00:01:56.770> major<00:01:56.920> scale

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369

to close things off any way you do it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.359 
to close things off any way you do it
you're<00:02:06.280> gonna<00:02:06.369> have<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.759> move<00:02:06.909> your<00:02:07.090> hand<00:02:08.369> it

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
you're gonna have to move your hand it

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.130 
you're gonna have to move your hand it
was<00:02:09.519> all<00:02:09.759> about<00:02:09.849> finding<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.420> convenient<00:02:10.959> place

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
was all about finding a convenient place

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.650 
was all about finding a convenient place
to<00:02:11.170> jump
