there is four dip switches these are for

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.630 
there is four dip switches these are for
your<00:01:29.350> frequency<00:01:29.830> if<00:01:30.070> somebody<00:01:30.340> else<00:01:30.520> is<00:01:30.580> in

it<00:02:14.930> just<00:02:15.110> works<00:02:15.290> as<00:02:15.379> a<00:02:15.409> normal<00:02:15.709> remote<00:02:16.090> but<00:02:17.090> you

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
it just works as a normal remote but you

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.000 
it just works as a normal remote but you
can<00:02:17.420> get<00:02:17.629> it<00:02:17.689> to<00:02:17.780> work<00:02:17.900> if<00:02:18.409> you<00:02:18.560> change<00:02:18.829> the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.240 
gonna take approximately 10 feet walk
back<00:02:42.220> 10<00:02:42.430> feet<00:02:42.640> every<00:02:43.600> single<00:02:43.900> picture<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:45.070> all

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
back 10 feet every single picture so all

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.510 
back 10 feet every single picture so all
down<00:02:45.490> there<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:45.850> approximately<00:02:46.330> 90<00:02:46.630> feet<00:02:46.780> away

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
down there is approximately 90 feet away

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.670 
down there is approximately 90 feet away
so<00:02:48.520> we'll<00:02:48.850> just<00:02:49.000> see<00:02:49.150> how<00:02:49.180> far<00:02:49.540> it'll<00:02:49.900> go<00:02:50.140> right

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
so we'll just see how far it'll go right

00:02:50.680 --> 00:03:11.830 
so we'll just see how far it'll go right
now

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.940 

all<00:03:12.840> right<00:03:13.020> I<00:03:13.140> just<00:03:13.319> finished<00:03:13.470> distance

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
all right I just finished distance

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.309 
all right I just finished distance
testing<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.670> I've<00:03:15.390> concluded<00:03:15.569> after<00:03:16.020> looking

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
testing and I've concluded after looking

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.979 
testing and I've concluded after looking
at<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.500> pictures<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.090> 45<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.270> 50<00:03:18.510> feets<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
at the pictures that 45 to 50 feets the

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.600 
at the pictures that 45 to 50 feets the
maximum<00:03:19.410> range<00:03:19.620> you're<00:03:20.069> gonna<00:03:20.160> get<00:03:20.370> out<00:03:20.430> of

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
maximum range you're gonna get out of

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.050 
maximum range you're gonna get out of
this

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
this

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.910 
this

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
I got a few over 60 but it just kind of

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.790 
I got a few over 60 but it just kind of
got<00:03:23.069> lucky<00:03:23.250> every<00:03:23.550> once<00:03:23.730> in<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.970> while<00:03:24.500> under<00:03:25.500> 50

got lucky every once in a while under 50
it<00:03:25.920> was<00:03:26.130> really<00:03:26.310> consistent<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:27.120> took<00:03:27.300> a

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
up for $38 not including shipping if you

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.550 
up for $38 not including shipping if you
compare<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.220> Canon<00:03:50.580> products<00:03:50.970> its<00:03:51.720> $44

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
compare it to the Canon products its $44

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.420 
compare it to the Canon products its $44
just<00:03:52.920> for<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.250> regular<00:03:53.760> old<00:03:54.090> wired<00:03:54.569> remote

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
just for the regular old wired remote

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.670 
just for the regular old wired remote
nothing<00:03:56.430> no<00:03:56.640> timer<00:03:56.970> no<00:03:57.480> anything<00:03:58.110> like<00:03:58.470> that

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
nothing no timer no anything like that

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.640 
nothing no timer no anything like that
so<00:03:59.519> with<00:04:00.150> this<00:04:00.299> you<00:04:00.510> do<00:04:00.690> get<00:04:00.870> wireless

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
so with this you do get wireless

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.890 
so with this you do get wireless
capability<00:04:02.459> it'll<00:04:02.970> take<00:04:03.239> single<00:04:03.660> shot

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
capability it'll take single shot

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.500 
capability it'll take single shot
continuous<00:04:04.640> two-second<00:04:05.640> delay<00:04:05.730> it'll<00:04:06.420> work

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
continuous two-second delay it'll work

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.080 
continuous two-second delay it'll work
in<00:04:06.630> bulb<00:04:06.900> mode<00:04:07.160> so<00:04:08.160> it<00:04:08.489> is<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.640> really<00:04:08.970> good

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
in bulb mode so it is a really good

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.970 
in bulb mode so it is a really good
value<00:04:09.480> for<00:04:09.510> what<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:10.319> picked<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.709> up<00:04:10.799> off
