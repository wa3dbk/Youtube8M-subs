00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.270
 It's fine with people. 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.069
 the milestone of the immense modernism to do 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.349
 one more review is for you guys I received yesterday 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.299
 sidrônio here is a sky technologies 2r and 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.500
 leading to Christ and Sidronio despite 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.119
 be small 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.130
 getting here in your hand gives you 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.689
 an idea of ​​size it's a drone 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.369
 small but already a drone that already comes 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.699
 camera equipped with a simple camera 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.529
 of 0.3 megapixels more efficient for 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.260
 Who wants to start playing already? 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.510
 shooting during the flight is 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.420
 the cost benefit certainly does not have 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.500
 nothing better that did not take person 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.190
 show the main features 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.079
 here his look is very cool is a 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.820
 much more refined visual 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.649
 that my other drone that this is mine 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.719
 even that is 0 22 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.340
 already a much more cool look 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.309
 be exactly two is fine but stay 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.570
 same must be very good but it is a visual 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.420
 much more interesting 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.969
 he has an external illumination that well 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.690
 cool when we call you part of 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.609
 low 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.830
 LED lighting stays here in these 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.270
 four dots and very closely resembles 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.360
 x5 c 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.040
 so it's really pretty and they live 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.490
 inside the bag that comes equipped 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.740
 with the propellers and come here 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.930
 for something I think it's cool, come on 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.790
 another landing gear here right? 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.200
 then this landing gear on the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.070
 still fit because he has a trading 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.720
 here o 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.490
 After you fit in, you can only 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.930
 drop if you open the drone so do not 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.600
 I still fit the ones I bought here in 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.680
 box later but the look of it 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.210
 very nice with the protectors and the 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.130
 another has to land much 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.810
 cool was a much more and more visual 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:46.079
 beautiful it comes with a 0 and reservations are not 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.860
 there at 00 comes with four is reserve and 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.470
 put a little more forward here 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.640
 normal charger cable is not 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.460
 wall charger that's it 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.390
 Normal charger comes with reader 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.329
 card're card reader and USB 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.930
 interesting too and comes with a card 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.970
 512mb memory is a memory card 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.110
 simple but the card now had 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.970
 then if someone wants to buy a 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.200
 2gb sd card 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.580
 For example, I do not know how much time either 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.800
 he can record with this card 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.240
 because there goes a lot of the flight time from where 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.580
 not the amount of available memory 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.440
 on the card anyway if the person after 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.880
 want to have multiple batteries do some 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.280
 goals there even good that has a 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.380
 highest capacity card even for 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.970
 gain more flight time 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.900
 it also comes with a screwdriver 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.850
 here o 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.190
 it comes to use the packaging with a 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.700
 screwdriver and comes the tool had 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.140
 for you to remove the series when 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.370
 broke when you lose something 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.600
 can do removal to make the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.890
 exchange 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.110
 Now let's talk a little about the control. 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.470
 to take these things here just 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.540
 a little control control to the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.760
 At first glance I did not like it very much. 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.770
 I had not really liked the look. 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.180
 but it 's a very good contract from 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.160
 hold his footprint is very good 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.959
 mainly because the levers here 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.450
 The top of them is rubbery so it's 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.310
 very cool and a very functional control 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.680
 I found it very functional even after I 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.490
 I used a little bit to like it well 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.360
 more than I had launched at the beginning and 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.340
 control functions 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.430
 The four buttons here are the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.269
 front left and right rear 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.220
 right 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.760
 these two here are the image buttons 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.800
 here is the button to take photo and 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.810
 this button here is the camera button 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.250
 reminding staff that they can never 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.840
 forgetting to turn on the camera started 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.000
 Shoot when you are going to use the drone 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.220
 always open again to turn off the 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.660
 camera to record the footage if you 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.040
 Lands uneven drones on tightening 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.920
 button again and it does not record that 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.630
 You signed this button here, I do not 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.299
 I managed to find that one 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.560
 drone is this control is used to 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.330
 several models probably for one 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.860
 another model must have precise utility 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.510
 I could not figure out then 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.600
 discovered makes another video showing 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.230
 this button here it toggles the 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.630
 flight 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.610
 whenever you and scream in flip mode're 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.239
 What the hell do you do through this? 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.880
 this other button here is the 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.380
 of the percentage is there are two flight modes 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.500
 intermediate beginner so here it is 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.000
 be 50% and 100% 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.590
 This flight mode here is personal to me. 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.049
 I meant the following he is always 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.700
 in flip mode if you push the button and 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.650
 goes pro camera mode because when he 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.660
 he's filming not from the flip 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.460
 You squeeze that he does not flip. 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.139
 so if you want it to reflect 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.419
 you have to turn off the camera eye 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.599
 if you can make a clip with it 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.069
 so let him call him here to show 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.169
 and winning a little bit but we'll see 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.580
 that his led the leds is very nice 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.240
 lighting system is also very 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.729
 cool 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.439
 so it's great to call 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.319
 all other drugs is one would be the drone 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:44.219
 but offer a flat surface 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:47.460
 igor control 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:50.219
 Stay ahead of you. 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.659
 Ready, it's good in the series, you 're going to accelerate. 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:56.310
 here is working already the staff do not 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.870
 I know the video and you can see 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.909
 he's on the way I think he got a little 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.009
 The darker you can see the oled here. 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:04.229
 button turns red off 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.259
 he's on a flip so if you see 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.729
 push button here 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:11.189
 it turned blue because it indicates that it is 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.750
 on mode or camera or is ready 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:14.759
 to shoot and take pictures you tighten 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.830
 again it changes to another color that 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.360
 also decided it has no function that you 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.460
 press again and back over the 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.639
 Happy New Year 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.169
 the staff is asking that the battery of the 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.379
 camcorder is running out 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.789
 click here this is it personal drone 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:31.529
 very cool, very cool one 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:35.939
 excellent value for money will go through 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:37.409
 account of 270 reais and whoever has 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:39.930
 interest again is just getting into 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:42.839
 contact via ms modeling alba 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.810
 gmail.com and remembering right 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:47.699
 very careful because it is not recommended 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.289
 for the child and is not recommended for 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.909
 who does not have experience with model airplanes 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:52.589
 which is recommended for those who already have the 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:56.099
 basic experience already know how to fly 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:57.750
 because it fell, it broke like I always did 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.339
 I always talk, I always play a lot 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.960
 moderate to stall 

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:04.649
 times and knocks nothing happens there 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.750
 dropped then very careful because 

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:08.550
 all drones are fragile do not have 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.770
 way only then depending on the height falls 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.599
 break damages the plate will have pain 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.889
 head to the fun lock not 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.180
 become headache when the pain of 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.919
 Why did you just always buy 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.039
 I recommend that you have a minimum of 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.409
 experience because buying and selling 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.569
 after misfortune fell broke is guaranteed 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:26.219
 there is no guarantee that I 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.479
 I always give you what I say in the text. 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:30.569
 ironic when it comes to me 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.250
 supplier and resets all 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:33.240
 functions as soon as I see the 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.099
 buyer 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.750
 so there are people who sometimes get bitch 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:37.900
 fell broke them and do not know what there and 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.240
 then it stopped working 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.630
 forget he has no guarantee he fell broke 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.430
 so always recommend if you already have one 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.020
 minimum experience with helicopter 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.389
 with drone as because the fun 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.190
 guaranteed if you do not have it 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.229
 the most basic to get you started 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.340
 learn to play for fun 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:56.259
 turn a headache 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.580
 Some people, that's it, then I 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:59.650
 I'll see if I can stay any more. 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.940
 days with it already announced already but I 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.710
 I managed to stay with him for a few more days. 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.470
 comes another model that I intend to stay 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.320
 I'm going to make a video of him. 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.940
 flying and filming his camera 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.500
 in this video his footage is very good 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.820
 Even here in the house yesterday I already 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.280
 I really liked it 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.860
 ok guys then again contact 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:22.419
 among those who want more information is 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:26.010
