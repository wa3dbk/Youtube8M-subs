well always storytelling always drawing
and<00:00:24.930> if<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.410> use<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> Mac<00:00:25.980> obviously<00:00:26.280> your

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
and if you use a Mac obviously your

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.460 
and if you use a Mac obviously your
technical<00:00:27.480> skills<00:00:27.750> don't<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:28.110> to<00:00:28.230> be<00:00:28.320> that

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
technical skills don't have to be that

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.900 
technical skills don't have to be that
great<00:00:28.710> because<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> Mac<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> wonderful

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
great because the Mac is a wonderful

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.240 
great because the Mac is a wonderful
computer<00:00:30.449> which<00:00:30.900> means<00:00:30.930> that<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.530> can<00:00:31.949> use<00:00:31.980> it

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
computer which means that you can use it

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.069 
computer which means that you can use it
very<00:00:32.460> intuitively<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.539> used<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.899> Mac

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
very intuitively and I have used the Mac

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.069 
very intuitively and I have used the Mac
for<00:00:34.289> the<00:00:34.320> past<00:00:34.559> 20<00:00:35.219> years<00:00:35.460> almost<00:00:35.789> so<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.569> would

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
for the past 20 years almost so I would

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.250 
for the past 20 years almost so I would
recommend<00:00:37.260> them<00:00:37.620> at<00:00:37.710> every<00:00:37.800> opportunity<00:00:39.260> if

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
recommend them at every opportunity if

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.809 
recommend them at every opportunity if
you<00:00:40.679> can<00:00:40.829> write<00:00:41.039> your<00:00:41.190> name

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:41.819 
you can write your name

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:44.750 
you can write your name
you<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.269> draw<00:00:42.829> drawing<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:43.920> actually<00:00:44.399> saying

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
you can draw drawing is actually saying

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.459 
you can draw drawing is actually saying
that<00:00:45.420> that's<00:00:45.659> what<00:00:45.839> it<00:00:46.019> is

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
that that's what it is

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.879 
that that's what it is
by<00:00:46.769> drawing<00:00:47.069> you<00:00:47.489> learn<00:00:47.699> to<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.889> I

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:49.889 
by drawing you learn to see and I

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:51.590 
by drawing you learn to see and I
suppose<00:00:50.370> that's<00:00:50.729> the<00:00:50.969> challenge<00:00:51.449> with

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
suppose that's the challenge with

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.829 
suppose that's the challenge with
drawing<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.109> to<00:00:52.260> refine<00:00:52.739> how<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.249> see<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.149> to

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
drawing is to refine how you see and to

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.160 
drawing is to refine how you see and to
refine<00:00:55.260> how<00:00:55.589> you<00:00:55.649> express<00:00:56.309> your<00:00:56.760> ideas<00:00:57.569> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
refine how you express your ideas the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.610 
refine how you express your ideas the
thing<00:00:58.379> about<00:00:58.789> comics<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.620> drawings

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
thing about comics is that the drawings

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.880 
thing about comics is that the drawings
have<00:01:01.979> to<00:01:02.159> be<00:01:02.629> relatively<00:01:03.629> simple<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.860> only

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
have to be relatively simple you only

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.340 
have to be relatively simple you only
look<00:01:05.339> at<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> comic<00:01:05.880> book<00:01:05.909> drawing<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.780> seconds

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
look at a comic book drawing for seconds

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.440 
look at a comic book drawing for seconds
so<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.579> get<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> information<00:01:09.030> over

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
so you have to get the information over

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.510 
so you have to get the information over
very<00:01:09.810> quickly<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.469> can't<00:01:10.799> load<00:01:11.159> them<00:01:11.369> up<00:01:11.460> with

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
very quickly you can't load them up with

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.749 
very quickly you can't load them up with
too<00:01:12.180> much<00:01:12.390> detail<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.189> distort

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
too much detail if you do you distort

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.459 
too much detail if you do you distort
the<00:01:14.939> storytelling<00:01:15.600> because<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.960> traps<00:01:16.289> the

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469 
the storytelling because it traps the

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:18.880 
the storytelling because it traps the
eye<00:01:16.590> too<00:01:16.740> much<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.600> very

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
eye too much so it's really a very

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.039 
eye too much so it's really a very
sophisticated<00:01:19.890> often<00:01:20.759> simple<00:01:21.270> but<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.719> very

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
sophisticated often simple but a very

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.440 
sophisticated often simple but a very
sophisticated<00:01:22.560> way<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.310> drawing<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
sophisticated way of drawing one of the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.760 
sophisticated way of drawing one of the
things<00:01:24.570> I'm<00:01:24.689> really<00:01:24.930> pleased<00:01:25.200> about<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
things I'm really pleased about with the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.980 
things I'm really pleased about with the
movie<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.820> its<00:01:27.000> faithful<00:01:27.539> to<00:01:27.899> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
movie is that its faithful to the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.990 
movie is that its faithful to the
graphic<00:01:28.409> novel<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.799> doesn't<00:01:29.100> misrepresent<00:01:29.820> it

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
graphic novel it doesn't misrepresent it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.639 
graphic novel it doesn't misrepresent it
and<00:01:30.299> also<00:01:30.719> everything<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.140> sufficiently

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
and also everything is sufficiently

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.010 
and also everything is sufficiently
well-made<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.429> will<00:01:32.929> direct<00:01:33.929> people

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
well-made that it will direct people

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.959 
well-made that it will direct people
towards<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.799> graphing<00:01:35.189> also<00:01:35.520> hopefully<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
towards the graphing also hopefully the

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.520 
towards the graphing also hopefully the
outcome<00:01:36.299> will<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.960> people<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.380> had<00:01:37.500> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
outcome will be the people have had a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.529 
outcome will be the people have had a
good<00:01:37.799> movie<00:01:38.159> experience<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.969> also<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
good movie experience and also have a

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.749 
good movie experience and also have a
good<00:01:39.810> graphic<00:01:40.619> novel<00:01:40.920> experience<00:01:41.429> as<00:01:41.579> well

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
good graphic novel experience as well

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.880 
good graphic novel experience as well
well<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.329> don't<00:01:42.570> tend<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> get<00:01:43.109> riled<00:01:43.350> up<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.679> just

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
well I don't tend to get riled up I just

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.399 
well I don't tend to get riled up I just
pity<00:01:44.670> their<00:01:45.000> ignorance<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.630> think<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:46.020> much<00:01:46.170> as

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
pity their ignorance I think as much as

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.160 
pity their ignorance I think as much as
anything<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.310> mean<00:01:47.609> I<00:01:47.759> don't<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:48.119> things<00:01:48.810> like

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
anything I mean I don't like things like

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.260 
anything I mean I don't like things like
I've<00:01:49.469> got<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> real<00:01:49.979> beam<00:01:50.249> up<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.060> people

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
I've got a real beam up on it but people

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.599 
I've got a real beam up on it but people
like<00:01:51.479> Roy<00:01:51.719> Lichtenstein<00:01:52.530> who<00:01:52.829> kind<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.490> do

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
like Roy Lichtenstein who kind of do

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.179 
like Roy Lichtenstein who kind of do
these<00:01:53.789> terribly<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:54.990> sloppy<00:01:55.469> tracings

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
these terribly I think sloppy tracings

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.219 
these terribly I think sloppy tracings
of<00:01:56.340> comic<00:01:56.700> books<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.119> pass<00:01:57.509> them<00:01:57.749> off<00:01:57.869> as<00:01:57.899> some

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
of comic books and pass them off as some

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.709 
of comic books and pass them off as some
kind<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.560> kitschy<00:01:59.069> pop<00:01:59.520> art<00:01:59.789> thing<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.299> think

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
kind of kitschy pop art thing I think

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.809 
kind of kitschy pop art thing I think
comic<00:02:01.079> book<00:02:01.229> art<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.679> best<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.130> incredibly

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
comic book art is best is incredibly

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.649 
comic book art is best is incredibly
sophisticated<00:02:03.170> as<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.439> say<00:02:04.700> it's<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:06.149> simple

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
sophisticated as I say it's it's simple

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.440 
sophisticated as I say it's it's simple
but<00:02:06.840> actually<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.920> naive<00:02:08.460> eye<00:02:08.789> that's

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
but actually it's the naive eye that's

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.350 
but actually it's the naive eye that's
captured<00:02:10.050> by<00:02:10.080> detail

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
captured by detail

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.060 
captured by detail
I<00:02:11.480> mean<00:02:11.840> that<00:02:11.930> when<00:02:12.050> I<00:02:12.110> first<00:02:12.530> started<00:02:12.950> reading

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
I mean that when I first started reading

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.340 
I mean that when I first started reading

comics I loved really complicated

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.770 
comics I loved really complicated
detailed<00:02:15.800> drawing<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.580> can<00:02:16.970> do<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.480> and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
detailed drawing and I can do that and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.110 
detailed drawing and I can do that and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
dense kind of detailed pieces but if you

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.480 
dense kind of detailed pieces but if you
look<00:02:23.480> at<00:02:23.600> those<00:02:23.750> pictures<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.800> composition

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
look at those pictures the composition

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.000 
look at those pictures the composition
of<00:02:25.640> them<00:02:25.820> is<00:02:25.940> actually<00:02:26.150> very<00:02:26.780> accessible<00:02:27.380> the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
of them is actually very accessible the

of them is actually very accessible the
line<00:02:28.670> work<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.210> very<00:02:29.510> simplified<00:02:30.160> which<00:02:31.160> isn't

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
line work is very simplified which isn't

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.040 
line work is very simplified which isn't
to<00:02:31.610> say<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:32.450> it's<00:02:32.630> crude<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.550> I<00:02:34.550> mean<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.270> it's

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
to say that it's crude and I mean I it's

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.900 
to say that it's crude and I mean I it's
made<00:02:36.290> me<00:02:36.440> think<00:02:36.740> of<00:02:36.920> something<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.400> forget<00:02:37.730> who
