00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
broken it down real quickly here in

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.090 
broken it down real quickly here in
terms<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.820> what<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.720> look<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.439> for<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
terms of what to look out for and the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.950 
terms of what to look out for and the
rules<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.789> creating<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.270> type<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.630> graphic

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
rules for creating this type of graphic

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.310 
rules for creating this type of graphic
so<00:00:22.560> rule<00:00:23.340> number<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:24.029> planning<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.930> very

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
you want to have three lines first of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.410 
you want to have three lines first of
all<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.370> top<00:01:02.609> line<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.850> gonna<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.239> there

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
all the top line is gonna be there

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.030 
all the top line is gonna be there
obviously<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.019> then<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> line<00:01:04.769> below

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
obviously and then the line below

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.070 
obviously and then the line below
there's<00:01:05.790> gonna<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.060> there's<00:01:06.720> gonna<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:07.049> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
there's gonna have there's gonna be a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.100 
there's gonna have there's gonna be a
distance<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> second<00:01:08.460> line<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
distance here for the second line and

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.500 
distance here for the second line and
that<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.380> basically<00:01:10.740> where<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.850> will<00:01:12.180> have

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
that is basically where you will have

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.310 
that is basically where you will have
your<00:01:12.720> bridge<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.250> letter<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
your bridge of the letter so this is the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.980 
your bridge of the letter so this is the
pillar<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.180> connecting<00:01:18.180> part<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.750> bridge

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
pillar the connecting part is the bridge

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.440 
pillar the connecting part is the bridge
and<00:01:19.320> then<00:01:19.530> here's<00:01:19.740> another<00:01:19.799> pillar<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:21.210> is

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
and then here's another pillar this is

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.710 
and then here's another pillar this is
the<00:01:21.689> pillar<00:01:22.320> that's<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.610> bridge<00:01:23.909> that's<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the pillar that's the bridge that's a

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.870 
the pillar that's the bridge that's a
pillar<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.350> B<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> are

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
pillar for the B and then for the are

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.380 
pillar for the B and then for the are
here

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
here

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.990 
here
that's<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.140> pillar<00:01:28.350> bridge<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.369> then<00:01:29.820> these

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
that's the pillar bridge and then these

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.690 
that's the pillar bridge and then these
are<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> pillars<00:01:30.540> right<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.530> where<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.520> have

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
are the pillars right so where you have

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.520 
are the pillars right so where you have
your<00:01:32.850> second<00:01:33.299> line<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.720> usually<00:01:33.960> where<00:01:34.380> you're

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
your second line is usually where you're

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.300 
your second line is usually where you're
gonna<00:01:34.710> put<00:01:35.400> your<00:01:35.460> bridge<00:01:36.049> okay<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.590> you've<00:01:38.280> got

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
gonna put your bridge okay so you've got

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.940 
gonna put your bridge okay so you've got
the<00:01:38.549> first<00:01:38.790> line<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:38.970> top<00:01:39.329> second<00:01:40.140> line<00:01:40.290> right

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the first line on top second line right

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.179 
the first line on top second line right
here<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.570> then<00:01:42.570> third<00:01:42.899> line<00:01:43.170> you're<00:01:44.009> gonna

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
here and then third line you're gonna

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.469 
here and then third line you're gonna
have<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:45.290> lesser<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.619> distance<00:01:47.130> from<00:01:47.479> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
have a lesser of a distance from the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.960 
have a lesser of a distance from the
first<00:01:48.750> one<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.320> tell<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.759> one

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
first one so you can tell for this one

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.300 
first one so you can tell for this one
you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.329> see<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.689> distance<00:01:52.020> boom<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.829> then

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
you can see the distance boom and then

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.310 
you can see the distance boom and then
this<00:01:53.520> distance<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.119> smaller<00:01:54.420> okay<00:01:56.329> so<00:01:57.329> once

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
this distance is smaller okay so once

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.310 
this distance is smaller okay so once
you<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.829> top<00:01:59.390> line<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.750> middle<00:02:00.869> line<00:02:01.110> in

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
you have the top line the middle line in

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.780 
you have the top line the middle line in
the<00:02:01.409> bottom<00:02:01.560> line<00:02:01.860> what<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.159> want<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.640> is

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the bottom line what you want to do is

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.910 
the bottom line what you want to do is
you<00:02:02.939> want<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
you want to have the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.910 
you want to have the
the<00:02:05.220> lines<00:02:06.000> going<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.540> way<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.650> is

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
the lines going this way and this is

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.340 
the lines going this way and this is
basically<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.640> angle<00:02:09.030> or<00:02:09.509> where<00:02:10.200> you're

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
basically the angle or where you're

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.190 
basically the angle or where you're
gonna<00:02:10.470> plug<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.160> your<00:02:11.430> pillar<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.060> again<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
gonna plug in your pillar and again the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.860 
gonna plug in your pillar and again the
nicer<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.860> plant<00:02:14.220> these<00:02:14.430> lines<00:02:15.420> these

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
nicer you plant these lines these

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.590 
nicer you plant these lines these
guiding<00:02:16.380> lines<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.980> call<00:02:17.730> them<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.150> pacing

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
guiding lines I call them the pacing

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.320 
guiding lines I call them the pacing
lines<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.890> better<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.280> have<00:02:20.460> them<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
lines the better you have them the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.620 
lines the better you have them the
cleaner<00:02:21.960> your<00:02:22.820> graphic<00:02:23.820> or<00:02:24.000> your<00:02:24.120> calligraphy

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
cleaner your graphic or your calligraphy

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.690 
cleaner your graphic or your calligraphy
or<00:02:24.660> your<00:02:24.870> font<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.380> been<00:02:25.560> look<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.490> want

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
or your font it's been look so you want

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.400 
or your font it's been look so you want
to<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:26.940> them<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.300> course<00:02:27.510> every<00:02:28.020> single<00:02:28.320> one

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
to have them of course every single one

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.550 
to have them of course every single one
you<00:02:28.560> want<00:02:28.710> to<00:02:28.800> have<00:02:28.830> them<00:02:29.630> parallel<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.840> have

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
you want to have them parallel and have

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.250 
you want to have them parallel and have
the<00:02:31.740> same<00:02:31.980> degree<00:02:32.250> here<00:02:32.700> okay<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:33.990> want<00:02:34.200> to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
the same degree here okay so you want to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.470 
the same degree here okay so you want to
have<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.560> lines<00:02:34.770> light<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.280> course<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.880> you

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
have the lines light of course and you

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.570 
have the lines light of course and you
can<00:02:36.630> have<00:02:36.780> them<00:02:36.930> thick<00:02:37.200> or<00:02:37.470> have<00:02:37.800> then<00:02:38.070> you

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
can have them thick or have then you

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.580 
can have them thick or have then you
know<00:02:38.700> closer<00:02:39.060> together<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.930> depends<00:02:40.320> on<00:02:40.410> you

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
know closer together it depends on you

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.770 
know closer together it depends on you
how<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:41.010> want<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.370> basically<00:02:42.120> create<00:02:42.630> your

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
how you want to basically create your

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.010 
how you want to basically create your
font<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:44.340> once<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.150> have<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.450> guiding<00:02:45.780> lines

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
font so once you have the guiding lines

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.750 
font so once you have the guiding lines
as<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.350> can<00:02:46.530> see<00:02:46.860> here<00:02:47.040> it's<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.400> little<00:02:47.459> bit

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
as you can see here it's a little bit

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.600 
as you can see here it's a little bit
more<00:02:48.060> clear<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:49.170> have<00:02:49.380> them<00:02:49.590> like<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.070> then

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
more clear you have them like that then

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.610 
more clear you have them like that then
you<00:02:50.790> know<00:02:51.000> where<00:02:51.600> you're<00:02:51.810> gonna<00:02:51.959> plug<00:02:52.260> your

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
you know where you're gonna plug your

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.160 
you know where you're gonna plug your
pillars<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.760> once<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:54.870> going

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
pillars in and once you have that going

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.310 
pillars in and once you have that going
then<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.010> can<00:02:56.160> decide<00:02:56.520> on<00:02:56.820> what<00:02:57.330> trace<00:02:57.959> you

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
then you can decide on what trace you

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.650 
then you can decide on what trace you
want<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.680> give<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.190> your<00:02:59.340> pillars<00:02:59.820> now<00:03:00.239> for<00:03:00.540> me

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
want to give to your pillars now for me

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.930 
want to give to your pillars now for me
I<00:03:00.959> like<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.950> know<00:03:02.070> this<00:03:02.280> night<00:03:02.760> it's

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
I like this you know this night it's

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.900 
I like this you know this night it's
really<00:03:03.120> nice<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.110> flow<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.430> like<00:03:05.580> I

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
really nice and that flow and like I

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.090 
really nice and that flow and like I
like<00:03:06.300> that<00:03:06.450> flow<00:03:06.690> going<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.260> speak<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:08.070> I

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
like that flow going so to speak so I

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.520 
like that flow going so to speak so I
create<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.580> flow<00:03:08.820> you<00:03:09.510> know<00:03:09.660> going<00:03:09.930> like

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
create that flow you know going like

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.100 
create that flow you know going like
from<00:03:10.769> here<00:03:11.010> thick<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.940> then<00:03:12.180> thin<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.900> then

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
from here thick and then thin and then

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.140 
from here thick and then thin and then
going<00:03:13.380> all<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.650> way<00:03:13.709> down<00:03:13.769> it's<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.700> flows

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
going all the way down it's it flows

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.720 
going all the way down it's it flows
really<00:03:15.360> nicely<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:16.080> at<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.830> bottom<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.430> feet

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
really nicely and at the bottom the feet

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.970 
really nicely and at the bottom the feet
here<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.269> don't<00:03:18.720> really<00:03:18.900> have<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.380> going<00:03:19.769> too

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
here I don't really have it going too

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.390 
here I don't really have it going too
crazy<00:03:20.160> just<00:03:20.700> nice<00:03:21.299> ending<00:03:21.690> like<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.110> okay<00:03:22.650> so

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
crazy just nice ending like that okay so

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.440 
crazy just nice ending like that okay so
the<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:25.400> guess<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.430> can<00:03:26.700> say<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.120> rule<00:03:27.420> should

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
the I guess you can say the rule should

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.820 
the I guess you can say the rule should
apply<00:03:28.080> it<00:03:28.380> relatively<00:03:30.049> closely<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.799> each

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
apply it relatively closely to each

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.350 
apply it relatively closely to each
other<00:03:32.370> for<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.700> while<00:03:32.790> for<00:03:33.120> your<00:03:33.180> different

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
other for a while for your different

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.300 
other for a while for your different
pillars<00:03:33.780> for<00:03:33.930> your<00:03:34.080> different<00:03:34.230> letters<00:03:34.799> so

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
pillars for your different letters so

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.009 
pillars for your different letters so
you<00:03:35.340> can<00:03:35.459> tell<00:03:35.730> this<00:03:35.880> one<00:03:36.150> goes<00:03:36.450> out<00:03:36.660> like<00:03:36.840> that

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
you can tell this one goes out like that

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.539 
you can tell this one goes out like that
but<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.350> doesn't<00:03:37.709> actually<00:03:37.799> wrap<00:03:38.160> around<00:03:38.459> like

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
but it doesn't actually wrap around like

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.720 
but it doesn't actually wrap around like
this<00:03:38.940> okay<00:03:39.780> which<00:03:40.350> is<00:03:40.500> okay<00:03:40.860> as<00:03:41.160> long<00:03:41.370> as<00:03:41.430> it's

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
this okay which is okay as long as it's

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.490 
this okay which is okay as long as it's
similar<00:03:42.239> that's<00:03:42.840> what<00:03:42.959> I'm<00:03:43.019> trying<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.290> say

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
similar that's what I'm trying to say

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.199 
similar that's what I'm trying to say
here<00:03:43.709> okay<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.519> bottom<00:03:44.850> is<00:03:44.880> just<00:03:45.060> like

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
here okay so the bottom is just like

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.530 
here okay so the bottom is just like
that<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:46.170> is<00:03:46.350> obviously<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.340> B<00:03:47.580> so<00:03:48.180> once

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
that and this is obviously the B so once

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.420 
that and this is obviously the B so once
you<00:03:48.750> create<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.230> BOM<00:03:49.440> pillar<00:03:49.739> you're<00:03:50.310> gonna

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
you create the BOM pillar you're gonna

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.490 
you create the BOM pillar you're gonna
kind<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.120> plan<00:03:51.330> out<00:03:51.480> what's<00:03:51.750> gonna<00:03:51.900> happen<00:03:52.260> for

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
kind of plan out what's gonna happen for

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.340 
kind of plan out what's gonna happen for
the<00:03:52.680> shorter<00:03:53.310> part<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:54.060> B<00:03:54.299> this<00:03:54.959> is<00:03:55.170> also

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
the shorter part of the B this is also

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.289 
the shorter part of the B this is also
the<00:03:55.590> pillar<00:03:55.799> so<00:03:56.160> you<00:03:56.220> kind<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:56.760> map<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.180> out

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
the pillar so you kind of map it out

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.240 
the pillar so you kind of map it out
same<00:03:57.780> thing<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:58.170> want<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.410> draw<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.590> guiding

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
same thing you want to draw the guiding

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.729 
same thing you want to draw the guiding
lines<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.880> pacing<00:04:00.239> lines<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.750> then<00:04:01.530> have<00:04:01.709> it

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
lines the pacing lines and then have it

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.860 
lines the pacing lines and then have it
nice<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.190> light<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:02.820> then<00:04:03.329> you<00:04:03.360> want<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.660> plan

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
nice and light and then you want to plan

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.020 
nice and light and then you want to plan
out<00:04:04.019> what's<00:04:04.260> gonna<00:04:04.410> happen<00:04:04.829> boom<00:04:05.340> for<00:04:05.880> me<00:04:06.000> I

did<00:04:06.329> that<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:07.160> then<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:08.430> kind<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.760> felt<00:04:09.000> in<00:04:09.150> the

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
did that and then I kind of felt in the

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:09.860 
did that and then I kind of felt in the
details

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
details

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.949 
details
I<00:04:09.989> created<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.680> bridge<00:04:11.010> connecting

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
I created the bridge connecting

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.800 
I created the bridge connecting
the<00:04:12.230> two<00:04:12.469> pillars<00:04:13.250> okay<00:04:13.879> so<00:04:13.939> you<00:04:14.209> can<00:04:14.420> tell<00:04:14.629> the

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
the two pillars okay so you can tell the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.560 
the two pillars okay so you can tell the
bridge<00:04:15.079> is<00:04:15.379> Scott<00:04:16.190> that<00:04:16.400> flow<00:04:16.729> going<00:04:16.970> really

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
bridge is Scott that flow going really

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.610 
bridge is Scott that flow going really
nice<00:04:17.750> okay<00:04:18.530> so<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.519> art<00:04:19.940> here<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:21.109> it's<00:04:21.500> the

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
nice okay so the art here and it's the

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.770 
nice okay so the art here and it's the
same<00:04:21.650> thing<00:04:22.039> I<00:04:22.340> have<00:04:22.639> it<00:04:22.820> going<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.539> flow

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
same thing I have it going the flow

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.439 
same thing I have it going the flow
going<00:04:24.169> boom<00:04:24.620> just<00:04:24.949> like<00:04:25.070> that<00:04:25.190> ending<00:04:25.850> follow

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
going boom just like that ending follow

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.840 
going boom just like that ending follow
us<00:04:26.600> the<00:04:26.750> rules<00:04:27.020> okay<00:04:27.229> and<00:04:27.620> then<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:28.310> flow<00:04:28.550> goes

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
us the rules okay and then the flow goes

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.330 
us the rules okay and then the flow goes
boom<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.750> comes<00:04:30.320> down<00:04:30.410> I<00:04:30.740> broke<00:04:30.979> the<00:04:31.100> rule<00:04:31.310> a

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
boom and comes down I broke the rule a

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.800 
boom and comes down I broke the rule a
little<00:04:31.550> bit<00:04:31.880> here<00:04:32.090> but<00:04:32.270> that's<00:04:32.449> okay<00:04:32.780> because

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
little bit here but that's okay because

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.930 
little bit here but that's okay because
I<00:04:33.289> wanted<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.770> put<00:04:33.979> a<00:04:34.009> little<00:04:34.280> bit<00:04:34.460> more<00:04:34.639> style

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
I wanted to put a little bit more style

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.590 
I wanted to put a little bit more style
into<00:04:35.120> this<00:04:35.419> are<00:04:35.750> okay<00:04:36.650> so<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:38.060> summarize<00:04:38.360> a

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
into this are okay so to summarize a

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.129 
into this are okay so to summarize a
little<00:04:38.900> quickly<00:04:39.639> as<00:04:40.639> you<00:04:40.729> can<00:04:40.880> see<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:41.840> is

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
little quickly as you can see this is

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.920 
little quickly as you can see this is
the<00:04:42.590> end<00:04:42.770> result<00:04:42.979> for<00:04:43.250> one<00:04:43.789> of<00:04:44.060> my<00:04:44.120> creations

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
the end result for one of my creations

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.350 
the end result for one of my creations
now<00:04:45.110> this<00:04:45.289> one<00:04:45.470> I<00:04:45.500> kind<00:04:45.889> of<00:04:45.949> went<00:04:46.160> a<00:04:46.729> little<00:04:47.150> bit

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
now this one I kind of went a little bit

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.270 
now this one I kind of went a little bit
crazy<00:04:47.419> on<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:47.990> I<00:04:48.229> took<00:04:48.470> a<00:04:48.650> little<00:04:49.009> bit<00:04:49.130> more

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
crazy on it I took a little bit more

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.370 
crazy on it I took a little bit more
time<00:04:49.520> in<00:04:49.699> the<00:04:49.820> planning<00:04:50.210> stage<00:04:50.479> so<00:04:51.050> I<00:04:51.080> could

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
time in the planning stage so I could

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.159 
time in the planning stage so I could
create<00:04:51.740> more<00:04:52.099> of<00:04:52.520> intricate<00:04:53.479> and<00:04:53.660> dynamic

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
create more of intricate and dynamic

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.140 
create more of intricate and dynamic
effect<00:04:54.530> if<00:04:54.919> you<00:04:54.979> can<00:04:55.250> read<00:04:55.430> it<00:04:55.550> as<00:04:55.669> this<00:04:55.820> Brian

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
effect if you can read it as this Brian

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.320 
effect if you can read it as this Brian
okay<00:04:56.630> so<00:04:57.199> you<00:04:57.289> can<00:04:57.530> see<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:58.070> this<00:04:58.970> is<00:04:59.150> the

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
okay so you can see the this is the

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.930 
okay so you can see the this is the
pillar<00:04:59.930> and<00:05:00.259> it's<00:05:00.919> got<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:01.190> nice<00:05:01.340> flow<00:05:01.699> going

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
pillar and it's got the nice flow going

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.749 
pillar and it's got the nice flow going
boom<00:05:02.389> and<00:05:02.960> then<00:05:03.349> it<00:05:03.470> comes<00:05:03.680> in<00:05:03.889> this<00:05:04.370> is<00:05:04.550> top

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
boom and then it comes in this is top

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:06.850 
boom and then it comes in this is top
line<00:05:05.030> and<00:05:05.300> then<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:05.870> middle<00:05:06.199> line<00:05:06.349> and<00:05:06.560> the

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
line and then the middle line and the

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.480 
line and then the middle line and the
bottom<00:05:07.009> line<00:05:07.340> okay<00:05:07.849> so<00:05:08.810> I<00:05:09.050> broke<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:09.979> B<00:05:10.160> and

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
bottom line okay so I broke the B and

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:17.260 
bottom line okay so I broke the B and
then<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.930> are<00:05:12.349> I<00:05:12.729> a<00:05:13.810> and<00:05:14.810> n<00:05:15.710> okay<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:16.699> I<00:05:16.970> made<00:05:17.240> a

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
then the are I a and n okay and I made a

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.500 
then the are I a and n okay and I made a
really<00:05:17.599> intricate<00:05:17.870> with<00:05:18.740> the<00:05:19.240> details<00:05:20.240> going

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
really intricate with the details going

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.899 
really intricate with the details going
everywhere<00:05:20.930> so<00:05:21.440> it<00:05:21.500> looks<00:05:21.680> nice<00:05:21.919> okay<00:05:22.280> so

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
everywhere so it looks nice okay so

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:26.290 
everywhere so it looks nice okay so
going<00:05:23.210> back<00:05:23.449> to<00:05:23.659> this<00:05:23.810> to<00:05:25.090> summarize<00:05:26.090> real

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
going back to this to summarize real

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.360 
going back to this to summarize real
quickly<00:05:26.510> you<00:05:26.690> want<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:27.080> put<00:05:27.229> the<00:05:27.320> top<00:05:27.500> line<00:05:27.800> the

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
quickly you want to put the top line the

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.339 
quickly you want to put the top line the
middle<00:05:28.699> line<00:05:28.909> with<00:05:29.360> a<00:05:29.389> distance<00:05:29.930> and<00:05:30.199> the

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
middle line with a distance and the

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.230 
middle line with a distance and the
bottom<00:05:30.710> line<00:05:30.919> which<00:05:31.280> is<00:05:31.460> a<00:05:31.490> little<00:05:31.849> bit<00:05:31.970> closer

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
bottom line which is a little bit closer

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.620 
bottom line which is a little bit closer
in<00:05:33.020> contrast<00:05:33.979> to<00:05:34.039> the<00:05:34.220> top<00:05:34.400> line<00:05:34.610> and<00:05:34.909> then<00:05:35.449> you

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
in contrast to the top line and then you

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.180 
in contrast to the top line and then you
want<00:05:35.870> to<00:05:35.960> draw<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:36.560> pacing<00:05:37.340> lines<00:05:37.520> going<00:05:39.190> well

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
want to draw the pacing lines going well

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.920 
want to draw the pacing lines going well
it's<00:05:40.340> diagonally<00:05:41.090> but<00:05:41.389> you<00:05:41.509> want<00:05:41.690> to<00:05:41.780> have

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
it's diagonally but you want to have
