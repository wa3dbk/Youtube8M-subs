00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.240
 and here we are preparing it has been a while 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.430
 long you have to have a little patience 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:18.460
 but now we are finally ready for 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.460
 sewing spends the guided years 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.640
 so I decided to sew it with a thread 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:30.289
 brown then change the thread by removing 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:37.150
 the old wire without removing it 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:40.730
 completely the day dino machine 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:46.160
 pin lake because otherwise the pudding 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:52.610
 inside the eye does not pass and raising with 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:55.970
 the raised foot was threaded up until 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:02.620
 does not switch to node cut node now 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:07.340
 I can put the check in the eye 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:10.180
 school below must have the same 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.180
 Brown 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.130
 a wire 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:45.370
 ok i can go it started then i could 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.530
 put my own flush with the burgundy 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:52.869
 but I prefer to go half a millimeter 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.960
 inside so give if safer than 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.360
 also take the glass 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:04.990
 if you are not so convinced you should a 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:07.810
 baste all the passionaria for 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:13.450
 be safer to take yourself to the 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:20.500
 straight that the reverse for a becomes a 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:22.390
 work objects so let's not start 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.000
 need to pay here at the beginning because 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.720
 when I finish I will finish over i 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.470
 bridges with which I started and I will save in 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.470
 those nothing 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:57.070
 still control that is put well you 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.930
 sees a bit of confusion that I am always 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.140
 famous endings resting on the machine 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.140
 to sew 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:22.760
 while I go on I always keep 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:27.010
 check that the fabric is 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.010
 correctly positioned in the center 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.510
 also while the worry always holds 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:40.959
 a finger here to prevent transportation 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:44.480
 then of the sewing machine 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:50.500
 above the trimmings more respect 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:57.320
 at the bottom there would be something more or less 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:04:01.640
 so therefore to avoid inconveniences 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:05.480
 given by data from the transport I keep well 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.989
 firm it confirms the above of the pasta 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.989
 but maria 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:47.990
 I stop often I do not run check not 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.990
 they are jobs that must be done in a hurry 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:21.509
 we also check to have taken the 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.509
 backward trill is perfect 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.330
 since this tablecloth is a tablecloth 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.790
 winter is made with a fabric 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:57.760
 really very big having done the 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.770
 cut and sew or logic tag before 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.150
 starting to work helps us 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:06.760
 very much because if in addition to having to 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.850
 check that the culture of 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.030
 trimmings are fine we should have 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:15.910
 also pay attention to power 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.040
 stretches to the fillets that we found 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:21.840
 for the hands it would have really been 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.840
 much more complicated 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.590
 ok 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.350
 now he has continued the long seam 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.470
 around the perimeter and soon you will have 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.810
 finished well I hope I was 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.650
 quite clear with the explanation e 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.710
 if there is something I don't d 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:06.410
 there is clear you can leave questions 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.410
 in the comments and thanks hello
