just<00:00:54.090> about<00:00:54.180> technique<00:00:54.860> but<00:00:55.860> also<00:00:55.890> about

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
just about technique but also about

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.280 
just about technique but also about
making<00:00:56.640> sure<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.060> clubs<00:00:57.480> suited<00:00:58.140> to

the<00:01:01.500> swing<00:01:01.860> and<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.790> club's<00:01:03.090> maybe<00:01:03.540> you're

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the swing and the club's maybe you're

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.380

hitting<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.040> great<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> great<00:01:06.119> swing

if her game goes off the ball a little
bit<00:01:44.999> we<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.170> bring<00:01:46.770> her<00:01:46.920> back<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
bit we can then bring her back in and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.980 
bit we can then bring her back in and
say<00:01:47.909> okay<00:01:48.209> let's<00:01:48.479> hit<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> couple<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.929> shots

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
