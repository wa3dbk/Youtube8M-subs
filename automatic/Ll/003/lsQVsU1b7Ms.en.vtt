00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
Henry's character and will they have

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.719 
Henry's character and will they have
good<00:01:48.810> chemistry<00:01:49.220> probably<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.520> series

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
good chemistry probably as the series

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.399 
good chemistry probably as the series
goes<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.810> what<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> think<00:01:52.200> about

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
goes on but what do I think about

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.319 
goes on but what do I think about
forever<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.250> thought<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.880> really<00:01:54.149> solid

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
forever I thought this is a really solid

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.569 
forever I thought this is a really solid
pilot<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.110> one<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> best<00:01:55.860> pilots<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.399> saw

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
pilot it's one of the best pilots I saw

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.600 
pilot it's one of the best pilots I saw
during<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.299> Paley<00:01:57.630> Center<00:01:57.659> uh<00:01:58.200> fall<00:01:59.189> TV

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
during the Paley Center uh fall TV

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.880 
during the Paley Center uh fall TV
previews<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.570> did<00:02:00.750> see<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.930> good<00:02:01.530> amount<00:02:01.740> of

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
previews and I did see a good amount of

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.490 
previews and I did see a good amount of
pilot<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.689> forever<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:04.049> thought<00:02:04.170> I'd<00:02:04.229> had

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
pilot so forever I just thought I'd had

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.010 
pilot so forever I just thought I'd had
a<00:02:04.530> really<00:02:04.860> good<00:02:05.100> concept<00:02:05.640> but<00:02:05.880> also<00:02:06.390> working

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
a really good concept but also working

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.960 
a really good concept but also working
in<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.890> procedural<00:02:08.340> show<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.670> we've<00:02:08.789> seen

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
in a procedural show that we've seen

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.729 
in a procedural show that we've seen
hundreds<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.690> times<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:10.110> seen<00:02:10.319> these<00:02:10.500> shows

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
hundreds of times we seen these shows

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.040 
hundreds of times we seen these shows
they're<00:02:11.099> all<00:02:11.250> over<00:02:11.550> network<00:02:12.510> television

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
they're all over network television

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.340 
they're all over network television
yeah<00:02:13.710> Castle<00:02:14.370> yeah<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:15.270> know<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.720> see<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.080> yes

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
yeah Castle yeah you know and see I yes

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.960 
yeah Castle yeah you know and see I yes
you<00:02:16.380> have<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.950> shows<00:02:17.160> but<00:02:17.460> with<00:02:17.610> forever

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
you have all the shows but with forever

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.020 
you have all the shows but with forever
they<00:02:18.300> put<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.780> twist<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.740> that<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.730> that

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
they put a twist to it and that is that

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.060 
they put a twist to it and that is that
this<00:02:21.180> guy<00:02:21.390> could<00:02:21.420> last<00:02:22.170> forever<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.770> he<00:02:22.830> comes

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
this guy could last forever and he comes

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.710 
this guy could last forever and he comes
back<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.520> life<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.210> think<00:02:24.450> that's

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
back to life and I think that's

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.150 
back to life and I think that's
something<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.410> got<00:02:25.650> me<00:02:25.770> really<00:02:25.800> interested

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
something that got me really interested

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.580 
something that got me really interested
in<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> show<00:02:26.880> also<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.990> chemistry<00:02:28.410> between

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
in the show also the chemistry between

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.100 
in the show also the chemistry between
the<00:02:29.070> woman<00:02:29.400> cop<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.910> Henry's<00:02:30.330> character<00:02:30.840> I

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
the woman cop and Henry's character I

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.380 
the woman cop and Henry's character I
thought<00:02:31.830> their<00:02:31.980> chemistry<00:02:32.250> was<00:02:32.490> great<00:02:33.120> it

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
thought their chemistry was great it

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.850 
thought their chemistry was great it
worked<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:33.840> well<00:02:33.870> there's<00:02:34.380> some<00:02:34.530> really<00:02:34.680> good

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.140 
comedy bits here and I like that she's
starting<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.040> get<00:02:38.130> suspicious<00:02:38.280> about<00:02:38.790> him<00:02:38.970> we

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
starting to get suspicious about him we

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.710 
do good see that she's a little
suspicious<00:02:40.700> maybe<00:02:41.700> not<00:02:41.880> him<00:02:42.060> being<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.360> forever

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
suspicious maybe not him being a forever

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.930

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
a lot of things happen is like but also

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.000 
a lot of things happen is like but also
they<00:03:05.900> kept<00:03:06.900> enough<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.470> mystery<00:03:07.830> that

and I was a little upset because I feel

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.930 
and I was a little upset because I feel
like<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.320> would<00:03:37.830> have<00:03:37.950> been<00:03:38.070> interesting<00:03:38.340> to

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
like it would have been interesting to

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.750 
like it would have been interesting to
see<00:03:39.180> her<00:03:40.020> via<00:03:40.739> forever<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.400> then<00:03:41.520> work

see her via forever and then work

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.640 
see her via forever and then work

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.410 
together as a someone that's a new or
forever<00:03:43.920> doesn't<00:03:44.280> know<00:03:44.489> what's<00:03:44.700> going<00:03:44.760> on<00:03:45.120> is

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
someone has been dealing with this all

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.800 
someone has been dealing with this all
talk<00:03:47.220> i<00:03:47.400> think<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:47.940> would<00:03:48.120> mean<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.420> their

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
talk i think that would mean that their

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.840 
talk i think that would mean that their
chemistry<00:03:49.110> even<00:03:49.470> better<00:03:49.650> but<00:03:50.489> they<00:03:50.580> kind<00:03:50.790> of

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
chemistry even better but they kind of

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.430 
chemistry even better but they kind of
lost<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.239> opportunity<00:03:51.330> in<00:03:51.989> this<00:03:52.140> episode

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
lost the opportunity in this episode

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.199 
lost the opportunity in this episode
maybe<00:03:52.860> as<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.160> series<00:03:53.340> goes<00:03:53.459> on<00:03:53.760> we'll<00:03:53.970> see

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
maybe as the series goes on we'll see

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.360 
maybe as the series goes on we'll see
her<00:03:54.300> die<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:55.020> she<00:03:55.230> could<00:03:55.380> become<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.680> forever<00:03:56.040> I

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
her die it she could become a forever I

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.979 
her die it she could become a forever I
feel<00:03:56.610> like<00:03:56.820> that's<00:03:57.000> gonna<00:03:57.209> happen<00:03:57.390> to<00:03:57.780> share

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
feel like that's gonna happen to share

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.870 
feel like that's gonna happen to share
one<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.260> these<00:03:58.380> seasons<00:03:58.860> I<00:03:59.100> just<00:03:59.610> have<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.730> gut

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
one of these seasons I just have a gut

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.120 
one of these seasons I just have a gut
feeling<00:03:59.940> I<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:01.110> would<00:04:01.470> like<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.650> see<00:04:01.890> that<00:04:02.100> I

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
feeling I I would like to see that I

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.699 
feeling I I would like to see that I
think<00:04:02.430> I'd<00:04:02.520> be<00:04:02.580> interesting<00:04:03.209> but<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.840> thought

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
think I'd be interesting but I thought

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.470 
think I'd be interesting but I thought
they<00:04:04.830> lost<00:04:05.040> our<00:04:05.220> opportunity<00:04:05.700> with<00:04:05.880> that<00:04:06.120> but

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
they lost our opportunity with that but

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.150 
they lost our opportunity with that but
I<00:04:06.750> think<00:04:06.989> there's<00:04:07.320> other<00:04:07.470> farmers<00:04:07.920> out<00:04:08.100> there

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
I think there's other farmers out there

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.300 
I think there's other farmers out there
so<00:04:08.760> I'm<00:04:09.630> intrigued<00:04:10.410> with<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.620> show<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:11.160> don't

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
so I'm intrigued with the show I don't

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.680 
so I'm intrigued with the show I don't
know<00:04:11.400> if<00:04:11.489> this<00:04:11.580> will<00:04:11.760> be<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:11.910> show<00:04:12.150> where<00:04:12.420> I'll

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.720

watch<00:04:12.870> exactly<00:04:13.320> on<00:04:13.620> time<00:04:13.860> but<00:04:14.430> I<00:04:14.489> feel<00:04:14.640> like

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
watch exactly on time but I feel like

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.310 
watch exactly on time but I feel like
this<00:04:14.910> will<00:04:15.030> be<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> hulu<00:04:15.540> show<00:04:15.780> for<00:04:16.049> me<00:04:16.140> i'll

liked<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.530> again<00:04:22.830> heavy<00:04:23.190> she<00:04:23.430> was<00:04:23.580> really<00:04:23.760> good

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
liked it again heavy she was really good

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.559 
liked it again heavy she was really good
concept<00:04:25.039> was<00:04:25.190> really<00:04:25.400> well<00:04:25.550> done<00:04:25.580> if<00:04:26.120> you<00:04:26.360> want

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:26.569 
concept was really well done if you want

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:28.629

a<00:04:26.629> good<00:04:27.020> procedural<00:04:27.560> show<00:04:27.740> that's<00:04:28.009> different

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
a good procedural show that's different

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.520 
a good procedural show that's different
watch<00:04:29.300> this<00:04:29.509> I<00:04:29.720> think<00:04:29.960> this<00:04:30.050> will<00:04:30.169> be<00:04:30.229> a<00:04:30.319> great

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
watch this I think this will be a great

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.650 
watch this I think this will be a great
tag<00:04:30.860> team<00:04:30.889> with<00:04:31.250> castle<00:04:31.759> or<00:04:31.940> if<00:04:32.060> castle<00:04:32.449> ends

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
tag team with castle or if castle ends

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.930 
tag team with castle or if castle ends
maybe<00:04:33.139> this<00:04:33.409> will<00:04:33.590> replace<00:04:33.710> castle<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:34.639> just

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
maybe this will replace castle I just

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.029 
maybe this will replace castle I just
think<00:04:35.060> it's<00:04:35.240> odd<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.360> great<00:04:35.690> network<00:04:36.169> and<00:04:36.470> I

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039
