00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.300
 Hi good evening 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.450
 This time, able to work its because I got a few high of rubber 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.380
 summer 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.950
 Try to make it known 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:24.060
 I thought it was a little good and I would like to introduce it 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:25.510
 I introduced a table tennis professional racket and a violin racket 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.210
 It is a person 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:34.070
 Passawa you have forgotten your password 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:37.000
 So, because I made a new community to create Ryuji pasad 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.829
 My videos do not have that video 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.100
 Well, because we introduce the same house 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.300
 This too 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.300
 Please see 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:52.130
 Pet 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.130
 The first to go high is the end of the grain height is 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.170
 is 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:05.210
 It is the amount to sculpt attached 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:07.360
 Well I was told that my friend changed to a new string height 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.950
 Well originally Chin Dagan 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.450
 I'm not a player I'm there in a little more beneath 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.230
 This is real 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.270
 Yes 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.230
 I stayed a while ago but it 's a bit wet 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.280
 So great 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.280
 Over is thin grain 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.940
 It is amazingly soft , so here 's the world's best 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.940
 Shape ratio 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.900
 in a high-quality certified Durban 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.770
 I'll 9 oh well I do not know well to say the world one 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.850
 Is it the feeling that it is the softest in the world ? 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.990
 I length of grain is 1.6 mm quite high 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.810
 Most answers that are super large 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.670
 It's like having no sponge 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:57.409
 I felt that it was so soft and there were question changes 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.860
 Well I'm going back interesting once batch year rubber is boost tc also before 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.070
 Do you think that you introduced 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.229
 It is brother of let 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.229
 Yes this is real 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:14.330
 Yes racket is the rear Rocks end point 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.200
 Try sticking this grain height to this and the bracket 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.430
 More than I thought it was amazing 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:26.819
 Why and this village and this village 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:31.980
 It is really superior in the attack performance if you stick the particle height that it is easy to attack it 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.060
 In addition, I can do a block well, I can do a block to stop firmly when I stay 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.650
 The 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:42.780
 If the other party is loop driven, push 6 knuckle push out and it will not be rolled anymore 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.630
 Also referred to as 1 aircraft if we rely on was to fallen no longer enter frozen immediately in net issues 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.950
 And it can attack 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.880
 Even if you loop well, you can also aim the counter lightly by putting your own pan 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.470
 You 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:03:01.010
 I was able to say that the other party was doing a pachi that has made one point appear 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:02.660
 When I was attacked 2 times and blocked, it would be light if there was a point that I followed 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.620
 If you block 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.600
 You get knuckle of the rotation feeling is 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.240
 see 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:15.310
 Not be a little quit when people use really it is recommended Epstein grain sales to try this once 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.590
 It is aggression if it is the stability or pie power 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.280
 This bag is Maamu cane 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.280
 I tried using it 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:28.439
 Stop here 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:30.359
 Hitting whether then in here in the rotation Toka mother Re bag When you come softening chance ball was 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:35.579
 Foremost and block here 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:37.240
 Toka occasionally or such tricks in the usual pen of push in here at the center 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.180
 Fore is a Attari to the chamber 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.680
 I can do that 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:48.310
 I think this is a very good combination 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:51.760
 Well Nittaku of but I think that people who know you racket and say, this Riarokku' is less 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.280
 Really because these feelings rocket cat of light Harbor 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.380
 I think it's a very good company 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.310
 Yes 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:04.709
 Well, it 's not a user, but it has been a feature 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.709
 If 1000 was Thank you Gozama me look Well
