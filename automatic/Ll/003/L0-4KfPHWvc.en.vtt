00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
I'm the one who has to decide that it's

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.120 
I'm the one who has to decide that it's
going<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.090> happen<00:03:31.300> yeah<00:03:31.989> before<00:03:32.650> it<00:03:32.920> can

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
going to happen yeah before it can

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.520 
going to happen yeah before it can
happen<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:34.330> I<00:03:34.630> guess<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.989> hardest<00:03:35.290> thing<00:03:35.500> for

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
happen and I guess the hardest thing for

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.860 
happen and I guess the hardest thing for
me<00:03:35.739> is<00:03:35.890> kind<00:03:36.520> of<00:03:36.640> just<00:03:36.760> sitting<00:03:37.150> here<00:03:37.390> every

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
me is kind of just sitting here every

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.310 
me is kind of just sitting here every
day<00:03:38.049> going<00:03:38.950> through<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.310> motions<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:40.320> really

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
day going through the motions and really

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.699 
day going through the motions and really
trying<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.010> tap<00:03:42.400> into<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:42.910> mentality<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:44.080> I

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
trying to tap into that mentality that I

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.850 
trying to tap into that mentality that I
can<00:03:45.070> actually<00:03:45.250> be<00:03:45.820> something<00:03:46.570> even<00:03:47.530> though

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
can actually be something even though

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.070 
can actually be something even though
I'm<00:03:48.400> kind<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.850> just<00:03:49.030> sitting<00:03:49.269> here<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.660> it's

I'm kind of just sitting here and it's
all<00:03:50.410> with<00:03:51.160> that<00:03:51.340> mental<00:03:51.790> aspect<00:03:52.500> doesn't<00:03:53.500> get

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
all with that mental aspect doesn't get

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.140 
all with that mental aspect doesn't get
better<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.250> Ken<00:03:54.430> right<00:03:54.670> because<00:03:54.910> it<00:03:55.030> yeah

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
exactly you could think of any number of

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.240 
exactly you could think of any number of
ways<00:03:57.790> at<00:03:58.090> every<00:03:58.390> every<00:03:58.780> day<00:03:59.019> so<00:03:59.620> any<00:03:59.830> little

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
ways at every every day so any little
