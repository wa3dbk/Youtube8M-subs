00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
string at fret one now it's important to

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.580 
string at fret one now it's important to
realize<00:02:32.359> that<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.840> should<00:02:33.049> put<00:02:33.230> your<00:02:33.260> finger

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
right next to the fret not on top of it

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.960 
right next to the fret not on top of it
and<00:02:35.750> not<00:02:36.409> too<00:02:36.650> far<00:02:36.980> this<00:02:37.129> way<00:02:37.189> either<00:02:37.609> you

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
and not too far this way either you

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.460 
and not too far this way either you
should<00:02:38.150> put<00:02:38.299> it<00:02:38.390> right<00:02:38.659> next<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:39.079> the<00:02:39.200> friend

should put it right next to the friend

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.800 
should put it right next to the friend
that's<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.859> perfect<00:02:40.040> place<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:41.180> if<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.599> use<00:02:41.780> a

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
that's the perfect place so if you use a

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.399 
that's the perfect place so if you use a
plectrum<00:02:42.379> to<00:02:42.620> give<00:02:42.799> that<00:02:43.310> string<00:02:43.579> of<00:02:43.700> pluck

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
plectrum to give that string of pluck

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.869 
plectrum to give that string of pluck
and<00:02:45.409> then<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:45.829> can<00:02:45.980> use<00:02:46.099> your<00:02:46.250> middle<00:02:46.400> finger

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
and then you can use your middle finger

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.959 
and then you can use your middle finger
to<00:02:46.909> step<00:02:47.329> on<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.720> fret<00:02:48.109> too<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.700> then<00:02:49.849> the

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:49.969 
to step on to fret too and then the

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.780 
to step on to fret too and then the
third<00:02:50.150> finger<00:02:50.540> on<00:02:50.599> to<00:02:50.750> fret<00:02:50.959> 3<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.519> little

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
third finger on to fret 3 and the little

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.140 
third finger on to fret 3 and the little
finger<00:02:53.000> on<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.359> fret<00:02:53.540> for<00:02:54.099> good<00:02:55.099> and<00:02:55.730> then<00:02:56.000> once

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
finger on to fret for good and then once

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.690 
finger on to fret for good and then once
you've<00:02:56.269> done<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.750> can<00:02:56.780> step<00:02:57.139> backwards

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
you've done that you can step backwards

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.929 
you've done that you can step backwards
form<00:02:58.780> fret<00:02:59.780> 3<00:03:00.669> to<00:03:01.959> fret<00:03:02.959> one<00:03:03.489> now<00:03:04.489> there<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:04.909> a

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
form fret 3 to fret one now there is a

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.819 
form fret 3 to fret one now there is a
reason<00:03:05.540> I'm<00:03:05.659> asking<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:06.049> to<00:03:06.200> do<00:03:06.379> this<00:03:06.409> I<00:03:06.769> know

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
reason I'm asking you to do this I know

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.220 
reason I'm asking you to do this I know
it<00:03:07.010> seems<00:03:07.220> simple<00:03:07.879> but<00:03:07.909> it's<00:03:08.419> important<00:03:09.049> at

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
it seems simple but it's important at

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.659 
it seems simple but it's important at
this<00:03:09.379> stage<00:03:09.439> that<00:03:09.709> you<00:03:10.010> learn<00:03:10.159> to<00:03:10.340> spread<00:03:10.639> your

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
this stage that you learn to spread your

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.580 
this stage that you learn to spread your

and the flexibility in your fingers

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.780 
and the flexibility in your fingers
because<00:03:15.260> unfortunately<00:03:15.530> some<00:03:16.159> people<00:03:16.459> get

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
because unfortunately some people get

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.369 
because unfortunately some people get
into<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.120> bad<00:03:17.299> habit<00:03:17.510> of<00:03:17.720> learning<00:03:18.139> to<00:03:18.260> play

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
repeatedly and to build the speed and

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.380 
repeatedly and to build the speed and
the<00:04:08.439> smoothness<00:04:08.920> that<00:04:09.250> you<00:04:09.549> can<00:04:09.730> play<00:04:09.909> it<00:04:09.939> so

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
the smoothness that you can play it so

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.480 

and<00:04:29.050> carry<00:04:29.320> on<00:04:29.410> through<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.860> guitar<00:04:30.190> on<00:04:30.340> each

and

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.300 

okay<00:04:44.389> so<00:04:44.780> remember<00:04:45.169> it's<00:04:45.500> not<00:04:45.650> a<00:04:45.710> race<00:04:45.979> it's

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
okay so remember it's not a race it's

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.920 
okay so remember it's not a race it's
not<00:04:46.430> important<00:04:46.970> that<00:04:47.120> you<00:04:47.180> play<00:04:47.419> it<00:04:47.539> as<00:04:47.659> fast

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
not important that you play it as fast

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.300 
not important that you play it as fast
as<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.169> can<00:04:48.409> what's<00:04:48.710> important<00:04:49.099> at<00:04:49.190> this

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
as you can what's important at this

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.100 
as you can what's important at this
stage<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:49.879> you<00:04:50.240> learn<00:04:50.389> to<00:04:50.569> hold<00:04:50.750> down<00:04:50.990> the

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
stage is you learn to hold down the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.839 
stage is you learn to hold down the
notes<00:04:51.349> you<00:04:51.919> know<00:04:52.039> we're<00:04:52.250> learning<00:04:52.340> to<00:04:52.610> pluck

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
notes you know we're learning to pluck

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:54.309 
notes you know we're learning to pluck
the<00:04:52.940> strings<00:04:53.240> with<00:04:53.419> the<00:04:53.509> plectrum<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:54.199> we're

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 
the strings with the plectrum and we're

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.540 
the strings with the plectrum and we're
learning<00:04:54.409> to<00:04:54.650> spread<00:04:54.919> our<00:04:55.039> fingers<00:04:55.400> like

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
learning to spread our fingers like

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.430 
learning to spread our fingers like
that's<00:04:55.759> what's<00:04:56.000> important<00:04:56.569> but<00:04:56.990> I<00:04:57.020> do<00:04:57.110> want

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
that's what's important but I do want

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.689 
that's what's important but I do want
you<00:04:57.470> to<00:04:57.560> challenge<00:04:57.889> yourself<00:04:58.129> and<00:04:58.520> push

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
you to challenge yourself and push

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.790 
you to challenge yourself and push
yourself<00:04:59.120> and<00:04:59.330> build<00:04:59.479> your<00:04:59.690> speed<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.050> by<00:05:00.620> all

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
yourself and build your speed and by all

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.499 
yourself and build your speed and by all
means<00:05:00.830> see<00:05:01.550> if<00:05:01.639> you<00:05:01.759> can<00:05:01.879> get<00:05:02.060> it<00:05:02.150> going<00:05:02.419> as

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
means see if you can get it going as

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:03.760 
means see if you can get it going as
fast<00:05:02.690> as<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.050> can<00:05:03.229> and<00:05:03.409> that<00:05:03.530> would<00:05:03.650> be

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
fast as you can and that would be

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.399 
fast as you can and that would be
brilliant

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.189
