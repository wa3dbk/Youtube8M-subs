00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 the trailer was awesome waging hall is the 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.879
 the main actor can actually still 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.160
 go a lot wrong 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.160
 and that's about soft power now 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.180
 I had a tough fight ahead of me 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.430
 you know i have my family a lot 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:23.590
 The harder part of the text 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.480
 selection but you are just stuck 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.700
 too much before you explode 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.380
 can not you keep thinking about it 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:43.120
 Our daughter what I still tell you 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:45.660
 I did not want to stand here and mine 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.660
 Ms. Morin 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.470
 this dish knows about the serious 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.370
 fate that hit her family 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.140
 it would have to have lifted nevertheless they have extremely 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.760
 Violent behavior is shown and 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.600
 the supervision duty for your child roughly 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.760
 neglected you need help to 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.440
 that means a whole year locked 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.360
 Now the care for the child arrives 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.950
 remains so long at the youth office until the 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.630
 father can make the court credible 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.630
 that he has grown to the responsibility 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.430
 should I come in with it I have to 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.000
 Alone make your willi lifted in 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.950
 my job place to train only if 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.869
 you keep to our rules I want 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.110
 Do not lose my daughter for doing that 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.110
 Me everything 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.450
 I know that you do not you 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.909
 Do not even know your daughter today 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.679
 Do not see them I say they are 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.679
 that they hate you she needs that 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.380
 Do you want to fight for the title again ? 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.650
 do you think you can beat him? 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.480
 not without you I will fight and 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.390
 I 'll get my child back then I'll be 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.910
 win on this fight 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.319
 the chances are bad for the 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.350
 say you can not do it you are 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.610
 finished that's a chance show him you 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.610
 have your fate in your hands 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.819
 hard and 24 minutes is the 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.400
 released twelve years and starts 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.989
 the 20 august 2015 in the german 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.730
 cinemas and tells the story of 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.930
 billi lifted played by Jake Gyllenhaal 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.849
 he is a 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.620
 first heavyweight champion 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.390
 one of the box like no one else's 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.579
 in the ring unbelievably much fits but 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.319
 Only one he always offers a big one 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.760
 and good show and is like an animal in the 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.709
 ring and is happy with his wife 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.939
 and his daughter at the side of one 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.769
 day it comes to an incident 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.239
 I will not build anything exactly what 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.620
 But above all, it's tragic 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.810
 event stands in the foreground that the 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.280
 family is almost tearing and it will be 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.930
 the self to the degree of alcohol 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.150
 partly also to drugs but above all 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.980
 in a downward spiral ultimately 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.629
 because there are running costs and 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.159
 he can hardly make money he ends up 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.780
 faster in the street than he can see 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.189
 can and the youth office can think 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.840
 this father still for his 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.609
 be responsible for the daughter and the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.959
 deals with the care deprived is so 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.180
 the story and the case of a man 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.250
 the top is down and falls 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.870
 I do not want that I want for 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.760
 the love of my life finally 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.290
 his daughter will go every inch and 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.819
 the right person to be that 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.040
 right does and so is a typical 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.199
 Outsider story with a lot of crass 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.849
 action in the boxing ring that looks like 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:47.680
 it would be a crossover from moriya and 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.629
 Rocky is incredibly happy because 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.129
 basically it's an underdog story 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.419
 the audience can always be good with her 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.000
 identify with director Antoine 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.590
 fuka one of them too uneven 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.750
 has presented very strong films in the 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.340
 Cinemas here a drama and athlete drama 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.959
 counts where I feel a lot with 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.180
 musical standing to the boxing ring 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.280
 accompanied and jake gyllenhaal out 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.989
 trained like no other and also 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.639
 In the box sequences it looks like he does 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.260
 the month for that boxed 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.790
 very fine but especially the 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.590
 go deeply emotional moments this 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.150
 movie is almost so terrible that 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.620
 I was a tear in the one or the other 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.810
 had to move away because always 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.039
 if you think about these 124 minutes 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.750
 when will the hope come? 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.880
 I call this man popular for nothing 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.050
 gets darker and darker at the end of the tunnel 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.430
 which is still worse it goes 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.080
 still downhill again 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.310
 that it is hard to bear that then 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.979
 I honestly say the press comments 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.720
 around the car are pretty good but me 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.940
 I am overwhelmed by the film for me 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.530
 It is one of the movies where I hoped 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.720
 that the group became good but he became 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.550
 terrific he has me emotionally in the cinema 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.740
 totally packed and the strip the 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.229
 fighter warrior rocky and co mag should 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.139
 be sure to look at one of the 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.580
 do not share the box 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.349
 has become too big and the dramatic 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.180
 Definitely attack history behind it 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.740
 Jackson once again shows more water 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.389
 can and especially last midnight 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.159
 crawler and that shows again now 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.550
 how was transformation this man reaches 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.870
 is a hammer is under me 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.639
 others must also say he 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.439
 definitely a special praise for that 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.180
 forest whitaker as a supporting actor and 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.710
 Coach from him later a great 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.389
 performance delivers rachel mcadams 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.099
 just like the little girl his 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.990
 daughter schmidt absolutely out strongly 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.249
 Sticht works in the cast works 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.289
 in a heavily written script and 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:20.569
 great and 50 cent in the dialog 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.860
 partly co-produced schmidt yes 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.289
 also an important figure himself 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.689
 delivers absolutely brilliant from should mean 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.969
 strong car strong book tacke optics 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:31.340
 great music I have nothing to complain about 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:33.469
 At least he almost gets me in his 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.969
 genre as a sportsman drama surprising 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:36.740
 and I have to say from my point of view 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:38.930
 quite rightly ten out of ten possible 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.669
 overall, one of these films scores points 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.560
 you should have seen and i have 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.150
 For a long time he considers ten points of war 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.860
 new war of the 8 that is always so 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.330
 the area where i say you should 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.069
 see and I think if one 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.569
 Genre 10 may be missing 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:51.889
 a little icing is maybe 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.659
 a little more surprise 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.370
 it gets like all in all just because of that 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.020
 absolutely hammer in quotation marks 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.000
 He scored nine out of ten possible points 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.189
 But listen to the genre rating and a lot 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.509
 fun in the construction of the is because he 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:03.919
 probably also a little smaller 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.210
 hire comes a movie which most 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.159
 probably not at all in the cinema 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.629
 at the latest on blu-ray or dvd her 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.370
 will not regret it 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:11.960
 I'm on my reviews 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.550
 full load like a thumb there if he 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.379
 they liked that is not with me 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.939
 otherwise that you know there is still one 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:18.680
 few left around me and tomorrow at 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:21.199
 15 o'clock of course later that one us 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.990
 new video and until then I hope since 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:25.990
 weeks again, of course, by 3
