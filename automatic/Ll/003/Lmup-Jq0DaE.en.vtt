government<00:04:06.500> has<00:04:06.860> all<00:04:06.980> this<00:04:07.040> information<00:04:07.599> when

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
government has all this information when

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.690 
government has all this information when
you<00:04:08.750> look<00:04:09.079> at<00:04:09.319> some<00:04:09.769> of<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:09.920> stuff<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.250> NSA<00:04:10.670> is

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
you look at some of the stuff the NSA is

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.509 
you look at some of the stuff the NSA is
doing<00:04:10.849> now<00:04:11.380> they're<00:04:12.380> bypassing<00:04:12.980> the

doing now they're bypassing the
cryptography<00:04:14.150> now<00:04:14.870> you<00:04:14.930> have<00:04:15.290> an<00:04:15.410> encrypted
