00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hi everyone, my name is jeca and today we go. 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.649
 read has the series or books I want 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.849
 reread one day and this is very difficult to 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.849
 do but let's go 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.420
 one thing that is very important you 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.550
 to know about me is that I 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.740
 I usually do not reveal books because 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.869
 first because there are so many other books 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.840
 I also want to read what to bring back 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.760
 go back and reread a book I've already read and 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.650
 The second thing is that I lack time because I 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.300
 I also want to read all the books I 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.910
 I still want to read in my life. 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.160
 Another reason is because usually when 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.080
 reading a book, we do not feel 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.360
 relation to him how we felt in the 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.579
 first time jack lew do not have the 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.589
 same emotions is not the same as you 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.449
 already waiting if you already know what's going to happen 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.979
 So a book has to be for years. 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.860
 after I read for at least 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.510
 forget but what happens in the book well 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.489
 I will now start taking this the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.260
 way because everyone knows that it will 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.150
 be on the list and of course one of the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.140
 series I would like to read is the series 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.330
 Harry Potter 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.390
 this is my favorite series of books 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.060
 until today I love harry potter so with 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.610
 You all love too, so I hope. 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.420
 that one day I have time to invest 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.530
 new in the seven books in the series because 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.450
 I've been feeling a lot lately 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.900
 nostalgic the book that I really want 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.070
 he is player number 12 I blend into 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.570
 I do not have a physical copy that 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.790
 Unfortunately to show you more. 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.920
 I'll put the image of him here I 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.409
 I really enjoyed this book when he 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.020
 for the first time a year and a half more 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.909
 or less that I read but I will not read 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.500
 now because I still remember the 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.050
 things that happened free of Flemish 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.600
 fresh in memory what happens one 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.120
 book then test but I do not know about five 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.990
 years there to forget completely 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.090
 although I think we're going to make a 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.700
 book movie may not have law before 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.320
 I do not know, I just know the player is not in the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.909
 list of the ones I most want to read too 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.580
 is on the list the book divergent from 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.040
 VerÃ´nica Block I spoke the book because 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.140
 do not talk the series, I really did 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.120
 My favorite book in the series and I have 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.890
 want to reread it only because it was 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.170
 the only book that really made me so 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.629
 so let my heavenly god that 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.190
 show this series maybe i'll reread 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.380
 selective insurgent 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.000
 But this really was mine. 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.670
 for the moment the only one who has 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.800
 willingness to re - read is a series 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.960
 I want to reread it's gym 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.100
 shell beach vampires the first time 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.110
 that I was on my way to bankers who 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.030
 right after it's twilight but 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.640
 really kung fu academy is very 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.410
 better than twilight and I stayed 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.690
 addict said but in those books when 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.580
 I started to read these she had only the three 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.710
 first books so it's all like this 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.750
 one followed by the other and then obviously 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.790
 I was reading as they left the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.010
 videos in the United States but I liked it 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.360
 A lot of vampire academy I 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.820
 I really do not have time to 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.720
 to invest in six books of a series that 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.060
 I've already read 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.130
 so one day maybe I'll reread 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.320
 vampire academy until I want 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.720
 read patient series not necessarily 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.280
 you need it and that's for the other but he is 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.320
 good at least to know what happens 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.300
 but I will not I will not start another 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.130
 yes he is the one from here I'm sure 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.540
 in the other it makes a celebrated in which 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.320
 happens in this series that you're sure 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.630
 absolute then but I want to elect more 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.370
 I want to read yes on the way to vampire or 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.709
 another series that I want it not going to 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.690
 no surprise no one is a throne 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.660
 glass of headquarters and messi 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.790
 I love it, it's not even over yet. 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.040
 I just want to reread the series I really 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.020
 I really need to read it again because 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.459
 there's a lot going on in the rivers 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.530
 I no longer remember 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.810
 and I need to remember what happens 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.520
 to read the next book 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.920
 But I do not think this is going to happen. 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.720
 I can not read until September 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.040
 when the fourth book came out I really 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.540
 wish I had time to see me this 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.940
 series at least three first books 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.130
 thence the fourth began, and so on 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.840
 we know how it's time is fact 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.420
 Time only lacks time a book that I 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.400
 I need urgently to re-read college 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.310
 nilo state the first time i read 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.290
 I apparently did not like it but then the 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.700
 that we think about the book and from there I 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.290
 I began to remember that I actually had 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.060
 a good impression of the book I do not know 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.769
 Why had I given so much notice? 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.750
 which I tried for four stars that 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.269
 So I need to reread the book. 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.890
 buy the last two books in the series 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.640
 so I need recessive because I think 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.709
 I was wrong 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.720
 finished I need to read to see if 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.380
 I really was wrong or if I was 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.510
 certain 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.850
 in my opinion and lastly a series 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.430
 What I need to reread is made of smoking itself 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.500
 bone law get her I read this series in 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.890
 end of last year and beginning of this year 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.250
 and I feel like I was going there too fast 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.200
 to absorb what it really is 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.860
 beauty of whole-language writing is 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.510
 something exciting and I need to go back and 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.430
 read this series because not silvio 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.290
 I enjoyed it enough was a deal 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.180
 so very fast very intense 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.820
 relationship with her and I need 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.030
 go back and read again and really 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.030
 to take advantage of the beauty that is 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.490
 this series because it's very very good 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.140
 seriously very good people very personal and 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.180
 sesc were the books that would 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.250
