00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
travel is a little bit different than a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.960 
travel is a little bit different than a
lot<00:01:18.080> of<00:01:18.320> people<00:01:18.590> maybe<00:01:18.800> go<00:01:19.040> on<00:01:19.160> vacation<00:01:19.729> and

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.350 

when<00:01:30.110> we<00:01:30.260> travel<00:01:30.710> being<00:01:31.190> in<00:01:31.370> the<00:01:31.490> car<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:31.970> this

when we travel being in the car is this

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.480 
when we travel being in the car is this
kind<00:01:32.659> of<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.990> destination<00:01:33.710> it's<00:01:34.070> not<00:01:34.220> about

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
kind of the destination it's not about

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.780 
kind of the destination it's not about
us<00:01:34.550> making<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.660> home<00:01:35.870> from<00:01:36.320> Alaska<00:01:37.190> it's<00:01:37.430> it's

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
us making it home from Alaska it's it's

00:01:37.790 --> 00:02:14.080 
us making it home from Alaska it's it's
just<00:01:38.030> about<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.390> experience<00:01:39.020> of<00:01:39.170> driving

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.140 

first<00:02:14.780> 100<00:02:15.319> miles<00:02:15.500> went<00:02:15.860> really<00:02:16.489> smoothly<00:02:16.849> I

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
first 100 miles went really smoothly I

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.330 
first 100 miles went really smoothly I
think<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.540> only<00:02:17.660> little<00:02:18.500> glitch<00:02:18.739> we<00:02:18.950> had<00:02:19.099> was

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
think the only little glitch we had was

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.970 
think the only little glitch we had was
the<00:02:19.610> fuel<00:02:20.180> gauge<00:02:20.390> not<00:02:20.989> being<00:02:21.560> completely

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
the fuel gauge not being completely

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.880 
the fuel gauge not being completely
accurate<00:02:22.610> great<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:24.080> we<00:02:24.230> also<00:02:24.379> did<00:02:24.739> the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
accurate great and we also did the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.949 
accurate great and we also did the
protective<00:02:25.580> plastic<00:02:25.940> on<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.540> front<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:26.870> the

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
protective plastic on the front of the

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.619 
protective plastic on the front of the
car<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.650> protect<00:02:27.950> them<00:02:28.430> Rob<00:02:28.819> chips<00:02:29.180> along<00:02:29.480> the

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
car to protect them Rob chips along the

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:45.870 
car to protect them Rob chips along the
way

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.880 

because<00:02:46.880> vinegar<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.600> get<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.870> off<00:02:48.020> we're

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
because vinegar so to get it off we're

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.620 
because vinegar so to get it off we're
making<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.220> deal<00:02:49.400> with<00:02:49.520> limited<00:02:49.940> tools<00:02:50.180> on<00:02:50.510> the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
making a deal with limited tools on the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:59.680 
making a deal with limited tools on the
road<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:56.830> this<00:02:57.830> is<00:02:57.980> your<00:02:58.280> gas<00:02:58.490> gauge<00:02:58.790> basically

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
road so this is your gas gauge basically

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.800 
road so this is your gas gauge basically
there's<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.680> little<00:03:00.920> float<00:03:01.160> inside<00:03:01.670> here<00:03:02.030> it

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
there's a little float inside here it

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.300 
there's a little float inside here it
goes<00:03:03.020> up<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.290> down<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.680> tells<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:04.010> how<00:03:04.040> much

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
goes up and down and tells you how much

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.160 
goes up and down and tells you how much
fuel<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:04.760> have<00:03:06.100> looks<00:03:07.100> almost<00:03:07.280> brand<00:03:07.610> new<00:03:07.700> I

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
fuel you have looks almost brand new I

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.780 
fuel you have looks almost brand new I
had<00:03:09.170> no<00:03:09.320> idea<00:03:09.470> how<00:03:09.860> amazing<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.370> fuel<00:03:10.580> mileage

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
had no idea how amazing the fuel mileage

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.949 
had no idea how amazing the fuel mileage
was<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.300> that<00:03:11.420> car

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
was in that car

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.720 
was in that car
I<00:03:11.990> kind<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:12.740> thought<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.040> gas<00:03:13.220> gauge<00:03:13.490> was

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
I kind of thought the gas gauge was

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.520 
I kind of thought the gas gauge was
broken<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:14.780> was<00:03:14.900> expecting<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.500> be

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
broken so I was expecting it to be

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.380 
broken so I was expecting it to be
clogged<00:03:15.860> somewhere<00:03:16.280> in<00:03:16.370> here<00:03:16.520> but<00:03:16.790> as<00:03:17.000> I<00:03:17.330> said

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
clogged somewhere in here but as I said

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.350 
clogged somewhere in here but as I said
it's<00:03:17.660> it's<00:03:18.410> fine<00:03:18.820> ten<00:03:19.820> years<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.150> building

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
it's it's fine ten years of building

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.940 
it's it's fine ten years of building
these<00:03:20.480> cars<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:20.959> I'm<00:03:21.050> still<00:03:21.440> wrong<00:03:21.650> all<00:03:21.860> the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
these cars and I'm still wrong all the

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.360 
these cars and I'm still wrong all the
