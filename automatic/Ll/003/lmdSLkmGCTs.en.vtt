in<00:00:05.130> this<00:00:05.430> video<00:00:05.790> I'm<00:00:06.029> going<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.359> show<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.569> how

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.750 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:06.899> avoid<00:00:07.290> spacing<00:00:07.919> problems<00:00:08.340> when<00:00:08.580> using

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
to avoid spacing problems when using

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.690 
to avoid spacing problems when using
guidelines<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:10.200> order<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.830> avoid<00:00:11.099> spacing

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
guidelines in order to avoid spacing

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.789 
guidelines in order to avoid spacing
problems<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:12.570> important<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.290> understand

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
problems it's important to understand

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.580 
problems it's important to understand
how<00:00:13.920> guidelines<00:00:14.880> work<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.540> there's<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.560> lot

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
how guidelines work and there's a lot

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.200 
how guidelines work and there's a lot
more<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.190> them<00:00:17.369> than<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.730> might<00:00:18.029> at<00:00:18.180> first

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
more to them than you might at first

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.380 
more to them than you might at first
think<00:00:18.859> this<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:19.980> particularly<00:00:20.490> important<00:00:21.210> if

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
think this is particularly important if

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.019 
think this is particularly important if
you're<00:00:21.720> using<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.170> mod<00:00:22.439> like<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.310> perfect<00:00:23.789> road

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
you're using a mod like the perfect road

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.089 
you're using a mod like the perfect road
spacing<00:00:24.630> mod<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.529> first<00:00:25.800> thing<00:00:25.980> to

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
spacing mod the first thing to

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.670 
spacing mod the first thing to
understand<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.720> guidelines<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.650> not

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
understand is that the guidelines do not

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.130 
understand is that the guidelines do not
lock<00:00:29.250> your<00:00:29.429> mouse<00:00:29.699> into<00:00:30.090> place<00:00:30.330> when<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.900> move

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
lock your mouse into place when you move

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.920 
lock your mouse into place when you move
over<00:00:31.349> an<00:00:31.590> intersection<00:00:32.450> let's<00:00:33.450> look<00:00:33.690> at<00:00:33.809> an

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
over an intersection let's look at an

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.840 
over an intersection let's look at an
example<00:00:35.120> we<00:00:36.120> want<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.390> draw<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> road<00:00:37.850> using

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
example we want to draw a road using

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.799 
example we want to draw a road using
this<00:00:39.000> guideline<00:00:41.090> but<00:00:42.090> when<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.420> move<00:00:42.660> your

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
this guideline but when you move your

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.440 
this guideline but when you move your
mouse<00:00:43.079> over<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.620> connection<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.969> doesn't

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
mouse over the connection it doesn't

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.190 
mouse over the connection it doesn't
lock<00:00:45.660> into<00:00:46.020> place<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.210> very<00:00:48.480> easy<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
lock into place so it's very easy to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.319 
lock into place so it's very easy to
think<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.250> you're<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> intersection

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
think that you're on the intersection

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.020 
think that you're on the intersection
when<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.780> actual<00:00:52.110> fact<00:00:52.289> you're<00:00:52.559> not<00:00:52.879> there<00:00:53.879> are

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
when in actual fact you're not there are

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.779 
when in actual fact you're not there are
two<00:00:54.270> other<00:00:54.539> misleading<00:00:55.350> indicators<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
two other misleading indicators the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.599 
two other misleading indicators the
first<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> blue<00:00:57.750> circle<00:00:58.289> which<00:00:59.190> gives<00:00:59.460> a

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
first is the blue circle which gives a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.200 
first is the blue circle which gives a
flash<00:00:59.989> when<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.109> move<00:01:01.289> over<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.649> guideline<00:01:02.219> but

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
flash when you move over a guideline but

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.880 
flash when you move over a guideline but
it<00:01:03.329> doesn't<00:01:03.780> indicate<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.559> you're<00:01:04.710> actually

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
it doesn't indicate that you're actually

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.690 
it doesn't indicate that you're actually
in<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> correct<00:01:05.670> place<00:01:06.950> since<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.130> flashes

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
in the correct place since it flashes

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.410 
in the correct place since it flashes
whenever<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.600> move<00:01:09.780> over<00:01:10.020> any<00:01:10.350> guideline<00:01:11.420> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
whenever you move over any guideline the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.899 
whenever you move over any guideline the
other<00:01:12.600> misleading<00:01:13.320> indicator<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.280> when<00:01:14.790> you

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
other misleading indicator is when you

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.630 
other misleading indicator is when you
use<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> guideline<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:16.530> you're<00:01:16.830> correctly<00:01:17.369> over

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
use a guideline if you're correctly over

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.289 
use a guideline if you're correctly over
the<00:01:17.759> guideline<00:01:18.210> it'll<00:01:18.780> turn<00:01:19.020> green<00:01:20.299> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the guideline it'll turn green the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.330 
the guideline it'll turn green the
problem<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.650> start<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
problem is that if you start in the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.230 
problem is that if you start in the
wrong<00:01:23.640> place

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
wrong place

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.980 
wrong place
but<00:01:25.020> continue<00:01:25.560> along<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> guideline

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
but continue along the guideline

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.469 
but continue along the guideline
eventually<00:01:27.990> it'll<00:01:28.140> turn<00:01:28.380> green<00:01:29.150> what<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.329> is

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
eventually it'll turn green what this is

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
eventually it'll turn green what this is
indicating<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.290> your<00:01:31.680> current<00:01:32.280> mouse

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
indicating is that your current mouse

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.200 
indicating is that your current mouse
position<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.360> correctly<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.350> guide<00:01:34.829> line

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
position is correctly on the guide line

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.550 
position is correctly on the guide line
let's<00:01:36.210> look<00:01:36.420> at<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> measurements<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.409> this

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
let's look at the measurements for this

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.160 
let's look at the measurements for this
road<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:39.030> distance<00:01:39.509> between<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.990> two

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
road the distance between the two

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.210 
road the distance between the two
parallel<00:01:40.439> roads<00:01:40.950> should<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.790> either<00:01:42.000> 440<00:01:42.930> or

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
parallel roads should be either 440 or

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.630 
parallel roads should be either 440 or
441<00:01:44.220> samolians<00:01:45.799> at<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.159> end

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
441 samolians at this end

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.950 
441 samolians at this end
it's<00:01:47.820> 441<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.530> correct<00:01:50.600> but<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.810> other

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
it's 441 that's correct but at the other

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.889 
it's 441 that's correct but at the other
end<00:01:52.880> it's<00:01:53.880> actually<00:01:54.470> 437<00:01:56.420> that<00:01:57.420> could<00:01:57.689> lead<00:01:57.869> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
end it's actually 437 that could lead to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.069 
end it's actually 437 that could lead to
spacing<00:01:58.500> problems<00:01:59.479> there<00:02:00.479> are<00:02:00.509> two<00:02:00.810> ways<00:02:01.049> to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
spacing problems there are two ways to

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.230 
spacing problems there are two ways to
ensure<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.549> correct<00:02:02.729> spacing

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
ensure that you get correct spacing

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.940 
ensure that you get correct spacing
using<00:02:03.840> guidelines<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:06.630> first<00:02:06.930> method<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.500> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
using guidelines the first method is to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.790 
using guidelines the first method is to
use<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.340> green<00:02:09.000> indicator

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.970 

if<00:02:13.220> you're<00:02:13.550> in<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.820> correct<00:02:14.060> position<00:02:14.980> when

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
if you're in the correct position when

you start to draw the road the guideline

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.610 
you start to draw the road the guideline
should<00:02:18.680> immediately<00:02:19.160> turn<00:02:19.790> green<00:02:20.150> if<00:02:20.620> it

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
should immediately turn green if it
