do is clean it so what did I do
it's<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.700> good<00:02:34.819> apart<00:02:35.120> which<00:02:35.959> was<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.170> wrong<00:02:36.530> move

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
it's a good apart which was a wrong move

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.650 
it's a good apart which was a wrong move
I<00:02:37.610> took<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.150> apart<00:02:38.530> spring<00:02:39.530> school<00:02:39.830> everywhere

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.360 
I took it apart spring school everywhere
took<00:02:41.660> me<00:02:41.810> probably<00:02:42.080> honestly<00:02:42.739> probably<00:02:43.280> about

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
took me probably honestly probably about

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.860 
took me probably honestly probably about
five<00:02:43.640> hours<00:02:43.819> you<00:02:44.060> get<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.239> gun<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.510> put<00:02:44.690> back

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
five hours you get the gun to put back

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.650 
five hours you get the gun to put back
together<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:45.560> was<00:02:45.769> a<00:02:46.069> pain<00:02:46.459> in<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.910> butt<00:02:47.150> all<00:02:47.600> I

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
together it was a pain in the butt all I

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.229 
together it was a pain in the butt all I
did<00:02:47.870> was<00:02:48.019> take<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.290> grip<00:02:48.500> off<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:49.239> some

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
did was take the grip off and some

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.509 
did was take the grip off and some
springs<00:02:50.569> popped<00:02:50.840> out<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.980> spring<00:02:52.250> for<00:02:52.400> that

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
springs popped out to spring for that

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.130 
springs popped out to spring for that
popped<00:02:52.730> out<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:52.940> cannot<00:02:53.360> figure<00:02:53.660> out<00:02:53.780> where

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
popped out I cannot figure out where

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.800 
popped out I cannot figure out where
when<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.769> probably<00:02:54.950> got<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:55.190> figured<00:02:55.370> out<00:02:55.810> so

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
when I probably got it figured out so

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.860 
when I probably got it figured out so
that's<00:02:57.070> that's<00:02:58.239> definitely<00:02:59.239> a<00:02:59.269> dislike<00:02:59.840> about

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
that's that's definitely a dislike about

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.400
