00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.520
 to distinguish between a nevus 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.880
 normal melanocytic and melanoma 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:27.020
 we use a rule called abc of 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:30.150
 read we value the asymmetry the more 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.550
 asymmetric is the pigmented lesion that 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.489
 we are looking at more risk there is that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.790
 is a melanoma kissed edges 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.270
 the more outgoing or peaks we see in 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.090
 the pigmented area there is more risk that 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.309
 be a melanoma the cee is the color what 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.340
 important is that the color is homogeneous 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.160
 not so much if it's very clear very very dark 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.230
 a melanocytic colored nevus is better 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.820
 very black that a nevus that has a 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.320
 color blue brown black later in the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.110
 part of the norm that we do less 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.360
 case is the diameter if they are more 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.550
 dangerous in theory those that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.160
 pigmented lesions greater than 56 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.780
 millimeters but because I have 23 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.570
 millimeters you can not exclude a 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.119
 melanoma and finally the evolution a 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.640
 pigmented lesion that has grown in little 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.090
 time it hurts that hurts or that 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.219
 bleed 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.270
 is more likely to be a 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:30.149
 melanoma apart from this rule we use 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.030
 the dermatoscopy that gives us more clues 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.539
 any lesion that is suspicious of 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.850
 be a melanoma so much because it fails 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:43.259
 some of the letters of the norm 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.369
 because because the dermatoscopy is 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.469
 very irregular 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.659
 we remove it to confirm the 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.000
 Diagnosis histologically 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.369
 pigmented lesions that do not have 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.520
 no typical feature there is no 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.829
 remove the melanocytic nevi 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.739
 normal and it's the only thing that needs to be done 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.509
 is periodic reviews is advised to 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:05.879
 patient periodically go to 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.190
 dermatologist depending on the risk that 

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:11.009
 let's observe in the query if we see that 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.440
 have many melanocytic nevi if there 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.750
 many atypical or if you have a history 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.970
 family melanoma reviews 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.040
 they have to be more frequent but if not 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.250
 with making them every two years is 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.250
 enough
