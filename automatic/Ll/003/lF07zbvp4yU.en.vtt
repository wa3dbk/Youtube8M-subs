00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
light as you can see here on this

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.089 
light as you can see here on this
vehicle<00:00:23.510> now<00:00:24.510> what's<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.230> mean<00:00:25.410> check

light basically comes on it could be one

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.280 
light basically comes on it could be one
that<00:00:32.910> says<00:00:33.120> check<00:00:33.239> engine<00:00:33.630> like<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.930> or<00:00:34.170> it

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
that says check engine like that or it

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.420 
that says check engine like that or it
could<00:00:34.440> be<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> little<00:00:34.980> shape<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.340> an

could be in the little shape of an
engine<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.120> some<00:00:36.300> other<00:00:36.420> vehicles<00:00:37.219> and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
what you generally do is take it to your

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.330 
what you generally do is take it to your
dealer<00:00:47.370> or<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.059> some<00:00:48.210> other<00:00:48.300> shop<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.340> they

dealer or to some other shop and they
find<00:00:51.030> out<00:00:51.149> what<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> code<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.930> how<00:00:52.050> did<00:00:52.199> I

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
find out what the code is and how did I

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.420 
find out what the code is and how did I
do<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.670> don't<00:00:53.670> they<00:00:53.820> use<00:00:55.190> something<00:00:56.190> like

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
do that don't they use something like

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.160 
do that don't they use something like
this<00:00:57.469> ok<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.129> code<00:00:59.730> scanner<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.539> this

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
this ok this is a code scanner and this

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.579 
this ok this is a code scanner and this
is<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> fairly<00:01:01.680> generic<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:03.199> there<00:01:04.199> could<00:01:04.470> they

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
is a fairly generic one there could they

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.440 
is a fairly generic one there could they
can<00:01:04.739> range<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.220> price<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:06.000> was<00:01:06.150> probably

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
can range in price this one was probably

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.450 
can range in price this one was probably
about<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.869> hundred<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.140> fifty<00:01:07.409> dollars<00:01:07.740> they

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
about one hundred and fifty dollars they

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.160 
about one hundred and fifty dollars they
can<00:01:08.610> range<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.850> price<00:01:09.000> from<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.659> up<00:01:10.020> to

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
can range in price from this to up to

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.130 
can range in price from this to up to
over<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.409> thousand<00:01:10.799> dollars<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> more

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
over a thousand dollars for the more

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.630 
over a thousand dollars for the more
sophisticated<00:01:13.140> ones<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.860> detect<00:01:14.220> more

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
sophisticated ones that detect more

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.070 
sophisticated ones that detect more
things<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.240> far<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:16.460> abs<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:18.080> different

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
things as far as abs and different

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.590 
things as far as abs and different
things<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.390> he'll<00:01:21.390> take<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
things like that so he'll take the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.190 
things like that so he'll take the
scanner<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:23.100> they'll<00:01:23.909> take<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:25.040> plug<00:01:26.040> okay<00:01:26.820> and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
scanner and they'll take a plug okay and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.840 
scanner and they'll take a plug okay and
generally<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.350> happens<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.979> up<00:01:29.280> underneath

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
generally what happens is up underneath

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.109 
generally what happens is up underneath
here<00:01:30.950> will<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> plug<00:01:32.520> into<00:01:32.759> your<00:01:33.060> computer

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
here will be a plug into your computer

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.740 
here will be a plug into your computer
and<00:01:33.979> I'm<00:01:34.979> you

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.910 
it's already on 2003 Subaru I don't want
to<00:02:38.549> erase<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.180> data<00:02:42.200> ok<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.319> wants<00:02:43.530> me<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.680> turn

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
to erase the data ok it wants me to turn

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.460 
to erase the data ok it wants me to turn
off<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.700> key<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.180> then<00:02:45.269> turn<00:02:45.569> on<00:02:45.599> for<00:02:46.290> 10

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
off the key and then turn on for 10

00:02:46.470 --> 00:03:08.509 
off the key and then turn on for 10
seconds<00:02:47.660> 1<00:02:48.660> 2<00:02:49.500> 3<00:02:51.650> 5<00:02:52.650> 6<00:02:53.629> 7<00:02:56.750> 10<00:03:06.170> ok<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.829> want<00:03:08.220> to

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
seconds 1 2 3 5 6 7 10 ok and I want to

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.160 
seconds 1 2 3 5 6 7 10 ok and I want to
read<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.940> codes<00:03:11.420> it's<00:03:12.420> leading<00:03:12.750> up<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.079> the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
read the codes it's leading up to the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:33.130 
read the codes it's leading up to the
vehicle

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.770 

ok

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.940 

okay<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:37.709> i<00:03:37.950> have<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.190> p0<00:03:39.319> 452<00:03:40.319> so<00:03:40.500> this<00:03:40.650> gives<00:03:40.800> me

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
okay so i have a p0 452 so this gives me

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.270 
okay so i have a p0 452 so this gives me
the<00:03:41.040> code<00:03:41.370> here<00:03:41.870> p<00:03:42.870> 0<00:03:42.900> 4<00:03:43.290> 52<00:03:43.770> which<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.160> an

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
the code here p 0 4 52 which is an

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.660 
the code here p 0 4 52 which is an
avapro<00:03:44.670> system<00:03:45.630> pressure<00:03:46.260> sensor<00:03:46.800> low<00:03:47.010> that

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
avapro system pressure sensor low that

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.720 
avapro system pressure sensor low that
means<00:03:47.910> there<00:03:48.330> is<00:03:48.890> basically<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.920> leak<00:03:50.250> in<00:03:50.490> the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
means there is basically a leak in the

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.690 
means there is basically a leak in the
evaporative<00:03:51.450> control<00:03:52.020> and<00:03:52.459> then<00:03:53.459> it<00:03:53.580> has

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
evaporative control and then it has

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.250 
evaporative control and then it has
another<00:03:53.880> code<00:03:54.209> but<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.540> has<00:03:54.630> no<00:03:54.780> definition

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
another code but it has no definition

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.100 
another code but it has no definition
for<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.680> code<00:03:56.510> so<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.660> is<00:03:57.810> probably<00:03:57.989> the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
for that code so this is probably the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.740 
for that code so this is probably the
one<00:03:58.260> we<00:03:58.350> can<00:03:58.470> do<00:03:59.040> something<00:03:59.220> about<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.760> leak<00:04:00.569> in

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
one we can do something about a leak in

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.290 
one we can do something about a leak in
the<00:04:00.780> evaporation<00:04:01.620> control<00:04:02.040> is<00:04:02.220> usually<00:04:02.910> most

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
the evaporation control is usually most

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.960 
the evaporation control is usually most
often<00:04:03.810> this<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:06.530> you<00:04:07.530> didn't<00:04:08.190> put<00:04:08.370> your<00:04:08.610> fuel

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
often this is a you didn't put your fuel

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.930 
often this is a you didn't put your fuel
cap<00:04:09.239> on<00:04:09.480> last<00:04:10.170> time<00:04:10.380> you<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.890> put<00:04:11.550> gas<00:04:11.730> in<00:04:11.760> the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
cap on last time you I put gas in the

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.490 
cap on last time you I put gas in the
vehicle<00:04:12.269> that's<00:04:12.450> generally<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.500> most<00:04:13.800> common

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
vehicle that's generally the most common

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.770 
vehicle that's generally the most common
thing<00:04:16.500> that<00:04:16.530> causes<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:17.370> code<00:04:17.609> like<00:04:17.790> this<00:04:17.820> the

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
thing that causes a code like this the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.180 
thing that causes a code like this the
other<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.169> second<00:04:19.470> most<00:04:19.560> common<00:04:19.650> is<00:04:20.160> that

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
other the second most common is that

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.750 
other the second most common is that
your<00:04:21.410> filler<00:04:22.410> tube<00:04:22.650> has<00:04:22.860> started<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.190> rust<00:04:23.520> out

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
your filler tube has started to rust out

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.909 
your filler tube has started to rust out
okay<00:04:24.540> I've<00:04:25.080> actually<00:04:25.230> checked<00:04:25.560> both<00:04:25.680> those

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
okay I've actually checked both those

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.100 
okay I've actually checked both those
things<00:04:25.950> they<00:04:26.340> look<00:04:26.520> okay<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:27.750> actually<00:04:27.870> i'll

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
things they look okay and actually i'll

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.810 
things they look okay and actually i'll
make<00:04:28.229> it<00:04:28.260> a<00:04:28.380> mission<00:04:28.650> i<00:04:28.800> know<00:04:28.919> it<00:04:29.280> was<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.580> fuel

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
make it a mission i know it was the fuel

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.510 
make it a mission i know it was the fuel
cap<00:04:30.240> because<00:04:31.169> I<00:04:31.350> took<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.680> off<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.100> started<00:04:32.400> up

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
cap because I took it off and started up

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.490 
cap because I took it off and started up
the<00:04:32.640> car<00:04:32.850> a<00:04:32.880> couple<00:04:33.000> times<00:04:33.360> just<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:34.229> give<00:04:34.410> the

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
the car a couple times just to give the

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.500 
the car a couple times just to give the
car<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.740> throw<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.040> code<00:04:35.280> so<00:04:35.729> i<00:04:35.760> could<00:04:36.030> do<00:04:36.330> this

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
car to throw a code so i could do this

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.060 
car to throw a code so i could do this
little<00:04:36.780> demonstration<00:04:36.900> so<00:04:37.590> now<00:04:37.740> i'm<00:04:37.919> just

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
little demonstration so now i'm just

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.850 
little demonstration so now i'm just
gonna<00:04:38.570> clear<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:39.750> code<00:04:39.990> from<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.320> car<00:04:42.860> back

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
gonna clear that code from the car back

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.940 
gonna clear that code from the car back
i'm<00:04:44.760> going<00:04:44.940> to<00:04:45.000> erase<00:04:45.360> codes<00:04:48.590> make<00:04:49.590> sure<00:04:49.620> you

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
i'm going to erase codes make sure you

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:56.990 
i'm going to erase codes make sure you
want<00:04:50.130> to<00:04:50.220> erase<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.610> codes<00:04:51.950> yes

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.760 

who

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.619 

ok<00:05:01.370> now<00:05:01.520> I'm<00:05:01.639> going<00:05:01.699> to<00:05:01.849> start<00:05:02.090> my<00:05:02.240> vehicle<00:05:02.569> up

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
ok now I'm going to start my vehicle up

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:08.680 
ok now I'm going to start my vehicle up
again<00:05:06.460> ok<00:05:07.460> so<00:05:07.520> as<00:05:07.729> you<00:05:07.849> can<00:05:07.940> see<00:05:08.150> after<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.539> car

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
again ok so as you can see after the car

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.450 
again ok so as you can see after the car
ran<00:05:08.840> for<00:05:09.050> a<00:05:09.080> little<00:05:09.199> while<00:05:09.349> the<00:05:10.009> check<00:05:10.310> engine

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
ran for a little while the check engine

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.570 
ran for a little while the check engine
shut<00:05:11.090> up<00:05:11.210> lights<00:05:11.509> shut<00:05:11.750> off<00:05:12.220> in<00:05:13.220> normal

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
shut up lights shut off in normal

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.399 
shut up lights shut off in normal
circumstances<00:05:13.940> I'd<00:05:14.539> drive<00:05:14.780> the<00:05:14.900> car<00:05:15.080> around<00:05:15.259> a

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
circumstances I'd drive the car around a

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.860 
circumstances I'd drive the car around a
little<00:05:15.500> bit<00:05:15.650> make<00:05:15.889> sure<00:05:15.919> it<00:05:16.190> stayed<00:05:16.490> off<00:05:16.870> but

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
little bit make sure it stayed off but

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.629 
little bit make sure it stayed off but
again<00:05:17.990> since<00:05:18.409> I<00:05:18.560> know<00:05:18.620> I<00:05:18.860> took<00:05:19.039> the<00:05:19.280> cap<00:05:19.460> off

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
again since I know I took the cap off

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.909 
again since I know I took the cap off
just<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.180> throw<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.479> code<00:05:20.740> pretty<00:05:21.740> sure<00:05:21.889> it's

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
just to throw the code pretty sure it's

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.309 
just to throw the code pretty sure it's
not<00:05:22.069> going<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.370> come<00:05:22.460> back<00:05:22.639> on<00:05:23.139> but<00:05:24.139> that's

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 
not going to come back on but that's

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.050 
not going to come back on but that's
pretty<00:05:24.860> much<00:05:25.009> what<00:05:25.250> happens<00:05:25.370> when<00:05:25.819> you<00:05:25.909> get<00:05:26.030> a

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
pretty much what happens when you get a

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.700 
pretty much what happens when you get a
check<00:05:26.900> engine<00:05:27.020> code<00:05:27.550> on<00:05:28.550> your<00:05:28.580> vehicle<00:05:29.710> you

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
check engine code on your vehicle you

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.230 
check engine code on your vehicle you
take<00:05:30.889> it<00:05:30.919> to<00:05:31.190> your<00:05:31.520> shop<00:05:31.789> they<00:05:32.360> run<00:05:32.870> a<00:05:34.240> scanner

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240
