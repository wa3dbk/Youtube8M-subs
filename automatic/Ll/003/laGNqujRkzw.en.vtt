00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:08.220
 Hello I am and I would like to do that 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.599
 imagine smoking with a fragrance lamp 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.650
 and we need the reucher for it 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:18.480
 a fragrance lamp is known for that 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.609
 evaporate from essential oils that are 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.900
 usually a bowl on top should 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.820
 So be a fragrance lamp where you have the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.880
 peel off or you can either 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.960
 then buy a special one 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.740
 Just make a tealight and 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.740
 put it in below 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.989
 what you need is a rich one 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.150
 victories in stainless steel looks pretty tight 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.850
 Quality will be easy on the 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.770
 shell placed on top 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.330
 I also have these lamps extra for that 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.300
 that was a nice make 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.640
 height for smoking because of 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.100
 Distance is also crucial as were 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.989
 it will not be up here 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.810
 quite as hot as in the coal Reucher 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.200
 because it is only the heat of the 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.690
 candle is up here and if you arrive 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.690
 Now just keep going uphill 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.539
 It is most beautiful for this smoking 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.159
 with a mixture so we are always 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.740
 rich haase and today 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.009
 peter of various kinds together 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.659
 mixed and if you put this on 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.969
 you can see it happens at the beginning 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.429
 not so much it takes very little that 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:37.590
 a beautiful incense for the home 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.630
 if you do not have that much smoke 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.630
 now wants to come so little bit 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.509
 smoke here and the fragrance comes already 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.259
 that's just the mixture of hazelnut 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:54.119
 From the tree is called a very fruity 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.119
 fresh mixture 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.250
 crucial for this richer and more 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.159
 how high is the distance between the 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.049
 candle and the sieve is the higher that is 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.000
 the smoother the whole thing will be 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.739
 the closer the distance is the more 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.780
 it gets more intense and more 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.550
 it smokes too and of course it is 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.060
 depending on what I'm forking out up here 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.190
 if I have firm roots and woods 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.260
 I have a lot more 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.150
 heat tolerated before the beginning there too 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.700
 smoking and delicate flowers like lavender 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:30.670
 or rose petals, of course, with 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:32.140
 less heat more beautiful aroma that can 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.500
 you just leave it as it is now 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.750
 It's as often as you want it to be 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.360
 as long as the candle burns and it 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.010
 slowly enough 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.329
 I think it's a wonderful variation 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.329
 to enrich in everyday life
