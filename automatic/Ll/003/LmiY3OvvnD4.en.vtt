00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.810
 in the first episode poker school we first want to give them the 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.189
 Basics so bring the basic knowledge closer also we explain the 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.640
 Difference between Limit and the most popular programs Rente No Limit 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.710
 Get Texas 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.310
 Welcome to the new DFS Poker School 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.280
 if they have become Bucher Club and then they are like many others 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.870
 People in this world are booming programs the cult game has a huge 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.480
 Camberg celebrated where the problem is you always like many people playing poker like that 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.480
 play successfully but you always have problems yourself 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.600
 you get things i'm on with his game i have 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.600
 and those who have little time can lose even that 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.930
 again another thing of this zone is always over when all the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.080
 same amount 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.090
 because students often asked how many times can I now be raised if all 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.390
 then have come to the next card 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.180
 then fell the ranking explained 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.790
 the blinds put the flop turn river 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.510
 I think we should play one round, we both get into one 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.450
 Pulling back small cabinets will be a bit of a watch 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.920
 so that the players can complain if we ever during the 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.580
 Analyze game and in the end 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.770
 to come back to the table and say what was good 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.740
 bad was what he can improve so 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.740
 there is something on the combo we play calls 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.330
 it's a bit different than the right school teachers are pulling 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.970
 So go back and watch the students 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.640
 and then in the end analyze later to determine or of course praise 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.630
 to distribute that it already be 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.200
 Of course, of course, it will prompt Texas pick that is the variant 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.490
 They all play 95 percent of all poker games in the world 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.360
 consist of picking Texas they may have previously played with five 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.119
 cards 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.849
 because you could always go out when and new draw that is 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.779
 in German times this is really a pure gambling the Scirocco r we 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:19.389
 Play Texas has been and need the ranking what are the good cards 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.579
 Weapons the bad cards the top five cards are scored 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.319
 and if nobody has anything then the highest class counts 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.959
 five cards is that the ASV 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.110
 one often says 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.070
 ad-hoc brother he is free English is very common in the program 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.789
 Therefore, even if they have a couple 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:38.269
 for example with two boys 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.429
 not bad at all better than a couple 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:44.389
 clear as in real life two couples 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.359
 that in this case we have the two kings and the two threes the 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.209
 Fifth Run 55 has a value though way better than 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.179
 female until the evidence that it is not that bad for example 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:57.529
 3 6 1 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:58.909
 then there are the streets
