00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.280 
number for the characters and story are
great<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.579> really<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.570> them<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.049> one<00:01:49.259> I

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
great I really like them in this one I

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.380 
great I really like them in this one I

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
didn't really like grand theft auto 4 I

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.999 
didn't really like grand theft auto 4 I
thought<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.020> Nico<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> pretty<00:01:52.770> weak

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
thought that Nico is a pretty weak

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.560 
thought that Nico is a pretty weak
character<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> think<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.030> having<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
character but I think that having the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.510 
character but I think that having the
trio<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.049> characters<00:01:55.530> being<00:01:55.710> michael<00:01:56.219> trevor

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
trio of characters being michael trevor

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.940 
trio of characters being michael trevor
and<00:01:56.880> franklin<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.570> great<00:01:58.170> admittedly

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
and franklin is great admittedly

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.130 
and franklin is great admittedly
franklin<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.759> my<00:02:00.000> least<00:02:00.299> favorite<00:02:00.750> character

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
franklin is my least favorite character

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.749 
franklin is my least favorite character

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.530 
might like him more it all depends on

is<00:05:25.770> kind<00:05:25.980> of<00:05:26.130> inherent<00:05:26.610> because<00:05:26.940> they<00:05:27.090> have<00:05:27.180> so

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
is kind of inherent because they have so

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.150 
is kind of inherent because they have so

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
many options but some of them are just

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.940 
many options but some of them are just
going<00:05:32.790> to<00:05:32.820> end<00:05:33.090> up<00:05:33.300> being<00:05:33.690> very<00:05:33.720> boring<00:05:34.710> or

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
going to end up being very boring or

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.470

having<00:05:35.130> a<00:05:35.190> big<00:05:35.430> difficulty<00:05:36.000> spike<00:05:36.270> and<00:05:36.390> you

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
having a big difficulty spike and you

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.360 
having a big difficulty spike and you
keep<00:05:36.630> dying<00:05:36.990> over<00:05:37.290> and<00:05:37.530> over<00:05:37.650> again<00:05:37.890> for<00:05:38.220> what

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
keep dying over and over again for what

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.010 
keep dying over and over again for what
you<00:05:38.490> feel<00:05:38.700> like<00:05:38.850> it's<00:05:39.000> a<00:05:39.060> cheaper<00:05:39.420> reason<00:05:39.780> and

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
you feel like it's a cheaper reason and

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.880 
you feel like it's a cheaper reason and
that<00:05:40.100> really<00:05:41.100> makes<00:05:41.310> you<00:05:41.490> not<00:05:41.730> want<00:05:41.790> to<00:05:42.210> play

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890
