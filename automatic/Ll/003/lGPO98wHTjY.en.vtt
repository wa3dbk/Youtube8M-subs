00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
right now also in the pace mate range

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.520 
right now also in the pace mate range
are<00:01:28.030> these<00:01:28.240> ones<00:01:28.570> now<00:01:28.869> caught<00:01:29.140> quite<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.439> few

bobble and chop with pasties in these

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.120 
bobble and chop with pasties in these
and<00:01:31.719> they're<00:01:32.200> slightly<00:01:32.469> different<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:33.039> the

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
and they're slightly different to the

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.609 
and they're slightly different to the
Herrick<00:01:33.520> version<00:01:33.969> now<00:01:34.810> instead<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.200> threading

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
Herrick version now instead of threading

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.520 
Herrick version now instead of threading
these<00:01:35.770> down<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.009> hook<00:01:36.310> link<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:37.060> actually

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
these down the hook link you actually

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.469 
these down the hook link you actually
simply<00:01:38.530> just<00:01:38.770> push<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.549> hook<00:01:39.700> point<00:01:39.939> through

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
simply just push the hook point through

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.100 
simply just push the hook point through
the<00:01:40.600> stem<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:45.159> then<00:01:45.310> thread<00:01:45.579> it<00:01:45.670> round<00:01:46.110> until

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
the stem and then thread it round until

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.669 
the stem and then thread it round until
you<00:01:47.229> get<00:01:47.409> to<00:01:47.530> about<00:01:47.560> this<00:01:48.009> position<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:50.259> then

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
you get to about this position and then

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.709 
you get to about this position and then
it's<00:01:50.920> just<00:01:51.069> a<00:01:51.219> simple<00:01:51.579> case<00:01:51.759> then<00:01:52.060> of<00:01:52.270> mold<00:01:52.569> in

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
it's just a simple case then of mold in

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.300 
it's just a simple case then of mold in
a<00:01:52.780> lump<00:01:53.020> of<00:01:53.170> paste<00:01:53.580> around<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.909> pace<00:01:55.119> mate<00:01:56.310> and

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
a lump of paste around the pace mate and

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.669 
a lump of paste around the pace mate and
then<00:01:58.299> that<00:01:58.420> should<00:01:58.630> stop<00:01:58.929> those<00:01:59.110> crafts<00:01:59.500> each

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
then that should stop those crafts each

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.990 
then that should stop those crafts each
up<00:02:00.630> pulling<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.810> paste<00:02:02.049> off<00:02:02.259> your<00:02:02.409> hook<00:02:03.000> right

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
up pulling the paste off your hook right

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.179 
up pulling the paste off your hook right
now<00:02:04.060> Enterprise<00:02:04.689> also<00:02:05.079> do<00:02:05.289> a<00:02:05.530> smaller<00:02:05.920> version

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
now Enterprise also do a smaller version

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.260 
now Enterprise also do a smaller version
at<00:02:06.489> a<00:02:06.549> pace<00:02:06.759> mate

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
at a pace mate
