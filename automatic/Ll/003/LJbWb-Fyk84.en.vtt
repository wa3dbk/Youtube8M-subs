 family trouble I hope you go 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.860
 Well, I'm fine, we end up at j 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.720
 less than the output of the playstation 4 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.429
 and we're all happy because it's done 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.710
 long as we wait for it and tomorrow we 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.300
 will have more by all in hand and I hope 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.130
 that she will reserve us many 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.230
 surprises you guys so I 'm waiting 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.610
 impatiently tomorrow is here today 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.550
 to introduce you a little the last 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.650
 little news about this ps4 just at 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.449
 passage the gameplay it's not yet a 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.100
 90 times per 6 years I feast with 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.329
 this moment and many subscribers more 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.469
 brought a video joined me on a 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.760
 work and 2 so I make them a big 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.859
 big up and thanks to them we have fun 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.600
 really a lot to many and you 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.280
 are going to see that these neck hits is going 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.510
 to be really not bad because I 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.680
 will not have my neck in my 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.269
 gunner and you'll see that at the 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.280
 end it will happen a very stupid thing 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.579
 who will do that you will see if I have 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.960
 or not here we went for the video 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.269
 so I have a lot of kills telling you 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.890
 so first thing did you know that we 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.200
 can order his ps4 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.130
 speaking and yes sony the city hall stop has 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.080
 very little time one of the few 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.840
 surprises that had reserved us so the 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.070
 ps4 in celebration will have a function where we 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.740
 will be able to talk again for example we will be able to 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.800
 tell him lance battlefield 4 and she 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.150
 will launch battlefield 2 4 and this some 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.040
 interesting thing we do sony on 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.990
 we said we see there if we read what we 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.330
 says battlefield 4 or the battlefield bear 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.310
 4 speaking with friends and that the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.780
 playstation 4 launches the game alone 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.590
 while we are seeing our 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.240
 game in full party 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.030
 what sony did is simply 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.380
 that so the system of vocal 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.780
 deactivates after 10 seconds what 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.100
 avoid small bugs like you 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.540
 when I just told you so 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.390
 it's a very, very good thing and we 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.730
 So this will slow it launches virum 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.140
 this battlefield 4 is a right finally not 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.140
 bad it's pretty cool what makes you 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.510
 sony second thing the ps4 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.920
 there are sticks and to stic that 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.270
 are already available for joysticks 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.170
 and for the console for people who 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.590
 would like a little bit of money and their 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.030
 console 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.800
 and like sticks in general it does not 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.960
 not very expensive there is someone and 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.090
 a few you got me internet 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.349
 already they sell sticks that you 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.390
 just have to stick on your ps 4 and 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.280
 his nature has somehow a little 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.690
 it would give him a nice little look 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.569
 I would put his sites in the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.900
 description cinema that marrie see at 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.290
 passage 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.849
 third thing the ps4 will be a lot 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.439
 faster installing games than 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.200
 on the xbox and that's something 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.959
 which shocked me a bit and we did not 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.280
 not much talked about but there is a 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.989
 comparison that was done is very 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.790
 little time so between xbox one and 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.709
 the ps4 so I explain why 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.760
 I'm talking about installing everything 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.640
 simply case for lyon who would not 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.379
 not the problem of the ps4 and the xbox on 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.519
 knows that video game builders 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.879
 have made games that are very very 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.799
 graphically heavy and and so what 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.359
 goes which means that in fact the the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.220
 games are very heavy and have cards 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.720
 and who are huge so it's that 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.870
 will not necessarily exist an installation of 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.730
 base so it would have to install the game 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.040
 as soon as we have it as on pc it is necessary 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.269
 to do but in addition simplified but sure we 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.389
 will be in the long run will be just the game there 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.159
 will have downloads that is and so he 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.780
 has been tried with two consoles 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.659
 so with the same connection not even 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.099
 all the same and so the xbox one a 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.150
 problem it has is that m and 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.389
 a lot of time to settle in 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.040
 example for fifa 14 on xbox month of 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.760
 the installation of the cat 14 points 16 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.829
 minutes on the ps3 she takes it takes 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.970
 35 seconds so I do not know if you 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.349
 see the weather but it's huge and 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.269
 it's about the same, especially games 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.799
 this session m ticket on call of duty 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.359
 and that's about the same time so 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.389
 that's pretty huge this time of 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.560
 shift only to the xbox and and that's it 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.180
 we are already coming to the end of the 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.949
 video I barely half hair 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.049
 if he spidey me know you that on the 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:45.329
 ps4 we can have 2000 to connect 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.459
 for those who did not know about ps3 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.349
 we could have 100 friends maximum in 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.060
 his list of friends on the ps4 we take 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.650
 to have 2000 so that's huge for 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.639
 I can add all subscribers 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.449
 so that's pretty cool 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:04:00.329
 and for you it will be short also 5th 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:01.620
 thing the playstation store is open 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.579
 for people who would not be those 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.609
 who already have the ps because you can 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.269
 darken the dlc be the games and the 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:12.389
 season pass are now available 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:14.280
 7th 6th thing of the time then an info that 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:17.159
 I saw a sna fu quite surprising 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.889
 and that shocked me and I stayed on 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:22.049
 the ass we can say there is a ps4 which 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.560
 was sold 95 thousand euros people and 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.820
 yes you are not dreaming 95 euros 95 thousand 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.219
 dollars per donation my corner of america 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.580
 someone sold a ps4 on ebay in 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:33.430
 saying that 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.460
 delivered with first class planes mats 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.699
 red and limousines and the price of this 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.349
 ps4 and go up to 95 thousand dollars or 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.900
 house imagine 95 but dollars that 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.610
 represents around to tell you that 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.840
 represents one hundred thousand euros what in 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.789
 these waters finally it's about the 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.460
 same price but it's pretty huge 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.349
 and for those who would look for a ps4 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.400
 by the way I saw on the right corner there 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:56.319
 for sale already 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.330
 on the other hand, the price is the problem 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.830
 they will they are worth 650 euros on the 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.060
 good corner people who resell and ps 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.629
 so that was careful not to 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.039
 to make entuber 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.319
 but those who really want to have it 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.699
 here it is 650 euros last info I 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.830
 know that I was very fast gameplay very 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.300
 short in america there are already some 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.659
 problems on the ps4 so the problems 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.460
 is that ps4 1 has a small 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.810
 live system and that's called twitch 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.400
 where we can chat with other people 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.440
 and we can at grade look at the cam of 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.599
 people via the playstation move and in fact 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.819
 we saw people who made him say 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.699
 and on those on sweat twitch who 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.990
 was doing who was doing that showed 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.729
 weapons that was shooting at the trees finally 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.719
 lots of mind-blowing stuff and 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.680
 blow people complained by 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.629
 example for people for children 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.400
 who see the ps4 to see people who 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:37.930
 are just fucking 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.270
 we'll say it in front of their playstation 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.250
 so that's it's just good it's 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.500
 not much but but it's a small 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.449
 the first little problem of ps4 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.039
 here I hope the video will have you 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.330
 more than I would have been too fast 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.800
 that you will have understood all that I 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.509
 all I say if it's heading 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.830
 put a green thumb subscribe if that 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.330
 is not yet of Faye and I 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.469
 tell you very quickly for videos on 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.879
 the playstation 4 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:59.879
