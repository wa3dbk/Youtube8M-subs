00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
smooth the edges and that's about it so

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.690 
smooth the edges and that's about it so
once<00:03:58.230> they<00:03:58.440> are<00:03:58.560> done<00:03:58.770> now<00:03:59.310> we're<00:03:59.490> going<00:03:59.610> to

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
once they are done now we're going to

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.910 
once they are done now we're going to
refrigerate<00:04:00.060> them<00:04:00.480> for<00:04:00.720> at<00:04:00.960> least<00:04:01.140> one<00:04:01.650> hour

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
refrigerate them for at least one hour

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.700 
refrigerate them for at least one hour
it's<00:04:02.610> very<00:04:02.940> important<00:04:03.570> that<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:04.290> place<00:04:04.470> them

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
it's very important that you place them

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.460 
it's very important that you place them
in<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.950> refrigerator<00:04:05.040> for<00:04:05.610> at<00:04:05.910> least<00:04:06.030> 1<00:04:06.300> hour

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.840 
in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour
this<00:04:07.470> will<00:04:07.650> allow<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:07.950> cookie<00:04:08.340> bowl<00:04:08.490> to<00:04:08.640> hold

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
this will allow the cookie bowl to hold

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.150 
this will allow the cookie bowl to hold
its<00:04:09.000> shape<00:04:09.090> in<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.780> oven<00:04:10.110> if<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.860> were<00:04:10.980> to

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
its shape in the oven if you were to

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.440 
its shape in the oven if you were to
bake<00:04:11.340> them<00:04:11.550> right<00:04:11.790> now<00:04:11.940> without

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
bake them right now without

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.750 
bake them right now without
refrigerating<00:04:13.170> them<00:04:13.350> first<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:14.430> ball<00:04:14.610> won't

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
refrigerating them first the ball won't

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.400 
refrigerating them first the ball won't
hold<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.120> shape<00:04:15.330> and<00:04:15.600> it<00:04:15.930> will<00:04:16.050> just<00:04:16.200> melt

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
hold the shape and it will just melt

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.710 
hold the shape and it will just melt
into<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.710> pan<00:04:16.980> so<00:04:17.520> it's<00:04:17.670> very<00:04:17.790> important<00:04:18.420> that

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
into the pan so it's very important that

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.390 
into the pan so it's very important that
you<00:04:19.080> refrigerate<00:04:19.650> them<00:04:19.770> for<00:04:19.830> at<00:04:20.040> least<00:04:20.160> one

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
you refrigerate them for at least one

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.270 
you refrigerate them for at least one
hour<00:04:20.550> before<00:04:20.700> baking<00:04:21.390> them<00:04:21.710> so<00:04:22.710> after<00:04:23.010> an<00:04:23.130> hour

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
hour before baking them so after an hour

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.640 
hour before baking them so after an hour
or<00:04:23.370> so<00:04:23.700> preheat<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.510> oven<00:04:24.540> to<00:04:24.810> 350<00:04:25.470> degrees
