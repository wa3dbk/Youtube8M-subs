00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 Hello everyone, welcome this 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.430
 microsoft will see you for one 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.560
 new module counts 7.10 a lot 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.910
 interesting and very simple the modica 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.099
 let's go talk today it's called iron 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.440
 fist and gives us upgrades to 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.630
 our hands you have understood well hands of 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.430
 iron wrench iron boy value 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.580
 of amateurs then this fashion 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.090
 adds 4 of different hard in that sense 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.480
 let's start from the first of argyll tier wood 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.250
 the tier stone the tier the roms and the tier of 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.170
 hammond in that sense 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.279
 then we going around the world 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.250
 sow 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.230
 we dig and break our fists later 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.730
 a certain amount of time we will have a level in 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.860
 this case if you kind of chat 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.210
 I did glance the level 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.980
 current livell 2 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.239
 for now it is written only in 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.610
 chat so watch out for the chat 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.800
 because if you do n't realize it then 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.809
 these enhancements what they give 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.000
 possibility of no longer using the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.670
 in the long run, in what sense 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.160
 I'm going to dig a moment now 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.469
 hole here because being level two I have 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.680
 got the guys wood boost 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.220
 so now I can from as the says 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.250
 tier digging with your bare hands 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.619
 konko alston and cobol stone let's see some 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.600
 speed punched 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.360
 then we should find history 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.130
 here it is look at you guys are 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.070
 digging as if I had a pickaxe of 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.960
 wood look and this applies to 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.299
 any element also the tree itself 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.329
 he will cut punches much faster 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.680
 there's a great thing guys and plan 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.470
 scand floor in this way 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.840
 we should do the level one thing 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.549
 important as chat law and damage 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.890
 what I do right now tells you 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.290
 that your fists have had a 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.420
 problem we say they are tired of 60's 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.299
 pounding and every shot you shoot 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.180
 take half a heart and tell you take one 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.240
 pause use a tool use any weapon 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.040
 there is a pickaxe and an excuse ax 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.840
 anything to avoid punching 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.880
 naked because practically you are 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.799
 ruining hands however in this case 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.530
 but have you seen I'm digging the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.329
 stone also applies to co al stretches 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.960
 go I think it will take a dozen 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.390
 fifteen minutes to get to 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.520
 halo 3 and then to tier ii this here 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.740
 I would have the chance to dig these 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.450
 hand elements and ning speed 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.150
 will become as if it were a small of 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.880
 stone so we'll dig faster 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.310
 the same thing here so more going 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.420
 more it goes on the more you become faster 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.040
 admire with bare fists 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.140
 but you have to be careful and not dig 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.970
 too fast because it just happens that 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.709
 takes you away and means which one to hit then 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.750
 be careful and maybe die to dig a 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.420
 fists naked and not the case is a fad 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.040
 very nice because they put it anyway 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.390
 a certain difference between a tir and 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.760
 the other in takes some time to 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.140
 go up and it's not really totally or 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.180
 which however puts you the limit of the 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.519
 fists so tired is a fad and 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.050
 very interesting and very simple 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.970
 let's just hope they put on a 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.850
 best pop up when doing level 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.769
 because actually written only in 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.300
 chat you can lose sight 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.340
 so guys this was fashion one 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.890
 very simple and very interesting model 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.730
 which is called iron fist and you will find the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.959
 link in description is pretty much going to be 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.959
 the simplest thing you have ever done 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.910
 destroy everything in punches boys and after 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.650
