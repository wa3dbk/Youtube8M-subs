00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 welcome to another review of this that is 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.150
 the rom series of version 3 at the end of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.929
 install a few minutes ago and as 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.440
 we can see later this is what it has 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:17.670
 the aroma is fine and very well 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.750
 let's start the bar 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.630
 notifications because we think that we do not know 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.140
 he sees very well but the truth is that the rom brings 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.880
 more than more than 4 bars to choose from and the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.570
 I chose this one because I did not know 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.960
 which ones were and well then we can 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.750
 change and do not break it or 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.890
 simply this one of the rom brings a 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.410
 option to replace them 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.110
 what we have chosen during the 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.079
 installation we can change the bar 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.000
 we can change the sounds and everything 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.860
 that we chose before 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.420
 now let's start these are all 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.980
 the applications I chose all the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.430
 applications for you to give 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.600
 account 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.600
 which bring 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.920
 with all the letters that the times 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.330
 that brings the world one 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.330
 I'm going to show 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.120
 to see then a song but without volume 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.120
 whatever 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.970
 as we can see this is the mode of 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.290
 search 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.720
 let's see we are seeing that the wifi 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.480
 it is working without problems 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.230
 connected 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.230
 the bluetooth 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.119
 as well 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.119
 It runs smoothly 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.610
 let's see sounds 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.290
 has its own personalization of that 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.610
 lady with the slow 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.000
 Y 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.920
 I have left him now 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.640
 the language but if you can change it 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.590
 here the academic language 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.030
 let's change it here let's put it 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.590
 in Spanish 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.590
 Mexico channel that are 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.000
 let's see about the phone and see 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.209
 this is the measurement series version 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.209
 3 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.310
 there is serene 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.239
 let's see how it is with the 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.239
 with its branch 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.310
 very well 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.220
 despite all those applications that 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.140
 we have open because they behave more 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.890
 downloaded from this one 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.260
 then we can not close the rule 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:03:00.450
 is that if I'm recording we have 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.450
 110 but many processes 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.950
 let's see how much they have storage 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.570
 let's see we have 280 looks vice 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.570
 for complications 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.260
 all calls 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.260
 It works perfect 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.780
 the messages too 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.780
 place store also works very well 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.340
 and there in charge 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.030
 we have to bring them in, it was the 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.030
 album 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.110
 films 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.110
 it's more of a player 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.250
 let's see the album 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.310
 and I have some pictures 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.310
 image 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.290
 and let's also doubt the camera 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.870
 we see that she brings 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:45.039
 something very interesting that comes this rom 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:47.319
 is that it already brings as a camera for 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:51.569
 take the pictures in hdr which will 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.569
 improves the camera noticeably 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.310
 and this is one 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.710
 music widget 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.810
 is the particle we can choose 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.670
 several as I said the rom comes very 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.670
 complete with customization 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.360
 we closed this 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.900
 let's pass it 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.930
 let's see the data we know what to turn off 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.550
 the data for me and I have an I 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.699
 I manage the telcel villa melo company 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.719
 extracted by default no longer needed 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.719
 install anything 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.220
 in the 3d camera we are going to try 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:40.930
 as I told you in the 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.930
 as I was saying that the hdr version 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.930
 the beds in 3d 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.320
 Well, if it works, it does not close 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:00.830
 let's see what else 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:07.500
 with all the widgets that prime 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.500
 Lets put 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:18.760
 and very similar to what is company htc 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.760
 and we can see 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:26.840
 and well this yes button any doubt or 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.840
