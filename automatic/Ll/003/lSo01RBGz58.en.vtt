00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
about his video but YouTube did explain

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.720 
about his video but YouTube did explain
later<00:02:26.290> they<00:02:26.560> thought<00:02:26.770> his<00:02:26.950> was<00:02:27.100> multi-level

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730

up<00:02:44.170> especially<00:02:44.470> on<00:02:45.040> your<00:02:45.070> iPad<00:02:45.550> 2<00:02:46.110> that's<00:02:47.110> a

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
up especially on your iPad 2 that's a

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.350 
up especially on your iPad 2 that's a
different<00:02:47.410> thing<00:02:47.670> maybe<00:02:48.670> it's<00:02:48.880> your<00:02:48.970> Wi-Fi

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
different thing maybe it's your Wi-Fi

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.770 
different thing maybe it's your Wi-Fi
connection<00:02:49.990> maybe<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.970> has<00:02:52.180> nothing<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.600> do

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
connection maybe it has nothing to do

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.380

with<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.050> ipad<00:02:53.410> 2<00:02:53.590> perhaps<00:02:54.550> it's<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:54.970> title

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
with the ipad 2 perhaps it's the title

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.410 
with the ipad 2 perhaps it's the title
of<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.570> video<00:02:55.750> if<00:02:55.990> it's<00:02:56.140> something<00:02:56.320> scammy

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420

burning<00:02:58.420> calories<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:59.380> really<00:02:59.800> don't<00:02:59.890> think

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
burning calories I really don't think

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.800 
burning calories I really don't think
that's<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.490> maybe<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.850> is<00:03:00.970> I'm<00:03:01.270> just<00:03:01.450> glad<00:03:01.600> it

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
that's it maybe it is I'm just glad it

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.810 
that's it maybe it is I'm just glad it
worked<00:03:01.990> try<00:03:02.680> changing<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.190> title<00:03:03.459> around

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
worked try changing the title around

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.490 
worked try changing the title around
sometimes<00:03:04.330> I<00:03:04.540> know<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.720> put<00:03:05.050> a<00:03:05.080> really<00:03:05.320> long

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
sometimes I know I put a really long

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.230 
sometimes I know I put a really long
description<00:03:06.220> or<00:03:06.459> something<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.060> they've

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
description or something and they've

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.760 
description or something and they've
truncated<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:07.959> before<00:03:08.320> so<00:03:08.440> I<00:03:08.470> thought<00:03:08.650> they

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
truncated that before so I thought they

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.440 
truncated that before so I thought they
would<00:03:08.920> handle<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.310> maybe<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.150> was<00:03:10.420> it

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
would handle it maybe that was it

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.390 
would handle it maybe that was it
something<00:03:10.990> made<00:03:11.140> quirky<00:03:11.920> they<00:03:12.040> don't<00:03:12.250> like
