00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.650
 Hello everyone, brilliant and strong 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.400
 mood painting 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.759
 nike zoom w dollars 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:09.769
 there are two 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.819
 tons which occurred with 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:15.029
 the sentence of the model spiridon 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.199
 in spiridonov uniform 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.470
 sneakers 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.199
 very much like a running end model 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.779
 90 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.009
 well maybe the mid nineties 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.589
 ninety-fifth this year 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:28.679
 spiridon 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.169
 but it is very similar not only to Anna and 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.110
 structures with war colors 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.440
 it will be models like the original 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.100
 running spiridonov 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.810
 on the heels he 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.260
 nike sell spiridon for those who don't know 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.530
 and those who do not know can 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.970
 use google to see 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.260
 as you saw 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.480
 parents 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.890
 this model 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.190
 through them in general will show you 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.190
 and tell you a little 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.850
 sneakers 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.340
 rather unusual did not cause help 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.460
 no interest no americans because 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.010
 what they were selling pretty 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.270
 sluggish 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.480
 percentage eventually they hit on 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.300
 the mulatto sale we ordered 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.160
 and now we show you but it was 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.370
 done as planned 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.280
 well because this model 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.460
 the percentage is so n permeated 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.079
 nineties 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.270
 that is, without 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.880
 basketball ruler 90 let's say 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.560
 so no one thinks we are all 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.930
 Russia live 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.230
 percentage so they got attention but 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.340
 first sole 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.719
 very much like 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.119
 m she me nike sneakers comfort tank one 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.170
 of the most beloved 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.630
 m drawing you more 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.440
 underlines 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.030
 Spiridon does not speak rozumu 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.020
 she is an ordinary herringbone in red 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.090
 in light and black bodies are very clingy that's even 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.380
 finger like him 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.630
 fight with 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.489
 so I think that from April it will not be very 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.269
 even worthy 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.069
 I want to show another one by the way 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.730
 moment prepared in advance 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.229
 second split 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.619
 second protocol 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.849
 got that sneaker estimated 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.409
 cardboard retirement 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.949
 per day so that you can show 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:29.529
 interest rate 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:31.569
 almost all the top is 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.159
 st thin material mesh us this 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.619
 moves away 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:37.879
 lower membrane 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.700
 and here is the feature 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.499
 sneakers are not hard on top of the gates 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.189
 they do not differ from 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.439
 standard basketball 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.659
 models 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.099
 tough on all sides so that there are no unnecessary 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.099
 movements even here so we can do 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.039
 drift 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.429
 so literally 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:57.899
 and if not for this black material 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:01.189
 very tough like that 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.299
 vip hall materials will be closed 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.409
 maybe you're a provincial 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.409
 but such a game chamber 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.019
 Here at the expense of this black material 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.910
 and a nice pleasant feeling appears 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.989
 but when you do homework 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.069
 it can be seen that the upper part is easy 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.169
 is deformed 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.739
 that's not bad 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.809
 I understand how good it is 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.699
 n used 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.209
 hell 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.499
 tell us 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:34.969
 district production 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:36.569
 origin 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.389
 I went to yuvao thousand if someone think 100 files 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.839
 file technology itself appeared 

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:44.749
 appeared the release of hyper dunk and south 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:46.169
 consider something wrong 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.109
 technology was invented long ago 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:48.860
 long 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.870
 when the percentage of laces are combined here are the lines 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.070
 subway swept the moment strip Tallinn so 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.189
 just say 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.629
 merged when you have curtains 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:03.569
 neon 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.819
 kids sneakers tight 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.569
 brigade at the base so it was thoughtful 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.909
 chicago in the nineties just in 2008 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.379
 the percentage of it was replaced by new strips 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.400
 ultralight these words which 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.859
 actually perform 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.859
 all this function 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.600
 not very tech model 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.880
 it turns out eventually but rather 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.280
 interesting unusual may become m for 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.580
 streets sneakers will be suitable because 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.810
 ventilation at first glance is very good 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.280
 protection of thousand mesh m 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.300
 tough selection 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.050
 and the sole is simple but effectively possible 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.699
 maybe these sneakers are belted 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.140
 in the reviews on the site sol Fontanka.ru 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.130
 it may not appear hoarfrost 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.180
 video 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.879
 you can see 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:53.139
 and then already 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.460
 decide yourself like, remember there are no beauties 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.460
 inside muddy why 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.210
 small annotation sneakers 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.719
 and he is detained 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:06.960
 everything ran 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.819
 who should click on the floor 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.180
 or translate 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.729
 all that is written 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.120
 by spiridon cross country 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.279
 five years ahead 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:18.310
 edition 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.699
 very comfortably 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.409
 wear sneakers 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:25.289
 the wedding 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:26.620
 or other 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.930
 hacking house $ 9 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.249
 and read from oxford 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:33.169
 do not watch comedy club 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.400
 all the best for new meetings
