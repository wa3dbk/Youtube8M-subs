00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
and unlike cro mag where you have to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.510 
and unlike cro mag where you have to
totally<00:01:24.900> tilt<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> device<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.830> turn<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.340> one

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
totally tilt the device to turn this one

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.399 
totally tilt the device to turn this one
is<00:01:26.670> very<00:01:26.880> subtle<00:01:27.420> movements<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.170> see

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
is very subtle movements as you can see

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.020 
is very subtle movements as you can see
making<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.860> turn<00:01:29.009> i<00:01:29.070> barely<00:01:29.520> turn<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
making that turn i barely turn the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.359 
making that turn i barely turn the
device<00:01:30.150> at<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.530> very<00:01:31.680> sensitive<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
device at all so it's very sensitive and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.340 
device at all so it's very sensitive and
i<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.840> change<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
i like that you can change the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.350 
i like that you can change the
sensitivity<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:35.220> even<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.150> lowest

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
sensitivity but even the lowest

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940 
sensitivity but even the lowest
sensitivity<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.259> not<00:01:37.470> even<00:01:37.710> close<00:01:37.829> to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
sensitivity is not even close to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.080 
sensitivity is not even close to
cro-mags<00:01:38.700> highest<00:01:39.150> sensitivity<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.880> just

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
cro-mags highest sensitivity so it just

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.910 
cro-mags highest sensitivity so it just
depends<00:01:42.420> your<00:01:42.570> preference<00:01:42.990> there's<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.710> gas

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
depends your preference there's the gas

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.760 
depends your preference there's the gas
button<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.759> that's<00:01:44.880> only<00:01:45.299> that

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
button right there and that's only that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.319 
button right there and that's only that
if<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.920> slow<00:01:47.159> down<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:47.790> outside<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
road you have a time limit and you've

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.679 
road you have a time limit and you've
reached<00:01:52.560> checkpoints<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.549> i<00:01:54.240> hate<00:01:54.479> those

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
reached checkpoints and i hate those

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.510
