first thing we'll do is just check our

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.009 
first thing we'll do is just check our
water<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.730> nutrients<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.359> sure<00:00:24.600> enough<00:00:24.630> it's

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
water of nutrients and sure enough it's

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.960 
water of nutrients and sure enough it's
going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.260> need<00:00:25.410> water<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:26.160> been<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> week<00:00:26.640> and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
going to need water it's been a week and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.310 
going to need water it's been a week and
the<00:00:27.060> plants<00:00:27.330> are<00:00:27.390> getting<00:00:27.630> bigger<00:00:27.840> they're

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the plants are getting bigger they're

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.820 
the plants are getting bigger they're
drinking<00:00:28.769> lots<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:31.109> next<00:00:31.380> thing<00:00:31.500> we'll<00:00:31.679> do<00:00:31.800> is

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
drinking lots the next thing we'll do is

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.560 
drinking lots the next thing we'll do is
add<00:00:32.070> our<00:00:32.099> nutrients<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:33.120> give<00:00:33.239> them<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> quick

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
add our nutrients just give them a quick

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.950 
add our nutrients just give them a quick
shake<00:00:33.870> eight<00:00:34.770> mils<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.160> nutrients<00:00:35.640> going<00:00:35.820> in

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.049 

now<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.290> far<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.010> resisted<00:00:44.550> raising<00:00:44.940> our

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
now so far we have resisted raising our

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:45.440 
now so far we have resisted raising our
lives

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
lives

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.600 
lives
now<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:45.840> followed<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> basic<00:00:46.950> tenets<00:00:47.520> of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
now we followed the basic tenets of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.160 
now we followed the basic tenets of
arrow<00:00:47.820> gardening<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.390> want<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.660> lower<00:00:48.899> our

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
arrow gardening we want to lower our

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.410 
arrow gardening we want to lower our
plants<00:00:49.620> instead<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.160> raising<00:00:50.520> our<00:00:50.579> lights<00:00:50.850> but

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
plants instead of raising our lights but

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.459 
plants instead of raising our lights but
I<00:00:51.449> don't<00:00:51.629> think<00:00:51.690> we're<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> make<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.320> any

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
I don't think we're going to make it any

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.630 
I don't think we're going to make it any
farther<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.829> think<00:00:53.010> we're<00:00:53.100> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.460> to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
farther I think we're going to have to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.119 
farther I think we're going to have to
raise<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.059> lights<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.510> time<00:00:54.570> or<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.500> lemon

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
raise the lights this time or that lemon

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.470 
raise the lights this time or that lemon
based<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> globe<00:00:56.850> basil<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.390> going

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
based on the globe basil is just going

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.510 
based on the globe basil is just going
to<00:00:57.570> go<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.930> far<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.469> there<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.800> we're<00:00:58.949> just

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
to go so far up in there that we're just

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.389 
to go so far up in there that we're just
going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.789> burn<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> plants<00:01:00.420> up<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.399> we're

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
going to burn the plants up so we're

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.039 
going to burn the plants up so we're
going<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> raise<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.000> lights<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.420> week<00:01:03.660> I'm

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
going to raise the lights this week I'm

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.660 
going to raise the lights this week I'm
going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.290> raise<00:01:04.439> them<00:01:04.589> with<00:01:04.680> extra<00:01:05.010> high<00:01:05.280> so

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
going to raise them with extra high so

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.890 
going to raise them with extra high so
that<00:01:05.790> we<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.030> see<00:01:06.270> what<00:01:06.420> we're<00:01:06.570> doing<00:01:06.600> or

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that we can see what we're doing or

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.750 
that we can see what we're doing or
recruiting<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:08.130> we're<00:01:08.250> gonna<00:01:08.340> lower<00:01:08.549> them

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
recruiting but we're gonna lower them

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.550 
recruiting but we're gonna lower them
back<00:01:08.790> down<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.570> next<00:01:09.810> high<00:01:10.080> setting

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
back down to just the next high setting

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.980 
back down to just the next high setting
when<00:01:10.740> we're<00:01:10.890> finished<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:11.810> remember<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
when we're finished now remember the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.600 
when we're finished now remember the
purpose<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.619> pruning<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.310> keep<00:01:14.460> our

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
purpose of this pruning is to keep our

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.850 
purpose of this pruning is to keep our
gardens<00:01:14.939> looking<00:01:15.299> right<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.740> producing<00:01:16.740> that

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
gardens looking right and producing that

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.010 
gardens looking right and producing that
really<00:01:17.369> high<00:01:17.549> yields<00:01:18.030> throughout<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.630> length

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
really high yields throughout the length

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.999 
really high yields throughout the length
of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> garden<00:01:19.409> life

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
of the garden life

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.190 
of the garden life
and<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.610> what<00:01:20.820> we're<00:01:20.939> doing<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.450> we're<00:01:21.960> trying

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
and so what we're doing is we're trying

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.230 
and so what we're doing is we're trying
to<00:01:22.320> create<00:01:22.560> space<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.159> each<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.790> these<00:01:23.880> plants

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
to create space for each of these plants

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.060 
to create space for each of these plants
to<00:01:24.450> live<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.869> where<00:01:25.290> they're<00:01:25.409> getting<00:01:25.500> lots<00:01:25.860> of

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
to live in where they're getting lots of

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.830 
to live in where they're getting lots of
light<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.490> not<00:01:26.820> blocking<00:01:27.119> out<00:01:27.330> any<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.720> their

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
light and not blocking out any of their

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.719 
light and not blocking out any of their
neighbors<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.380> also<00:01:28.770> put<00:01:29.189> them<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.549> way

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
neighbors and also put them in a way

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.640 
neighbors and also put them in a way
that<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:30.450> get<00:01:30.600> bushing<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.200> bushier<00:01:31.530> to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
that they get bushing in and bushier to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.590 
that they get bushing in and bushier to
give<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> give<00:01:32.340> us<00:01:32.369> bigger<00:01:32.729> yields<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.360> they

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
give it give us bigger yields as they

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.080
