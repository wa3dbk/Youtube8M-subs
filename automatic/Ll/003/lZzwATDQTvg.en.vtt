machine you're going to be looking at

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.879 
machine you're going to be looking at
paying<00:02:50.129> around<00:02:50.310> 20<00:02:50.969> US<00:02:51.269> dollars<00:02:51.569> a<00:02:51.659> month<00:02:51.889> just

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
paying around 20 US dollars a month just

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.830 
paying around 20 US dollars a month just
for<00:02:53.069> computer<00:02:53.609> that<00:02:53.879> excludes<00:02:54.359> the<00:02:54.629> power

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
for computer that excludes the power

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.229 
for computer that excludes the power
used<00:02:55.139> by<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.379> monitor<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:56.519> speaker's<00:02:57.060> the

modem

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.570 

now<00:03:00.420> obviously<00:03:00.660> this<00:03:01.110> power<00:03:01.800> draw<00:03:02.070> drops<00:03:02.370> down

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
now obviously this power draw drops down

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.220 
now obviously this power draw drops down
a<00:03:02.640> bit<00:03:02.820> with<00:03:03.000> your<00:03:03.120> not<00:03:03.330> claim<00:03:03.600> easy<00:03:03.870> games

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
a bit with your not claim easy games

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.990 
a bit with your not claim easy games
when<00:03:04.860> you're<00:03:05.010> running<00:03:05.250> productivity

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
when you're running productivity

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.060 
when you're running productivity
application<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.660> deserving<00:03:07.080> there<00:03:07.500> when

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
application to deserving there when

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.840 
application to deserving there when
you're<00:03:08.310> watching<00:03:09.240> video<00:03:09.720> then<00:03:10.710> the<00:03:11.520> palette

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
you're watching video then the palette

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.480 
you're watching video then the palette
or<00:03:11.940> since<00:03:12.420> ever<00:03:12.960> around<00:03:13.650> 100<00:03:14.220> watts<00:03:14.510> slowly

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.670 
or since ever around 100 watts slowly
that<00:03:17.490> obviously<00:03:17.790> drops<00:03:18.090> down<00:03:18.300> your<00:03:19.110> average

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
that obviously drops down your average

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.550 
that obviously drops down your average
monthly<00:03:19.950> kilowatt<00:03:20.400> hours<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:22.200> monthly

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
monthly kilowatt hours and the monthly

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.760 
monthly kilowatt hours and the monthly
cost<00:03:23.060> but<00:03:24.060> still<00:03:24.360> having<00:03:24.840> said<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.110> 100<00:03:25.350> what

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
cost but still having said that 100 what

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.090 
cost but still having said that 100 what
color<00:03:26.040> certainly<00:03:26.790> still<00:03:27.180> significant<00:03:28.100> so

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
color certainly still significant so

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.480 
color certainly still significant so
yeah<00:03:29.280> that's<00:03:29.490> not<00:03:30.480> surprisingly<00:03:31.020> this

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
yeah that's not surprisingly this

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.340 
yeah that's not surprisingly this
computer<00:03:32.490> uses<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:32.880> lot<00:03:33.060> more<00:03:33.240> power<00:03:33.570> take<00:03:34.260> your

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
computer uses a lot more power take your

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.730 
computer uses a lot more power take your

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
average I promise me see as we saw from

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.640 
average I promise me see as we saw from
running<00:03:38.040> productivity<00:03:38.640> applications<00:03:39.270> and

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650
