nice yeah actually they do their little
magnets<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:11.100> it<00:05:11.250> so<00:05:11.430> I've<00:05:11.580> drawn<00:05:11.850> to<00:05:12.060> it<00:05:12.180> so

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
magnets to it so I've drawn to it so

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.090 
magnets to it so I've drawn to it so
there<00:05:12.930> we<00:05:13.020> go<00:05:13.050> that's<00:05:13.590> better

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
there we go that's better

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.880 
there we go that's better
so<00:05:14.460> this<00:05:14.850> works<00:05:15.090> better<00:05:15.330> so<00:05:16.080> there<00:05:16.770> are

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
so this works better so there are

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.240 
so this works better so there are
magnets<00:05:17.340> on<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.880> pads<00:05:18.120> this<00:05:18.990> one<00:05:19.169> as<00:05:19.260> well<00:05:19.410> it

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
magnets on the pads this one as well it

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.670 
magnets on the pads this one as well it
draws<00:05:20.490> right<00:05:20.820> through<00:05:21.030> okay<00:05:21.840> so<00:05:22.320> that's<00:05:22.500> step

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
draws right through okay so that's step

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.510 
draws right through okay so that's step
one<00:05:22.979> a<00:05:23.330> second<00:05:24.330> option<00:05:24.690> would<00:05:24.930> be<00:05:24.990> a<00:05:25.520> cradle

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
one a second option would be a cradle

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.300 
one a second option would be a cradle
this<00:05:26.910> is<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.120> cradle<00:05:27.300> for<00:05:27.510> the<00:05:27.600> iPod<00:05:27.960> iPhone<00:05:28.310> I

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
this is the cradle for the iPod iPhone I

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.969 
this is the cradle for the iPod iPhone I
touch<00:05:30.120> anything<00:05:30.690> that<00:05:30.930> has<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.200> iPod<00:05:31.560> connect

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
already Apple connector built into it so

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.320 
already Apple connector built into it so
basically<00:05:34.950> you<00:05:35.430> can<00:05:35.580> keep<00:05:35.729> it<00:05:35.850> on<00:05:35.910> it<00:05:36.150> says

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
it there you go

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.700 
it there you go
or<00:05:58.169> maybe<00:05:58.560> not<00:05:58.770> so<00:05:59.720> this<00:06:00.720> one<00:06:01.020> still<00:06:01.440> has<00:06:01.470> a

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
or maybe not so this one still has a

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.550 
or maybe not so this one still has a
little<00:06:01.979> bit<00:06:02.160> of<00:06:02.340> issues<00:06:02.669> looks<00:06:02.910> like<00:06:03.120> it

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.130 

straight<00:06:07.560> on<00:06:07.740> your<00:06:07.890> own<00:06:10.940> so

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
straight on your own so

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.080 
straight on your own so
I'm<00:06:13.650> gonna<00:06:13.770> take<00:06:14.100> a<00:06:14.130> look<00:06:14.310> here<00:06:14.520> because<00:06:14.550> that

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
I'm gonna take a look here because that

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.040 
I'm gonna take a look here because that
doesn't<00:06:15.390> look<00:06:15.570> like<00:06:15.740> that's<00:06:16.740> charge<00:06:17.450> hey<00:06:18.450> but

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
doesn't look like that's charge hey but

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.570 
doesn't look like that's charge hey but
that's<00:06:19.200> why<00:06:19.320> we<00:06:19.410> do<00:06:19.500> two<00:06:19.620> reviews<00:06:19.710> for<00:06:20.130> right<00:06:20.370> I

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
that's why we do two reviews for right I

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.670 
that's why we do two reviews for right I
guess<00:06:21.330> it's<00:06:21.510> working<00:06:21.690> right<00:06:21.960> now<00:06:22.140> it<00:06:22.350> doesn't

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
guess it's working right now it doesn't

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.800 
guess it's working right now it doesn't
look<00:06:22.830> like<00:06:22.920> as<00:06:23.190> 100%<00:06:23.550> or<00:06:23.910> the<00:06:24.120> cube<00:06:24.420> dough<00:06:24.600> did

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
look like as 100% or the cube dough did

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.220 
look like as 100% or the cube dough did
work<00:06:25.020> right<00:06:25.260> away<00:06:25.520> so<00:06:26.900> maybe<00:06:27.900> it's<00:06:28.080> better

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230 
work right away so maybe it's better

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.800 
work right away so maybe it's better
indeed<00:06:28.590> to<00:06:28.770> indeed<00:06:29.190> to<00:06:29.370> have<00:06:29.520> let<00:06:30.480> me<00:06:30.570> take<00:06:30.780> a

the charging port but the magnet is not

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.000 
the charging port but the magnet is not
strong<00:07:00.450> enough<00:07:00.720> as<00:07:00.960> you<00:07:01.080> can<00:07:01.260> see<00:07:01.410> to<00:07:01.620> keep<00:07:01.830> it

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
strong enough as you can see to keep it

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.520 
strong enough as you can see to keep it
into<00:07:02.430> a<00:07:02.700> vertical<00:07:03.300> position<00:07:03.600> so<00:07:04.110> you<00:07:04.170> put<00:07:04.440> it

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
into a vertical position so you put it

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.360 
into a vertical position so you put it
horizontal<00:07:05.870> real<00:07:06.870> quick<00:07:07.200> this<00:07:07.560> was<00:07:07.830> it<00:07:08.010> I<00:07:08.160> mean

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
horizontal real quick this was it I mean

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.250 
horizontal real quick this was it I mean
I<00:07:08.430> think<00:07:08.610> you<00:07:09.150> know<00:07:09.180> right<00:07:09.480> now<00:07:09.690> I<00:07:09.720> can

I think you know right now I can

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.830 
I think you know right now I can
actually<00:07:10.580> since<00:07:11.580> that<00:07:11.820> one<00:07:12.000> is<00:07:12.150> charging<00:07:12.660> as

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
actually since that one is charging as

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.800 
actually since that one is charging as
well<00:07:13.290> I<00:07:13.650> can<00:07:14.460> add<00:07:14.700> of<00:07:14.910> course<00:07:15.180> a<00:07:15.300> second<00:07:15.720> device

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810 
well I can add of course a second device

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.330 
well I can add of course a second device
to<00:07:16.290> it<00:07:16.440> and<00:07:18.020> let's<00:07:19.020> just<00:07:19.170> put<00:07:19.350> this<00:07:19.440> one<00:07:19.620> on<00:07:19.650> and
