00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.190
 hello again good let's make a 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.550
 mobile with a plastic bottle 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.279
 recycled and about 300 eva rubber is what 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.529
 we have to do what I think with 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:29.939
 a pen from here in the bottle I've 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.829
 gone round marking it to know 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.530
 where do I have to cut what I've drawn 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.670
 So far I hope you see it 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.670
 appreciate 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.629
 good then 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.629
 the beginning 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.760
 then with a to put well 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:01:02.210
 and I'm going to start spinning it with some 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:05.720
 scissors in your hand but if we want 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.619
 cutting slowly where we have 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.619
 put the stripes 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.740
 in the present 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.800
 so 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.220
 I'm doing it with a bottle of 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.330
 normal water but you can make 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.590
 soft drinks even of flavor if you have 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.590
 some flavor utility out there 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.470
 the model that is of the appetites 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.860
 yes 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:13.520
 here 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.520
 and as you see now it falls 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:21.860
 the dock let's say 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.860
 and well, along this pier 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.600
 let's stick some figures 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.370
 eva rubber 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.129
 I'm going to put the first one up 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.700
 then what is already a little bit of 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.700
 glue 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.430
 metapÃ¡n ues 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.060
 with hot glue deforms the 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.060
 plastic 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.269
 so you have to have a little 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.269
 care of 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.650
 of our too but to do it from 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.650
 this way throw it in the coin 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.239
 wait a few seconds 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.210
 and then already 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.960
 because if not the plastic then it deforms 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.950
 that's what you see seeing us what 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.950
 you see 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.290
 ah 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.930
 and we are putting ornaments 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.950
 two 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.180
 good we would have a mobile 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.939
 for children 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.239
 with many colors and I what I'm going to 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.239
 do now 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.970
 put tiny little hearts with color 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.970
 red markers 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.710
 you can put more pieces of eva rubber 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.710
 each one 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.370
 in their own way 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.950
 to put hearts like that 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.090
 and well this would be the mobile 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.960
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.960
 in the next video
