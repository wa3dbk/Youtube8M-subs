00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
because Morel tries to attack him but

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.340 
because Morel tries to attack him but
then<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.909> weird<00:01:56.969> arm<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.780> appears<00:01:58.140> from

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
out of his side to block it but this

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.060 
out of his side to block it but this
gives<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.600> good<00:02:00.719> opportunity<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.680> knuckle

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
gives a good opportunity for a knuckle

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.249 
gives a good opportunity for a knuckle
to<00:02:02.310> help<00:02:02.490> out<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.850> battle<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:03.899> shoot

here<00:02:04.560> he<00:02:04.799> really<00:02:05.369> really<00:02:05.490> sells<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.939> scene

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
here he really really sells the scene

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.600 
here he really really sells the scene
because<00:02:06.630> his<00:02:07.439> leg<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.829> hurt<00:02:08.009> he<00:02:08.250> can't<00:02:08.489> really

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
because his leg is hurt he can't really

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.249 
because his leg is hurt he can't really
move<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.060> he<00:02:09.239> decides<00:02:09.569> he's<00:02:09.810> actually<00:02:09.989> going

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
move so he decides he's actually going

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.620 
move so he decides he's actually going
to<00:02:10.410> ride<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.920> one<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.220> his<00:02:11.310> weird<00:02:11.640> floating

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
to ride on one of his weird floating

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.180 
to ride on one of his weird floating
hands<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.080> he<00:02:13.170> sends<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.500> barrage<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:14.010> his

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
hands and he sends a barrage of his

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.160 
hands and he sends a barrage of his
punches<00:02:14.610> towards<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.420> p<00:02:15.570> which<00:02:15.750> really<00:02:15.960> don't

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
punches towards you p which really don't

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.200 
punches towards you p which really don't
seem<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.470> do<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.890> much<00:02:17.130> but<00:02:17.760> he's<00:02:18.000> really

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
seem to do that much but he's really

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.820 
seem to do that much but he's really
confident<00:02:18.720> in<00:02:18.840> his<00:02:19.020> skills<00:02:19.290> at<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.560> point

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
confident in his skills at this point

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.110 
confident in his skills at this point
and<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.100> looks<00:02:20.280> like<00:02:20.400> he's<00:02:20.550> actually<00:02:20.760> gotten<00:02:21.030> a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
and it looks like he's actually gotten a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.880 
and it looks like he's actually gotten a
little<00:02:21.270> bit<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.570> power<00:02:21.750> boost<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.380> i<00:02:22.830> do

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
little bit of a power boost and i do

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.680 
little bit of a power boost and i do
like<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.310> scene<00:02:23.520> where<00:02:23.670> he<00:02:23.790> sort<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.090> at<00:02:24.210> isis

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690

and I'm not really sure what to think of
poof<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.440> know<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.620> can<00:02:35.070> analyze<00:02:35.520> him<00:02:35.730> as

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
poof you know you can analyze him as

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.760 
poof you know you can analyze him as
much<00:02:36.060> as<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.360> want<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.900> try<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.320> break<00:02:37.500> his
