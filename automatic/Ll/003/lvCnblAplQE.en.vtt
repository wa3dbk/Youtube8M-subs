like<00:02:01.830> what<00:02:02.039> I've<00:02:02.190> got<00:02:02.429> here<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:03.209> practice<00:02:03.959> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
like what I've got here in practice the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.020 
like what I've got here in practice the
way<00:02:04.410> it<00:02:04.649> works<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.220> that<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.520> program<00:02:05.789> your

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
way it works is that you program your

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.650 
way it works is that you program your
flight<00:02:06.479> plan<00:02:06.720> into<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> GPS<00:02:07.819> you<00:02:08.819> takeoff<00:02:09.300> you

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
flight plan into the GPS you takeoff you

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.690 
flight plan into the GPS you takeoff you
get<00:02:09.840> up<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.229> your<00:02:10.319> altitude<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.129> then<00:02:11.340> let<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
get up to your altitude and then let the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.850 
get up to your altitude and then let the
autopilot<00:02:12.180> do<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.720> flying<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
autopilot do the flying and the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.520 
autopilot do the flying and the
navigating<00:02:14.459> for<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.910> don't<00:02:15.810> get<00:02:15.959> me<00:02:16.080> wrong<00:02:16.260> I

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
navigating for you don't get me wrong I

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.050 
navigating for you don't get me wrong I
mean<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.890> would<00:02:17.040> also<00:02:17.220> want<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.670> confirm

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
mean you would also want to confirm

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.940 
mean you would also want to confirm
where<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.450> are<00:02:18.629> regular<00:02:19.260> intervals<00:02:19.709> by

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
where you are regular intervals by

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.920 
where you are regular intervals by
cross-checking<00:02:20.489> with<00:02:20.760> charts<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.360> landmarks

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930

with the autopilot switched on most of
the<00:02:24.660> hard<00:02:24.840> work<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.260> done<00:02:25.470> for<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:27.120> to

fun<00:02:29.910> but<00:02:30.810> then<00:02:31.080> even<00:02:31.349> learning<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.890> fly<00:02:32.099> is<00:02:32.250> a

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
fun but then even learning to fly is a

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.790

accomplishments<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.319> personally<00:02:43.950> found

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
accomplishments and I personally found

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.690 
accomplishments and I personally found
it<00:02:44.459> was<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.610> huge<00:02:44.940> confidence<00:02:45.390> builder<00:02:45.750> as<00:02:46.140> well

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
it was a huge confidence builder as well

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.369 
it was a huge confidence builder as well
learning<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.940> fly<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.180> recreational<00:02:48.870> aircraft

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
learning to fly a recreational aircraft

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.130 
learning to fly a recreational aircraft
is<00:02:49.620> also<00:02:49.980> not<00:02:50.340> as<00:02:50.489> daunting<00:02:50.670> or<00:02:51.090> as<00:02:51.540> expensive

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
is also not as daunting or as expensive

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.350 
is also not as daunting or as expensive
as<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.319> might<00:02:52.470> be<00:02:52.769> thinking<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:54.209> on

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
as you might be thinking and just on

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.030 
as you might be thinking and just on

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
that subject one of the greatest

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.040 
that subject one of the greatest

the feeling you had

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.400 
the feeling you had
you<00:03:04.250> can<00:03:04.700> actually<00:03:04.910> fly<00:03:05.330> an<00:03:05.390> aeroplane<00:03:05.630> by

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
you can actually fly an aeroplane by

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.450 
you can actually fly an aeroplane by

the Brumbies 600 LSA lowing which as you

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.730 
the Brumbies 600 LSA lowing which as you
can<00:03:13.220> see<00:03:13.400> has<00:03:13.700> gotten<00:03:13.940> great<00:03:14.240> visibility<00:03:14.740> and

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
can see has gotten great visibility and

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.220 
can see has gotten great visibility and
it's<00:03:16.130> a<00:03:16.190> really<00:03:16.520> hot<00:03:16.850> little<00:03:17.120> aircraft<00:03:17.240> I've

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
it's a really hot little aircraft I've

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.560 
it's a really hot little aircraft I've
had<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.500> fly<00:03:18.800> of<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.250> high-wing<00:03:19.610> evolution<00:03:20.390> and

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
had a fly of the high-wing evolution and

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.150 
had a fly of the high-wing evolution and
it's<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.840> different<00:03:21.170> sort<00:03:21.380> of<00:03:21.440> aeroplanes<00:03:21.920> to

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
it's a different sort of aeroplanes to

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.000 
it's a different sort of aeroplanes to
this<00:03:22.310> particular<00:03:22.670> one<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.870> evolution<00:03:24.530> seems

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
this particular one the evolution seems

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.250 
this particular one the evolution seems
to<00:03:25.220> me<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.550> be<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.700> more<00:03:25.940> practical<00:03:26.360> aircraft

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
to me to be a more practical aircraft

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.410 
to me to be a more practical aircraft
it's<00:03:27.440> bigger<00:03:27.830> inside<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.820> high<00:03:29.000> wing<00:03:29.240> is

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
it's bigger inside and the high wing is

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.350 
it's bigger inside and the high wing is
good<00:03:29.660> for<00:03:29.840> hotter<00:03:29.990> climates<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.800> also<00:03:31.790> found<00:03:32.210> it

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
good for hotter climates I also found it

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.960 
good for hotter climates I also found it
very<00:03:32.540> docile<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.410> easy<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.950> fly<00:03:34.160> aeroplane<00:03:34.670> I

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
very docile and easy to fly aeroplane I

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.760 
very docile and easy to fly aeroplane I
think<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.660> would<00:03:35.750> be<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:35.900> very<00:03:36.170> forgiving

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
think it would be a very forgiving

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.710 
think it would be a very forgiving
aircraft<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.490> that's<00:03:37.640> very<00:03:38.060> important<00:03:38.630> if

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
aircraft and that's very important if

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.300 
aircraft and that's very important if
you're<00:03:38.870> especially<00:03:39.500> if<00:03:39.770> you're<00:03:39.980> new<00:03:40.160> to

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
you're especially if you're new to

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.360 
you're especially if you're new to
flying<00:03:40.870> we<00:03:41.870> chose<00:03:42.140> our<00:03:42.380> Brumby<00:03:42.800> for<00:03:43.070> a<00:03:43.100> few

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
flying we chose our Brumby for a few

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.870 
flying we chose our Brumby for a few
reasons

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
reasons

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.960 
reasons
firstly<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:45.200> was<00:03:45.410> particularly<00:03:46.190> fun<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.760> fly

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
firstly it was particularly fun to fly

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.080 
firstly it was particularly fun to fly
it<00:03:47.720> has<00:03:47.900> phenomenal<00:03:48.410> visibility<00:03:49.370> but<00:03:49.880> also

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
it has phenomenal visibility but also

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.000 
it has phenomenal visibility but also
because<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.960> was<00:03:51.050> such<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.260> strongly<00:03:51.830> built

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
because it was such a strongly built

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.280 
because it was such a strongly built
aircraft<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.880> strengths<00:03:53.660> really<00:03:53.990> was<00:03:54.140> an

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
aircraft and strengths really was an

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.680 
aircraft and strengths really was an
important<00:03:54.710> issue<00:03:54.800> for<00:03:55.010> us<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:56.210> fact<00:03:56.390> that<00:03:56.540> it

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
important issue for us the fact that it

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.510 
important issue for us the fact that it
was<00:03:56.810> designed<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:57.500> built<00:03:57.680> in<00:03:57.800> Australia<00:03:58.370> was

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
was designed and built in Australia was

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.300 
was designed and built in Australia was
also<00:03:58.850> really<00:03:59.240> important<00:03:59.870> we<00:04:00.770> visited<00:04:01.220> the

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
also really important we visited the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.730 
also really important we visited the
factory<00:04:01.520> and<00:04:01.880> saw<00:04:02.210> firsthand<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:03.080> quality<00:04:03.620> of

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
factory and saw firsthand the quality of

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.320 
factory and saw firsthand the quality of
the<00:04:03.890> workmanship<00:04:04.460> that's<00:04:04.700> gone<00:04:04.910> into<00:04:05.120> the

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
the workmanship that's gone into the

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.140 
the workmanship that's gone into the
Brumbies<00:04:05.860> Paul<00:04:06.860> has<00:04:07.130> actually<00:04:07.520> showed<00:04:07.760> us<00:04:07.940> how

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
Brumbies Paul has actually showed us how

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.180 
Brumbies Paul has actually showed us how
and<00:04:08.480> why<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.750> bromby<00:04:09.290> was<00:04:09.470> so<00:04:09.709> much<00:04:09.890> stronger

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
and why the bromby was so much stronger

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.300 
and why the bromby was so much stronger
than<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.610> other<00:04:10.790> LSAs<00:04:11.560> he<00:04:12.560> explained<00:04:13.070> that

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
than the other LSAs he explained that

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.090 
than the other LSAs he explained that
filled<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:14.120> designer<00:04:14.590> designed<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.770> Brumby

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
filled the designer designed the Brumby

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.070 
filled the designer designed the Brumby
as<00:04:16.280> more<00:04:16.640> of<00:04:16.820> a<00:04:16.910> general<00:04:16.940> aviation<00:04:17.480> aircraft

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
as more of a general aviation aircraft

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.890 
as more of a general aviation aircraft
like<00:04:18.590> pipettes<00:04:19.100> and<00:04:19.250> Cessnas<00:04:19.760> but<00:04:20.420> under<00:04:20.810> an

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
like pipettes and Cessnas but under an

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.980 
like pipettes and Cessnas but under an
LSA<00:04:21.380> certification<00:04:22.370> so<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.300> Brumby<00:04:23.660> can

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
LSA certification so the Brumby can

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.020 
LSA certification so the Brumby can
handle<00:04:24.320> things<00:04:24.530> like<00:04:24.770> turbulence<00:04:25.370> better<00:04:25.640> and

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
handle things like turbulence better and

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.350 
handle things like turbulence better and
heavier<00:04:26.510> landings<00:04:26.960> far<00:04:27.620> better<00:04:27.920> this<00:04:28.850> means<00:04:29.180> I

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
heavier landings far better this means I

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.300 
heavier landings far better this means I
think<00:04:29.420> that<00:04:29.870> they<00:04:30.020> should<00:04:30.050> enjoy<00:04:30.620> a<00:04:30.650> generally

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
think that they should enjoy a generally

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.090 
think that they should enjoy a generally
longer<00:04:31.520> useful<00:04:31.970> working<00:04:32.630> life<00:04:32.840> closer<00:04:33.500> again

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
longer useful working life closer again

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.420 
longer useful working life closer again
maybe<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.640> general<00:04:35.030> aviation<00:04:35.980> so<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.130> bottom
