these speeds that are trying to steal
his<00:01:53.640> treasure<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.329> Don<00:01:54.570> Shinjo<00:01:55.110> said<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.680> his

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
his treasure so Don Shinjo said that his

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
his treasure so Don Shinjo said that his
family<00:01:56.280> had<00:01:56.490> been<00:01:56.520> storing<00:01:56.939> treasured<00:01:57.420> there

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570

for<00:01:57.780> years<00:01:58.049> underneath<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.770> ice<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
for years underneath the ice and the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.950 
for years underneath the ice and the
reason<00:01:59.790> they<00:01:59.850> do<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.240> because<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.780> ice

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
reason they do that is because the ice

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.770 
reason they do that is because the ice
is<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.409> thick<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.430> strong<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.240> normal
