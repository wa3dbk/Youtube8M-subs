and another point for this guys is you
get<00:02:44.160> assists<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.030> if<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.300> have<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.540> UAV<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
get assists so if you have a UAV in the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.229 
get assists so if you have a UAV in the
air<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:47.040> one<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.430> your<00:02:47.519> teammates<00:02:48.000> get<00:02:48.180> to

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
air and one of your teammates get to

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.479 
air and one of your teammates get to
kill<00:02:48.540> while<00:02:48.810> your<00:02:48.959> UAV<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.590> here<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:50.340> will

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
kill while your UAV is in here you will

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.699 
kill while your UAV is in here you will
get<00:02:50.670> about<00:02:51.060> 30<00:02:51.360> points<00:02:51.810> for<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.019> so<00:02:52.470> imagine

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
get about 30 points for that so imagine

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.280 
get about 30 points for that so imagine
if<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.010> had<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.459> UAV<00:02:53.880> account<00:02:54.480> UV<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.110> black

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
if you had a UAV account UV and a black

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.830 
if you had a UAV account UV and a black
bird<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.650> air<00:02:55.769> that's<00:02:56.489> 90<00:02:57.450> points<00:02:57.660> you're

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
bird in the air that's 90 points you're

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.180 
bird in the air that's 90 points you're
going<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.170> get<00:02:58.260> every<00:02:58.560> time<00:02:58.680> your<00:02:58.860> teammate

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
going to get every time your teammate

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.100 
going to get every time your teammate
gets<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.489> kill<00:02:59.700> for<00:02:59.880> about<00:03:00.000> 30<00:03:00.209> seconds<00:03:00.720> that

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
gets to kill for about 30 seconds that

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.530 
gets to kill for about 30 seconds that
your<00:03:01.380> your<00:03:02.040> support<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.580> in<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.790> air<00:03:02.910> which<00:03:03.420> is

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
your your support is in the air which is

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.880 
your your support is in the air which is
actually<00:03:03.690> ridiculous<00:03:04.050> guys<00:03:04.410> imagine<00:03:04.800> if

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
gives you an extra 200 points so I'm

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.870 
gives you an extra 200 points so I'm
currently<00:04:02.070> coming<00:04:02.250> out<00:04:02.430> of<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.549> game<00:04:02.640> let's

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
currently coming out of a game let's

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.940 
currently coming out of a game let's
just<00:04:03.000> say<00:04:03.090> average<00:04:03.239> on<00:04:03.510> about<00:04:03.690> 500<00:04:04.320> 5000

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
just say average on about 500 5000

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
just say average on about 500 5000
points<00:04:05.070> per<00:04:05.370> minute<00:04:05.579> which<00:04:05.700> is<00:04:05.820> ridiculous

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
points per minute which is ridiculous
