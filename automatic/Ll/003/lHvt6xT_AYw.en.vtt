kind<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.520> expensive<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:49.020> cool<00:00:49.489> so<00:00:50.489> I

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
the Aki naki that you can use it in both

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.390 
the Aki naki that you can use it in both
directions<00:02:34.989> so<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:36.510> clean<00:02:37.680> one<00:02:38.680> direction<00:02:39.250> and

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
directions so I clean one direction and

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.550 
directions so I clean one direction and
then<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.910> just<00:02:40.810> flip<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.260> over<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:43.319> do<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.349> next

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
then I just flip it over and do the next

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.890 
then I just flip it over and do the next
one

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
one

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.960 
one
not<00:02:46.900> too<00:02:47.080> much<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:49.000> now<00:02:49.599> I'm<00:02:50.200> using<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.680> vacuum

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
not too much so now I'm using the vacuum

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.930 
not too much so now I'm using the vacuum
just<00:02:51.970> putting<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.599> on<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.079> then<00:02:53.700> going<00:02:54.700> one

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
just putting it on and then going one

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.390 
just putting it on and then going one
round<00:02:55.319> putting<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.530> rest<00:02:56.769> out<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.190> brush

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
round putting the rest out of the brush

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.130 
round putting the rest out of the brush
go<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.329> other<00:02:58.450> way<00:02:58.569> around

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
go the other way around

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.890 
go the other way around
and<00:02:59.260> then<00:02:59.709> again<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:01.000> other<00:03:01.150> way<00:03:01.299> around<00:03:01.480> and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
and then again the other way around and

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:30.020 
and then again the other way around and
then<00:03:02.549> that<00:03:03.549> is<00:03:03.670> done

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.940

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
so when you turn out the vacuum arm it

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.170 
so when you turn out the vacuum arm it
should

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
should

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.110
