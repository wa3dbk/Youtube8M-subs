00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.589
 you know we do not have the right 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.220
 to publish two models before August 26 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.260
 also we asked the bride to 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.389
 the collection of yves saint laurent de 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.719
 we lend her pretty face to serve 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.279
 decor yves saint laurent you come 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.470
 to make a collection particularly 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.910
 successful I will make you forget a 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.279
 question the silhouette of the woman 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.470
 modern has not stopped evolving from the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.180
 head to toe for 20 years it's up to 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.099
 to say that 67's does not look like 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.300
 nothing to these two 47 nor to that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.980
 of 27 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.840
 do you think we are 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.620
 arrived at some sort of stabilization of 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.120
 women's fashion 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.280
 yes certainly I think in any case 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.890
 that it happens more and more through 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.230
 every collection I think life 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.180
 modern has evolved so much that everything has 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.260
 so changed that women have not 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.600
 no longer want to be transformed by 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.320
 a different silhouette each season 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.480
 and even from year to year I think 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.010
 it's a more stable thing than fashion 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.049
 happened to one thing then stable I 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.150
 think it's a lot better because that 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.350
 allows to see affirmed the style of 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.340
 couturiers before the hour then before 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.590
 it was more to hesitate flaws 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.250
 the icwa while the hall a style 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.420
 remains and asserts each year speak 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.740
 of madness there is still question 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.570
 very important is that of the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.369
 length of the skirts 40 we can not 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.200
 to say that in the street the woman is 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.650
 so elegant in the sense that you 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.110
 hear 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.640
 until now that is to say that the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.619
 elegant word has changed so much too 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.960
 one of the five plus at all say the same 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.479
 thing that before the war or even 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.100
 than ten years ago I think the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.869
 elegant word and that is replaced by the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.060
 seductive word I think we have more 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.020
 want to be seduced while being 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.829
 elegant now 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.000
 you told me it was not 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.729
 so much I say we saw in the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.960
 street all an art but that is to say there is 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.329
 the best and the worst 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.829
 in any case I am for the east for 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.170
 short dresses does it what you 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.659
 want me to say obviously everything is 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.579
 a matter of age and even women 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.159
 it's not just age but women 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.590
 bullish anyway I think it's 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.160
 a thing that will still remain a stop 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.160
 long time
