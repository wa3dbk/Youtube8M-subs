00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.160 
that side band is going to clip into so
we've<00:01:55.670> got<00:01:55.790> two<00:01:56.000> on<00:01:56.150> this<00:01:56.300> side<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:56.600> then<00:01:56.930> two

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
we've got two on this side and then two

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.210 
we've got two on this side and then two
little<00:01:57.440> cutouts<00:01:57.950> on<00:01:58.250> this<00:01:59.150> side<00:01:59.420> as<00:01:59.600> well<00:02:00.220> so

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
little cutouts on this side as well so

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.180 
little cutouts on this side as well so
to<00:02:01.280> fit<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.820> case<00:02:02.000> pop<00:02:02.900> your<00:02:03.140> iphone<00:02:03.530> on<00:02:03.740> like

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
to fit the case pop your iphone on like

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.920 
to fit the case pop your iphone on like
so<00:02:04.550> making<00:02:04.910> sure<00:02:05.150> you've<00:02:05.480> got<00:02:05.510> it<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.780> right

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
so making sure you've got it the right

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.750 
so making sure you've got it the right
way<00:02:06.140> round<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.680> then<00:02:07.370> we're<00:02:07.520> going<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.670> put

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
way round and then we're going to put

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.540 
way round and then we're going to put
this<00:02:08.030> on<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:08.509> front<00:02:08.780> first<00:02:09.379> so<00:02:09.979> not<00:02:10.220> from<00:02:10.459> the

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
this on the front first so not from the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.330 
this on the front first so not from the
back<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:11.300> needs<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.690> go<00:02:11.810> on<00:02:11.840> from<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.440> front<00:02:12.739> we

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
back it needs to go on from the front we

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.759 
back it needs to go on from the front we
go<00:02:13.489> through<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.700> control<00:02:14.000> side<00:02:14.360> first<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.110> we

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
go through the control side first and we

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.710 
go through the control side first and we
just<00:02:15.980> clip<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.640> into<00:02:17.000> place<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.599> is

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
just clip this into place so this is

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.320 
just clip this into place so this is
locating<00:02:18.349> into<00:02:18.650> those<00:02:18.800> sort<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.580> slots<00:02:20.030> on<00:02:20.269> the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
locating into those sort of slots on the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.870 
locating into those sort of slots on the
back<00:02:20.690> cover<00:02:20.960> then<00:02:21.740> we<00:02:21.920> go<00:02:22.069> for<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.580> bottom

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
back cover then we go for the bottom

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.360 
back cover then we go for the bottom
edge<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.480> top<00:02:23.690> edge<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.380> we<00:02:24.710> just<00:02:24.950> clip

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
edge and the top edge and we just clip

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.030 
edge and the top edge and we just clip
the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.630 
the
into<00:02:26.489> place<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:29.010> you've<00:02:29.159> got<00:02:29.519> to

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
into place like so and you've got to

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.509 
into place like so and you've got to
just<00:02:29.760> make<00:02:30.000> sure<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.719> it<00:02:31.379> locates<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.159> tabs

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
just make sure that it locates the tabs

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.229 
just make sure that it locates the tabs
into<00:02:32.969> the<00:02:33.829> little<00:02:34.829> portions<00:02:35.430> are<00:02:35.670> cut<00:02:35.879> out<00:02:35.909> in

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
into the little portions are cut out in

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.380 
into the little portions are cut out in
that<00:02:36.359> metal<00:02:36.659> plane<00:02:37.459> so<00:02:38.459> that's<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.790> fitted<00:02:39.209> and

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
that metal plane so that's it fitted and

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.530 
that metal plane so that's it fitted and
it's<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.930> very<00:02:39.959> thin<00:02:40.620> profile<00:02:41.219> case<00:02:41.549> but

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
it's a very thin profile case but

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.509 
it's a very thin profile case but
beautifully<00:02:43.260> made<00:02:43.470> let's<00:02:43.950> start<00:02:44.220> with<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.370> look

a<00:03:20.069> cutout<00:03:20.669> for<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.590> silence<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.709> switch<00:03:22.950> and

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
a cutout for the silence of switch and

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.250 
a cutout for the silence of switch and
the<00:03:23.430> volume<00:03:23.609> up<00:03:23.909> and<00:03:24.090> down<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.480> then<00:03:24.989> on<00:03:25.169> the

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
bottom obviously a cutout for the

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.059 
bottom obviously a cutout for the
speaker<00:03:27.419> microphone<00:03:27.659> and<00:03:28.169> dock<00:03:28.319> connector<00:03:28.829> on

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
speaker microphone and dock connector on

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.640 
speaker microphone and dock connector on
the<00:03:29.239> front<00:03:30.239> it's<00:03:30.479> obviously<00:03:30.780> completely<00:03:30.989> open

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
the front it's obviously completely open

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.300 
the front it's obviously completely open
and<00:03:31.799> there<00:03:32.609> is<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.790> very<00:03:33.449> minimal<00:03:34.319> raised<00:03:34.979> edge

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
and there is a very minimal raised edge

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.789 
and there is a very minimal raised edge
so<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.359> minimal<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:36.900> probably<00:03:37.260> not<00:03:37.470> even<00:03:37.709> a

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
so so minimal is probably not even a

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.089 
so so minimal is probably not even a
millimeter<00:03:38.239> so<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.569> would<00:03:39.870> say<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.590> if<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:40.889> do

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
millimeter so I would say that if you do

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.399 
millimeter so I would say that if you do
place<00:03:41.400> face<00:03:41.970> down<00:03:42.299> on<00:03:42.479> the<00:03:42.510> table<00:03:42.629> like<00:03:43.079> so

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
place face down on the table like so

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.710 
place face down on the table like so
your<00:03:44.010> screens<00:03:44.430> probably<00:03:45.060> not<00:03:45.269> going<00:03:45.419> to<00:03:45.510> touch
