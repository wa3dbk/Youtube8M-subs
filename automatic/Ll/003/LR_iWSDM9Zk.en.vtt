new iphone or iphone 5 so let's start
with<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.349> video<00:00:16.070> so<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.250> new<00:00:17.400> iphone<00:00:17.970> will

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
with this video so the new iphone will

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.470 
with this video so the new iphone will
have<00:00:18.570> 4<00:00:18.900> inch<00:00:19.170> screen<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:20.160> will<00:00:20.369> be<00:00:20.580> taller<00:00:20.880> it

have 4 inch screen it will be taller it

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.870 
have 4 inch screen it will be taller it
will<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:21.869> more<00:00:22.199> pixels<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.460> means<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
will have more pixels so that means the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.019 
will have more pixels so that means the
resolution<00:00:24.570> will<00:00:24.869> be<00:00:24.900> better<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:26.310> new<00:00:26.490> aspect

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
resolution will be better the new aspect

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.870 
resolution will be better the new aspect
ratio<00:00:27.480> will<00:00:27.750> be<00:00:27.779> 16<00:00:28.380> by<00:00:28.529> 9<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.429> watch

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
ratio will be 16 by 9 so you can watch

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.389 
ratio will be 16 by 9 so you can watch
with<00:00:30.269> us<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.779> full<00:00:31.050> resolution<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:32.219> new

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
with us in full resolution the new

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.959 
with us in full resolution the new
iphone<00:00:32.940> 5<00:00:33.210> will<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:34.559> also<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> different

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
iphone 5 will we also have a different

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.110 
iphone 5 will we also have a different
design<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.750> will<00:00:37.170> probably<00:00:37.530> be<00:00:37.890> curved<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.969> it

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
design it will probably be curved so it

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.420 
design it will probably be curved so it
will<00:00:39.329> look<00:00:39.360> like<00:00:39.570> apple<00:00:40.320> mouse<00:00:40.469> apple

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
will look like apple mouse apple

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.000 
will look like apple mouse apple
recently<00:00:41.670> bought<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.660> liquid<00:00:43.140> metal<00:00:43.379> company

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
recently bought a liquid metal company

recently bought a liquid metal company
so<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.340> means<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.120> iphone<00:00:45.690> 5<00:00:45.930> will

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
so that means that iphone 5 will

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.250 
so that means that iphone 5 will
probably<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:47.100> liquid<00:00:47.610> metal<00:00:48.090> back<00:00:48.329> which<00:00:49.020> is

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
your iphone the back won't scratch and

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.790

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
things the glass will be from gorilla

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.610 
things the glass will be from gorilla
glass<00:00:59.100> 2<00:00:59.210> that<00:01:00.210> means<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.140> will<00:01:01.320> be

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
glass 2 that means that it will be

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.329 
glass 2 that means that it will be
stronger<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.000> when<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.930> phone<00:01:04.500> falls<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.159> your

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
on the floor it won't break screen so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.410 
on the floor it won't break screen so
yeah<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.750> amazing<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.890> new<00:01:11.040> iphone<00:01:11.580> 5<00:01:11.850> will

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
yeah it's amazing the new iphone 5 will

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.020 
yeah it's amazing the new iphone 5 will
be<00:01:12.450> twenty<00:01:13.350> percent<00:01:13.740> stealer<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.790> will

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
be twenty percent stealer and it will

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.690 
be twenty percent stealer and it will
have<00:01:15.240> smaller<00:01:15.689> USB<00:01:16.170> dock<00:01:16.680> connector<00:01:17.250> which

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
have smaller USB dock connector which

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.960 
have smaller USB dock connector which
will<00:01:17.729> be<00:01:18.110> compatible<00:01:19.110> with<00:01:19.500> other<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:20.040> devices

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
will be compatible with other I devices

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.570 
will be compatible with other I devices
which<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.570> very<00:01:21.990> cool<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.799> will<00:01:22.979> probably<00:01:23.280> be

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
which is very cool it will probably be

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.520 
which is very cool it will probably be
faster<00:01:24.390> than<00:01:24.960> other<00:01:25.460> USB<00:01:26.460> connectors<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.659> yet

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
faster than other USB connectors and yet

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.109 
faster than other USB connectors and yet
bridge<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.369> table<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:32.040> iowa<00:01:32.460> iphone

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
bridge on table so then the iowa iphone

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.410 
bridge on table so then the iowa iphone
5<00:01:33.479> will<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.040> next<00:01:35.310> generation<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.119> iphone

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
5 will be the next generation of iphone

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.219 
5 will be the next generation of iphone

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.880 
megapixels and that's why to have sony
its<00:02:26.940> new<00:02:27.120> glass<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.810> would<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.650> phone

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
its new glass that would so the phone

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.729 
its new glass that would so the phone
will<00:02:28.920> be<00:02:29.310> better<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:29.880> low<00:02:30.090> light<00:02:30.390> performance

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
will be better in low light performance

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.970 
will be better in low light performance
and<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:32.670> will<00:02:32.940> probably<00:02:33.630> have<00:02:33.870> more<00:02:34.260> pixels<00:02:34.739> I

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
and it will probably have more pixels I

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.479 
and it will probably have more pixels I
don't<00:02:35.340> believe<00:02:35.519> because<00:02:35.970> 8<00:02:36.540> pixels<00:02:37.170> is<00:02:37.560> enough

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
don't believe because 8 pixels is enough

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.060 
don't believe because 8 pixels is enough

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
market now have 4g LTE that's why the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.080 
market now have 4g LTE that's why the
new<00:03:06.870> iphone<00:03:07.350> file<00:03:07.620> will<00:03:07.950> probably<00:03:08.459> have<00:03:08.730> four

reality<00:03:09.630> well<00:03:10.230> what<00:03:10.500> 4G<00:03:10.980> LTE<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.690> 4g<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:12.900> just

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
reality well what 4G LTE is 4g is just

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.460 
reality well what 4G LTE is 4g is just
an<00:03:13.650> upgrade<00:03:14.190> from<00:03:14.430> 3g<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.269> faster<00:03:15.840> connection

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
an upgrade from 3g is faster connection

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.660 
an upgrade from 3g is faster connection
