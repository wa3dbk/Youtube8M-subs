losing<00:00:54.360> 6-1<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.020> treat<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.890> 76

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
losing 6-1 I treat it as if it was 76

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.220 
losing 6-1 I treat it as if it was 76
and<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.640> was<00:00:56.730> closed<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:57.960> need<00:00:58.140> to

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
and it was closed and now I just need to

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.479 
and it was closed and now I just need to
turn<00:00:58.440> around<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.800> fix<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.039> couple<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.309> things

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
turn around and fix a couple of things

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.310 
turn around and fix a couple of things
and<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.850> was<00:00:59.910> able<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> do<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.870> described

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and I was able to do that you described

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.039 
and I was able to do that you described
her<00:01:01.500> there's<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.800> stubborn<00:01:02.399> whim<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.480> also

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
her there's a stubborn whim and also

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.660 
her there's a stubborn whim and also
he's<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.350> wind<00:01:04.589> perhaps<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.159> needed<00:01:05.580> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
he's the wind perhaps that you needed to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.670 
he's the wind perhaps that you needed to
win<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.030> match<00:01:06.240> more<00:01:06.510> than<00:01:06.540> than<00:01:07.170> Ryan<00:01:07.409> did

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
win that match more than than Ryan did

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.080 
win that match more than than Ryan did
yeah<00:01:08.159> possibly<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.549> mean<00:01:08.700> he's<00:01:08.790> got<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.970> great

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
yeah possibly I mean he's got a great

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.130 
yeah possibly I mean he's got a great
future<00:01:09.150> ahead<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.570> him<00:01:09.689> he's<00:01:09.869> got<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
future ahead of him he's got the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
future ahead of him he's got the
Olympics<00:01:10.470> coming<00:01:10.560> up<00:01:10.799> next<00:01:10.920> week<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.400> he's<00:01:11.640> um

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
Olympics coming up next week so he's um

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.330 
Olympics coming up next week so he's um
he<00:01:12.570> might<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:12.990> focused<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.220> is

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
he might be focused on that but it is

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.440 
he might be focused on that but it is
definitely<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.760> stubborn<00:01:15.060> when<00:01:15.240> where<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
