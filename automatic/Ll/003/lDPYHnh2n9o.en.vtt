right<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.540> our<00:01:00.660> cables<00:01:01.020> cross<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
right with our cables cross in the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.890 
right with our cables cross in the
center<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:02.330> which<00:01:03.330> will<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.600> harder<00:01:03.870> to

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
center here which will be harder to

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.359 
center here which will be harder to
access<00:01:04.320> once<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.770> underneath<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.190> flight

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
access once it's underneath the flight

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:14.890 
access once it's underneath the flight
track<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.790> want<00:01:08.910> to<00:01:09.000> rub<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.270> in

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.880 

take<00:01:15.560> our<00:01:15.680> cable<00:01:15.860> slide<00:01:16.570> and<00:01:17.570> you'll<00:01:17.690> notice

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
take our cable slide and you'll notice

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.810 
take our cable slide and you'll notice
one<00:01:18.890> groove<00:01:19.130> is<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.280> little<00:01:19.460> bit<00:01:19.550> deeper<00:01:19.700> than

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
one groove is a little bit deeper than

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.480 
one groove is a little bit deeper than
the<00:01:20.030> other<00:01:20.180> that<00:01:20.840> groove<00:01:21.170> is<00:01:21.470> gonna<00:01:21.710> go<00:01:22.160> on<00:01:22.370> the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
the other that groove is gonna go on the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.090 
the other that groove is gonna go on the
top<00:01:22.670> cable<00:01:23.230> so<00:01:24.230> we're<00:01:24.320> gonna<00:01:24.410> set<00:01:24.620> it<00:01:24.710> slightly

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
top cable so we're gonna set it slightly

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.760 
top cable so we're gonna set it slightly
off-center<00:01:25.780> make<00:01:26.780> sure<00:01:26.930> both<00:01:27.110> cables<00:01:27.530> are<00:01:27.680> in

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
off-center make sure both cables are in

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.150 
off-center make sure both cables are in
the<00:01:27.860> grooves<00:01:28.130> on<00:01:28.370> the<00:01:28.520> bottom<00:01:28.670> side<00:01:32.110> at<00:01:33.160> this

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
the grooves on the bottom side at this

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.240 
the grooves on the bottom side at this
point<00:01:34.460> we<00:01:35.450> can<00:01:35.600> start<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.960> feed<00:01:36.260> that<00:01:36.560> cable

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
point we can start to feed that cable

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.550 
point we can start to feed that cable
slide<00:01:37.460> underneath<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.450> flight<00:01:38.690> track<00:01:38.960> and

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
slide underneath the flight track and

slide underneath the flight track and
into<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.640> groove<00:01:40.880> now<00:01:41.170> once<00:01:42.170> we<00:01:42.290> have<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.470> part

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
into the groove now once we have a part

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.700 
into the groove now once we have a part
way<00:01:42.920> in<00:01:44.770> we<00:01:45.770> can<00:01:45.920> slide<00:01:46.479> cables<00:01:47.479> over<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.619> we

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
way in we can slide cables over so we

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.660 
way in we can slide cables over so we
can<00:01:48.800> line<00:01:48.979> them<00:01:49.130> up<00:01:50.020> with<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.080> front<00:01:51.320> of<00:01:51.410> stock

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
can line them up with the front of stock

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.120 
can line them up with the front of stock
at<00:01:52.670> this<00:01:52.850> point<00:01:53.350> we<00:01:54.350> want<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.680> make<00:01:54.800> sure<00:01:54.979> the
