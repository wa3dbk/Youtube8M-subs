done I am doing a guide up safely that

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.150 
done I am doing a guide up safely that
will<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.179> up<00:00:15.269> soon<00:00:15.599> as<00:00:15.780> well<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.890> front<00:00:17.070> of

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
will be up soon as well so in front of

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.700 
will be up soon as well so in front of
me<00:00:17.250> I've<00:00:17.369> got<00:00:17.609> my<00:00:17.820> garage<00:00:18.480> door<00:00:18.960> remote<00:00:19.529> here

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
me I've got my garage door remote here

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.910 
me I've got my garage door remote here
so<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> wireless<00:00:20.730> remote<00:00:21.080> and<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.830> can

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
so this is a wireless remote and you can

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.220 
so this is a wireless remote and you can
see<00:00:23.100> normally<00:00:23.430> push<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> button<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:25.050> get<00:00:25.199> a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
see normally push the button we get a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.810 
see normally push the button we get a
light<00:00:25.410> up<00:00:25.590> there<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:26.310> see<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.490> couple<00:00:26.670> of

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
light up there you can see a couple of

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.189 
light up there you can see a couple of
wires<00:00:26.970> come<00:00:27.300> out<00:00:27.480> there<00:00:27.599> actually<00:00:27.750> wired

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
wires come out there actually wired

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.429 
wires come out there actually wired
directly<00:00:28.769> into<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.429> switch<00:00:29.760> here<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.439> over

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
directly into this switch here and over

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.799 
directly into this switch here and over
to<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:32.460> little<00:00:32.520> device<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:33.090> which<00:00:33.360> happens

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
to this little device here which happens

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.340 
to this little device here which happens
to<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.340> bluetooth<00:00:35.340> headset<00:00:36.200> it's<00:00:37.200> been

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to be a bluetooth headset it's been

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.860 
to be a bluetooth headset it's been
modified<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> transistor<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.329> whatnot

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
modified with a transistor and whatnot

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.590 
modified with a transistor and whatnot
you'll<00:00:40.140> see<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> guide<00:00:41.360> now<00:00:42.360> what

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
we're actually doing with tasker if we

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.650 
we're actually doing with tasker if we
bring<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.840> up<00:00:45.870> as<00:00:46.170> well<00:00:47.210> scrub<00:00:48.210> my<00:00:48.360> phone

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
here open up you'll see them tasca we're

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.840 
here open up you'll see them tasca we're
actually<00:00:51.270> connecting<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.379> headset

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
actually connecting to the headset

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.920 
actually connecting to the headset
waiting<00:00:53.850> three<00:00:54.090> seconds<00:00:54.570> we're<00:00:54.750> actually

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
waiting three seconds we're actually

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.229 
waiting three seconds we're actually
waiting<00:00:55.250> to<00:00:56.250> get<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.399> full<00:00:56.730> Bluetooth

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
have happens on the disconnect on this

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.490 
have happens on the disconnect on this
particular<00:01:04.830> headsets<00:01:05.400> not<00:01:05.610> always<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> same

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
particular headsets not always the same

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.590 
particular headsets not always the same
that's<00:01:07.500> why<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> had<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.890> use<00:01:08.010> cut<00:01:08.490> aska<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.450> you

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
that's why I had to use cut aska so you

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.230 
that's why I had to use cut aska so you
see<00:01:09.810> there<00:01:10.049> three<00:01:10.650> seconds<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.250> boom<00:01:11.460> we're

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
here which one ova gate of currently God

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.570 
here which one ova gate of currently God
glance<00:01:21.600> up<00:01:23.270> just<00:01:24.270> try<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.020> bit<00:01:25.229> more

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
glance up just try and get it a bit more

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.550 
glance up just try and get it a bit more
so<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.909> got<00:01:27.090> glanced<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.570> we've<00:01:27.840> got<00:01:28.080> pebble

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
so we got glanced up we've got pebble

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.030 
so we got glanced up we've got pebble
Tasker<00:01:29.100> installed<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> pebble<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:31.200> just

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
Tasker installed on the pebble so just

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.940 
Tasker installed on the pebble so just
click<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.280> there<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:33.210> get<00:01:33.390> our<00:01:33.950> three

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
click that there we get our three

current toss-up hit door and the light

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.999 
current toss-up hit door and the light
up<00:01:39.810> means<00:01:40.229> we're<00:01:40.530> opening<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:43.140> Sony<00:01:43.649> is

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
up means we're opening the Sony is

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.100 
up means we're opening the Sony is
pretty<00:01:44.729> good<00:01:44.909> as<00:01:45.060> well<00:01:45.090> nice<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.750> easy<00:01:45.899> I'm

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
pretty good as well nice and easy I'm

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.389 
pretty good as well nice and easy I'm
utilizing<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.860> new<00:01:47.240> Tasker<00:01:48.890> smile<00:01:49.890> extension

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
utilizing the new Tasker smile extension

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.210 
utilizing the new Tasker smile extension
here<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.329> open<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.810> up<00:01:51.979> see<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> little

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
here so we open it up see a little

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.990 
here so we open it up see a little
Tasker<00:01:53.790> symbol<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:55.610> it's<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.670> little<00:01:56.790> bit

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
Tasker symbol there it's a little bit

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.889 
Tasker symbol there it's a little bit
difficult<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.719> do<00:01:58.619> while<00:01:59.009> recording<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.750> there

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
difficult to do while recording so there

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.959 
difficult to do while recording so there
we<00:02:00.990> are<00:02:01.020> door<00:02:01.560> through<00:02:02.280> same<00:02:02.490> throught<00:02:02.759> else

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
we are door through same throught else

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.460 

and<00:02:09.460> light<00:02:09.670> up<00:02:09.880> so<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:12.160> is<00:02:12.810> our<00:02:13.810> garage<00:02:14.230> door

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
and light up so that is our garage door
