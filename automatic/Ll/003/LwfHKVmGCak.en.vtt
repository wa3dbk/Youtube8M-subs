00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
it's kind of cool I think he also had a

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.250 
it's kind of cool I think he also had a
little<00:03:50.850> piece<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.000> sticky<00:03:51.480> stuff<00:03:51.690> in<00:03:51.900> this<00:03:52.080> I

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
little piece of sticky stuff in this I

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.960 
little piece of sticky stuff in this I
might<00:03:52.410> have<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.560> make<00:03:52.770> sure<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:52.950> keep<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.400> so

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
might have to make sure I keep that so

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.020 
might have to make sure I keep that so
overall<00:03:54.209> this<00:03:54.570> is<00:03:54.810> kind<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.800> hard<00:03:56.130> box<00:03:56.580> to

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
overall this is kind of a hard box to

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.810 
overall this is kind of a hard box to
get<00:03:57.270> as<00:03:57.540> my<00:03:57.810> first<00:03:58.230> one<00:03:58.590> because<00:03:59.160> as<00:03:59.760> the

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
get as my first one because as the

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.600 
get as my first one because as the
letter<00:04:00.690> stated<00:04:01.320> there<00:04:01.980> were<00:04:02.220> some<00:04:02.459> issues

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
letter stated there were some issues

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.640 
letter stated there were some issues
with<00:04:02.850> this<00:04:03.180> one<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:03.780> makes<00:04:04.110> it<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.350> little

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
with this one and that makes it a little

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.070 
with this one and that makes it a little
harder<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.550> judge<00:04:05.940> because<00:04:06.630> this<00:04:06.930> is

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
harder to judge because this is

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.530 
harder to judge because this is
obviously<00:04:07.530> just<00:04:07.620> kind<00:04:08.100> of<00:04:08.190> stuff<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:09.060> was

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
grabbed and thrown together as kind of a

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.970
