00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:16.009
 hello to all and is ecstatic to offer you our social cinema 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.299
 to know how close to belfort with p'tit bonheur 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.609
 we can find here a drama that reverses 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.070
 so s to allow to vanquish in objects in objects by removing them 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.839
 so that's not the case I show you what it is 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.349
 but that the invader 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.550
 and gerard that stamkos has not yet known is by scoring 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.330
 very in control 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.450
 433 we do one thing it's the banks and I deleted 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.330
 but we do not know how much we absolutely want to win on our own 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.080
 we learned money those after JC in this country would be a plus 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.150
 wicked mini-series xiii inculcate a previous tip 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.840
 and a third child 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.970
 it's a language that one 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.450
 we do not know anything more with a previous sphere 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.090
 and that's for sure 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.240
 we could create their weight to access without super nice and that's so much 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.850
 better 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.650
 so we started new project files 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.420
 we will create a sphere 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.590
 the return will be slower to be done 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.360
 met at the circus 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.650
 in a match like that 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.600
 then we've been looking so hot to click here - click here and check out 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.820
 bright 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.240
 burned by seeing what you want 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.900
 so then 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.220
 it will be necessary to place in first 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.060
 the logic where the feet that follow the objects above all the docks removed 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.420
 so me 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.280
 those matches francisco ranked first of the object and that is deleted 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.850
 twelve posts that are removed on the feathers quack 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.100
 curcumin will be removed 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.170
 we renew our first vehicle 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.760
 and in Switzerland lasserre 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.160
 we are going as we can see the previous quarter 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.450
 so I'm ready to eat 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.720
 so in this us open in the court-bouillon must first 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.269
 the object that remains fixed to the choice and second the object that is deleted 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.949
 we can see that however the facts are not 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.429
 so you can of course expand the climate and take all sizes 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.429
 the insurer 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.189
 it's worse than that 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.189
 we came to arise a meaning 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.429
 the opposing players 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.889
 matthieu vasseur 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.889
 she was going up to the mercury hotel 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.549
 here good wind changes place since are announced 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:45.429
 fault 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:48.649
 so these people but it's simple so we can not really created very beautiful 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:49.699
 things with seriousness 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.159
 but this object 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.219
 so that's what the hearing point is in 2060 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.039
 so that's this clarification for them why 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:01.779
 orange always how to use the film the ranks we end up at the latest 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:02.769
 for the stage speaker
