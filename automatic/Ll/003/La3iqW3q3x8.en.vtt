00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
guitar sounds like when we play it with

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.660 
guitar sounds like when we play it with
a<00:01:37.940> flat<00:01:38.240> pick<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:39.040> what<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.310> first<00:01:40.520> thing

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
a flat pick and what the first thing

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
Macassar ebony is not only the warmth

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.110 
Macassar ebony is not only the warmth
but<00:01:44.930> also<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.620> balance<00:01:45.830> of<00:01:46.280> each<00:01:46.550> individual

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
but also the balance of each individual

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.150 
but also the balance of each individual
string<00:01:47.510> as<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:47.810> play<00:01:48.020> chords<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:48.860> hear<00:01:49.010> each

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
string as you play chords you hear each

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160 
string as you play chords you hear each
note<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:49.730> they<00:01:50.000> just<00:01:50.270> kind<00:01:50.450> of<00:01:50.510> jump<00:01:50.810> out<00:01:50.960> at

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
note and they just kind of jump out at

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.460 
note and they just kind of jump out at
you<00:01:51.410> with<00:01:51.790> unprecedented<00:01:52.790> clarity<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:53.900> so

you with unprecedented clarity and so
what<00:01:54.620> I'll<00:01:54.740> do<00:01:54.890> is<00:01:54.920> I'll<00:01:55.130> play<00:01:55.250> through<00:01:55.490> a

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
what I'll do is I'll play through a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.460 
what I'll do is I'll play through a
chord<00:01:55.760> progression<00:01:55.790> first<00:01:56.540> soft<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.170> then

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
chord progression first soft and then
