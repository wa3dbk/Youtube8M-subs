bar<00:01:50.280> chord<00:01:52.550> ok<00:01:53.550> so<00:01:54.120> those<00:01:54.390> are<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.570> three<00:01:54.690> main

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
bar chord ok so those are the three main

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.860 
bar chord ok so those are the three main
chords<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.620> song<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> opening<00:01:57.030> is

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
chords of this song so the opening is

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.650 
chords of this song so the opening is
exactly<00:01:58.260> what<00:01:58.410> I<00:01:58.440> just<00:01:58.650> played<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:59.660> eleventh

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
exactly what I just played the eleventh

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:09.119 
exactly what I just played the eleventh
fret<00:02:02.750> 9th<00:02:03.750> fret

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:15.729 

then<00:02:10.129> a<00:02:10.340> 74<00:02:13.390> what<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.420> actually<00:02:14.660> suggest<00:02:15.440> is

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
then a 74 what I actually suggest is

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.699 
then a 74 what I actually suggest is
playing<00:02:16.519> just<00:02:16.970> an<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.269> barre<00:02:18.080> chord<00:02:18.110> because<00:02:18.590> I

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
playing just an a barre chord because I

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.990 
playing just an a barre chord because I
think<00:02:18.769> sometimes<00:02:19.069> he<00:02:19.370> plays<00:02:19.459> that<00:02:19.700> as<00:02:19.819> well

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
think sometimes he plays that as well

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.970 
think sometimes he plays that as well
instead<00:02:20.330> of<00:02:20.900> having<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.140> worry<00:02:21.349> about<00:02:21.379> muting

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
instead of having to worry about muting

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.009 
instead of having to worry about muting
that<00:02:22.129> fourth<00:02:22.400> string<00:02:22.760> we're<00:02:23.750> just<00:02:23.870> going<00:02:23.989> to

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
that fourth string we're just going to

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.009 
that fourth string we're just going to
say<00:02:24.140> it's<00:02:24.290> in<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:24.470> bar<00:02:25.430> chord<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:26.900> the

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
say it's in a bar chord so that is the

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.680 
say it's in a bar chord so that is the
opening<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.890> then<00:02:28.400> when<00:02:28.879> she<00:02:29.030> sings<00:02:29.330> the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
opening and then when she sings the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.780 
opening and then when she sings the
first<00:02:29.900> verse<00:02:30.200> this<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:31.010> it's<00:02:31.670> always

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
first verse this is it it's always

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.190 
first verse this is it it's always
different<00:02:32.060> when<00:02:32.239> she's<00:02:32.450> singing<00:02:32.959> when<00:02:33.080> she's

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
different when she's singing when she's

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.350 
different when she's singing when she's
not<00:02:33.349> singing<00:02:33.590> I'll<00:02:33.830> explain<00:02:34.099> that<00:02:34.310> it's<00:02:35.000> up
