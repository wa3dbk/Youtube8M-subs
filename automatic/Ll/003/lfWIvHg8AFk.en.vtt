they're there they're reusable that's

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.479 
they're there they're reusable that's
pretty<00:03:43.750> neat<00:03:43.930> you<00:03:44.829> can<00:03:44.859> buy<00:03:45.069> something

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
pretty neat you can buy something

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.550 
pretty neat you can buy something
affordably<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:46.269> can<00:03:46.419> reuse<00:03:46.599> it<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:49.560> I

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
affordably and you can reuse it so I

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.180 
affordably and you can reuse it so I
mean<00:03:51.519> it's<00:03:51.730> it's<00:03:51.940> funny<00:03:52.299> when<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.069> when<00:03:54.069> you

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
mean it's it's funny when you when you

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.940 
mean it's it's funny when you when you
find<00:03:54.459> something<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.030> simplistic

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
find something so simplistic

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.390 
find something so simplistic
that's<00:03:56.950> that<00:03:57.639> stop<00:03:57.970> such<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.889> such<00:03:59.889> a<00:03:59.919> big

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
that's that stop such a such a big

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.059 
that's that stop such a such a big
problem<00:04:00.730> because<00:04:01.290> if<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.470> look<00:04:02.620> at<00:04:02.769> a<00:04:02.829> cruise

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
problem because if you look at a cruise

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.349 
problem because if you look at a cruise
ship<00:04:03.099> we'll<00:04:03.579> just<00:04:03.730> use<00:04:03.849> a<00:04:03.880> cruise<00:04:04.150> ship<00:04:04.329> for

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
ship we'll just use a cruise ship for

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:05.789 
ship we'll just use a cruise ship for
example<00:04:04.870> this<00:04:04.959> could<00:04:05.109> be<00:04:05.169> used<00:04:05.440> for<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.680> variety

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
example this could be used for a variety

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.520 
example this could be used for a variety
of<00:04:06.160> applications<00:04:06.959> but<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:08.019> cruise<00:04:08.260> ship<00:04:08.380> for

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
of applications but a cruise ship for

of applications but a cruise ship for
example<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:10.090> may<00:04:10.239> get<00:04:10.450> a<00:04:10.480> really<00:04:10.870> good<00:04:11.049> deal

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
example you may get a really good deal

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.129 
example you may get a really good deal
on<00:04:11.349> a<00:04:11.440> cruise<00:04:12.269> but<00:04:13.269> like<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.630> mentioned<00:04:14.019> earlier

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
on a cruise but like I mentioned earlier
