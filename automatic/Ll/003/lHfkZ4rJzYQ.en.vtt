00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.420
 and the only thing that has percent pose these glasses and this other device in the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.730

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.580
 cheeks 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.020
 why I chose the bleach do not allow those layoffs because good 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.130
 can cause small erosions that disappear over time but do not 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.990
 They are nice as for what we do 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.160
 that perfect island between everything that is not tooth we leave the tooth exposed and 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.550
 We are applying the sun whitening gel to the tooth at this time 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.250
 hydrogen peroxide this consists of one in one the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.730
 that is going to react with a very powerful light was going to make it stay is going to be the 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.650
 activate 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.840
 the white the bleach archangel 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.120
 on top of the actor who is the one who is no more and kind announcer 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.900
 it was a Friday of the United States in less than an hour we can have the 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.670
 Perfect teeth for back national rosalia see perfectly what happens 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.770
 that is not advisable criminal right after being done veto but 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.799
 Yes effectively 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.549
 is an ultra-fast approach in 45 minutes in the worst case scenario 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.850
 say that it is the maximum because we do in chemistry we do not do more than 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.440
 three 15-minute sessions 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.070
 yes or we still can not we do not think we can raise any more we give them some 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.020
 buckets so they keep tracking at home for all three 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.880
 days lester medel whitening all color depends on the functions of each patient 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.270
 but in principle with those 45 minute poets - sometimes only two sessions 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.610
 we will have enough today while the data continues to apply this 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.999
 product in helena 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.909
 I want to tell you that in this clinic we have another possibility and it is 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.919
 through screens how are you big where are you going to be able to see the face of lena 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.039
 without these glasses and without this device in your mouth 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:39.289
 We can see the final result how our mouth will look before 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:44.759
 start the treatments this is something new and allows us to say no 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:48.579
 I do not know if for a corporate tone for a treatment for all this not 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.059
 you're more for a complete treatment and on the other is to say this in which what 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:55.389
 it is a smile design we make a face analysis 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:59.260
 we demand of the develop a series of facial lines to see 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.330
 the social equilibrium and from there what we are going to signals that obvious 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.640
 lidia improves the patient is not in this case is not the extreme whitening 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.819
 standard teeth whiter but what we are interested in is the 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.650
 way to say 6 gingival smile if there is none if we have something for the runners 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.660
 vowels that are the back teeth much more stuffed inside than 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.900
 we can maybe expand the arc a little 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.150
 that's what we're saying is that we could do with these teeth is 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.960
 say we give different techniques 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.570
 to make them from a much more conservative to others later to what 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.600
 better a little more aggressive but good are they will fall in the poor s daring 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.319
 we all work with a surgical microscope 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.419
 to go to the smallest detail and veneers that are practically like paper 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.759
 with which you do not notice practically anything and the dye almost does not have to touch it 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.810
 Well, it seems like we're going to see 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.870
 this light this take this treatment as we say novelty finishes nygaard 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.930
 united states and allows us to have a white smile and perfect in so 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.410
 only in less than an hour they tell us we're going to see the result we're going to
