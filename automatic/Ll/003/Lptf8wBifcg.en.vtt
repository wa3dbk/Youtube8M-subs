towel around it get as much that dusting
as<00:03:09.209> possible<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:10.590> then<00:03:10.739> turn<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:10.980> on<00:03:11.190> nice<00:03:11.430> and

slow

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.410 

it's<00:03:15.510> still<00:03:15.780> escaping<00:03:16.430> now<00:03:17.430> hopefully<00:03:17.700> you

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
it's still escaping now hopefully you

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.120

you<00:03:20.250> can<00:03:20.400> stop<00:03:20.580> see<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.730> nice<00:03:20.970> smooth

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
you can stop see a nice smooth

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.630 
you can stop see a nice smooth
buttercream<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.710> now<00:03:23.010> we<00:03:23.070> can<00:03:23.190> do<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> ganache

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
buttercream and now we can do a ganache

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.730 
buttercream and now we can do a ganache
because<00:03:23.760> our<00:03:23.970> cream<00:03:24.240> is<00:03:24.360> also<00:03:24.510> hot<00:03:24.870> pour<00:03:25.650> it

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
because our cream is also hot pour it

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.980 
because our cream is also hot pour it
straight<00:03:25.950> over<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.430> chocolate<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:27.330> that

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
straight over the chocolate and that

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.630 
straight over the chocolate and that
should<00:03:28.230> be<00:03:28.350> enough<00:03:28.770> to<00:03:28.980> melt<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.280> chocolate

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
should be enough to melt the chocolate

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.520 
should be enough to melt the chocolate
so<00:03:29.730> leave<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.210> for<00:03:30.420> about<00:03:30.570> a<00:03:30.660> minute<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.350> then

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
so leave it for about a minute and then

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.930 
so leave it for about a minute and then

after a minute Jamie I want to stir it

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.820 
after a minute Jamie I want to stir it
into<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.150> beautifully<00:03:33.750> smooth<00:03:34.110> ganache<00:03:34.320> now

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
into a beautifully smooth ganache now

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:35.930 
into a beautifully smooth ganache now
we're<00:03:35.040> gonna<00:03:35.130> do<00:03:35.220> our<00:03:35.250> buttercream<00:03:35.730> which

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
we're gonna do our buttercream which

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.910 
we're gonna do our buttercream which
needs<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.180> go<00:03:36.360> into<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.690> piping<00:03:36.900> bag<00:03:37.050> you<00:03:37.800> can

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
needs to go into a piping bag you can

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.650 
needs to go into a piping bag you can
get<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.100> nice<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.370> smooth<00:03:39.300> in<00:03:39.480> without

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
get it nice and smooth in without

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.120 
get it nice and smooth in without
getting<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:40.170> mess<00:03:40.350> later<00:03:40.560> on<00:03:40.740> when<00:03:40.830> it<00:03:40.890> comes<00:03:41.040> to

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
getting a mess later on when it comes to

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.260 
getting a mess later on when it comes to
squeezing<00:03:41.460> it<00:03:41.520> there<00:03:41.790> we<00:03:41.850> go<00:03:41.910> I<00:03:41.940> think<00:03:42.120> that's

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
squeezing it there we go I think that's

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.720 
squeezing it there we go I think that's
plenty<00:03:42.450> for<00:03:42.930> now<00:03:43.050> yeah<00:03:43.680> let<00:03:44.310> me<00:03:44.370> squeeze<00:03:44.580> that

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
plenty for now yeah let me squeeze that

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.490 
plenty for now yeah let me squeeze that
down<00:03:44.790> towards<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.210> bottom<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:46.170> we've<00:03:46.260> got<00:03:46.380> all

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
down towards the bottom so we've got all

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.900 
down towards the bottom so we've got all
the<00:03:46.590> bits<00:03:46.710> we<00:03:46.830> need<00:03:46.980> now<00:03:47.160> is<00:03:47.190> time<00:03:47.550> he's<00:03:47.730> not

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
the bits we need now is time he's not

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.640 
the bits we need now is time he's not
constructing<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:48.570> we<00:03:48.630> put<00:03:48.780> one<00:03:48.990> of<00:03:49.020> our<00:03:49.260> cake

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
constructing so we put one of our cake

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.760 
constructing so we put one of our cake
bases<00:03:50.160> like<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.210> and<00:03:51.840> then<00:03:52.020> around<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.380> bottom

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
bases like so and then around the bottom

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.130 
bases like so and then around the bottom
I've<00:03:52.920> got<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.130> few<00:03:53.400> pieces<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:54.150> greaseproof

I've got a few pieces of greaseproof

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.780 
I've got a few pieces of greaseproof
paper<00:03:55.200> okay<00:03:55.950> but<00:03:56.160> we're<00:03:56.250> just<00:03:56.280> going<00:03:56.460> to<00:03:56.520> slide

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
paper okay but we're just going to slide

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.880 
paper okay but we're just going to slide
in<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.390> is<00:03:57.510> what<00:03:57.630> makes<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.900> decoration<00:03:58.290> later

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.390 
so idiot-proof okay Sofia shoots are
those<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.560> important<00:04:01.830> thing<00:04:01.920> is<00:04:02.010> it's<00:04:02.220> not

those the important thing is it's not
joined<00:04:02.730> at<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:02.940> middle<00:04:03.180> but<00:04:03.480> tucks<00:04:03.780> in<00:04:03.990> around

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
joined at the middle but tucks in around

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.840 
joined at the middle but tucks in around
the<00:04:04.290> edges<00:04:04.320> now<00:04:04.950> we<00:04:05.010> don't<00:04:05.310> want<00:04:05.520> to<00:04:05.550> be<00:04:05.640> shy
