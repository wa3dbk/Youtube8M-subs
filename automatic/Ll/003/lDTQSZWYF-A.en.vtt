00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.200
 welcome to my first 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.080
 video tutorial about video chat 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.940
 it's about a split screen too 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.679
 do 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.370
 with the free programs video 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.100
 experience with the also from free license 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.170
 I am in version 3.0 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.270
 I did not look for anyone for a long time 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.330
 a splitscreen does about youtube 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.250
 looked looked at the internet but there 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.240
 seems to be different from others 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.439
 to give versions 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:37.739
 therefore, mostly the version 2.4 or 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:41.690
 shown higher or lower as you can see 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.980
 that's not the case with the west and 3.0 anymore 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.930
 I also have a bit of a wolf 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.420
 searched as I now am I doing 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.550
 I really had to search a bit 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.149
 The solution is so easy on hand 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.309
 if I show you then yes 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.120
 Also conceivable there you would have yourself 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.309
 can come on it 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.280
 yes, in any case, we have to do with it 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.040
 start making videos in the video 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.200
 I've done it here at 13 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.100
 then we pull up the first video here 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.830
 the first video track 2 dobhan about it 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.580
 that a little bit smaller and 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.580
 copy the whole 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:25.180
 apps 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.180
 the other part instead of the front one 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.189
 we would have the first video now 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:02.799
 covered directly in front of the upper video 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:05.590
 and now we want to do that 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.810
 our video on the right side 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.290
 time rating the above over the video 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.970
 on the left side and so-called 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.530
 picture screen 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.910
 First of all you have to go to this one 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.790
 effect go 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.730
 the first time on it is important that 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.440
 you release this motion as the first 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.489
 step 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.380
 why I'll show you right away 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.599
 second video format so umstellen 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.940
 become 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:36.099
 Attention now it will be loud and now 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.280
 we have to write that effect 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.170
 insert 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.160
 With this we can have a specific one 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.530
 Select area 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.400
 in the video I take here now the times 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.170
 middle we make vertical splitscreen 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.450
 That's about as far as the lenses 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.450
 give pictures to the right 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.930
 it is enough to show when we do this job 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.780
 We have already chosen 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.580
 We now have the motion again 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.709
 insert 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.920
 quite simply the wild so then rises 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.930
 to add because you've already back so 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.319
 With this motion you can do this 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.150
 position image now 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:28.799
 I now take 25 as 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.090
 proven meadow grazing screen power 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.150
 you can see the whole picture is going down 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:41.819
 right pushed in principle already in the 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:44.079
 first game screen made using the 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.200
 second videos I want you now 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:51.629
 show what happens when you do the motion 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:57.269
 let in and start this job 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:04:00.750
 I passed the following is enough 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.750
 that middle 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.000
 so and now you can just think 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.600
 motion also the appeal court too 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.980
 push 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.240
 you think this is wrong now 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.420
 The screen stays here in the 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.060
 Center left and right remains free as 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:25.040
 to see here and only the picture will 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.440
 of course, has moved so lively 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.390
 because this video bed what happens 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.760
 apparently on levels just like it 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:37.370
 maybe at photoshop bread time and 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:40.340
 So at genf it's also trying that 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.190
 upper describes the lower, so to speak 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:48.420
 that means first has to be evaluated 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.930
 we'll clear that 80 again 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.930
 passed 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:05:02.310
 then only this vegetable motion 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:07.880
 Of course now we can drown here 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.880
 Let's go to the minus - 25 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:15.260
 now left side hopes that wonderful 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:21.120
 andrÃ© clasen 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:23.580
 that is again just loading looks thinks 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.460
 now the chains will become balloon music for you 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:30.000
 and then you have one 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.290
 beautiful splitscreen right his 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.290
 left the other 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.330
 it can be so easy with the video 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.380
 patton splitscreen 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.070
 you can of course also with it 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:47.720
 individual pictures make the move 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.720
 in principle there is always itself 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.380
 call a splitscreen you're just 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.360
 this one looks a bit scared 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.300
 choose 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.670
 could we make at will 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.410
 I hope to do the next of those 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.900
 Do not want to search for too long now 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.860
 on youtube this is me again 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.460
