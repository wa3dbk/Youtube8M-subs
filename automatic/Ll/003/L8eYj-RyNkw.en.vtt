00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
compatible with math which is also

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.969

awesome<00:01:29.860> iMovie<00:01:30.790> which<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.300> have<00:01:31.630> on<00:01:31.660> my<00:01:32.020> Mac<00:01:34.979> at

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
awesome iMovie which I have on my Mac at

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.830 
awesome iMovie which I have on my Mac at
the<00:01:36.160> bottom<00:01:36.490> there's<00:01:36.729> not<00:01:36.880> much<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.360> it<00:01:37.390> and

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
the bottom there's not much to it and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.469 
the bottom there's not much to it and
the<00:01:38.440> only<00:01:38.740> flaw<00:01:38.950> but<00:01:39.009> this<00:01:39.340> camera<00:01:39.729> guys<00:01:39.940> is

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
the only flaw but this camera guys is

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.919 
the only flaw but this camera guys is
that<00:01:41.429> there's<00:01:42.429> no<00:01:42.670> internal<00:01:43.179> memory<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:43.660> you

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
that there's no internal memory so you

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.070 
that there's no internal memory so you
have<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.560> buy<00:01:44.710> an<00:01:44.770> SD<00:01:45.190> card<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:46.300> SD<00:01:46.720> cards

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
have to buy an SD card and the SD cards

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.580 
have to buy an SD card and the SD cards
are<00:01:47.289> not<00:01:47.500> cheap<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.160> that's<00:01:48.429> not<00:01:48.610> too<00:01:48.880> cool<00:01:49.590> so

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
are not cheap so that's not too cool so

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.260 
are not cheap so that's not too cool so
let's<00:01:50.710> just<00:01:50.950> go<00:01:51.130> ahead<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.610> get<00:01:51.850> straight<00:01:52.119> on
