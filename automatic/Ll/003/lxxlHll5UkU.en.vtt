00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.600
 maximum 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.090
 a coach who sees his team 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.879
 bat we tried everything needed a little bit of 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.159
 success we did not have today we 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.620
 will pick up next time here it is 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:15.480
 stays seven games 5 out of 9 it's not a 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.370
 disaster except for those who thought 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.360
 we were going for a walk 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.370
 I always said we would not take 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.939
 never in professional football 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.090

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.860
 participate in the game an aside the other 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.409
 was still very good obviously he kids 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.500
 interested is axel who sacrifices 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.519
 I find that in this position there 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.970
 can evolve in all major clubs 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.769
 europe 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.629
 axel is a player who thinks only of 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.620
 the team and that's exceptional it's 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.829
 for that I say it now 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.329
 and when we have this mentality there ah ben 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.739
 I think it 's not just him 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.200
 a lot who also sacrifices that's what 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.940
 what matters is that the whole is there 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.420
 the group is here and believe me he lives 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.250
 very well 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.720
 he lives very well and I have a lot 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.849
 enjoyed the return date name well we 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.950
 combine difficult it was not heated 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.799
 real directly the boy and here it is 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.139
 there are some posing players who are 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.980
 ready but that's fine it's a 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.980
 positive competition
