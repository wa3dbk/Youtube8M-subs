we<00:02:39.530> started<00:02:39.830> by<00:02:39.950> mounting<00:02:40.280> up<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.459> super<00:02:40.760> 44

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
we started by mounting up the super 44

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.789 
we started by mounting up the super 44
mufflers<00:02:41.540> first<00:02:41.810> making<00:02:42.320> sure<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.620> leave

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
mufflers first making sure to leave

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.229 
mufflers first making sure to leave
everything<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.370> lose<00:02:43.489> until<00:02:43.910> we<00:02:44.000> got<00:02:44.120> the

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
everything to lose until we got the

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.759 
everything to lose until we got the

complete system installed in the line

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.039 
complete system installed in the line
then<00:02:46.370> we<00:02:46.670> snaked<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.030> tailpipes<00:02:47.600> over<00:02:47.959> the

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
then we snaked the tailpipes over the

rearend housing and hooked them to the
mufflers<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.630> entire<00:02:50.900> install<00:02:51.350> could<00:02:51.470> be

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
mufflers the entire install could be

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.440 
mufflers the entire install could be
done<00:02:51.739> at<00:02:51.830> home<00:02:51.860> or<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.400> lift<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.150> took<00:02:53.299> us

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
done at home or on a lift and it took us

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:02.820 
done at home or on a lift and it took us
less<00:02:53.780> than<00:02:54.019> 90<00:02:54.440> minutes

simple sure it sounds good which
everybody<00:03:21.100> wants<00:03:21.610> but<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.060> also<00:03:22.210> reduces<00:03:22.510> back

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
everybody wants but it also reduces back

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.150 
everybody wants but it also reduces back
pressure<00:03:23.410> which<00:03:23.650> gives<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:23.980> more

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
pressure which gives you more

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.850 
pressure which gives you more
acceleration<00:03:24.850> power<00:03:25.270> and<00:03:25.660> performance<00:03:25.860> that

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
acceleration power and performance that

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.900 
acceleration power and performance that
it<00:03:26.980> looks<00:03:27.130> cool
