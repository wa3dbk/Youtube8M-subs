00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.790
 i need the mode a junior 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:38.950
 world champion politics today a cd about 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:40.900
 nutrition under the motto think big me 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.760
 have a weekly plan like you 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.250
 you promise if you stick to it 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.850
 maintain absolute stop we will 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.110
 In any case, my twelve scores 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.890
 week plan is divided into two 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.409
 sections 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.629
 twice six weeks the first six 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:01:00.120
 weeks is because of the mass phase 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.120
 with just over 4,000 kilocalories 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.620
 last six weeks are the 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.840
 position data quotes there 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.660
 what are the carbohydrates and the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.000
 calorie reduction are you this 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.160
 conventional 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.500
 Without them that means you start 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.869
 the pieces level and then reduces 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.090
 first the carbohydrates then slowly 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.220
 If you produce the fat you are on 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.380
 a healthy level is probably still good 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.250
 loses and reduces that because always 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.740
 further down 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.590
 as I said the reduce twice once 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.500
 Full throttle mat phase in the last six 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.479
 weeks we increase the training was like that 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.119
 that we reduce the calories, so to speak 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.160
 and the training load increase so that 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.810
 the shape gets better because of us 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.810
 move us more and eat less 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.850
 I have been here so typical 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:14.930
 The dish is cooked and that is today 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.390
 schnitzel it rice vegetables and salad 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.140
 that's such a typical bodybuilding 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.730
 easy to saturate with 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.830
 the feeling of satiety is good there 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.110
 meat with come on our use 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.750
 our meat shelves lean meat 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.320
 no matter what can take bÃ¼chel fischer 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.570
 I'm actually ahead of the price 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.490
 inside the rice potatoes noodle no matter 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.200
 what do you take care of you have to stop 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.160
 take care everything has different 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.959
 nutrition information 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.940
 that's why everything has to be different 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.340
 I'm also more likely to be 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.380
 the vaude guy i have my theme he 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.600
 from the beginning of the preparation to 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.700
 the end of the preparation then i would 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.300
 I always know exactly how much I want to 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.300
 I eat 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.920
 I can promise you if you are 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.720
 it hold absolutely no checks on off 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.000
 runs off but is in the parish 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.110
 function 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 that is generally the jbl days within 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.000
 the twelve weeks just settles as 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.140
 alarm preparation, there are no dates 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.240
 otherwise you can phase in the mass 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.640
 entry to and adjustable ausschau 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.440
 at home biting but the conviction that 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.060
 first date should look only now 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.410
 everything comes last again 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.600
 last models asks is right 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.750
 so I decided more 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.000
 carbohydrates eat more food too 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.730
 but take it clean I'm one 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.680
 Supporters of it too far beyond the 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.780
 form not to come between matches 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.820
 and if nothing was shooting at me 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.850
 just eight to ten kilograms 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:55.160
 try to nourish the whole clean 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.160
 and as you can see many good results 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.560
 all diet or all this preparation 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.450
 or wants to do a lot of discipline in hessen 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.070
 the all because I myself is the 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.410
 match athlete the so iron 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.390
 discipline it to the opponent so that it is the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.320
 Country to leader was hard to fall 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.480
 held to it 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.010
 why are immediately on the tricks 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.590
 It can make things easier 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.440
 For example, you can eat everything 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.870
 little diet ketchup off it was only two 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.660
 tablespoon of equipment is not full 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.490
 customer but logical chain was on it 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.620
 you can use a lot of fabric you can 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.540
 colleagues 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.610
 not only drinking water has to be natural 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.630
 Do not just collude this too much 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.650
 use fabric 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.510
 but you can do a lot for 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.460
 For example, you can get a lean quark 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.810
 to bake a cheesecake 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.430
 it 's just simple without 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.620
 carbohydrates and stuff like that 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.280
 So, the whole preparation 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.010
 facilitate 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.960
 The important thing is the calories that I have 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.540
 keep wrote down that he by 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.560
 Data not 100 grams 1300 ill 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.479
 double or 100 grams per 100 grams 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.070
 Everything has gotten off others and that 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.770
 is very important that you keep you there 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.870
 But I always paid no attention to what 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.820
 always consultants but reward because of that 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.199
 pull by hold on to the twelve 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.949
 week plan and we will be on everyone 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.949
 follow the case
