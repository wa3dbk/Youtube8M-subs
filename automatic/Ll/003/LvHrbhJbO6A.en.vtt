and Bear Grylls and what does it contact

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.220 
and Bear Grylls and what does it contact
survival<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.090> they've<00:02:21.180> tried<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.659> steal<00:02:22.049> this

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
survival and they've tried to steal this

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.170 
survival and they've tried to steal this
idea<00:02:22.409> this<00:02:23.250> clip<00:02:25.099> you<00:02:26.099> can<00:02:26.220> see<00:02:26.519> it<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.909> see

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
idea this clip you can see it you see

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.140 
idea this clip you can see it you see
the<00:02:27.299> two<00:02:27.480> little<00:02:27.779> arrows<00:02:28.109> so<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:29.430> slides<00:02:29.760> into

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the two little arrows so it slides into

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.289 
the two little arrows so it slides into
this

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
this

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.959 
this
and<00:02:32.299> you<00:02:32.989> can<00:02:33.170> make<00:02:33.349> it<00:02:33.530> slide<00:02:34.400> in<00:02:34.579> like<00:02:34.609> this

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:34.969 
and you can make it slide in like this

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.170 
and you can make it slide in like this
so<00:02:35.749> that<00:02:35.780> way<00:02:36.139> your<00:02:36.349> knife<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.310> your<00:02:37.909> belt

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
so that way your knife and your belt

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.979 
so that way your knife and your belt
will<00:02:38.510> be<00:02:38.540> facing<00:02:39.019> upwards<00:02:39.769> or<00:02:40.599> you<00:02:41.599> can<00:02:41.780> have

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
will be facing upwards or you can have

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.319 
will be facing upwards or you can have
it<00:02:42.139> down<00:02:42.439> so<00:02:43.069> that<00:02:43.099> way<00:02:43.370> your<00:02:43.700> knife<00:02:43.879> you'd<00:02:44.239> be

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
it down so that way your knife you'd be

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.569 
it down so that way your knife you'd be
pulling<00:02:44.540> down<00:02:45.010> grabbing<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:46.189> pulling<00:02:46.430> it

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
pulling down grabbing it and pulling it

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.670 
pulling down grabbing it and pulling it
down<00:02:46.760> rather<00:02:47.090> than<00:02:47.239> up<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.049> can<00:02:48.200> change<00:02:48.409> it

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
down rather than up so you can change it

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.080 
down rather than up so you can change it
and<00:02:49.189> it<00:02:49.280> comes<00:02:49.489> with<00:02:49.579> a<00:02:49.730> little<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.750> know

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
and it comes with a little you know
