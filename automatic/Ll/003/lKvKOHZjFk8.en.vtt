00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.200
 good afternoon, the window company was a layer 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.480
 represents the highlight of the range 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.169
 wooden windows 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.959
 sliding doors and with this wooden 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:18.780
 doors that work on the original 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.680
 technology they don't open like 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.190
 standard window 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.830
 they move on the runners while they 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.030
 provide the same tightness 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.480
 what kind of heat preservation and 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.590
 noise resistance 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.450
 like good thick dense 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.470
 wooden windows such doors are also sometimes 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.890
 are called 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.950
 the rise in thinking is due to 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.280
 feature of the mechanism as a control 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.590
 allows you to open this door when 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.100
 pulls out side to open 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.550
 pass 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.050
 it is in the lower position further 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.960
 when the door approaches the crane and 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.799
 it is necessary that the door is closed she 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.010
 runs up to 4 on 2 pieces and which 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:13.460
 mounted on the frame and slightly 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.380
 rises at this moment happens 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.010
 perimeter sealing ie we 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.950
 we leave from blowing we leave from 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.420
 freezing 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.399
 what doors can be made as with 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.700
 mechanical lock locking 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:35.740
 so with electric controlled 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.869
 via remote control 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.270
 modern hardware for doors 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.390
 Hss gotta allows you to make 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.909
 products are very large so 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.009
 the usual double door which 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.110
 presented in our video where one 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.890
 half does not open and the second 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.530
 moves 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.099
 may have overall dimensions about height 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.490
 up to two meters 80 centimeters and 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:04.700
 width up to 6 meters that is one 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.130
 the flap can be three by three 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.360
 almost 9 pair of such 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.209
 the truth is there are limitations 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.760
 maximum load limit 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.720
 which can be on forms that is 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.239
 by weight 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.180
 the door itself carry with double glazing 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.280
 which cannot be installed cannot 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.709
 exceed 400 program if weight 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.060
 exceeds then we are forced of course 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.060
 reduce designs 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:42.209
 such a door consists naturally of 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.250
 wood glazing is not the most important thing 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.640
 fittings in which to provide 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.430
 and accessories are included not only the element 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.120
 which drives the door and here 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.909
 handles pigments but lower threshold yes 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.799
 The current series of type rock which we see this 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:05.359
 not wooden threshold is a threshold consisting 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:09.389
 from aluminum and special plastic 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:13.519
 which provides heat protection not 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:17.629
 penetration cold fashion room 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:20.669
 There are many options 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.519
 opening such doors as well as in 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:26.879
 windows there is a choice and when 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:30.060
 ordering doors and having the opportunity 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.669
 the choice of configuration of the opportunity 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.549
 choice of opening this will see 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:37.349
 standard door one part deaf 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.500
 friend opens here 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.220
 both flaps can move on each 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.669
 boyfriend 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:48.419
 and then through the creative door which 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:50.639
 cleared from the center to the edge of the deaf 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:54.660
 an element that is naturally sufficient 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:57.360
 Malvina cooking is often in demand . 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.630
 there are options when not moving on 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.240
 one stupid part and the other part 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.140
 Made for beauty and option when 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.320
 two doors can take one piece 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.300
 either two flaps are shifted to the side 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:17.730
 opening a wide enough passport and 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.100
 the most interesting thing is of course the corner 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.850
 designing openings for installation 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.520
 lift on sliding doors highest need 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:31.400
 remember to have two nuances 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.990
 1 heavy doors therefore 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.290
 attachment points must be strong 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.830
 the area should be made of durable 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.220
 of the material 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.430
 the second part of the door hacks work well 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.160
 only if the opening is absolutely 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.160
 perfectly matched to the level i.e. 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.220
 the slightest drop and immediately the doors 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.800
 pester work well so if you 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.740
 get ready to purchase these doors 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.610
 please take care of the right 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.479
 prepare 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.969
 and correctly making area
