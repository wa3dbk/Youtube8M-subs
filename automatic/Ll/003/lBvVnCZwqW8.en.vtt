definitely<00:01:57.509> more<00:01:57.659> interesting<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.380> by

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
definitely more interesting just by

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.109 
definitely more interesting just by
virtue<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.950> having<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.369> friend<00:01:59.610> along<00:01:59.790> for<00:01:59.850> the

virtue of having a friend along for the
ride<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.930> means<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.350> sometimes<00:02:01.799> have<00:02:02.009> these

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
ride it means you sometimes have these

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.499 
ride it means you sometimes have these
moments<00:02:02.460> where<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.969> two<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.299> might

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
moments where the two of you might

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.420 
moments where the two of you might
startle<00:02:03.960> each<00:02:04.079> other<00:02:04.290> as<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.920> come<00:02:05.159> running

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
startle each other as you come running

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.399 
startle each other as you come running
out<00:02:05.520> through<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.880> shadows<00:02:06.270> one<00:02:07.140> neat<00:02:07.380> thing

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
out through the shadows one neat thing

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.319 
out through the shadows one neat thing
about<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.009> co-op<00:02:08.250> mode<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.820> a<00:02:09.000> lot<00:02:09.269> of

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:09.329 
about the co-op mode is that a lot of

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.729 
about the co-op mode is that a lot of
the<00:02:09.450> game<00:02:09.600> story<00:02:09.929> sequences<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.619> been

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
the game story sequences have been

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.650 
the game story sequences have been
retouched<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.519> justify<00:02:12.030> their<00:02:12.209> being<00:02:12.450> two

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
retouched to justify their being two

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.210 
retouched to justify their being two
Marines<00:02:12.989> running<00:02:13.290> around<00:02:13.530> instead<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.920> just

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
Marines running around instead of just

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.789 
Marines running around instead of just
one<00:02:14.690> it's<00:02:15.690> also<00:02:15.870> worth<00:02:16.140> bringing<00:02:16.350> up<00:02:16.590> one

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
one it's also worth bringing up one

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.220 
one it's also worth bringing up one
point<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.130> caution<00:02:17.519> about<00:02:17.640> co-op<00:02:18.090> mode<00:02:18.329> you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
point of caution about co-op mode you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.870 
point of caution about co-op mode you
can<00:02:19.410> start<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.709> co-op<00:02:19.950> session<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:20.400> any<00:02:20.640> level

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
can start a co-op session on any level

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.340 
can start a co-op session on any level
of<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.180> game<00:02:21.329> so<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.900> cheap<00:02:22.140> way<00:02:22.320> of

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
of the game so it's a cheap way of

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.990 
of the game so it's a cheap way of
possibly<00:02:22.799> spoiling<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.549> experian

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
of the single-player and co-op game is

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.500 
of the single-player and co-op game is
essentially<00:02:28.680> identical<00:02:28.800> in<00:02:29.400> both<00:02:29.610> cases<00:02:30.120> it's

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
essentially identical in both cases it's

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.670 
essentially identical in both cases it's
a<00:02:30.570> pretty<00:02:30.750> long<00:02:30.990> series<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.410> missions

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
a pretty long series of missions

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.580 
a pretty long series of missions
weighing<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.340> at<00:02:32.460> around<00:02:32.580> 15<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.330> 20<00:02:33.630> hours<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
weighing in at around 15 to 20 hours the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.290 
weighing in at around 15 to 20 hours the
gameplay<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.070> actually<00:02:35.490> pretty<00:02:35.730> easy<00:02:35.820> either

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
gameplay is actually pretty easy either

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.540 
gameplay is actually pretty easy either
way<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.170> first<00:02:37.470> person<00:02:37.800> shooter<00:02:38.070> vets<00:02:38.310> should

way so first person shooter vets should

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.880 
way so first person shooter vets should
be<00:02:38.670> able<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.970> breeze<00:02:39.240> on<00:02:39.450> through<00:02:39.750> but<00:02:40.620> that

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
be able to breeze on through but that

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.740 
be able to breeze on through but that
along<00:02:41.400> with<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.820> variety<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.420> silly

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
contrivances that stick out from all

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.370 
contrivances that stick out from all
those<00:02:44.490> great<00:02:44.790> graphics<00:02:45.270> like<00:02:45.600> how<00:02:45.990> you<00:02:46.050> can't

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
those great graphics like how you can't

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.170 
those great graphics like how you can't

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
nerve-wracking or intense as it probably

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.920 
nerve-wracking or intense as it probably

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
multiplayer mode in a word it's okay

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.240 
multiplayer mode in a word it's okay
it's<00:02:57.840> basically<00:02:58.170> just<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.530> bunch<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.830> variants

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
it's basically just a bunch of variants

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.670 
it's basically just a bunch of variants
on<00:02:59.430> 4<00:02:59.730> player<00:02:59.970> deathmatch<00:03:00.510> it's<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.320> faster

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
on 4 player deathmatch it's a faster

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.680 
on 4 player deathmatch it's a faster
paced<00:03:01.920> game<00:03:02.040> than<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.459> campaign<00:03:02.940> but<00:03:03.239> since

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
paced game than the campaign but since

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.229 
paced game than the campaign but since
doom3<00:03:04.260> doesn't<00:03:04.590> have<00:03:04.680> much<00:03:04.890> depth<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:05.550> the

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
doom3 doesn't have much depth to it the

doom3 doesn't have much depth to it the
running<00:03:06.540> gun<00:03:06.750> action<00:03:06.989> online<00:03:07.440> can<00:03:07.680> actually

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
running gun action online can actually

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.280 
running gun action online can actually
get<00:03:08.130> old<00:03:08.340> pretty<00:03:08.400> quick<00:03:08.640> but<00:03:09.480> yeah<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.959> still

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
get old pretty quick but yeah it still

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.040 
get old pretty quick but yeah it still
looks<00:03:10.500> real<00:03:10.709> nice<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:12.630> other<00:03:12.750> thing<00:03:13.020> about

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
looks real nice the other thing about

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.630 
looks real nice the other thing about
dhoom<00:03:13.440> 3<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.830> there<00:03:14.130> aren't<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.580> many

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
dhoom 3 is there aren't that many

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.760 
dhoom 3 is there aren't that many
memorable<00:03:15.150> moments<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.870> campaign<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.650> all

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
memorable moments in the campaign it all

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.800 
memorable moments in the campaign it all
sort<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:17.070> just<00:03:17.280> blends<00:03:17.550> together<00:03:17.760> again<00:03:18.660> you

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
sort of just blends together again you

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.120 
sort of just blends together again you
might<00:03:18.959> end<00:03:19.140> up<00:03:19.260> having<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.650> much<00:03:19.830> better<00:03:19.860> time

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
might end up having a much better time

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.250 
might end up having a much better time
playing<00:03:20.610> in<00:03:20.730> co-op<00:03:21.090> since<00:03:21.600> that<00:03:21.750> makes<00:03:21.989> for<00:03:22.230> a

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
playing in co-op since that makes for a

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.560 
playing in co-op since that makes for a
more<00:03:22.440> dynamic<00:03:22.650> experience<00:03:23.370> still<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.420> game

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
more dynamic experience still the game

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.240 
more dynamic experience still the game
definitely<00:03:24.930> gives<00:03:25.290> an<00:03:25.440> outstanding<00:03:26.010> first

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
definitely gives an outstanding first

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.890 
definitely gives an outstanding first
impression<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.180> first<00:03:27.390> time<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.600> see

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
impression and the first time you see

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.360 
impression and the first time you see
some<00:03:28.110> of<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.260> monsters<00:03:28.620> you'll<00:03:28.799> be<00:03:28.920> really

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370
