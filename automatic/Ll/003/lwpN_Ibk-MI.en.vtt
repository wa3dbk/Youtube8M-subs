which has a 5.3 inch screen so small
like<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.909> hybrid<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.840> tablet<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.439> smartphone

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
like a hybrid of a tablet and smartphone

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.039 
like a hybrid of a tablet and smartphone
which<00:01:21.060> also<00:01:21.210> comes<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.630> stylus<00:01:22.020> that

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
which also comes to stylus that

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.380 
which also comes to stylus that
interacts<00:01:22.590> with<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> phone<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.280> there<00:01:24.270> was

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
interacts with the phone and there was

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.440 
interacts with the phone and there was
also<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:25.740> Nokia<00:01:26.100> Lumia<00:01:26.159> 900<00:01:26.970> which<00:01:27.210> runs

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
also the Nokia Lumia 900 which runs

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.330 
also the Nokia Lumia 900 which runs
windows<00:01:28.170> which<00:01:28.860> was<00:01:29.159> also<00:01:29.750> very<00:01:30.750> interesting

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
windows which was also very interesting

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.760 
windows which was also very interesting
so<00:01:32.340> um<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.970> mean<00:01:33.630> most<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.170> these<00:01:34.290> phones<00:01:34.560> are

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
so um I mean most of these phones are

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.010 
so um I mean most of these phones are
probably<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.490> use<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.939> know<00:01:36.570> quad-core

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
probably going to use you know quad-core

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.140 
probably going to use you know quad-core
processors<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.770> higher<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.430> capacity<00:01:38.970> than

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
processors and higher and capacity than

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.390 
processors and higher and capacity than
the<00:01:39.270> existing<00:01:39.479> ones<00:01:40.220> some<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the existing ones some of the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.719 
the existing ones some of the
interesting<00:01:41.610> ultrabooks<00:01:42.540> which<00:01:43.729> obviously

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
interesting ultrabooks which obviously

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.429 
interesting ultrabooks which obviously
were<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> main<00:01:45.600> features<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.140> the

were one of the main features of the
show<00:01:46.700> included<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> HP<00:01:48.450> Spectre<00:01:48.840> which<00:01:49.020> uses

this<00:02:13.040> was<00:02:13.190> also<00:02:13.430> another<00:02:13.520> ultrabook

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
this was also another ultrabook

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.250 
this was also another ultrabook
introduced<00:02:14.300> now<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.629> one<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:14.810> interesting

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
introduced now this one is interesting

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.960 
introduced now this one is interesting
because<00:02:15.379> it<00:02:15.739> actually<00:02:15.890> has<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:18.280> all<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.640> ports

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
because it actually has a all the ports

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.910 
because it actually has a all the ports
hidden<00:02:20.269> behind<00:02:20.450> which<00:02:20.930> come<00:02:21.170> off<00:02:21.319> as<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.560> as<00:02:21.860> a

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
hidden behind which come off as a as a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.400 
hidden behind which come off as a as a
hidden<00:02:22.879> sort<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.300> dock<00:02:23.540> when<00:02:23.959> you<00:02:24.050> press<00:02:24.260> the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
hidden sort of dock when you press the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.860 
hidden sort of dock when you press the
button<00:02:24.440> her<00:02:24.830> suitor<00:02:25.190> raises<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.000> Ultrabook

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
button her suitor raises the Ultrabook

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.809 
button her suitor raises the Ultrabook
and<00:02:27.080> then<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:27.769> have<00:02:27.890> access<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.340> these<00:02:28.459> ports

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
and then you have access to these ports

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.759 
and then you have access to these ports
so<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.870> has<00:02:30.019> pretty<00:02:30.260> some<00:02:30.440> pretty<00:02:30.620> cool

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
so it has pretty some pretty cool

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.170 
so it has pretty some pretty cool
features<00:02:31.250> as<00:02:31.400> well<00:02:31.430> which<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.819> can<00:02:31.910> check<00:02:31.940> out
