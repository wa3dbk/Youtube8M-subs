00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
is now installed on the ipad mini when

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.490 
is now installed on the ipad mini when
you<00:04:56.819> do<00:04:56.970> install<00:04:57.389> do<00:04:57.659> the<00:04:57.810> right-hand<00:04:58.289> edge

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
you do install do the right-hand edge

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.010 
you do install do the right-hand edge
first<00:04:58.830> get<00:04:59.639> the<00:04:59.819> silicone<00:05:00.090> gel<00:05:00.569> underneath

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
first get the silicone gel underneath

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.529 
first get the silicone gel underneath
the<00:05:01.349> hard<00:05:01.680> case<00:05:02.009> inserts<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:02.879> thence<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.389> lot

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
the hard case inserts and thence a lot

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:04.879 
the hard case inserts and thence a lot
easier<00:05:03.719> to<00:05:03.900> put<00:05:04.110> in<00:05:04.229> on<00:05:04.349> the<00:05:04.440> left-hand<00:05:04.800> side

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
easier to put in on the left-hand side

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.890 
easier to put in on the left-hand side
as<00:05:05.219> you<00:05:05.370> can<00:05:05.490> see<00:05:05.729> it<00:05:06.150> definitely<00:05:06.569> adds<00:05:06.599> a<00:05:06.780> nice

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
as you can see it definitely adds a nice

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.080 
as you can see it definitely adds a nice
look<00:05:07.440> to<00:05:07.469> the<00:05:07.710> actual<00:05:07.949> ipex<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.580> got<00:05:08.669> this<00:05:08.759> red

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
look to the actual ipex you got this red

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.089 
look to the actual ipex you got this red
border<00:05:09.930> now<00:05:10.080> and<00:05:10.349> obviously<00:05:10.440> gives<00:05:10.919> it<00:05:11.069> a

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
border now and obviously gives it a

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.070 
border now and obviously gives it a
maximum<00:05:11.580> protection<00:05:11.729> like<00:05:12.599> I<00:05:12.629> said<00:05:12.840> you<00:05:12.990> do

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
maximum protection like I said you do

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.600 
maximum protection like I said you do

two grooves here I know it's really
simple<00:06:09.900> and<00:06:10.169> it<00:06:10.259> may<00:06:10.379> sound<00:06:10.620> petty<00:06:11.009> to<00:06:11.250> a<00:06:11.279> few

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
simple and it may sound petty to a few

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.850 
simple and it may sound petty to a few
people<00:06:11.879> but<00:06:12.139> giving<00:06:13.139> these<00:06:13.289> grooves<00:06:13.680> here

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
people but giving these grooves here

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.040 
people but giving these grooves here
just<00:06:14.219> allows<00:06:14.639> for<00:06:14.819> added<00:06:15.060> support<00:06:15.270> it<00:06:15.629> it

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
just allows for added support it it

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.409 
just allows for added support it it
makes<00:06:16.349> it<00:06:16.560> the<00:06:17.129> ipad<00:06:17.520> mini<00:06:17.550> feel<00:06:18.060> like<00:06:18.270> it's

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
makes it the ipad mini feel like it's

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.360 
makes it the ipad mini feel like it's
meant<00:06:18.599> to<00:06:18.719> be<00:06:18.750> stood<00:06:19.050> up<00:06:19.110> and<00:06:19.440> not<00:06:20.009> meant<00:06:20.219> to<00:06:20.340> be

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
meant to be stood up and not meant to be

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.219 
meant to be stood up and not meant to be
kind<00:06:20.789> of<00:06:20.909> forced<00:06:21.300> into<00:06:21.539> that<00:06:21.659> position<00:06:21.840> like

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
kind of forced into that position like

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.050 
kind of forced into that position like
other<00:06:22.379> companies<00:06:22.889> don't<00:06:23.520> really<00:06:23.819> give<00:06:24.029> you
