00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:55.420
 literally 5 minutes even in winter and 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:58.310
 cars warmly have heated seats 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.110
 single seat unfortunately 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:05.270

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.780
 price around 1000 rubles not more 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.630
 quite spacious interior 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.190
 Here I sit myself for an increase in places 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.800
 Meter eighty four me still 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.800
 plenty of room in front of your knees 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.220
 3 rear headrests that you need 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.810
 lift if someone sits behind 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.810

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.830

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.830
 still in the rear doors have tweeters 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:19.560
 the trunk sang enough for such 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.560
 small car 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:30.040
 I additionally set the color 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.110
 original rear bumper trim 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.110
 something messed up scratching it 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.610
 let's talk a little more about 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:12.849
 tom what exactly needs to be turned 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.630
 attention when buying a car suzuki 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.699
 sx4 exactly dorestaylingovoy version 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.820
 In general, he has two major sores 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:25.870
 steering rack and catalyst why 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:30.150
 steering rack in the joints 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.650
 from the steering rack are bushes 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.039
 these ordinary sleeves are made of metal 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.100
 This car is not plastic and 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:43.000
 about 30-35 thousand mileage these sleeves 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.570
 burst and you get a replacement 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.570
 steering rack 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.889
 why problems with catalyst that is 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.900
 recommended gasoline which can 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.120
 inject in car 95 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.659
 many people in order to save start 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:12.669
 cast 92 and also the catalyst crashes 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:14.770
 about 30-40 thousand well, as a rule she 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.590
 such runs the car is not yet 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:21.900
 the warranty ends and the data is not 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.900
 shawls eliminate on the service for free 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.370
 restyled version 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:32.849
 already change the steering rack and such 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:34.300
 there is no problem sometimes it is blunting 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.759
 keyless access 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.860
 that is, in this car is not worth 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.020
 start-stop system well, that is, not a button 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:46.180
 such a twist 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:49.779
 and very often when you sit down and 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.669
 trying to start a car on 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:53.590
 the red key lights up 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.689
 it means that the car is not 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.060
 sees the key well have to get out 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:00.039
 pocket and bring here somewhere 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.870
 the sensor is somewhere here that is to 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.520
 this place is all then the car 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:08.680
 Starts if you suddenly sat down 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.930
 battery then you can just pull out 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:15.789
 mechanical key that is keychain 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.409
 such a key chain he has here and if you 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:20.520
 press 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.520
 lips a little uncomfortable 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.610
 that 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:28.860
 if you move this catch you can 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:32.219
 will stand a mechanical key insert 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.749
 him here and here and start the car then 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:35.749
 have got used to it 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.970
 In general, the whole car is enough 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:47.220
 reliable spacious economical at me 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:51.510
 with active driving in the city consumption in 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:55.920
 area 9 and 7 on the highway somewhere 70 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:58.020
 half 8 respectively if there is and 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:04.200
 calmer slower the outcome will be 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:09.000
 less cost parts and consumables 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:14.640
 also quite acceptable at toyota 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.910
 corolla claimed car clearance 175 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.220
 cm 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:23.340
 millimeters to very generally in general 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.430
 I am pleased with the car good Peter 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:29.400
 said reliable quality 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:31.770
