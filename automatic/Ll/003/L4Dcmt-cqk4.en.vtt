00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.980 
billion 20 billion armature and you see
my<00:04:58.890> stamina<00:04:59.460> increase<00:04:59.940> right<00:05:00.180> there<00:05:00.390> to<00:05:00.960> the

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
my stamina increase right there to the

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.630

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
max so guys that's about it I'm guessing

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.550 
max so guys that's about it I'm guessing
that<00:05:05.790> this<00:05:05.940> is<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.360> higher<00:05:06.600> percentage<00:05:06.810> it<00:05:07.260> that

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
that this is a higher percentage it that

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.320 
that this is a higher percentage it that
we<00:05:07.800> that<00:05:08.100> no<00:05:08.250> one<00:05:08.370> will<00:05:08.460> be<00:05:08.610> then<00:05:08.820> for<00:05:09.210> it

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
we that no one will be then for it

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.110 
we that no one will be then for it
because<00:05:09.960> it<00:05:10.200> is<00:05:10.440> single<00:05:10.890> player<00:05:11.070> and<00:05:11.370> now<00:05:11.460> they

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
because it is single player and now they

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.290 
because it is single player and now they
can't<00:05:12.360> really<00:05:12.990> monitor<00:05:13.470> your<00:05:13.650> single<00:05:14.010> player

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
can't really monitor your single player
