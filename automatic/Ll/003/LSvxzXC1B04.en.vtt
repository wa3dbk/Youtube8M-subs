four lights here which control different
kinds<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.930> lighting<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.160> moment<00:01:08.280> I

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
kinds of lighting but if the moment I

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
kinds of lighting but if the moment I
only<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.540> programmed<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.410> it's<00:01:10.620> easy

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
only have this programmed and it's easy

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.190 
only have this programmed and it's easy
to<00:01:10.980> change<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:12.150> those<00:01:12.510> are<00:01:12.630> also<00:01:12.750> hooked<00:01:13.080> up

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
to change but those are also hooked up

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.500 
to change but those are also hooked up
to<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.410> up<00:01:13.530> these<00:01:14.180> you've<00:01:15.180> got<00:01:15.360> your

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
to the up these you've got your

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.620 
to the up these you've got your
carburetor<00:01:16.110> heat<00:01:16.410> here<00:01:16.740> pull<00:01:17.400> out<00:01:18.170> back<00:01:19.170> in

you've<00:01:21.630> also<00:01:21.870> have<00:01:22.230> your<00:01:22.470> wing<00:01:22.920> flaps<00:01:23.280> here

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
you've also have your wing flaps here

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.480 
you've also have your wing flaps here
hard<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.450> see<00:01:24.660> but<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:25.979> full<00:01:26.220> range

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
hard to see but you have your full range

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.990 
hard to see but you have your full range
of<00:01:26.640> 40<00:01:26.940> degrees<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.390> choose<00:01:27.630> from<00:01:28.550> up<00:01:29.550> here

of 40 degrees to choose from up here

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.920 
of 40 degrees to choose from up here
you've<00:01:30.210> got<00:01:30.240> your<00:01:30.720> your<00:01:31.729> radio<00:01:32.729> controls

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
you've got your your radio controls

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.560 
you've got your your radio controls
basically<00:01:33.930> there's<00:01:34.170> your<00:01:34.320> column<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:35.220> select

course is the most important to me is a

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.220 
course is the most important to me is a
trim<00:02:01.580> wheel<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:02.960> that<00:02:03.960> also<00:02:04.460> changes

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
trim wheel and that also changes

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.780 
trim wheel and that also changes
you<00:02:06.440> can't<00:02:06.680> really<00:02:06.920> see<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.130> well<00:02:07.400> in<00:02:07.580> there

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
you can't really see it well in there

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.320 
you can't really see it well in there
but<00:02:08.000> it's<00:02:08.120> actually<00:02:08.270> changing<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:10.330> has
