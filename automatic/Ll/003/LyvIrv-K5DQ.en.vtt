the<00:01:43.939> next<00:01:44.180> thing<00:01:44.329> is<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.600> think<00:01:44.630> about<00:01:45.079> what

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
the next thing is to think about what

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.499 
the next thing is to think about what
your<00:01:45.590> opponent's<00:01:46.189> immediate<00:01:46.759> threats<00:01:47.119> are<00:01:47.299> so

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
your opponent's immediate threats are so

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.090 
your opponent's immediate threats are so
many<00:01:47.689> times<00:01:47.899> we<00:01:48.140> have<00:01:48.259> a<00:01:48.320> specific<00:01:48.590> plan<00:01:49.070> that

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
many times we have a specific plan that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.160 
many times we have a specific plan that
we're<00:01:49.369> trying<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:50.030> enforce<00:01:50.450> on<00:01:50.630> our<00:01:50.750> opponent

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
we're trying to enforce on our opponent

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.020 
we're trying to enforce on our opponent
and<00:01:51.590> if<00:01:51.680> we<00:01:51.799> don't<00:01:51.920> just<00:01:52.130> look<00:01:52.310> at<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.520> just

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
and if we don't just look at the just

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.760 
and if we don't just look at the just
the<00:01:53.149> immediate<00:01:53.509> now<00:01:53.960> don't<00:01:54.289> even<00:01:54.530> try<00:01:54.740> to

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
the immediate now don't even try to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.670 
the immediate now don't even try to
sometimes<00:01:55.490> get<00:01:56.000> too<00:01:56.240> deep<00:01:56.570> as<00:01:56.810> far<00:01:57.020> as<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.200> three

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
sometimes get too deep as far as a three

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.889 
sometimes get too deep as far as a three
or<00:01:57.799> four<00:01:58.039> or<00:01:58.159> five<00:01:58.369> move<00:01:58.789> that<00:01:59.119> they've<00:01:59.270> you

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
or four or five move that they've you

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.099 
or four or five move that they've you
know<00:01:59.930> studied<00:02:00.680> for<00:02:01.009> for<00:02:01.430> years<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.000> years<00:02:02.240> but

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
know studied for for years and years but

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:04.719 
know studied for for years and years but
just<00:02:03.350> think<00:02:03.530> about<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.859> immediate<00:02:04.189> threats

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
just think about the immediate threats

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.670 
just think about the immediate threats
do<00:02:05.000> they<00:02:05.149> have<00:02:05.390> an<00:02:05.509> immediate<00:02:05.750> checkmate<00:02:06.530> do

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
do they have an immediate checkmate do

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.740 
do they have an immediate checkmate do
they<00:02:06.799> have<00:02:07.039> an<00:02:07.159> immediate<00:02:07.369> Fork<00:02:08.060> do<00:02:08.330> they<00:02:08.479> have

they have an immediate Fork do they have

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.550 
they have an immediate Fork do they have
an<00:02:09.050> immediate<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:11.750> know<00:02:11.840> attack<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.470> they

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
an immediate you know attack that they

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.229 
an immediate you know attack that they
have<00:02:12.769> on<00:02:12.980> your<00:02:13.160> queen<00:02:13.489> that<00:02:13.790> they<00:02:13.879> could<00:02:14.030> pin

looking at the emedia

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.770

threats also be looking for different

have you know upon the structure that is

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.360 
have you know upon the structure that is
not<00:02:29.120> safe<00:02:29.510> does<00:02:30.019> your<00:02:30.170> opponent<00:02:30.260> have<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:31.069> weak

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
kingside safety this you have you know

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.520 
kingside safety this you have you know
an<00:02:34.790> outpost<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:35.750> can<00:02:35.959> really<00:02:36.170> take<00:02:36.470> a

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
an outpost that you can really take a

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.229 
an outpost that you can really take a
part<00:02:36.830> of<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.640> last<00:02:37.819> thing<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.060> want<00:02:38.209> to

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
part of and the last thing you want to

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.259 
part of and the last thing you want to
think<00:02:38.300> about<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:39.190> right<00:02:40.190> before<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.790> move<00:02:41.000> so

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
think about is right before you move so

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.790 
think about is right before you move so
many<00:02:41.450> times<00:02:41.660> people<00:02:42.080> look<00:02:42.319> at<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.560> variation

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
many times people look at a variation

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.920 
many times people look at a variation
and<00:02:43.370> they'll<00:02:43.519> think<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.390> know<00:02:44.510> three<00:02:44.810> or

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
and they'll think of you know three or

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.750 
and they'll think of you know three or
four<00:02:45.080> different<00:02:45.470> moves<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.310> then<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.580> end

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
four different moves and then the end

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.190 
four different moves and then the end
they'll<00:02:47.120> just<00:02:47.269> kind<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.540> tell<00:02:47.660> themselves<00:02:48.110> you

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
they'll just kind of tell themselves you

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.170 
they'll just kind of tell themselves you
know<00:02:48.319> what<00:02:48.530> none<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.459> those<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.849> they'll<00:02:50.030> just

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
know what none of those and they'll just

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.300 
know what none of those and they'll just
kind<00:02:50.299> of<00:02:50.450> sporadically<00:02:50.959> just<00:02:51.769> make<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.010> move

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
kind of sporadically just make a move

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.490 
kind of sporadically just make a move
without<00:02:53.239> really<00:02:53.599> thinking<00:02:53.690> about<00:02:54.110> that's

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
without really thinking about that's

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.620 
without really thinking about that's
probably<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.890> worst<00:02:55.130> thing<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.610> can<00:02:55.790> do<00:02:56.000> any

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
probably the worst thing you can do any

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.600 
probably the worst thing you can do any
time<00:02:56.989> right<00:02:57.349> before<00:02:57.560> you're<00:02:57.980> going<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:58.430> make<00:02:58.579> a

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
time right before you're going to make a

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.000 
time right before you're going to make a
chess<00:02:58.970> move<00:02:59.299> think<00:03:00.110> about<00:03:00.349> that<00:03:00.530> move<00:03:00.769> for

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
chess move think about that move for

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.150 
chess move think about that move for
just<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.340> second<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:01.819> then<00:03:01.910> see<00:03:02.420> is<00:03:03.099> this<00:03:04.099> a

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
just a second and then see is this a

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.880 
just a second and then see is this a
blunder<00:03:04.760> because<00:03:05.120> most<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.140> times<00:03:06.410> if<00:03:06.739> you

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
blunder because most of the times if you

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.860 
blunder because most of the times if you
lose<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.220> chess<00:03:07.640> game<00:03:07.880> you're<00:03:08.599> they're<00:03:08.750> going

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
lose a chess game you're they're going

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.479 
lose a chess game you're they're going
to<00:03:08.930> lose<00:03:09.049> for<00:03:09.319> one<00:03:09.470> or<00:03:09.590> two<00:03:09.620> reasons<00:03:09.739> one<00:03:10.459> you

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
to lose for one or two reasons one you

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.640 
to lose for one or two reasons one you
just<00:03:10.849> play<00:03:11.090> someone<00:03:11.720> who<00:03:11.870> is<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:11.989> lot<00:03:12.230> better<00:03:12.440> as

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
just play someone who is a lot better as

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.960 
just play someone who is a lot better as
far<00:03:12.860> as<00:03:12.950> their<00:03:13.099> tactical<00:03:13.519> mind<00:03:13.730> they<00:03:13.910> can

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
far as their tactical mind they can

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.030 
far as their tactical mind they can
think<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.360> lot<00:03:14.510> deeper<00:03:14.780> than<00:03:15.049> you<00:03:15.170> can<00:03:15.410> their

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
think a lot deeper than you can their

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.650 
think a lot deeper than you can their
strategy<00:03:16.700> was<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.880> little<00:03:17.120> bit<00:03:17.209> deeper<00:03:17.510> you're

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
strategy was a little bit deeper you're

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.870 
strategy was a little bit deeper you're
just<00:03:17.840> not<00:03:18.049> going<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.290> beat<00:03:18.470> them<00:03:18.620> anyway<00:03:18.980> or<00:03:19.220> -

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
just not going to beat them anyway or -

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.150 
just not going to beat them anyway or -
it's<00:03:20.569> because<00:03:21.019> you<00:03:21.049> just<00:03:21.380> played<00:03:21.620> someone<00:03:21.950> and

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
if I have an immediate attack I'll do

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.970 
if I have an immediate attack I'll do
that<00:04:11.540> I'm<00:04:11.750> not<00:04:11.930> really<00:04:12.109> thinking<00:04:12.560> about<00:04:12.650> what

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
that I'm not really thinking about what

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.280 
that I'm not really thinking about what
my<00:04:13.130> opponent's<00:04:13.639> doing<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.180> I<00:04:14.630> sure<00:04:14.959> as<00:04:15.079> heck

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
my opponent's doing and I sure as heck

my opponent's doing and I sure as heck
and<00:04:15.560> not<00:04:15.889> thinking<00:04:16.250> about<00:04:16.400> what<00:04:16.729> his<00:04:16.910> plan<00:04:17.329> is

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
and not thinking about what his plan is

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.180 
and not thinking about what his plan is
for<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.019> game<00:04:18.169> so<00:04:18.440> really<00:04:18.680> start<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:19.010> think

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
for the game so really start to think

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.979 
for the game so really start to think
about<00:04:19.370> all<00:04:19.519> these<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:20.150> more<00:04:20.329> you<00:04:20.510> do<00:04:20.690> the

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
about all these the more you do the

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.990 
about all these the more you do the
better<00:04:21.019> it'll<00:04:21.410> come<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:22.250> faster<00:04:22.700> you'll<00:04:22.849> be

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
better it'll come the faster you'll be

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.250 
better it'll come the faster you'll be
thinking<00:04:23.180> on<00:04:23.510> your<00:04:23.630> feet<00:04:23.690> and<00:04:23.930> you<00:04:24.020> won't<00:04:24.169> have

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
thinking on your feet and you won't have

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.480 
thinking on your feet and you won't have
to<00:04:24.380> think<00:04:24.590> too<00:04:24.710> long<00:04:24.860> about<00:04:25.070> it<00:04:25.190> but

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
to think too long about it but

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.070 
to think too long about it but
definitely<00:04:25.940> start<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.240> incorporate<00:04:26.599> this

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
definitely start to incorporate this

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.250 
definitely start to incorporate this
into<00:04:27.409> your<00:04:27.680> own<00:04:27.740> chess<00:04:28.010> game
