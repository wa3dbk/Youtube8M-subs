00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
you're swiping through threads it'll

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.910 
you're swiping through threads it'll
just<00:01:02.550> wrap<00:01:03.300> around<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.530> very<00:01:04.799> first

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
just wrap around to the very first

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.260 
just wrap around to the very first
thread<00:01:05.460> when<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> end<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.240> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
thread when you get to the end if you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.850 
thread when you get to the end if you
turn<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.600> off<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.900> will<00:01:07.200> just<00:01:07.350> stop<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
turn that off it will just stop and

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.920 
turn that off it will just stop and
you'll<00:01:07.950> have<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.100> go<00:01:08.189> back<00:01:08.310> again<00:01:09.090> feature<00:01:09.750> you

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
you'll have to go back again feature you

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.980 
you'll have to go back again feature you
probably<00:01:10.260> won't<00:01:10.470> turn<00:01:10.619> off<00:01:10.820> swipes<00:01:11.820> from<00:01:12.330> you

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
probably won't turn off swipes from you

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.679 
probably won't turn off swipes from you
can<00:01:13.110> change<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.530> from<00:01:13.799> edges<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.490> Center<00:01:15.119> you

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
can change that from edges to Center you

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.520 
can change that from edges to Center you
can<00:01:15.720> also<00:01:16.020> adjust<00:01:16.560> how<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.020> edge<00:01:19.200> is

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
can also adjust how are in the edge is

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.320 
can also adjust how are in the edge is
so<00:01:19.740> if<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.159> all<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.400> way<00:01:20.549> it'll

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
so if you do this all the way it'll

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.789 
so if you do this all the way it'll
actually<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.810> swiping<00:01:22.200> will<00:01:22.320> work<00:01:22.470> from<00:01:22.619> in

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
actually the swiping will work from in

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.039 
actually the swiping will work from in
the<00:01:22.920> center<00:01:23.189> if<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.180> further<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the center if you do it further to the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.660 
the center if you do it further to the
edge<00:01:25.170> you'll<00:01:25.380> have<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.770> pretty<00:01:26.460> close

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
edge you'll have to do it pretty close

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.859 
edge you'll have to do it pretty close
to<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> edge<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.360> I'm<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.540> going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
to the edge so I'm just going to do it

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.840 
to the edge so I'm just going to do it
on<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.990> way<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.320> then<00:01:29.250> when<00:01:29.490> you're<00:01:29.549> happy

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
on the way and then when you're happy

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.210 
on the way and then when you're happy
with<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.119> once<00:01:30.930> you're<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.710> messaging

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
with that once you're in the messaging

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.050 
with that once you're in the messaging
app<00:01:32.369> if<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.790> swipe<00:01:33.119> you'll<00:01:34.079> see<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.820> preview<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
app if you swipe you'll see a preview of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.060 
app if you swipe you'll see a preview of
the<00:01:36.960> message<00:01:37.290> that's<00:01:37.439> next<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.950> other

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the message that's next to it the other

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.980 
the message that's next to it the other
thread<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> last<00:01:39.299> message<00:01:39.600> you
