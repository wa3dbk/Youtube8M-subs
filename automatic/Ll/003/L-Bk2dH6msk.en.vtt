00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
in the game no 20 episodes in I could

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.169 
in the game no 20 episodes in I could
literally<00:00:51.600> write<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.289> stock<00:00:52.829> build<00:00:53.309> script<00:00:53.909> for

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179 
literally write a stock build script for

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.849 
literally write a stock build script for
weird<00:00:54.359> trip<00:00:54.600> because<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.989> feel<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.559> say<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
weird trip because I feel like I say the

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.979 
weird trip because I feel like I say the
exact<00:00:56.129> same<00:00:56.159> thing<00:00:56.579> every<00:00:56.820> time<00:00:56.960> lack<00:00:57.960> of

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
exact same thing every time lack of

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.680 
exact same thing every time lack of
power<00:00:58.319> /<00:00:58.710> torque<00:00:59.069> in<00:00:59.640> for<00:00:59.909> two<00:01:00.089> terms<00:01:00.239> at<00:01:00.510> least

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
power / torque in for two terms at least

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.360 
power / torque in for two terms at least
obviously<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.890> real<00:01:02.069> life<00:01:02.129> I'm

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
obviously it's like in real life I'm

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.770 
obviously it's like in real life I'm
sure<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.640> would<00:01:02.699> slide<00:01:02.909> fine<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.449> Forza

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
sure it would slide fine but in Forza

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.999 
sure it would slide fine but in Forza
times<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.470> doesn't<00:01:04.649> have<00:01:04.829> enough

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
times it just it doesn't have enough

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.770 
times it just it doesn't have enough
power<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.369> torque<00:01:05.519> third<00:01:06.240> gear<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.509> not<00:01:06.630> an

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
power and torque third gear is not an

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.870 
power and torque third gear is not an
option<00:01:07.049> as<00:01:07.200> per<00:01:07.350> usual<00:01:07.530> at<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:07.920> stage<00:01:08.100> with

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
option as per usual at this stage with

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.039 
option as per usual at this stage with
this<00:01:09.000> current<00:01:09.180> particular<00:01:09.600> though<00:01:09.750> there<00:01:09.930> was

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
this current particular though there was

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.600 
this current particular though there was
a<00:01:10.079> surprise<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.649> the<00:01:10.740> metal<00:01:11.009> body<00:01:11.159> roll<00:01:11.399> I

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
a surprise in the metal body roll I

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.850 
a surprise in the metal body roll I
thought<00:01:11.790> being<00:01:12.149> like<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.659> kind<00:01:12.899> of<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.680> it's

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
thought being like it kind of like it's

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.980 
thought being like it kind of like it's
kind<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.549> known<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:14.759> being<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.210> rally<00:01:15.390> car<00:01:15.509> so

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
kind of known for being a rally car so

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.330 
kind of known for being a rally car so
that's<00:01:16.140> how<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> would<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.590> been<00:01:16.649> like<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.159> lot

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that's how it would have been like a lot

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.499 
that's how it would have been like a lot
stiffer<00:01:17.579> than<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.880> was<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.149> I<00:01:18.210> had<00:01:18.329> a<00:01:18.360> lot

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
stiffer than it was but I had a lot

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.209 
stiffer than it was but I had a lot
about<00:01:18.600> your<00:01:18.810> old<00:01:18.960> buddy<00:01:19.469> rolls<00:01:19.680> right<00:01:19.829> and

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
about your old buddy rolls right and

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.690 
about your old buddy rolls right and
just<00:01:20.969> be<00:01:21.060> honest<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.479> over<00:01:21.869> over<00:01:22.140> all<00:01:22.350> those

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
just be honest like over over all those

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.889 
just be honest like over over all those
genuinely<00:01:23.700> disappointed<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.390> was<00:01:24.479> expecting<00:01:24.750> a

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
genuinely disappointed I was expecting a

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.109 
genuinely disappointed I was expecting a
lot<00:01:25.020> more<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.530> thing<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.969> did

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
lot more of this thing and it just did

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.149 
lot more of this thing and it just did
for<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:27.930> main<00:01:28.170> notes<00:01:28.439> where<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.799> needs<00:01:28.979> more

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
for what main notes where it needs more

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.459 
for what main notes where it needs more
power<00:01:29.399> and<00:01:29.729> more<00:01:29.820> stiffening<00:01:30.810> basically<00:01:31.289> so

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
power and more stiffening basically so

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:32.959 
power and more stiffening basically so
we'll<00:01:32.009> see<00:01:32.189> how<00:01:32.219> it<00:01:32.369> goes<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.729> medium

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
we'll see how it goes in the medium

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.660 
we'll see how it goes in the medium
build<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.590> how<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.740> looks<00:01:34.829> ever<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
build and this is how it looks ever the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.649 
build and this is how it looks ever the
wheels<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.090> stuff<00:01:36.240> there<00:01:36.479> were<00:01:36.570> an

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
wheels and stuff there were an

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.020 
wheels and stuff there were an
interesting<00:01:37.049> choice<00:01:37.170> oh<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> know<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.520> stuck

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
interesting choice oh I know but I stuck

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.480 
interesting choice oh I know but I stuck
with<00:01:39.210> them<00:01:39.299> ed<00:01:39.869> medium<00:01:40.200> build<00:01:40.350> has<00:01:40.530> 269

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
with them ed medium build has 269

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.450 
with them ed medium build has 269
horsepower<00:01:42.200> 229<00:01:43.200> foot-pounds<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.740> torque<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
horsepower 229 foot-pounds of torque and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.719 
horsepower 229 foot-pounds of torque and
it<00:01:44.700> weighs<00:01:44.850> 2,000<00:01:45.740> 343<00:01:46.740> pounds<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.189> not<00:01:47.700> a

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
it weighs 2,000 343 pounds so not a

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.209 
it weighs 2,000 343 pounds so not a
massive<00:01:48.329> increase<00:01:48.479> by<00:01:48.840> any<00:01:49.020> means<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
massive increase by any means in the

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.849 
massive increase by any means in the
torque<00:01:50.460> or<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.609> horsepower<00:01:51.200> but<00:01:52.200> at<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
torque or a horsepower but at the

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.260 
torque or a horsepower but at the
weights<00:01:53.039> gone<00:01:53.219> down<00:01:53.369> quite<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.640> good<00:01:53.880> bit<00:01:54.060> there

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
weights gone down quite a good bit there

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.719 
weights gone down quite a good bit there
so<00:01:54.509> sorry<00:01:55.439> but<00:01:55.560> our<00:01:55.710> folks<00:01:55.920> Vegas<00:01:56.460> crashed

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
so sorry but our folks Vegas crashed

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.179 
so sorry but our folks Vegas crashed
yeah<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.390> said<00:01:57.450> not<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.049> big<00:01:58.289> decrease<00:01:58.710> but

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
yeah so as I said not a big decrease but

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.010 
yeah so as I said not a big decrease but
the<00:01:59.549> mod<00:01:59.729> slow<00:02:00.000> put<00:02:00.179> in<00:02:00.299> here<00:02:00.509> for<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.750> medium

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the mod slow put in here for the medium

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.289 
the mod slow put in here for the medium
build<00:02:01.200> our<00:02:01.409> street<00:02:01.679> camshaft<00:02:02.189> ray<00:02:02.909> springs

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
build our street camshaft ray springs

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.899 
build our street camshaft ray springs
and<00:02:03.479> weight<00:02:03.630> reduction<00:02:04.109> all<00:02:04.409> drive<00:02:04.679> train<00:02:04.979> set

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
and weight reduction all drive train set

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.580 
and weight reduction all drive train set
to<00:02:06.030> race<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.539> I<00:02:06.689> put<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.109> clock

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
to race and I put on the clock

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.340 
to race and I put on the clock
compomotive<00:02:08.090> cxr<00:02:09.090> wheels<00:02:09.390> which<00:02:09.720> were<00:02:09.960> at<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
compomotive cxr wheels which were at the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.630 
compomotive cxr wheels which were at the
interesting<00:02:10.830> choice<00:02:11.010> that<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.280> think<00:02:11.460> of

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
interesting choice that I think of

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.660 
interesting choice that I think of
there<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:13.470> feels<00:02:13.740> much<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.100> same<00:02:14.370> as<00:02:14.550> the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
there and it feels much the same as the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
there and it feels much the same as the
soft<00:02:14.880> build<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.270> terms<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.600> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
soft build in terms of the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.180 
soft build in terms of the
characteristics<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.590> care<00:02:16.800> but<00:02:17.160> like

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
characteristics of the care but like

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.620 
characteristics of the care but like
naturally<00:02:17.790> Nair<00:02:18.000> with<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.270> slight

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
naturally Nair with the slight

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.720 
naturally Nair with the slight
improvements<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.350> feels<00:02:19.590> faster<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.370> stiffer

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
improvements it feels faster and stiffer

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.880 
improvements it feels faster and stiffer
which<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.090> obviously<00:02:21.480> what<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.690> want<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.319> but

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
which is obviously what you want and but

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.530 
which is obviously what you want and but
it's<00:02:23.010> still<00:02:23.190> not<00:02:23.370> slow<00:02:23.700> or<00:02:23.910> sorry<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:24.330> still

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
it's still not slow or sorry it's still

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.270 
it's still not slow or sorry it's still
slow<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.080> it's<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.500> it's<00:02:25.680> just<00:02:25.830> not<00:02:26.010> very

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
slow and it's like it's just not very

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.910 
slow and it's like it's just not very
enjoyable<00:02:26.700> it's<00:02:27.690> very<00:02:27.870> bland<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.620> doesn't

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
enjoyable it's very bland it doesn't

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.280 
enjoyable it's very bland it doesn't
stand<00:02:29.100> out<00:02:29.250> at<00:02:29.490> all<00:02:29.700> like<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.150> doesn't<00:02:30.420> jump<00:02:31.110> a

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
stand out at all like it doesn't jump a

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.140 
stand out at all like it doesn't jump a
note<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.620> particularly<00:02:32.100> grabs<00:02:32.490> me<00:02:32.760> about<00:02:32.970> it

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
note and particularly grabs me about it

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.310 
note and particularly grabs me about it
it's<00:02:33.240> not<00:02:33.360> particularly<00:02:33.630> fast<00:02:33.900> it's<00:02:34.230> not

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
it's not particularly fast it's not

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.480 
it's not particularly fast it's not
particularly<00:02:34.620> nimble<00:02:35.160> that's<00:02:35.340> not

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
particularly nimble that's not

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.140 
particularly nimble that's not
particularly<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:38.430> just<00:02:38.489> impressive<00:02:39.090> in

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
particularly and it just impressive in

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.180 
particularly and it just impressive in
any<00:02:39.270> way<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.810> assumed<00:02:40.230> like<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.680> would<00:02:41.100> have

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
any way like I assumed like I would have

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.740 
any way like I assumed like I would have
assumed<00:02:41.400> at<00:02:41.580> this<00:02:41.700> stage<00:02:41.880> at<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.209> full<00:02:42.480> build

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
assumed at this stage at the full build

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.890 
assumed at this stage at the full build
would<00:02:42.959> have<00:02:43.080> gotten<00:02:43.319> better<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:44.750> like<00:02:45.750> would

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
would have gotten better and like would

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.240 
would have gotten better and like would
have<00:02:45.989> been<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.110> big<00:02:46.290> improvement<00:02:46.410> done<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.040> boot

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
have been a big improvement done it boot

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.180 
have been a big improvement done it boot
that's<00:02:48.060> like<00:02:48.360> obviously<00:02:48.810> that's<00:02:48.989> tip<00:02:49.680> combo

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that's like obviously that's tip combo

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.490 
that's like obviously that's tip combo
yeah<00:02:51.060> just<00:02:51.269> shocked<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.810> he'll<00:02:52.170> kind<00:02:52.410> of

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
yeah just shocked that he'll kind of

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.050 
yeah just shocked that he'll kind of
planned<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:52.980> born<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.340> was<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.580> really<00:02:53.910> like

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
planned and born it was I really like

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.790 
planned and born it was I really like
known<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.810> cars<00:02:55.050> kind<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.320> heritage<00:02:55.590> stuff

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
known this cars kind of heritage stuff

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.500 
known this cars kind of heritage stuff
like<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:55.980> as<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.610> rally<00:02:56.910> Keef<00:02:57.150> as<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.360> famous

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
like that as a rally Keef as a famous

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.360 
like that as a rally Keef as a famous
ready<00:02:57.780> Caryn<00:02:58.050> stuff<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.410> really<00:02:58.800> expected<00:02:58.950> more

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
ready Caryn stuff I really expected more

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.310 
ready Caryn stuff I really expected more
about<00:02:59.580> even<00:03:00.330> at<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.480> medium<00:03:00.780> build<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.170> was

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
about even at the medium build it was

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.740 
about even at the medium build it was
still<00:03:01.530> not<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.860> impressive<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.760> kept<00:03:03.600> it

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
still not that impressive so I kept it

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.810 
still not that impressive so I kept it
the<00:03:03.870> same<00:03:03.900> kind<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.530> red<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:05.070> actually<00:03:05.459> made<00:03:05.730> it

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
the same kind of red I actually made it

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.190 
the same kind of red I actually made it
metallic<00:03:06.090> though<00:03:06.330> dunno<00:03:06.540> if<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.720> notice<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.110> my

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
pounds I have to say mmm it was good it

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.330 
pounds I have to say mmm it was good it
was<00:03:24.870> obviously<00:03:25.140> better<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.769> was<00:03:25.950> drift

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
was obviously better and it was drift

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.880 
was obviously better and it was drift
above<00:03:26.610> but<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:26.940> was<00:03:27.090> just<00:03:27.120> not<00:03:27.780> fun<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.560> was<00:03:28.680> not

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
above but it was just not fun it was not

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.430 
above but it was just not fun it was not
an<00:03:29.010> enjoyable<00:03:29.250> experience<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:30.269> mean<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:31.290> was

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
an enjoyable experience I mean it was

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.020 
an enjoyable experience I mean it was
stiffer<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.280> was<00:03:32.400> faster<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.000> a

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
stiffer and it was faster and a

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.699 
stiffer and it was faster and a
sensation<00:03:33.510> speed<00:03:33.810> was<00:03:34.019> obviously<00:03:34.350> they're

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
sensation speed was obviously they're

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.410 
sensation speed was obviously they're
like<00:03:35.040> more<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:35.610> than<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.940> was<00:03:36.060> in<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.299> other

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420

like more so than it was in the other
like<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:36.989> other<00:03:37.019> sections<00:03:37.470> naturally<00:03:38.040> but

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
like in the other sections naturally but

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.330 
like in the other sections naturally but
like<00:03:38.910> nothing<00:03:39.840> against<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.799> same<00:03:41.010> thing<00:03:41.220> is

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
like nothing against the same thing is

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.949 
like nothing against the same thing is
the<00:03:41.430> median<00:03:41.790> bill<00:03:42.000> like<00:03:42.180> nothing<00:03:42.660> stood<00:03:42.900> out

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
the median bill like nothing stood out

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.569

sofa got it sounds kind of cool but as
far<00:03:53.459> as<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.670> actual<00:03:53.790> driving<00:03:54.180> experience<00:03:54.660> of

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
far as the actual driving experience of

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.360 
far as the actual driving experience of
it<00:03:54.840> goes<00:03:54.989> there's<00:03:55.290> nothing<00:03:55.709> that<00:03:55.860> stands<00:03:56.130> out

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
it goes there's nothing that stands out

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
not fun so my answer to this question

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.850 
not fun so my answer to this question
will<00:04:28.230> it<00:04:28.350> drift<00:04:29.600> perhaps<00:04:30.600> I'm<00:04:31.440> not<00:04:31.500> going<00:04:31.800> to

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
will it drift perhaps I'm not going to

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.320 
will it drift perhaps I'm not going to
say<00:04:31.980> no<00:04:32.010> I'm<00:04:32.310> not<00:04:32.490> gonna<00:04:32.640> say<00:04:32.790> yes<00:04:32.940> I<00:04:33.150> would

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.230 
say no I'm not gonna say yes I would
personally<00:04:33.540> say<00:04:34.020> yes<00:04:35.010> it<00:04:35.190> would<00:04:35.400> drift<00:04:35.670> but<00:04:36.030> no

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240

personally say yes it would drift but no
you<00:04:36.300> wouldn't<00:04:36.840> want<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.200> so<00:04:37.410> I'm<00:04:37.500> gonna<00:04:37.650> say
