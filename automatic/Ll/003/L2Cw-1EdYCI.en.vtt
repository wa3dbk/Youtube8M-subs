a<00:02:34.489> half<00:02:34.519> minutes<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:35.150> cook<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:35.720> hasn't<00:02:35.959> been

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
a half minutes to cook this hasn't been

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.350 
a half minutes to cook this hasn't been
dried<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:36.830> it's<00:02:36.980> cooked<00:02:37.220> from<00:02:37.370> fresh<00:02:37.640> mm-hmm
