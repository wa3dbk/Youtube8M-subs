00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
purchase the switch program they gave me

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.770 
purchase the switch program they gave me
a<00:04:42.280> free<00:04:42.460> trial<00:04:42.760> worked<00:04:43.030> great<00:04:43.240> for<00:04:43.270> me<00:04:43.600> so<00:04:43.750> I

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
a free trial worked great for me so I

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.650 
a free trial worked great for me so I
spent<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.139> 30<00:04:44.410> bucks<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.770> do<00:04:44.979> it<00:04:45.540> no<00:04:46.540> matter
