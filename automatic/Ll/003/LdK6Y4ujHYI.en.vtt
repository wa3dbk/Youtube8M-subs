00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.459
 Racing fans have been waiting for almost one 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.930
 Yearning for drive works out because 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:14.420
 the sony racer actually would have 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.640
 on time for the launch of the ps4 on the 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.990
 market should come 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.789
 unfortunately nothing came of it 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.039
 evolution studios still needed 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.449
 additional time around the planned 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.650
 multiplayer features into the game 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.160
 install 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.840
 on 8 october 2014 is ripe now works 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.000
 finally released and takes care of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.120
 Since then, for well-kept chaos within 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.920
 the global network community finally 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.350
 The game is primarily based on online 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.449
 Gameplay, however, due to technical 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.460
 problems currently only severely limited 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.199
 is possible 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.330
 since the release of the game is the 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.760
 drive club server constantly overloaded 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.680
 why evolution studios many of the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.059
 multiplayer features completely except 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.160
 had to work 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.100
 at least the accessibility of 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.290
 ensure servers without contact 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.280
 drive club is central to the race 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.500
 completely cropped 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.290
 because here in this case, only the one 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.479
 additional events attract visitors 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.250
 these are 50 events 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.100
 who run out of normal round course 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.710
 stage racing drift events and time 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.750
 trial events exist 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.369
 The number of events but should according to the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.650
 evolution studios in the course of the next 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.189
 half a year through monthly deals 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.689
 meant to be increased if the drive 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.700
 fails server is unreachable 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.380
 affect your earned 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.110
 points of experience only on the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.070
 personal driver level out unfortunately 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.140
 become the data 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.820
 if you have already established a club 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.130
 or member in a carpool 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.250
 time not in the offline mode 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.890
 the same applies to the past 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.080
 achieved club level because without the drive 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.350
 club server you will automatically as 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.840
 Solofahrer classifies therefore escapes 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.360
 offline players have access to five 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.170
 For example, the vw 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.200
 golf 7 gti the bentley continental gt v8 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.580
 or the bmw m3 gts exclusively by 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.039
 the leveling of the club level 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.599
 be unlocked 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.700
 after all, the remaining 45 cars 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.069
 easily playable in solo mode 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.170
 the main focus of drive also works 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.670
 is indeed on the multiplayer mode of 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.590
 but ten days after that 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.019
 Appearance date of the game still 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.670
 you should not work properly 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.250
 it will create one of the strictest 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.810
 Two are likely to kick with up to 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.290
 Eleven other players to the bet 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.450
 drive 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.510
 these online races are fun 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.750
 but due to the gameplay are evil 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.300
 Reminders on the agenda 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.620
 currently the evolution studios are trying 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.700
 at least the normal online races 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.950
 to make available 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.630
 but during the test phase we had to 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.310
 us with hundreds of game crashes 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.670
 what to fight for of course 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.350
 scary frustration unfortunately it is 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.970
 due to the prevailing server issues 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.580
 currently not possible own 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.870
 challenge to create 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.120
 few days before the official 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.490
 we were allowed to show the game 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.400
 the pre launch server all 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.290
 try multiplayer function and 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.890
 the challenge element turned out 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.200
 being a real fun just rarely before 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.000
 pack us in a racing game like that 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.770
 one penetrated the best of the 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.960
 competition in land and soil too 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.520
 stamp 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.890
 the challenges consist of the 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.390
 task types 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.270
 average speed duel 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.650
 curve rides duel and hits duel 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.900
 the events are created on basis 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.580
 a previously driven events and 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.910
 are usually on a specific 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.440
 limited to around 300 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.940
 editors online have the 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.350
 challenge with your real time 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.660
 notifications still reasonably 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.550
 works as she after the 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.590
 release of the game thousands of 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.110
 Connect players to the web server 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.160
 wanted the whole system is easy 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.620
 collapsed 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.690
 just for the sake of a club or club 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.780
 the adaptation of the club can paint 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.260
 currently be accomplished 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.120
 Of course you can 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.830
 Meanwhile, enjoy the solo mode 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.840
 but because of the extremely simple 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.540
 presentation is quite fast the air 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.300
 out you are only allowed an event after 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.440
 deny the other one in the end 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.630
 experience points and cars to earn 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.670
 On the whole it was already 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.890
 painfully we miss about one 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.320
 tuning section or disconnectable 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.820
 help 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.830
 the buyers but in single player mode 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.990
 By the way, do not act squeamishly 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.240
 although the developers are too rabid 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.290
 driving with curves or collision 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.720
 acknowledge penalties 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.450
 this will be your top speed 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.740
 for a few seconds to 80 or 120 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.050
 km h limited we were able to observe 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.730
 must also punish the curves 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.790
 rob or cause of 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.620
 Billiards also sucks in the 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.880
 solo mode a noticeable 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.620
 elastic band effect 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.570
 at online event with 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.610
 Human opponents will face this problem 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.260
 Of course not on and the driver's field 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.190
 draws clearly in the course of the race 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.190
 visible apart
