00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
puzzle that Calvin puzzle has mass

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.780 
puzzle that Calvin puzzle has mass
produced<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.679> I'm<00:00:13.740> really<00:00:14.070> happy<00:00:14.309> about<00:00:14.460> this

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
produced and I'm really happy about this

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.939 
produced and I'm really happy about this
one<00:00:14.849> because<00:00:15.389> this<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.719> tri<00:00:16.109> pootle

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
one because this is a tri pootle

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.189 
one because this is a tri pootle
and<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.550> think<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.029> trifles<00:00:18.510> first<00:00:18.779> puzzle

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
and I think this is trifles first puzzle

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.320 
and I think this is trifles first puzzle
that<00:00:19.320> got<00:00:19.529> mass<00:00:19.830> produced<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.910> let's<00:00:21.090> go<00:00:21.210> ahead

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
that got mass produced so let's go ahead

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.170 
that got mass produced so let's go ahead
and<00:00:21.720> open<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.680> box<00:00:25.580> now<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.609> got<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
and open the box now I got the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.540 
and open the box now I got the
stickerless<00:00:27.630> version<00:00:28.140> because<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:29.039> stickers

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
stickerless version because the stickers

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.880 
stickerless version because the stickers
weren't<00:00:29.880> quite<00:00:30.090> made<00:00:30.539> when<00:00:31.199> he<00:00:31.380> sent<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.800> me

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
weren't quite made when he sent it to me

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.080 
weren't quite made when he sent it to me
otherwise<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.369> would<00:00:32.489> have<00:00:32.520> chosen<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.910> black

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
otherwise I would have chosen a black

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.940 
otherwise I would have chosen a black
one<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.809> he<00:00:34.020> wanted<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.290> send<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.620> me<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:34.890> I

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
one but he wanted to send it to me so I

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.870 
one but he wanted to send it to me so I
figured<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.399> would<00:00:35.640> get<00:00:35.760> these

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
figured that I would get these

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.959 
figured that I would get these
stickerless<00:00:36.420> one<00:00:36.950> okay<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.579> called<00:00:38.820> a

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
stickerless one okay so this is called a

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:39.560 
stickerless one okay so this is called a
dino

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
dino

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.440 
dino
morphix<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> shape<00:00:41.550> transformation

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
morphix this is a shape transformation

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.720 
morphix this is a shape transformation
from<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.200> dino<00:00:43.500> cube<00:00:43.920> now<00:00:44.309> try<00:00:44.520> bloom

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
from a dino cube now try bloom

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.100 
from a dino cube now try bloom
originally<00:00:45.329> did<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.629> I'll<00:00:45.840> show<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110

you<00:00:51.899> can<00:00:51.930> see<00:00:52.050> they're<00:00:52.350> exactly<00:00:52.829> identical

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
you can see they're exactly identical

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.520 
you can see they're exactly identical
and<00:00:53.640> trifle<00:00:54.270> who's<00:00:54.390> actually<00:00:54.809> confirmed<00:00:55.440> with

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
and trifle who's actually confirmed with

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.319 
and trifle who's actually confirmed with
me<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.219> exactly<00:00:56.489> identical<00:00:57.059> in

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
me that it is exactly identical in

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.479 
me that it is exactly identical in
everything<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.050> with<00:00:58.079> size<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.770> that

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
everything to do with size and that

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.650 
everything to do with size and that
shape<00:00:59.840> okay<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.160> this<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.430> face<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
shape okay so this is a face and a

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.120 
shape okay so this is a face and a
corner<00:01:04.439> turning<00:01:05.689> four-sided<00:01:07.010> kind<00:01:08.010> of

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
corner turning four-sided kind of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.539 
corner turning four-sided kind of
puzzles<00:01:08.520> at<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.850> two<00:01:09.150> three<00:01:09.600> four<00:01:10.110> yes<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.460> you

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
puzzles at one two three four yes so you

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.370 
puzzles at one two three four yes so you
can<00:01:11.760> see<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.090> they<00:01:12.270> turn<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.780> face<00:01:13.020> and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
can see that they turn on the face and

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.310 
can see that they turn on the face and
on<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.520> corner<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.750> got<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.049> honest

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
on the corner and I got to be honest

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.530 
on the corner and I got to be honest
this<00:01:16.470> reminds<00:01:17.130> me<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:19.200> Wrexham<00:01:19.799> morphix

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
this reminds me of the Wrexham morphix

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.649 
this reminds me of the Wrexham morphix
now<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:22.020> piece<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:22.880> this<00:01:23.880> whole<00:01:24.119> section

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
now this piece here this whole section

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.649 
now this piece here this whole section
here<00:01:24.689> acts<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:26.369> piece<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.479> see

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
here acts as this piece so you can see

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.319 
here acts as this piece so you can see
they<00:01:27.810> move<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.500> corner<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.070> also<00:01:30.060> moves

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
they move on the corner and also moves

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.090 
they move on the corner and also moves
on<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.780> face<00:01:30.990> except<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.680> course<00:01:31.740> this

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
on the face except for of course this

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.910 
on the face except for of course this
one<00:01:32.280> has<00:01:32.490> added<00:01:33.450> difficulty<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:35.369> one<00:01:35.689> can<00:01:36.689> be

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
one has added difficulty this one can be

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.499 
one has added difficulty this one can be
solved<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.040> two<00:01:38.310> different<00:01:38.640> states<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.060> think<00:01:39.329> I

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
solved in two different states I think I

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.450 
solved in two different states I think I
think<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.409> could<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.650> solved<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.070> way<00:01:41.280> where

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
think it could be solved this way where

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.950 
think it could be solved this way where
all<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.700> corners<00:01:42.000> are<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> same<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.930> think

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
all the corners are the same and I think

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.620 
all the corners are the same and I think
it<00:01:43.229> could<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.530> solved<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.399> way<00:01:44.640> where<00:01:45.329> all

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
it could be solved this way where all

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.810 
it could be solved this way where all
the<00:01:46.079> face<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.799> whole<00:01:46.979> entire<00:01:47.220> face<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
the face the whole entire face is the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.880 
the face the whole entire face is the
same<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.360> fact<00:01:48.689> I'm<00:01:48.899> gonna<00:01:49.079> scramble<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.680> up

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
same in fact I'm gonna scramble this up

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.590 
same in fact I'm gonna scramble this up
I<00:01:50.130> don't<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> very

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
I don't think this is going to be a very

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.649 
I don't think this is going to be a very
difficult<00:01:51.810> puzzle<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:54.030> solve<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.570> be

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
difficult puzzle to to solve to be

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.749 
difficult puzzle to to solve to be
honest<00:01:54.930> it's<00:01:55.140> basically<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.130> very<00:01:56.369> first

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
honest it's basically the very first

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.600 
honest it's basically the very first
step<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.659> which<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.020> pretty<00:01:58.469> simple<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
step of this which is pretty simple and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.789 
step of this which is pretty simple and
on<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.329> black<00:02:00.540> one<00:02:00.810> you're<00:02:01.469> gonna<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.770> a

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
on the black one you're gonna have a

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.200 
on the black one you're gonna have a
sticker<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.460> middle<00:02:02.820> where<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:02.969> white

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
sticker in the middle where the white

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.280 
sticker in the middle where the white
one<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.540> here<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.990> would<00:02:04.110> know<00:02:04.259> that

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
one is here so you would know that

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.990 
one is here so you would know that
that's<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.860> face<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.490> don't<00:02:05.610> think<00:02:05.880> that's

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
that's the face but I don't think that's

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.029 
that's the face but I don't think that's
gonna<00:02:06.149> add<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.659> any<00:02:07.140> kind<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.439> difficulty<00:02:08.009> or

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
gonna add to any kind of difficulty or

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.240 
gonna add to any kind of difficulty or
anything<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.550> okay<00:02:10.250> so

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
anything like that okay so

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.300 
anything like that okay so
oh<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:14.020> see<00:02:14.290> there's<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.560> tribe<00:02:14.770> whom<00:02:15.010> sticker

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
oh I see there's a tribe whom sticker

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.540 
oh I see there's a tribe whom sticker
here<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.200> can<00:02:20.320> see<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.860> says<00:02:21.040> trapping

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
here so you can see it says trapping

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.520 
here so you can see it says trapping
them<00:02:21.640> there<00:02:21.820> I<00:02:22.030> wish<00:02:22.240> I<00:02:22.540> might<00:02:22.780> take<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:23.380> off

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
them there I wish I might take that off

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.560 
them there I wish I might take that off
and<00:02:23.560> put<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.160> red<00:02:24.340> or<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.850> yellow<00:02:25.150> or

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
and put it on the red or the yellow or

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.640 
and put it on the red or the yellow or
something<00:02:25.720> like<00:02:25.960> that<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.140> think<00:02:26.320> that<00:02:26.410> there's

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
something like that I think that there's

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.020 
something like that I think that there's
a<00:02:26.710> Calvin<00:02:27.700> puzzle<00:02:28.030> sticker<00:02:28.270> yes<00:02:28.750> there<00:02:28.960> is<00:02:30.030> so

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
a Calvin puzzle sticker yes there is so

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.760 
a Calvin puzzle sticker yes there is so
I<00:02:31.060> might<00:02:31.300> take<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.110> tried<00:02:32.470> from<00:02:32.620> one

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
I might take that that I tried from one

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.460 
I might take that that I tried from one
off<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.220> put<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.430> on<00:02:34.140> coloring<00:02:35.140> where<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.290> can

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
off and put it on coloring where I can

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.350 
off and put it on coloring where I can
actually<00:02:35.620> see<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:36.100> okay<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:36.730> I'm<00:02:36.970> gonna<00:02:37.120> call

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
actually see it okay so I'm gonna call

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.630 
actually see it okay so I'm gonna call
this<00:02:37.740> scrambled<00:02:38.740> so<00:02:39.010> I'm<00:02:39.070> gonna<00:02:39.220> try<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.400> make

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
this scrambled so I'm gonna try to make

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.730 
this scrambled so I'm gonna try to make
all<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.060> faces<00:02:40.510> one<00:02:40.690> color<00:02:40.960> now<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.440> let's

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
all the faces one color now so let's

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.590 
all the faces one color now so let's
start<00:02:42.100> with<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.550> red<00:02:42.790> because<00:02:43.090> it's<00:02:43.420> already

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
start with the red because it's already

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:52.160 
start with the red because it's already
pretty<00:02:43.990> close<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:46.050> make<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.200> red<00:02:47.410> here<00:02:48.209> yellow

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.520 

exchange<00:02:53.170> this<00:02:53.440> one<00:02:54.120> for<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.300> one<00:02:55.530> there's

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
exchange this one for this one there's

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:05.490 
exchange this one for this one there's
yellow<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:59.370> then<00:03:00.370> green<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.500> another

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
yellow and then green so that is another

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.680 
yellow and then green so that is another
solved<00:03:05.980> state<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.340> would<00:03:06.550> think<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:07.360> now<00:03:07.480> I'm

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
solved state I would think so now I'm

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.210 
solved state I would think so now I'm
gonna<00:03:07.870> Reese<00:03:08.320> crumble<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.709> again<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.130> then

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
gonna Reese crumble it again and then

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.340 
gonna Reese crumble it again and then
try<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.459> solve<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:09.850> back<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.270> way<00:03:10.390> I<00:03:10.660> had<00:03:11.140> it

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
try to solve it back to the way I had it

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.259 
try to solve it back to the way I had it
when<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.740> first<00:03:12.250> received<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.850> turning<00:03:16.180> is

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
when I first received it the turning is

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.610 
when I first received it the turning is
really<00:03:16.570> good<00:03:16.750> like<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.019> don't<00:03:17.080> even<00:03:17.260> think<00:03:17.410> it

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
really good like I don't even think it

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.340 
really good like I don't even think it
needs<00:03:17.769> lube<00:03:18.070> it's<00:03:18.280> just<00:03:18.430> oh<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.930> guys<00:03:20.110> hear

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
needs lube it's just oh you guys hear

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.860 
needs lube it's just oh you guys hear
that<00:03:20.380> I<00:03:22.080> gotta<00:03:23.080> do<00:03:23.260> something<00:03:23.500> about<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:24.870> so

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
that I gotta do something about that so

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.740 
that I gotta do something about that so
let's<00:03:26.230> keep<00:03:26.470> going<00:03:27.300> alright<00:03:28.300> so<00:03:28.630> now<00:03:28.720> let's

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
let's keep going alright so now let's

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.870 
let's keep going alright so now let's
see<00:03:29.140> if<00:03:29.290> I<00:03:29.410> can<00:03:29.590> solve<00:03:29.830> it<00:03:29.950> back<00:03:30.100> into<00:03:30.459> all<00:03:30.790> the

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
see if I can solve it back into all the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.210 
see if I can solve it back into all the
corners<00:03:31.239> being<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.570> same<00:03:31.780> color<00:03:32.050> so<00:03:32.860> let's

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
corners being the same color so let's

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.960 
corners being the same color so let's
move<00:03:33.519> this<00:03:33.700> one<00:03:33.910> here<00:03:34.530> move<00:03:35.530> this<00:03:35.769> one<00:03:36.010> here<00:03:36.250> is

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
move this one here move this one here is

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:46.650 
move this one here move this one here is
green<00:03:37.890> red<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:40.049> then<00:03:42.269> blue<00:03:45.120> there<00:03:46.120> we<00:03:46.209> go<00:03:46.390> so

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
green red and then blue there we go so

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.270 
green red and then blue there we go so
as<00:03:46.780> you<00:03:46.900> can<00:03:47.049> see<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.680> pretty<00:03:48.160> easy

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
as you can see it is a pretty easy

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.110 
as you can see it is a pretty easy
puzzle<00:03:49.090> but<00:03:50.190> it's<00:03:51.190> not<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.459> bad<00:03:51.640> puzzle<00:03:52.000> either

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
puzzle but it's not a bad puzzle either

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.430 
puzzle but it's not a bad puzzle either
it's<00:03:52.330> definitely<00:03:52.780> it<00:03:52.870> would<00:03:52.930> be<00:03:52.989> really<00:03:53.320> good

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
it's definitely it would be really good

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.680 
it's definitely it would be really good
for<00:03:53.500> beginners<00:03:54.150> also<00:03:55.150> just<00:03:55.420> for<00:03:55.570> your

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
you've got a tribe who and puzzle and

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.590 
you've got a tribe who and puzzle and
let's<00:04:01.299> take<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:01.480> look<00:04:01.690> at<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.049> mechanism<00:04:03.600> see

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
let's take a look at the mechanism see

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.979 
let's take a look at the mechanism see
if<00:04:04.660> I<00:04:04.720> can<00:04:04.840> pop<00:04:05.049> one<00:04:05.080> of<00:04:05.380> these<00:04:05.470> out<00:04:06.959> yep<00:04:07.959> very

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
if I can pop one of these out yep very

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.130 
if I can pop one of these out yep very
easily<00:04:08.470> oh<00:04:09.120> wow<00:04:10.120> that's<00:04:10.299> pretty<00:04:10.870> easy

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
easily oh wow that's pretty easy

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.229 
easily oh wow that's pretty easy
actually<00:04:11.380> so<00:04:12.280> let's<00:04:12.459> just<00:04:12.640> keep<00:04:12.820> going

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:26.999 

I<00:04:24.810> guess<00:04:25.810> when<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.020> reassemble<00:04:26.590> this<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:26.830> can

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
I guess when I reassemble this I can

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:28.650 
I guess when I reassemble this I can
just<00:04:27.130> put<00:04:27.340> them<00:04:27.490> however<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.090> want<00:04:28.360> because

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
just put them however I want because

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.480 
just put them however I want because
there<00:04:28.870> is<00:04:28.990> no<00:04:29.169> fixed<00:04:29.470> color<00:04:29.889> scheme<00:04:30.250> that<00:04:30.430> you

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
there is no fixed color scheme that you

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:38.189 
there is no fixed color scheme that you
have<00:04:30.669> to<00:04:30.819> obey<00:04:30.940> by<00:04:31.330> oh<00:04:32.400> wow<00:04:35.160> look<00:04:36.160> at<00:04:36.190> that<00:04:37.199> do

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
have to obey by oh wow look at that do

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.290 
have to obey by oh wow look at that do
these<00:04:38.410> have<00:04:38.620> caps<00:04:38.979> they<00:04:39.220> do<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:39.759> so<00:04:40.060> do<00:04:40.120> these

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
these have caps they do and so do these

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.850 
these have caps they do and so do these
in<00:04:40.509> it<00:04:40.690> yeah<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:42.900> can<00:04:43.900> see<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.139> as<00:04:44.410> a<00:04:44.440> cap<00:04:44.710> I

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
in it yeah I can see that as a cap I

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.680 
in it yeah I can see that as a cap I
can't<00:04:45.099> get<00:04:45.220> it<00:04:45.310> off<00:04:45.430> so<00:04:45.699> but<00:04:45.910> but<00:04:46.330> that's<00:04:46.509> I

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
can't get it off so but but that's I

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.930 
can't get it off so but but that's I
guess<00:04:46.750> how<00:04:47.020> you<00:04:47.050> would<00:04:47.289> adjust<00:04:47.440> it<00:04:50.880> it's<00:04:51.880> a

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
guess how you would adjust it it's a

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.670 
guess how you would adjust it it's a
little<00:04:52.180> bit<00:04:52.300> of<00:04:52.419> Lube<00:04:52.630> it's<00:04:52.900> just<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.500> right

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
little bit of Lube it's just the right

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.529 
little bit of Lube it's just the right
amount<00:04:53.949> of<00:04:54.039> Lube<00:04:54.220> it's<00:04:54.400> not<00:04:54.580> over<00:04:54.940> lubricated

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
amount of Lube it's not over lubricated

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:56.809 
amount of Lube it's not over lubricated
that's<00:04:55.690> for<00:04:55.900> sure

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
that's for sure

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.089 
that's for sure
all<00:04:57.819> right<00:04:58.060> so<00:04:58.270> now<00:04:58.479> see<00:04:59.080> if<00:04:59.560> we<00:04:59.710> can't<00:04:59.949> get

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
all right so now see if we can't get

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.260 
all right so now see if we can't get
this<00:05:00.250> back<00:05:00.520> together<00:05:00.789> oh<00:05:02.970> wow

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
have moved out of alignment with each

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:14.930 
have moved out of alignment with each
other<00:05:10.590> so<00:05:11.590> yeah<00:05:11.650> I<00:05:11.740> can<00:05:11.770> move<00:05:12.039> some<00:05:12.310> back
