00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
snap-on magnet magnetic rollers I think

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.660 
snap-on magnet magnetic rollers I think
I<00:03:17.819> probably<00:03:18.120> use<00:03:18.980> it's<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.220> eight<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.609> a

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
I probably use it's like eight and a

I probably use it's like eight and a
pack<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.150> use<00:03:21.389> like<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:23.930> think<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.019> was<00:03:25.109> like<00:03:25.290> four

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
pack I use like I think it was like four

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.839 
pack I use like I think it was like four
maybe<00:03:27.060> five<00:03:28.730> packs<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.970> rollers<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.519> also

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
maybe five packs of rollers and I also

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.720 
maybe five packs of rollers and I also
use<00:03:33.359> my<00:03:35.209> wood<00:03:36.209> duckbill<00:03:36.780> clips<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:38.220> sometimes

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
use my wood duckbill clips and sometimes

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.640 
use my wood duckbill clips and sometimes
when<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.000> will<00:03:39.239> roll<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.810> was<00:03:39.989> feel<00:03:40.349> tight

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
when I will roll it it was feel tight

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:50.000 
when I will roll it it was feel tight
enough<00:03:40.949> so<00:03:41.480> I<00:03:42.480> use<00:03:42.750> these<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:49.500> way<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.709> roll

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
enough so I use these the way I roll

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.960 
enough so I use these the way I roll
mines<00:03:50.449> wasn't<00:03:51.449> sure<00:03:51.629> you<00:03:51.750> saw<00:03:52.019> in<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.819> the<00:03:53.819> way

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
mines wasn't sure you saw in the the way

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.759 
mines wasn't sure you saw in the the way
it<00:03:54.120> was<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.269> road<00:03:54.569> where<00:03:55.139> you<00:03:55.319> can't<00:03:55.560> really

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
it was a road where you can't really

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.890 
it was a road where you can't really
tell<00:03:56.010> sometimes<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.790> rope<00:03:57.060> frontward<00:03:57.720> of

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
tell sometimes this rope frontward of

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.640 
tell sometimes this rope frontward of
backward<00:03:58.349> but<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.590> use<00:03:58.739> live<00:03:58.949> well<00:03:59.510> my<00:04:00.650> like

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
backward but I use live well my like

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.210 
backward but I use live well my like
going<00:04:02.069> back<00:04:02.310> in<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:03.150> middle<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.590> saw<00:04:04.859> a<00:04:04.889> row

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
going back in the middle and I saw a row

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.550 
going back in the middle and I saw a row
up<00:04:05.540> everywhere<00:04:06.540> so<00:04:06.900> of<00:04:06.959> course<00:04:07.230> when<00:04:07.500> you

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
up everywhere so of course when you

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.619 
up everywhere so of course when you
start<00:04:07.829> getting<00:04:08.010> back<00:04:08.519> anyway<00:04:08.819> that's<00:04:09.329> rolling

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
start getting back anyway that's rolling

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.580 
start getting back anyway that's rolling
under<00:04:11.030> that's<00:04:12.030> why<00:04:12.209> my<00:04:12.359> curls<00:04:12.750> are<00:04:12.989> going<00:04:13.349> up

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
under that's why my curls are going up

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.189 
under that's why my curls are going up
that's<00:04:14.489> how<00:04:14.730> I'm<00:04:14.940> used<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.239> relish<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.720> nice

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
that's how I'm used to relish that nice

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.240 
that's how I'm used to relish that nice
to<00:04:16.500> really<00:04:16.829> set<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.099> lot<00:04:17.430> when<00:04:17.760> I<00:04:17.789> had<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:18.120> relaxer

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
to really set a lot when I had a relaxer

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.180 
to really set a lot when I had a relaxer
so<00:04:20.250> but<00:04:21.830> like<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:23.220> i<00:04:23.250> think<00:04:23.639> it<00:04:23.729> is<00:04:25.190> real

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
so but like it i think it is real

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.570 
so but like it i think it is real
stretched<00:04:26.610> out<00:04:26.909> is<00:04:27.180> really<00:04:27.360> bouncy<00:04:28.139> it's<00:04:29.099> soft

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
stretched out is really bouncy it's soft

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.600 
stretched out is really bouncy it's soft
and<00:04:31.310> it's<00:04:32.310> really<00:04:32.870> thick<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:34.440> could<00:04:34.860> see

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
and it's really thick you could see

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.369 
and it's really thick you could see
very<00:04:37.030> thick<00:04:37.919> so<00:04:39.240> well<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.270> do<00:04:40.449> this<00:04:40.870> again

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
very thick so well I do this again

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.279 
very thick so well I do this again
probably<00:04:42.129> so<00:04:42.370> does<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.419> grows<00:04:43.689> I'll<00:04:44.080> probably

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
probably so does it grows I'll probably

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.709 
probably so does it grows I'll probably
like<00:04:44.620> it<00:04:44.800> even<00:04:44.919> more<00:04:46.439> I<00:04:48.180> guess<00:04:49.180> that's<00:04:49.419> pretty

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:49.719
