00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
okay and make sure you type the exact

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:44.600 
okay and make sure you type the exact
same<00:02:35.270> value<00:02:35.660> for<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.990> other<00:02:36.110> one

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.140 

now<00:02:45.300> go<00:02:45.870> back<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.260> game<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:47.000> you're<00:02:48.000> going

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
now go back to the game and you're going

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.760 
now go back to the game and you're going
to<00:02:48.210> realize<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.960> have<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.200> same<00:02:49.440> score

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
to realize that you have the same score

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.190 
to realize that you have the same score
in<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.130> corner<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.640> see<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.910> 234th<00:02:51.480> but

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
in the corner you see that 234th but

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.410 
in the corner you see that 234th but
then<00:02:52.410> unpause<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.730> get<00:02:53.880> some<00:02:54.060> more<00:02:54.180> points

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
then unpause it and get some more points

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.850 
then unpause it and get some more points
and<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:56.160> automatically<00:02:56.610> just<00:02:56.820> jumps<00:02:57.150> right<00:02:57.210> up

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
and it automatically just jumps right up

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.840 
and it automatically just jumps right up
just<00:02:58.860> like<00:02:58.980> that<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.990> is<00:03:04.640> pretty<00:03:05.640> much

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
just like that so that is pretty much

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.990 
just like that so that is pretty much
