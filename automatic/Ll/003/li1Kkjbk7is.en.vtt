Chris Harley studies the creatures that
live<00:00:06.450> at<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.899> bottom<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.620> ocean<00:00:08.069> among

live at the bottom of the ocean among
his<00:00:08.849> favorites<00:00:09.420> starfish<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.740> way<00:00:11.490> they're

his favorites starfish the way they're

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.370 
his favorites starfish the way they're
put<00:00:11.940> together<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.420> just<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:12.809> different<00:00:13.230> from

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
put together is just so different from

put together is just so different from
the<00:00:13.650> way<00:00:13.799> we<00:00:13.830> were<00:00:14.219> put<00:00:14.460> together<00:00:14.549> there's<00:00:15.000> a

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
the way we were put together there's a

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.260 
the way we were put together there's a
lot<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.330> interesting<00:00:15.570> biology<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.650> study<00:00:16.740> and

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
lot of interesting biology to study and

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.730 
lot of interesting biology to study and
you<00:00:18.270> know<00:00:18.359> again<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.779> terms<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.199> their

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
you know again in terms of their

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.349 
you know again in terms of their
importance<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.640> ecosystem<00:00:21.240> it's

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
importance in the ecosystem it's

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.029 
importance in the ecosystem it's
actually<00:00:21.720> quite<00:00:21.990> high<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.500> see<00:00:22.710> them<00:00:22.830> at<00:00:22.920> low

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
actually quite high you see them at low

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.050 
actually quite high you see them at low
tide<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.430> doesn't<00:00:23.670> look<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:23.789> they're

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
tide and it doesn't look like they're

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.759 
tide and it doesn't look like they're
doing<00:00:24.330> very<00:00:24.539> much<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:25.260> if<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.439> were<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.650> take

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
doing very much but if you were to take

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.679 
doing very much but if you were to take
them<00:00:25.949> all<00:00:26.070> away<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.609> shoreline<00:00:27.420> would<00:00:27.570> look

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
them all away the shoreline would look

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.009 
them all away the shoreline would look
incredibly<00:00:28.349> different<00:00:29.300> so<00:00:30.300> when<00:00:30.689> he<00:00:30.779> got<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
incredibly different so when he got a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.500 
incredibly different so when he got a
look<00:00:31.320> at<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.710> video<00:00:32.130> taken<00:00:32.759> last<00:00:32.969> month<00:00:33.180> by<00:00:33.480> a

look at this video taken last month by a
diver<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.230> how<00:00:34.380> sound<00:00:34.800> near<00:00:35.190> Lions<00:00:35.610> Bay<00:00:35.850> he

diver and how sound near Lions Bay he
was<00:00:36.360> understandably<00:00:37.170> concerned<00:00:37.520> they<00:00:38.520> were

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
was understandably concerned they were

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.940 
was understandably concerned they were
literally<00:00:39.120> dissolving<00:00:39.989> into<00:00:40.260> white<00:00:40.500> gooey

literally dissolving into white gooey

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.819 
literally dissolving into white gooey
blobs<00:00:41.510> then<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.660> individual<00:00:43.230> legs<00:00:43.500> would

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
blobs then the individual legs would

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.709 
blobs then the individual legs would
drop<00:00:44.129> off<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.730> start<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> crawl<00:00:45.300> away<00:00:45.450> by

drop off and start to crawl away by
themselves<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> response<00:00:48.719> to

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
themselves and that can be a response to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.240 
themselves and that can be a response to
stress<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.620> also<00:00:49.770> something<00:00:50.100> that

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
stress but it's also something that

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.560 
stress but it's also something that
happens<00:00:50.670> when<00:00:50.820> they<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:51.000> very<00:00:51.239> very<00:00:51.420> sick

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
happens when they get very very sick

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
stars it was depressing because you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.420 
stars it was depressing because you
don't<00:01:04.350> want<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.650> see<00:01:04.799> one<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> animals

that<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.610> really<00:01:05.820> like<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.420> such<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.229> sorry

that you really like in such a sorry

that you really like in such a sorry
state<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.729> also<00:01:08.909> very<00:01:09.119> intriguing

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
state but it was also very intriguing

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.840 
state but it was also very intriguing
because<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.650> raised<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.189> bunch<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.460> questions

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
because it raised a bunch of questions

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.640 
because it raised a bunch of questions
of<00:01:12.000> why<00:01:12.270> there<00:01:12.630> was<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> why<00:01:13.320> there<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:13.619> a

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
of why there was a why there was a

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.859 
of why there was a why there was a
die-off<00:01:13.950> after<00:01:14.760> making<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.180> number<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.540> calls

along<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.470> coast<00:01:16.740> Chris<00:01:17.189> determined<00:01:17.700> that

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
along the coast Chris determined that

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.130 
along the coast Chris determined that
the<00:01:17.909> deaths<00:01:18.150> were<00:01:18.270> confined<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the deaths were confined to the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.859 
the deaths were confined to the
Vancouver<00:01:19.650> area<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.880> why<00:01:21.060> there<00:01:21.750> were

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
Vancouver area as for why there were

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.410 
Vancouver area as for why there were
only<00:01:22.020> theories<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.369> leading<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.939> seemed<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
only theories the leading to seemed to

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.870 
only theories the leading to seemed to
be<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:25.650> had<00:01:25.740> had<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> lot<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.400> rainfall

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
be that we had had a lot of rainfall

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.609 
be that we had had a lot of rainfall
right<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.360> end<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.780> August<00:01:28.229> beginning<00:01:28.380> of

right at the end of August beginning of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.980 
right at the end of August beginning of
September<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.250> maybe<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.880> salinity<00:01:30.329> dropped

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
September so maybe the salinity dropped

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.450 
September so maybe the salinity dropped
enough<00:01:31.470> that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
enough that

and<00:01:50.820> we're<00:01:51.000> collecting<00:01:51.630> some<00:01:51.690> samples<00:01:52.260> for

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
and we're collecting some samples for

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.140 
and we're collecting some samples for
them<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.680> they<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:52.920> actually<00:01:53.220> look<00:01:53.490> carefully

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
them so they can actually look carefully

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.510 
them so they can actually look carefully
under<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.420> microscope<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.170> run<00:01:55.740> some<00:01:56.040> DNA

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
under the microscope and run some DNA

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.359 
under the microscope and run some DNA
analysis<00:01:57.090> what's<00:01:57.840> at<00:01:58.020> stake<00:01:58.440> aside<00:01:59.070> from<00:01:59.250> the
