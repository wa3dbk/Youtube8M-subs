00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 i 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.490
 so we can get an idea of 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.240
 moment in which we are in the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.550
 life of xbox 360 and playstation3 xbox 360 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.970
 is ready and it seems that they have passed 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.440
 flying from turning 10 we are going to do 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.180
 balance we are going to take stock in this 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.820
 occasion in the technical and we will pick up 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.000
 15 xbox 360 graphic ceilings and 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.860
 playstation 3 15 graphic roofs that do not 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.840
 are organized in this video to mode 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.420
 of ranking but that all of them are 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.420
 worthy reference games in their field 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.260
 Surely metal gear solid 4 a day 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.449
 today is no longer a game visually 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.670
 shocking but it deserves a place although 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.370
 be of honor in this list as in your 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.680
 moment and for a very long time 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.100
 remember that a game that came out in 2008 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.559
 visually broke molds 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.210
 epic games are the creators of a real 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.239
 engine and also the developers 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.920
 to date let software only 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.920
 that's why it was in the team that achieved 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.930
 squeeze the most in a real engine 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.729
 the milestone in the franchise to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.729
 date and software drive 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.020
 mass efect is again a sagas 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.760
 imperishable that is born in xbox 360 and 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.800
 playstation3 delivery delivery was 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.230
 improving in the technical way more 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.730
 that palpable and that reaches its zenith with 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.730
 the third player 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.420
 we are going to a tremendous title 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.820
 present and that is that we are about 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.160
 point to point of receiving batman arkham 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.440
 light but batman arkham is a saga with 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.560
 A lot of story history on playstation3 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.510
 story on xbox 360 surely from 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.790
 between the three available games up 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.800
 the moment that is visually the most 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.800
 important is batman arkham city 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.350
 and we go with another of those franchises 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.180
 who earn a freelance position in a 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.439
 list of technical ceilings and we talk about 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.689
 a charter and this time we 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.580
 we direct directly uncharted 2 a 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.650
 Graphically charter 2 has two 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.110
 fundamental virtues on the one hand the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.120
 level of detail and mime is extreme and for 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.819
 another side know how to play with that of the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.120
 movie games like 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.120
 absolutely nobody 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.690
 true is that at a playable level as 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.060
 video game crisis seems to me a saga 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.950
 pretty forgettable but what I can not 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.020
 forget is that at the technical level there is 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.240
 total reference to crisis 3 the last 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.980
 delivery is started is not up to the level 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.440
 of what to expect for the name 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.890
 that looks but in consoles is authentic 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.890
 concerning 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.830
 we also talk about the game of 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.480
 technical reference when we 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.460
 we direct and we look face to face to the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.530
 killzone saga you only need to have in 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.880
 account that sony always uses 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.470
 deliveries of those who are like letter of 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.960
 technical presentation for all your 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.240
 platforms in playstation 3 joaquin are 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.610
 two and in playstation 4 killzone shadows 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.370
 Paul the third hands over the second part 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.410
 that we saw of the saga on playstation3 in 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.650
 the game that we include with this ranking 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.650
 today 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.670
 this will not be the last occasion in the 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.040
 which we will see a game of rockstar in 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.990
 this list of 15 but we are going to open 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.010
 mouths are going to be heating engines with 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.010
 max payne 3 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.980
 the fight genre seems that 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.810
 technically does not have much to say 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.489
 which is little more than functional without 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.170
 However, if we look at the catalog we have 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.870
 examples of fighting games visually 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.609
 very attractive and very impressive street 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.530
 fighter or dead or alive there was my 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.239
 great doubt at the time of including in this 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.799
 list but I think the dollar light 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.450
 is one step ahead as far as 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.260
 technical level refers to I like more 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.260
 how it moves 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.310
 god of war 3 about to receive a 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.590
 remastered version on playstation 4 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.060
 he also finds a place in this list 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.560
 just like a charter 3 a game 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.840
 visually very attractive at the level 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.060
 technically at a palpable level but it is also 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.219
 a game with some planes that contribute 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.569
 much to that graphic experience that 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:13.609
 has the player 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.140
 and another genre that always tries to go a 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.030
 step forward in the technical thing that 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.340
 always try to bring something is the 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.019
 engine genre and the saga force of 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.820
 undisputed way bet by the 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.470
 fluency but without neglecting the detail 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.720
 without neglecting the impact without taking off 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.190
 the effects of lights forza motorsport 4 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.190
 I think he deserves to be here 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.980
 on the side of sonny each side involves 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.590
 we have a great tourism grand tourism 6 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.540
 that one step ahead in what he proposed 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.000
 and the fifth installment is also a game 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.650
 that visually I think it's even 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.240
 a step ahead of what he offered 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.240
 strength in xbox 360 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.699
 whose forms 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.650
 and we go with halo halo had to 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.169
 appear here the fourth installment of halo 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.810
 when 343 industries arrive and develop 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.490
 your first original game will surely be 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.610
 a game that sacrifices a little the world 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.159
 open in pursuit of a visual section 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.680
 truly amazing 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:18.240
 minsk info values ​​grandeza point 5 os 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.870
 he said that rockstar had to appear 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:27.289
 here again it seems impossible that they have 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:34.770
 got this video game on xbox 360 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:36.840
 but that's where you have it and we leave for 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.370
 the final one of the last games that 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.620
 saw the generation one of the last 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.409
 great video games of the generation of 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.629
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.069
 in this exclusive case of playstation 3 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:49.770
 it's a game that everyone absolutely 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:51.870
 all you know is from the leaves and it's a 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.819
 amazing game in all its aspects 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.819
 the technician one of them 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.260
 15 games this is that visually 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:04.300
 squeeze the maximum xbox 360 playstation3 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.560
 15 games plus I believe that all 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.389
 recommended levels 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.100
 this is the youtube channel of the network area 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.100
 I am sos them bye bye 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.540
 two
