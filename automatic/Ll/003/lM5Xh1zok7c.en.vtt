00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
quickly and instead of having to take it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.040 
quickly and instead of having to take it
in<00:00:35.550> your<00:00:35.610> inventory<00:00:36.059> then<00:00:36.239> close<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> bank

bank and not on the ground so it's

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.569 
bank and not on the ground so it's
forever<00:00:51.719> gone<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.860> good<00:00:52.980> item<00:00:53.219> sing

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
or read so if you click on this one the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.710 
or read so if you click on this one the
low<00:01:52.710> key<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.909> either<00:01:54.090> rent<00:01:54.450> or

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
low key you can either rent or

low key you can either rent or
permanently<00:01:55.320> by<00:01:55.590> these<00:01:55.860> slots<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:57.149> don't

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
permanently by these slots and I don't

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.359 
permanently by these slots and I don't
really<00:01:58.170> think<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.680> or<00:01:58.920> they<00:01:59.100> could<00:01:59.130> have

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
really think this or they could have

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.819 
really think this or they could have
done<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.549> better<00:01:59.670> by<00:02:00.180> having<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.619> can

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
done it better by having it so you can

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.249 
done it better by having it so you can
rent<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.430> buy<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:02.880> runescape<00:02:03.630> gold<00:02:04.049> as

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
rent it and buy with runescape gold as

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.170 
rent it and buy with runescape gold as
well<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.740> would<00:02:05.100> mean<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.460> money<00:02:05.880> sink

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
well so that would mean a money sink

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.510 
well so that would mean a money sink
instead<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.320> wrinkles<00:02:07.619> loyalty<00:02:08.220> points

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
another option that's through wrinkle I

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.460 
another option that's through wrinkle I
mean<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.580> runescape<00:02:34.180> GP<00:02:34.510> then<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:35.230> would<00:02:35.440> be

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
mean the runescape GP then it would be

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.830 
mean the runescape GP then it would be
really<00:02:35.709> good<00:02:35.920> but<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:37.090> doesn't<00:02:37.330> really<00:02:37.450> have<00:02:37.810> a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
really good but it doesn't really have a

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.410 
really good but it doesn't really have a
big<00:02:38.170> advantage<00:02:38.290> as<00:02:38.860> 5<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.459> quite<00:02:39.730> enough<00:02:40.030> but

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
big advantage as 5 is quite enough but

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.610 
big advantage as 5 is quite enough but
if<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:40.660> really<00:02:40.840> want<00:02:41.020> more<00:02:41.200> than<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.500> could

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
takes out the fall supplies for making

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.230 
takes out the fall supplies for making
overloads<00:05:09.340> meaning<00:05:10.340> that<00:05:10.490> making<00:05:10.849> overloads

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
overloads meaning that making overloads

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.570 
overloads meaning that making overloads
now<00:05:11.509> is<00:05:11.750> so<00:05:11.990> much<00:05:12.139> easier<00:05:12.169> but<00:05:13.039> just<00:05:13.490> not

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
now is so much easier but just not

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.520 
now is so much easier but just not
overload<00:05:14.060> every<00:05:14.389> other<00:05:14.539> skill<00:05:14.870> it's<00:05:15.199> not<00:05:15.349> so

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
overload every other skill it's not so

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.070 
overload every other skill it's not so
much<00:05:15.560> more<00:05:16.099> convenient<00:05:16.490> to<00:05:16.819> train<00:05:17.090> and<00:05:17.360> really
