people<00:00:00.450> often<00:00:00.719> ask<00:00:00.840> us<00:00:01.140> what<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.560> so<00:00:01.680> special

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
people often ask us what is so special

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.380 
people often ask us what is so special
about<00:00:02.399> TSW<00:00:03.240> why<00:00:03.540> choose<00:00:04.020> TSW<00:00:04.770> why<00:00:05.490> do<00:00:05.549> install

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
about TSW why choose TSW why do install

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.320 
about TSW why choose TSW why do install
us<00:00:06.569> laugh<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:07.140> sell<00:00:07.319> TSW<00:00:07.980> wheels<00:00:08.189> so<00:00:09.179> let's

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
us laugh to sell TSW wheels so let's

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.150 
us laugh to sell TSW wheels so let's
take<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.510> look<00:00:09.690> at<00:00:09.809> this<00:00:09.900> wheel<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.230> TSW<00:00:10.860> rama

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
take a look at this wheel the TSW rama

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.009 
take a look at this wheel the TSW rama
we<00:00:12.030> look<00:00:12.150> at<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.300> couple<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.660> things<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.990> show

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
we look at a couple of things to show

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.230 
we look at a couple of things to show
the<00:00:13.349> difference<00:00:13.769> between<00:00:13.950> TSW<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.969> many

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
the difference between TSW and many

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.710 
the difference between TSW and many
other<00:00:15.450> wheels<00:00:15.719> if<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:16.770> start<00:00:17.100> with<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> lip<00:00:17.720> what

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
other wheels if we start with a lip what

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.950 
other wheels if we start with a lip what
TSW<00:00:19.260> does<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.400> uses<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.939> muricata<00:00:21.600> lip<00:00:21.810> as

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
TSW does is it uses a muricata lip as

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.540 
TSW does is it uses a muricata lip as
opposed<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.439> normal<00:00:22.740> machine<00:00:22.920> cut<00:00:23.310> lip

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
opposed to a normal machine cut lip

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.310 
opposed to a normal machine cut lip
that's<00:00:24.150> what<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.420> tear<00:00:24.600> stubby<00:00:24.869> lips<00:00:25.050> are<00:00:25.170> so

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
that's what the tear stubby lips are so

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.800 
that's what the tear stubby lips are so
shiny<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.070> what<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.939> entails<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.390> using<00:00:27.720> a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
shiny and what that entails is using a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.320 
shiny and what that entails is using a
special<00:00:27.930> diamond<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.890> high-speed<00:00:29.160> lathe<00:00:29.699> to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
special diamond in a high-speed lathe to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.870 
special diamond in a high-speed lathe to
get<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.630> extra-special<00:00:31.050> shiny<00:00:31.710> look<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.730> a

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
get that extra-special shiny look it's a

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.850 
get that extra-special shiny look it's a
lot<00:00:33.149> more<00:00:33.329> difficult<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.380> cost<00:00:34.649> more

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
lot more difficult to do it cost more

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.069 
lot more difficult to do it cost more
money<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.430> does<00:00:35.670> make<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> difference<00:00:36.120> what

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
money but it does make a difference what

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.690 
money but it does make a difference what
we<00:00:37.140> also<00:00:37.469> do<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:37.800> make<00:00:38.070> sure<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.370> machine

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
we also do is we make sure we machine

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.479 
we also do is we make sure we machine
right<00:00:38.940> down<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> bottom<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.649> lip<00:00:40.860> so

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
right down to the bottom of the lip so

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.100 
right down to the bottom of the lip so
you<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:41.730> some<00:00:41.969> separation<00:00:42.480> between<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
you get some separation between the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.200 
you get some separation between the
center<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> wheel<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.550> outside<00:00:44.940> lab

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
center of the wheel and the outside lab

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.779 
center of the wheel and the outside lab
or<00:00:45.870> nearly<00:00:46.289> all<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.559> our<00:00:46.770> TSW<00:00:47.340> wheels<00:00:47.550> we're

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
or nearly all of our TSW wheels we're

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.670 
or nearly all of our TSW wheels we're
using<00:00:47.940> metal<00:00:48.329> rivets<00:00:48.690> what<00:00:48.930> most<00:00:49.260> companies

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
using metal rivets what most companies

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.410 
using metal rivets what most companies
are<00:00:49.950> doing<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.250> using<00:00:50.430> plastic<00:00:51.000> rivets

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
are doing is using plastic rivets

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.760 
are doing is using plastic rivets
there's<00:00:51.870> obviously<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.469> big<00:00:52.530> difference

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
there's obviously a big difference

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.650 
there's obviously a big difference
between<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.370> metal<00:00:53.610> rivet<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.270> plastic

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
between a metal rivet and a plastic

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.380 
between a metal rivet and a plastic
rivet<00:00:54.989> very<00:00:55.739> importantly<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.699> metal<00:00:57.059> rivet

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
rivet very importantly the metal rivet

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.900 
rivet very importantly the metal rivet
looks<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.109> lot<00:00:58.739> better<00:00:58.920> than<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> plastic<00:00:59.460> rivet

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
looks a lot better than a plastic rivet

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.610 
looks a lot better than a plastic rivet
at<00:01:00.030> won't<00:01:00.329> fate<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.960> will<00:01:01.079> not<00:01:01.289> come<00:01:01.500> out

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
at won't fate and it will not come out

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.229 
at won't fate and it will not come out
of<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> wheel<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.489> next<00:01:02.730> thing<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:02.940> look<00:01:03.120> at

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
of the wheel the next thing we look at

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.070 
of the wheel the next thing we look at
is<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.750> caps<00:01:04.250> TSW<00:01:05.250> uses<00:01:05.519> extra<00:01:06.150> thick<00:01:06.479> emblem

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
is the caps TSW uses extra thick emblem

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.020 
is the caps TSW uses extra thick emblem
the<00:01:07.680> advantage<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.580> first<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.000> all

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the advantage of this is first of all

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.030 
the advantage of this is first of all
the<00:01:09.150> emblem<00:01:09.450> will<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:09.810> warp<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.470> also<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the emblem will not warp and also the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.859 
the emblem will not warp and also the
color<00:01:11.310> will<00:01:11.580> not<00:01:11.760> fade<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.390> gives<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.659> much

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
color will not fade but it gives a much

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.810 
color will not fade but it gives a much
better<00:01:13.110> quality<00:01:13.409> feel<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> wheel<00:01:14.369> all

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
better quality feel on the wheel all

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.370 
better quality feel on the wheel all
right<00:01:14.970> let's<00:01:15.119> take<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.299> look<00:01:15.390> at<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.689> TSW

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
right let's take a look at this TSW

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.740 
right let's take a look at this TSW
status<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:16.979> what<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.670> want<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> point<00:01:18.119> out<00:01:18.390> is

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
status in what we want to point out is

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.469 
status in what we want to point out is
on<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> back<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.950> wheel<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.060> what<00:01:21.390> is

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
on the back of a wheel you have what is

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
on the back of a wheel you have what is
called<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.869> same<00:01:22.110> two<00:01:22.259> ball<00:01:22.439> every<00:01:23.130> single

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
called the same two ball every single

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.789 
called the same two ball every single
TSW<00:01:24.270> wheel<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.720> hub<00:01:25.049> centric<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:25.619> use<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
TSW wheel is hub centric we use a

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.819 
TSW wheel is hub centric we use a
special<00:01:26.400> metal<00:01:27.320> centering<00:01:28.320> ring<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.680> make

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
special metal centering ring to make

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.469 
special metal centering ring to make
sure<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> wheel<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.430> hap<00:01:29.579> centric<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
sure the wheel is hap centric if the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.210 
sure the wheel is hap centric if the
wheel<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.990> not<00:01:31.020> hap<00:01:31.350> centric<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.950> are<00:01:32.040> going

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
wheel is not hap centric you are going

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.460 
wheel is not hap centric you are going
to<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.430> vibration<00:01:33.240> i<00:01:33.360> would<00:01:33.840> not<00:01:34.079> advise

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
to get vibration i would not advise

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.469 
to get vibration i would not advise
buying<00:01:34.860> any<00:01:35.070> wheel<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.880> not<00:01:36.030> happy<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
buying any wheel that is not happy and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.649
