got<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:09.379> Vitus<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.890> don't<00:02:11.220> know<00:02:11.400> what<00:02:11.610> Vitus

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
got a Vitus so I don't know what Vitus

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.670 
got a Vitus so I don't know what Vitus
cell<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.510> think<00:02:12.690> it's<00:02:12.959> another

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
cell is I think it's another

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.300 
cell is I think it's another
medical<00:02:14.310> kind<00:02:14.579> of<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.790> thing<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:16.099> that's<00:02:17.099> going

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
medical kind of a thing and that's going

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.970 
medical kind of a thing and that's going
to<00:02:17.370> go<00:02:17.519> up<00:02:17.670> there<00:02:18.349> I'm<00:02:19.349> going<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.799> outline

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
to go up there I'm going to outline

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.759 
to go up there I'm going to outline
these<00:02:20.640> two<00:02:20.939> angel<00:02:21.329> faces<00:02:21.629> with<00:02:22.109> a<00:02:22.140> couple<00:02:22.590> of

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
these two angel faces with a couple of

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.580 
these two angel faces with a couple of
these<00:02:22.980> silver<00:02:23.519> washers<00:02:24.510> kind<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.989> frame<00:02:25.319> those

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
these silver washers kind of frame those

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.390 
these silver washers kind of frame those
faces<00:02:26.219> a<00:02:26.250> little<00:02:26.640> bit<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.650> oh<00:02:28.650> yeah<00:02:28.890> one<00:02:29.219> other

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
faces a little bit and oh yeah one other

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.270 
faces a little bit and oh yeah one other
thing<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.299> dental<00:02:30.870> floss<00:02:31.049> I'm<00:02:32.010> going<00:02:32.219> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
thing that the dental floss I'm going to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.849 
thing that the dental floss I'm going to
frame<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.879> dental<00:02:33.299> floss<00:02:34.340> with<00:02:36.560> these<00:02:37.560> little

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
frame the dental floss with these little

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.099 
frame the dental floss with these little
plastic<00:02:38.069> magnifying<00:02:38.969> glasses<00:02:39.329> I've<00:02:39.900> got<00:02:40.079> a

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
plastic magnifying glasses I've got a

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.990 
plastic magnifying glasses I've got a
few<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.530> these<00:02:40.799> I've<00:02:41.069> never<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.549> actually

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
few of these I've never you actually

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.789 
few of these I've never you actually
used<00:02:42.329> these<00:02:42.629> before<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.230> one<00:02:43.469> is<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> little

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
used these before this one is a little

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.550 
used these before this one is a little
dirty<00:02:44.129> never<00:02:44.969> really<00:02:45.329> use<00:02:45.569> these<00:02:45.810> before<00:02:46.349> but

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
dirty never really use these before but

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.970 
dirty never really use these before but
I'm<00:02:46.650> going<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.040> on<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.329> think<00:02:48.629> is<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.799> kind

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
I'm going to on this I think is it kind

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.190 
I'm going to on this I think is it kind
of<00:02:50.069> like<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.639> way<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.970> looks<00:02:51.299> so<00:02:51.569> this<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.959> my

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
of like the way that looks so this is my

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.220 
of like the way that looks so this is my
plan<00:02:53.120> then<00:02:54.120> I'll<00:02:54.269> put<00:02:55.549> these<00:02:56.549> little<00:02:57.230> these

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
plan then I'll put these little these

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.800 
plan then I'll put these little these
little<00:02:58.290> things<00:02:58.969> underneath<00:02:59.969> all<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.389> corners

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
little things underneath all the corners

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.530 
little things underneath all the corners
to<00:03:01.139> screw<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.889> down<00:03:02.040> but<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.700> think<00:03:02.849> this<00:03:03.359> is

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
to screw it down but I I think this is

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.830 
to screw it down but I I think this is
where<00:03:03.689> I'm<00:03:03.780> going<00:03:03.959> with<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:05.510> let<00:03:06.510> me<00:03:06.659> work

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
where I'm going with this so let me work

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.179 
where I'm going with this so let me work
on<00:03:06.989> this<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.230> little<00:03:07.409> bit<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.769> get<00:03:07.950> everything

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
on this a little bit and get everything

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:15.559 
on this a little bit and get everything
glued<00:03:08.519> down<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:13.049> probably<00:03:13.879> silly<00:03:14.879> to<00:03:15.209> say

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
glued down this is probably silly to say

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.780 
glued down this is probably silly to say
but<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:15.900> just<00:03:15.989> learned<00:03:16.650> something<00:03:17.010> very<00:03:17.370> simple

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
but I just learned something very simple

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.599 
but I just learned something very simple
here<00:03:18.150> i<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.510> glued<00:03:18.930> down<00:03:19.079> my<00:03:19.379> cold<00:03:19.739> tablet<00:03:20.250> label

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
here i I glued down my cold tablet label

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.430 
here i I glued down my cold tablet label
and<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.209> was<00:03:21.329> about<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:21.780> put<00:03:21.959> some<00:03:22.169> of<00:03:22.319> the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
and I was about to put some of the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.610 
and I was about to put some of the
layered<00:03:22.739> things<00:03:23.159> on<00:03:23.459> when<00:03:23.879> I<00:03:23.909> thought<00:03:24.620> maybe

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
layered things on when I thought maybe

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.740 
layered things on when I thought maybe
it<00:03:25.949> would<00:03:26.069> be<00:03:26.099> a<00:03:26.280> good<00:03:26.489> idea<00:03:26.879> if<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.359> put<00:03:27.599> my

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
it would be a good idea if I put my

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.610 
it would be a good idea if I put my
plastic<00:03:28.470> down<00:03:28.709> first<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.879> then<00:03:30.349> drilled<00:03:31.349> my

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
plastic down first and then drilled my

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.500 
plastic down first and then drilled my
holes<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:32.579> that<00:03:32.609> they<00:03:32.879> go<00:03:33.060> through<00:03:33.090> the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
holes so that they go through the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.890 
holes so that they go through the
plastic<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.260> actually<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.599> wood

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
plastic and actually and so the wood

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.429 
plastic and actually and so the wood
piece<00:03:37.169> itself<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.629> course<00:03:39.959> this<00:03:40.169> makes

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:40.439 
piece itself so of course this makes

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.009 
piece itself so of course this makes
sense<00:03:40.919> I<00:03:41.459> didn't<00:03:42.030> do<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.299> this<00:03:42.449> way<00:03:42.659> the<00:03:42.810> first

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
sense I didn't do it this way the first

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.379 
sense I didn't do it this way the first
time<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.349> did<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.799> excuse<00:03:44.669> me<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:44.849> much<00:03:45.120> harder

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
time I did it excuse me a much harder

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.189 
time I did it excuse me a much harder
way<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:46.739> first<00:03:47.040> time<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.280> did<00:03:47.729> this<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.329> I<00:03:48.359> kind

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
way the first time I did this so I kind

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.140 
way the first time I did this so I kind
of<00:03:49.379> aligned<00:03:49.979> everything<00:03:50.159> the<00:03:50.669> way<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.819> thought

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
of aligned everything the way I thought

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.659 
of aligned everything the way I thought
I<00:03:51.209> wanted<00:03:51.659> it<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:51.959> then<00:03:52.019> I<00:03:52.650> held<00:03:53.129> on<00:03:53.370> very

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
I wanted it and then I held on very

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.170 
I wanted it and then I held on very
tightly<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.329> plastic<00:03:55.069> plastic<00:03:56.180> Plexiglas

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
tightly to the plastic plastic Plexiglas

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.599 
tightly to the plastic plastic Plexiglas
and<00:03:57.479> then<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.139> course<00:03:58.379> I<00:03:58.500> did<00:03:58.680> my<00:03:58.829> drilling<00:03:59.280> in

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
and then of course I did my drilling in

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.539 
and then of course I did my drilling in
each<00:03:59.759> of<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.120> corners<00:04:00.569> and<00:04:01.139> so<00:04:01.889> my<00:04:02.040> holes<00:04:02.310> are

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
each of the corners and so my holes are

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.439 
each of the corners and so my holes are
ready<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.970> go<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:04.009> when<00:04:05.009> I<00:04:05.069> add<00:04:05.310> my<00:04:05.449> little

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
ready to go so when I add my little

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.119 
ready to go so when I add my little
hardware<00:04:06.930> pieces<00:04:07.169> I'm<00:04:07.500> just<00:04:07.709> going<00:04:07.859> to<00:04:07.889> set

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
hardware pieces I'm just going to set

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.119 
hardware pieces I'm just going to set
the<00:04:08.280> hardware<00:04:08.669> down<00:04:08.939> and<00:04:10.009> everything<00:04:11.009> is

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
the hardware down and everything is

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.629 
the hardware down and everything is
going<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.549> align<00:04:12.259> very<00:04:13.259> nicely<00:04:13.769> here<00:04:14.400> like

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
going to align very nicely here like

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.759 
going to align very nicely here like
this<00:04:15.000> so<00:04:15.269> anyway<00:04:15.659> just<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.259> simple<00:04:16.650> little

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
this so anyway just a simple little

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.479 
this so anyway just a simple little
trick<00:04:18.199> probably<00:04:19.199> very<00:04:19.409> obvious<00:04:19.979> simple

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
trick probably very obvious simple

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.409 
trick probably very obvious simple
little<00:04:20.729> trick<00:04:20.880> but<00:04:21.120> I<00:04:21.150> just<00:04:21.419> discovered<00:04:21.930> it

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
little trick but I just discovered it

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:29.090 
little trick but I just discovered it
okay<00:04:24.419> this<00:04:24.779> one<00:04:25.020> is<00:04:25.490> officially<00:04:26.490> finished

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.610 

I<00:04:29.240> kind<00:04:30.240> of<00:04:30.330> know<00:04:30.450> what<00:04:30.600> I'm<00:04:30.630> doing<00:04:31.020> now<00:04:31.200> the

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
I kind of know what I'm doing now the

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.310 
I kind of know what I'm doing now the
first<00:04:31.860> one<00:04:32.100> was<00:04:32.310> more<00:04:32.700> of<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:32.910> dry<00:04:33.720> run<00:04:34.050> this

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
first one was more of a dry run this

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.410 
first one was more of a dry run this
this<00:04:34.680> was<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.340> little<00:04:35.640> bit<00:04:35.760> easier<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.120> do<00:04:36.390> I

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
this was a little bit easier to do I

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.970 
this was a little bit easier to do I
figured<00:04:36.990> out<00:04:37.140> what<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.410> do<00:04:37.530> with<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.800> holes

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
figured out what to do with the holes

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.400 
figured out what to do with the holes
I'm<00:04:38.670> gonna<00:04:38.820> put<00:04:39.060> my<00:04:39.210> something<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:40.110> hang<00:04:40.260> it

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
I'm gonna put my something to hang it

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.610 
I'm gonna put my something to hang it
with<00:04:40.530> on<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.860> back<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.810> it's<00:04:42.810> ready<00:04:43.080> done

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
I can look inside there and see my

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.990 
I can look inside there and see my
little<00:04:46.650> floaters<00:04:47.250> down<00:04:47.520> inside<00:04:48.060> and<00:04:50.000> okay

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000
