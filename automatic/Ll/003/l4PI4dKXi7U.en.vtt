decide whether it's an a or I gay and
that's<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.910> nutshell<00:00:46.070> alright

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
that's just it in a nutshell alright

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.590 
that's just it in a nutshell alright
it's<00:00:47.309> gonna<00:00:47.489> be<00:00:47.610> fun<00:00:47.850> man<00:00:48.059> sitting<00:00:48.450> back

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
it's gonna be fun man sitting back

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.619 
it's gonna be fun man sitting back
watching<00:00:48.950> everyone's<00:00:49.950> response<00:00:50.460> cuz<00:00:51.449> yeah

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
watching everyone's response cuz yeah

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
you know there gonna be guys that is

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.880 
you know there gonna be guys that is
probably<00:00:53.640> not<00:00:53.789> gonna<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:55.500> know<00:00:55.649> for

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
probably not gonna like it you know for

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.130 
probably not gonna like it you know for
various<00:00:56.280> reasons<00:00:56.309> there<00:00:57.300> will<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.539> guys<00:00:57.840> who

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
various reasons there will be guys who

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.310 
various reasons there will be guys who
will<00:00:58.350> love<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.710> game<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:59.609> various<00:01:00.000> reasons

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
will love the game for various reasons

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.630 
will love the game for various reasons
you<00:01:01.320> know<00:01:01.469> I've<00:01:01.559> given<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.190> opinion

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
you know I've given you my opinion

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.960 
you know I've given you my opinion
already<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.710> said<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> game<00:01:05.040> has<00:01:05.280> improved<00:01:05.430> I

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
already I said the game has improved I

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.120 
already I said the game has improved I
like<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> direction<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.229> game<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.920> in

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
like the direction this game is going in

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.450 
like the direction this game is going in
yes<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.270> openly<00:01:09.840> admitted<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.380> everyone<00:01:10.799> this

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
yes I openly admitted to everyone this

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.320 
yes I openly admitted to everyone this
game<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.119> definitely<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:13.280> where<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:15.000> want<00:01:15.270> it

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
game is definitely not where we want it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.600 
game is definitely not where we want it
to<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:15.869> far<00:01:16.140> as<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.320> simulation<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.130> total

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
to be as far as a simulation a total

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.480 
to be as far as a simulation a total
simulation<00:01:18.210> reason<00:01:18.990> being<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.860> impossible

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
simulation reason being it's impossible

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.179 
simulation reason being it's impossible
for<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:22.500> know<00:01:22.530> Madden<00:01:23.159> has

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
for it to be that you know Madden has

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.390 
for it to be that you know Madden has
not<00:01:23.610> been<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> solid<00:01:24.650> simulation<00:01:25.650> hasn't

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
not been a solid simulation hasn't

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.450 
not been a solid simulation hasn't
really<00:01:26.580> showed<00:01:26.850> too<00:01:27.210> many<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:28.380> know<00:01:28.530> too<00:01:29.310> many

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
really showed too many you know too many

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.469 
really showed too many you know too many
signs<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.560> being<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.829> solid<00:01:32.729> simulation<00:01:33.329> for

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
signs of it being a solid simulation for

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.530 
signs of it being a solid simulation for
several<00:01:33.900> years<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:34.950> impossible<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
several years so it's impossible for the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.100 
several years so it's impossible for the
game<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.430> perfect<00:01:38.430> which<00:01:39.390> no<00:01:39.689> game<00:01:39.930> will

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
game to be perfect which no game will

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.749 
game to be perfect which no game will
ever<00:01:40.259> be<00:01:40.439> perfect<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.070> understand<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
ever be perfect but you understand the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.969 
ever be perfect but you understand the
analogy<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.810> impossible<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.740> game<00:01:43.920> to

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
analogy it's impossible for this game to

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.240 
analogy it's impossible for this game to
be<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> full-blown<00:01:44.909> simulation<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.979> one<00:01:46.979> or

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
be the full-blown simulation and one or

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.780 
be the full-blown simulation and one or
even<00:01:47.310> two<00:01:47.700> cycle<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.479> possibly<00:01:49.640> what<00:01:50.640> you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
even two cycle and possibly what you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.600 
even two cycle and possibly what you
guys<00:01:51.000> should<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.509> looking<00:01:51.869> for<00:01:52.490> what<00:01:53.490> I'm

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
guys should be looking for what I'm

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.630 
guys should be looking for what I'm
looking<00:01:53.970> for<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.380> game<00:01:55.680> turning<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
looking for is is this game turning the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.910 
looking for is is this game turning the
corner<00:01:57.320> that's<00:01:58.320> what<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.590> should<00:01:58.799> ask

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
corner that's what you should ask

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.070 
corner that's what you should ask
