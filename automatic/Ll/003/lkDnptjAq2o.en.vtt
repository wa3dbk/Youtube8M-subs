either<00:00:01.709> bike<00:00:02.010> blogger<00:00:02.310> here<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.970> viewer<00:00:03.720> asked

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
either bike blogger here a viewer asked

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.940 
either bike blogger here a viewer asked
how<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.410> determine<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.100> wheel<00:00:05.339> size<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:06.950> the

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
how to determine the wheel size of the

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.060 
how to determine the wheel size of the
wheel<00:00:08.220> here<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.120> can<00:00:09.420> determine<00:00:10.050> what<00:00:10.950> to

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
wheel here so you can determine what to

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.669 
wheel here so you can determine what to
input<00:00:11.550> on<00:00:11.759> your<00:00:11.940> bike<00:00:12.179> computer<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.500> can

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
input on your bike computer so you can

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.589 
input on your bike computer so you can
get<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.070> speed<00:00:14.429> while<00:00:14.910> you're<00:00:15.089> riding<00:00:15.389> on

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
get the speed while you're riding on

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.410 
get the speed while you're riding on
your<00:00:15.719> bicycle<00:00:16.049> accurately<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.760> do<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.119> lay

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
your bicycle accurately to do that lay

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.769 
your bicycle accurately to do that lay
down<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.960> tape<00:00:19.320> measure<00:00:20.000> set<00:00:21.000> up<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.359> wheel<00:00:21.570> of

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
down a tape measure set up the wheel of

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.830 
down a tape measure set up the wheel of
the<00:00:21.869> bicycle<00:00:22.080> such<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.580> valve<00:00:23.850> stem<00:00:24.300> is

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the bicycle such that the valve stem is

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.000 
the bicycle such that the valve stem is
right<00:00:25.109> at<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.320> end<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> tape<00:00:25.980> measure

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
right at the end of the tape measure

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.029 
right at the end of the tape measure
then<00:00:27.000> roll<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.779> bike<00:00:27.990> forward<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.769> full

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
then roll the bike forward one full

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.700 
then roll the bike forward one full
revolution<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> wheel<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.660> determine<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
revolution of the wheel to determine the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.610 
revolution of the wheel to determine the
circumference<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.820> wheel<00:00:32.850> plus<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.809> tire

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
circumference of the wheel plus the tire

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.130 
circumference of the wheel plus the tire
and<00:00:35.040> before<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.180> pump<00:00:36.570> up<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.899> tire

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and before you do this pump up the tire

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.920 
and before you do this pump up the tire
to<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> recommended<00:00:37.980> maximum<00:00:38.940> pressure<00:00:39.600> that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
to the recommended maximum pressure that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.959 
to the recommended maximum pressure that
you'll<00:00:40.140> run<00:00:40.320> an<00:00:40.500> ad<00:00:40.649> normally<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.730> get<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
you'll run an ad normally to get the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.819 
you'll run an ad normally to get the
most<00:00:42.149> accurate<00:00:42.480> measurement<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.559> let's<00:00:43.680> go

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
most accurate measurement so let's go

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:54.319 
most accurate measurement so let's go
ahead<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.129> roll<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.430> forward<00:00:51.890> okay<00:00:53.120> it<00:00:54.120> looks

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
ahead and roll it forward okay it looks

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.619 
ahead and roll it forward okay it looks
like<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.719> got<00:00:54.899> about<00:00:55.050> math<00:00:55.829> 84<00:00:56.640> inches<00:00:56.969> 85

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
like we got about math 84 inches 85

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.240 
like we got about math 84 inches 85
inches<00:00:59.210> so<00:01:00.210> when<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.050> input<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
inches so when you input that on the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.399 
inches so when you input that on the
computer<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.420> they'll<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.199> in

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
computer here they'll do that in

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.980 
computer here they'll do that in
millimeters<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> determine<00:01:06.119> millimeters

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
millimeters so to determine millimeters

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.109 
millimeters so to determine millimeters
from<00:01:07.229> inches<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.950> simply<00:01:08.340> take<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> inches

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
from inches you simply take the inches

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.760 
from inches you simply take the inches
and<00:01:09.299> multiply<00:01:09.960> by<00:01:12.020> 25.4<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.350> let's<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.650> ahead

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
and multiply by 25.4 so let's go ahead

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.730 
and multiply by 25.4 so let's go ahead
and<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.810> all<00:01:15.810> right<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.320> came<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.619> with

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and do that all right so we came up with

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.999 
and do that all right so we came up with
85<00:01:17.220> inches<00:01:17.700> let's<00:01:17.909> multiply<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.600> by<00:01:18.890> 25.4<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
85 inches let's multiply that by 25.4 to

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.240 
85 inches let's multiply that by 25.4 to
get<00:01:20.159> millimeters<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.720> gives<00:01:21.900> us<00:01:22.250> 2159

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
get millimeters it gives us 2159

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.070 
get millimeters it gives us 2159
millimeters<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.060> need<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.270> enter<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.900> our

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
millimeters we need to enter that on our

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.980 
millimeters we need to enter that on our
bike<00:01:25.229> computer<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> Sigma<00:01:26.880> BC<00:01:27.270> 509

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990

button<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:33.030> three<00:01:33.270> seconds<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.650> use<00:01:34.799> a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
button for three seconds I like to use a

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.010 
button for three seconds I like to use a
pin<00:01:35.189> cap<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.700> do<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.689> let<00:01:36.810> me<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:36.990> that

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
pin cap to do that so let me do that

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.630 
pin cap to do that so let me do that
right<00:01:37.170> now<00:01:37.409> while<00:01:37.890> trying<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.369> hold<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
right now while trying to hold the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.300 
right now while trying to hold the
camera<00:01:38.880> somewhat<00:01:39.540> steady<00:01:39.930> hold<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.070> down

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310

you know I mount it on there I actually
just<00:03:50.940> use<00:03:51.240> some<00:03:51.860> electrical<00:03:52.860> tape<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.400> wrap

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
just use some electrical tape and I wrap

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.060 
just use some electrical tape and I wrap
it<00:03:53.670> around<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:55.110> interface<00:03:55.350> of<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.830> bike
