00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.989
 Hello everyone, everyone too 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.570
 show them from this video is live 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.260
 what 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.660
 that unix mystery or to say it of a 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.010
 different mode 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.010
 tunick is triple to 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.400
 I make this video live at least from 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.880
 the message because the same tonic no longer 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.880
 reappeared 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.320
 I do not know what happened to him 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.600
 the thing about this one 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.620
 I have received many comments from 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.620
 what 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.190
 this character does not exist that I 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.190
 feed all this is false 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.440
 to nobody that that message from the box 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.750
 red edit it in paint 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.900
 and I come to show you that that is not 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.900
 true 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.720
 to get started 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.870
 nothing more to see if this time it appears 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.610
 try this several times 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.980
 lying down 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.860
 let's hope so far 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.340
 medal sends I sent this message 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.340
 here 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.830
 I regret this is that we believe very 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.830
 beautiful 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.460
 it cost me a lot 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.880
 let's hope that 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.560
 of the desire to appear this character 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:13.010
 not like the other times that nothing 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.319
 well then to see the message she 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.280
 they sent me 1 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.280
 unknown 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.420
 well OK 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.670
 it always surprises me when there are messages 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.670
 of this type 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.680
 like as triple a 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:43.010
 send him something hello 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.010
 Hello 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.220
 all right 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.760
 good by itself and stop 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.860
 what I just appeared here 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.890
 when arriving of humorous denouncing me 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.430
 I kill by the 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:42.560
 and that's how I was blocked by almost 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.560
 all day that fell to me badly 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.280
 what we do many here to avoid 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.860
 censorship is to write words like 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.160
 part is thus separated 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:03.320
 well it came out I left a lot of the subject 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:05.780
 come here do not send that they give lag the one that 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.100
 is that it is processed by processing 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.100
 the teacher processing and nothing 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.690
 all right 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.690
 and let me go to your cube 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.180
 can not hear not even the 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.980
 pet that always appears on the ball 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.980
 it's a mascot of blacks 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.810
 do not 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.880
 nothing 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.419
 ok let's try this 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.860
 pedrito will be removed from your list 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.860
 little friends, you're sure 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.550
 pedrito 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.900
 a little laughs where 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:07.650
 and then the example could be 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.870
 the lightning x 300 will be removed from 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:14.150
 tourists is safe in the other appears 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.150
 your friend list is safe 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.009
 A Little bit weird 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:26.479
 just look for triple-a and it does not appear 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.479
 you do not see the list of friends 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.380
 that was short 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.600
 this to sufficient proof that that 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.890
 message what seems to one if there is 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.160
 so they are not saying in their 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.160
 comments 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.180
 go I want
