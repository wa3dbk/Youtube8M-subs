00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.049 
his design I'll put a link in the
description<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.649> his<00:00:52.800> video<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.579> actually<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
description to his video is actually a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.389 
description to his video is actually a
bit<00:00:54.210> more<00:00:54.320> resource<00:00:55.320> friendly<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.219> you

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
bit more resource friendly but just you

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.490 
bit more resource friendly but just you
to<00:00:56.670> show<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:56.969> how<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.420> works<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.140> sort<00:00:58.410> of

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
to show you how it works this is sort of

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.260 
to show you how it works this is sort of
the<00:00:59.010> concept<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.699> got<00:00:59.820> three<00:00:59.940> sticky

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the concept so you got three sticky

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.990 
the concept so you got three sticky
pistons<00:01:00.780> I'm<00:01:01.350> using<00:01:01.559> glowstone<00:01:02.489> because<00:01:02.820> it's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
pistons I'm using glowstone because it's

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.119 
pistons I'm using glowstone because it's
a<00:01:03.180> transparent<00:01:04.110> block<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.650> could<00:01:04.769> also<00:01:04.890> use

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
a transparent block you could also use

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.300 
a transparent block you could also use
an<00:01:05.250> upside<00:01:05.610> down<00:01:05.640> stairs<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.780> want<00:01:07.310> and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
an upside down stairs if you want and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.130 
an upside down stairs if you want and
because<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.970> glowstone<00:01:09.450> above<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.900> chest

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
because of the glowstone above the chest

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.510 
because of the glowstone above the chest
you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.650> actually<00:01:10.799> access<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.880> with<00:01:12.810> glass

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
you can actually access it with glass

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.260 
you can actually access it with glass
then<00:01:14.720> moving<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:16.700> this<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.759> actually<00:01:17.970> designed

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
then moving on this is actually designed

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.960 
then moving on this is actually designed
that<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:19.290> did<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:20.130> sent<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.549> me<00:01:20.700> but

that that did not get sent to me but

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.320 
that that did not get sent to me but
YouTube<00:01:21.840> actually<00:01:22.259> sort<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.180> suggested<00:01:24.180> me<00:01:24.299> to

wall<00:01:35.280> metal<00:01:36.090> portal<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> uses<00:01:37.409> simpler

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
wall metal portal now it uses simpler

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.069 
wall metal portal now it uses simpler
mechanics<00:01:38.430> as<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.880> ultimate<00:01:39.270> nether<00:01:39.720> portal

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
mechanics as the ultimate nether portal

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.490 
mechanics as the ultimate nether portal
that<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.310> posted<00:01:41.310> meaning<00:01:42.180> we<00:01:42.329> got<00:01:42.509> dispenser

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that I posted meaning we got dispenser

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.130

with water and we got the dispenser with

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.050 
with water and we got the dispenser with
final<00:01:46.140> charges<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:47.250> full<00:01:47.549> flush<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
final charges but full flush with the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.240 
final charges but full flush with the
wall<00:01:48.210> thing<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> way<00:01:49.259> she<00:01:49.590> wired<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.130> up

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
wall thing and the way she wired it up

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.350 
wall thing and the way she wired it up
because<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.790> person<00:01:51.030> who<00:01:51.270> made<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.600> girl

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
because the person who made this girl

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.399 
because the person who made this girl
thing<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.600> don't<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:55.170> there's<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.350> lot

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.150 
designs
very<00:02:13.980> compact<00:02:14.340> very<00:02:14.910> well<00:02:15.180> wired<00:02:15.750> up<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.260> tried

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
very compact very well wired up I tried

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.960 
very compact very well wired up I tried
to<00:02:17.310> improve<00:02:17.580> it

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
to improve it

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.040 
to improve it
I<00:02:18.000> must<00:02:18.270> admit<00:02:18.420> but<00:02:19.970> can't<00:02:20.970> really<00:02:21.120> get<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.510> any

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
I must admit but can't really get it any

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.000 
I must admit but can't really get it any
better<00:02:22.290> than<00:02:22.590> this

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
better than this

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.040 
better than this
and<00:02:23.520> that's<00:02:24.030> also<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.360> reason<00:02:24.720> why<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.870> don't

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
and that's also the reason why I don't

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.660 
and that's also the reason why I don't
really<00:02:25.470> want<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.650> get<00:02:25.800> into<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.070> tutorial

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
really want to get into a tutorial

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.940 
really want to get into a tutorial
because<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.970> tutorial<00:02:27.390> she<00:02:27.630> did<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:28.080> really

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
because the tutorial she did is really

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.530 
because the tutorial she did is really
really<00:02:29.130> good<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.910> really<00:02:29.940> don't<00:02:30.390> think

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
really good and I really don't think

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.140 
really good and I really don't think
