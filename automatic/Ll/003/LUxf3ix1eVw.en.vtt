00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.389 

you<00:00:01.170> know<00:00:01.380> there's<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.620> new<00:00:01.770> live<00:00:01.979> moose<00:00:02.190> out

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
you know there's a new live moose out

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.860 
you know there's a new live moose out
this<00:00:02.639> year<00:00:02.879> which<00:00:03.090> competes<00:00:03.480> against<00:00:03.720> this

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
this year which competes against this

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.019 
this year which competes against this
thing<00:00:04.110> but<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:05.190> think<00:00:05.580> there's<00:00:05.790> still<00:00:05.970> some

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
thing but I think there's still some

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:38.400 
thing but I think there's still some
life<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.569> this<00:00:06.660> calorie

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.290 

you

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:01:14.800 

you

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.210 

we've<00:01:15.409> got<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.560> machine<00:01:15.650> that<00:01:15.950> goes<00:01:16.040> around

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
we've got a machine that goes around

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.899 
we've got a machine that goes around
corners<00:01:16.729> really<00:01:17.510> smooth<00:01:18.159> docile<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:19.520> then

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
corners really smooth docile and then

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.510 
corners really smooth docile and then
really<00:01:20.479> bitchin<00:01:20.900> fast<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.159> I<00:01:22.190> think<00:01:22.369> this

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
really bitchin fast so I think this

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.399 
really bitchin fast so I think this
thing<00:01:22.729> is<00:01:22.760> going<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.090> be<00:01:23.270> giving<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.080> Hayabusa

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
thing is going to be giving the Hayabusa

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.710 
thing is going to be giving the Hayabusa
a<00:01:24.799> good<00:01:25.070> run<00:01:25.250> for<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.460> money<00:01:25.549> and<00:01:25.880> can't<00:01:26.570> wait

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
a good run for the money and can't wait

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.850 
a good run for the money and can't wait
to<00:01:26.810> get<00:01:26.930> two<00:01:27.110> of<00:01:27.140> them<00:01:27.320> together<00:01:27.440> for<00:01:27.799> a

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
to get two of them together for a

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:44.859 
to get two of them together for a
shootout

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.510 

we<00:01:45.869> don't<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.140> bring<00:01:46.319> the<00:01:46.409> creek<00:01:46.679> life<00:01:46.890> if<00:01:47.280> you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
we don't you bring the creek life if you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.370 
we don't you bring the creek life if you
had<00:01:47.640> 3000<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.359> got<00:01:48.479> 3,500<00:01:49.289> rpm

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:18.380 

driving<00:01:55.100> it<00:01:55.189> out<00:01:55.310> you

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.149 

10.1<00:02:19.390> seconds<00:02:19.840> it's<00:02:20.319> got<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.620> be<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.739> nine<00:02:20.980> in

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
10.1 seconds it's got to be a nine in

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.740 
10.1 seconds it's got to be a nine in
there<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:21.849> here's<00:02:22.150> what<00:02:22.299> I<00:02:22.359> think<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.629> is

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
there so here's what I think that is

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.140 
there so here's what I think that is
wrong<00:02:22.989> an<00:02:23.140> hour<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.620> didn't<00:02:24.370> have<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.670> pre-play

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
wrong an hour I didn't have the pre-play

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.789 
wrong an hour I didn't have the pre-play
all<00:02:25.329> gone<00:02:25.569> so<00:02:25.750> when<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:25.959> went<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.260> go<00:02:26.409> on<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.620> gas

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
all gone so when I went to go on the gas

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.740 
all gone so when I went to go on the gas
to<00:02:27.040> rebel<00:02:27.340> gamma<00:02:27.519> I<00:02:27.670> came<00:02:28.120> off<00:02:28.359> and<00:02:28.569> then<00:02:28.659> you

introduction of the 2008 Kawasaki zx10
guys<00:05:12.550> today<00:05:12.820> had<00:05:12.970> an<00:05:13.060> opportunity<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.570> try<00:05:14.320> the

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
guys today had an opportunity to try the

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.270 
guys today had an opportunity to try the
bike<00:05:14.560> out<00:05:14.710> in<00:05:14.740> a<00:05:14.860> couple<00:05:14.979> different

bike out in a couple different

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.710 
bike out in a couple different
situations<00:05:15.850> obviously<00:05:16.270> we're<00:05:16.389> here<00:05:16.479> on<00:05:16.630> the

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
situations obviously we're here on the

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.050 
situations obviously we're here on the
drag<00:05:16.900> strip<00:05:17.020> so<00:05:17.320> had<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:17.800> chance<00:05:18.100> to<00:05:18.340> ride<00:05:18.940> the

drag strip so had a chance to ride the

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.540 
drag strip so had a chance to ride the
bike<00:05:19.210> on<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.449> drag<00:05:19.630> ship<00:05:19.840> and<00:05:19.990> really<00:05:20.320> see<00:05:21.039> all

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
bike on the drag ship and really see all

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.740 
bike on the drag ship and really see all
the<00:05:21.820> revisions<00:05:22.030> we've<00:05:22.389> made<00:05:22.539> you<00:05:22.630> know<00:05:22.690> we

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
the revisions we've made you know we

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.719 
the revisions we've made you know we
brought<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:23.020> bike<00:05:23.169> out<00:05:23.380> first<00:05:23.620> in<00:05:23.770> 2006<00:05:24.580> they

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
brought the bike out first in 2006 they

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:25.860 
brought the bike out first in 2006 they
really<00:05:24.970> kind<00:05:25.060> of<00:05:25.150> blew<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.449> lid<00:05:25.570> off<00:05:25.630> the

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
really kind of blew the lid off the

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.650 
really kind of blew the lid off the
industry<00:05:26.259> in<00:05:26.349> terms<00:05:26.500> of<00:05:26.740> performance<00:05:27.509> we<00:05:28.509> went

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
industry in terms of performance we went

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.939 
industry in terms of performance we went
ahead<00:05:28.720> and<00:05:28.930> made<00:05:28.990> a<00:05:29.050> bunch<00:05:29.259> of<00:05:29.320> revisions<00:05:29.800> this

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
ahead and made a bunch of revisions this

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.950 
ahead and made a bunch of revisions this
year<00:05:30.160> focusing<00:05:30.820> on<00:05:30.970> three<00:05:31.150> aspects<00:05:31.630> of<00:05:31.750> engine

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
year focusing on three aspects of engine

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.629 
year focusing on three aspects of engine
performance<00:05:32.110> one<00:05:32.680> we<00:05:33.039> wanted<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.430> increase

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
performance one we wanted to increase

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.930 
performance one we wanted to increase
the<00:05:33.789> low-end<00:05:34.300> torque<00:05:34.830> and<00:05:35.830> power<00:05:35.860> feel<00:05:36.490> we

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
the low-end torque and power feel we

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.480 
the low-end torque and power feel we
also<00:05:37.060> want<00:05:37.330> to<00:05:37.389> increase<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.900> mid-range

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
also want to increase the mid-range

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.790 
also want to increase the mid-range
responsiveness<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:39.789> of<00:05:40.180> course<00:05:40.650> can't<00:05:41.650> talk

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
responsiveness and of course can't talk

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.529 
responsiveness and of course can't talk
about<00:05:41.919> the<00:05:42.130> zx-14<00:05:42.820> without<00:05:43.060> talking<00:05:43.360> about

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
about the zx-14 without talking about

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.270 
about the zx-14 without talking about
peak<00:05:43.840> horsepower<00:05:44.080> which<00:05:44.830> is<00:05:44.860> what<00:05:45.099> it<00:05:45.190> was

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
peak horsepower which is what it was

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.189 
peak horsepower which is what it was
known<00:05:45.460> for<00:05:45.699> so<00:05:46.150> we<00:05:46.270> also<00:05:46.419> went<00:05:46.690> ahead<00:05:46.780> and

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
known for so we also went ahead and

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.659 
known for so we also went ahead and
increase<00:05:47.770> the<00:05:47.889> peak<00:05:48.070> horsepower<00:05:48.250> on<00:05:48.580> the

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
increase the peak horsepower on the

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.810 
increase the peak horsepower on the
zx-14<00:05:49.270> for<00:05:49.449> 2008<00:05:50.190> went<00:05:51.190> about<00:05:51.340> this<00:05:51.520> a<00:05:51.550> couple

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
zx-14 for 2008 went about this a couple

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.610 
zx-14 for 2008 went about this a couple
different<00:05:51.940> ways<00:05:52.199> obviously<00:05:53.199> we<00:05:53.349> went<00:05:53.500> and

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
different ways obviously we went and

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.170 
different ways obviously we went and
changed<00:05:53.830> the<00:05:54.010> ECU<00:05:54.430> on<00:05:54.580> this<00:05:54.729> with<00:05:54.909> some<00:05:55.060> new

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
changed the ECU on this with some new

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.839 
changed the ECU on this with some new
mapping<00:05:55.389> that<00:05:56.220> made<00:05:57.220> some<00:05:57.550> of<00:05:57.639> the<00:05:57.699> other

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
mapping that made some of the other

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.810 
mapping that made some of the other
engine<00:05:58.210> changes<00:05:58.479> that<00:05:58.599> we<00:05:58.690> made<00:05:58.870> that's<00:05:59.820> we

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
engine changes that we made that's we

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.550 
engine changes that we made that's we
went<00:06:00.970> to<00:06:01.180> some<00:06:01.419> different<00:06:01.720> intake<00:06:02.020> porting<00:06:02.440> on

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
went to some different intake porting on

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.640 
went to some different intake porting on
the<00:06:02.889> motorcycle<00:06:03.610> as<00:06:03.729> well<00:06:04.449> as<00:06:04.659> revised

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
the motorcycle as well as revised

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.399 
the motorcycle as well as revised
injectors<00:06:06.310> the<00:06:07.210> header<00:06:07.539> connector<00:06:08.020> pipe<00:06:08.229> is

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
injectors the header connector pipe is

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:10.830 
injectors the header connector pipe is
also<00:06:08.500> about<00:06:08.800> 75%<00:06:09.610> larger<00:06:10.000> than<00:06:10.270> it<00:06:10.389> was<00:06:10.539> on<00:06:10.570> the

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
also about 75% larger than it was on the

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.339 
also about 75% larger than it was on the
O<00:06:10.870> 6<00:06:11.199> in<00:06:11.349> the<00:06:11.409> O<00:06:11.440> 7<00:06:11.830> model<00:06:12.150> again<00:06:13.150> really<00:06:14.020> feeds

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
O 6 in the O 7 model again really feeds

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.620 
O 6 in the O 7 model again really feeds
in<00:06:14.620> and<00:06:14.800> improves<00:06:15.190> that<00:06:15.490> low-end<00:06:16.150> performance

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
in and improves that low-end performance

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.010 
in and improves that low-end performance
of<00:06:16.750> the<00:06:16.810> new<00:06:16.900> zx-14<00:06:18.120> for<00:06:19.120> Kawasaki<00:06:19.270> I'm<00:06:19.870> Russ

2008 sees the emergence of a new

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.219 
2008 sees the emergence of a new
Hayabusa<00:06:36.800> kind<00:06:37.580> of<00:06:37.699> leaving<00:06:37.849> the<00:06:38.120> zx-14<00:06:38.960> into

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
Hayabusa kind of leaving the zx-14 into

Hayabusa kind of leaving the zx-14 into
the<00:06:39.319> shadows<00:06:39.710> or<00:06:40.159> maybe<00:06:40.610> not<00:06:40.849> because<00:06:41.599> we<00:06:41.840> just
