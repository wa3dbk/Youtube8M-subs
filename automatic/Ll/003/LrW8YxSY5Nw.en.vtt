 LONG TIME THE END EXISTS ... 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 I can not wait to go home 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.100

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.100

 It's a new biome? 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.200
 I'm confused, where are the trees? 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Ok, that's enough! 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.100
 What is happening here 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.000
 How did it happen?! 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 There must be an explanation ... 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.100
 No, wait, do not do it! 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.100
 It's time to come home 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.000

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.000

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 Notch, you have to help us! 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.300
 There are monsters everywhere! 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.000
 They destroy our world! Why not give them their own world? 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 In this way, the enderman and the dragons will not destroy our world! 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
