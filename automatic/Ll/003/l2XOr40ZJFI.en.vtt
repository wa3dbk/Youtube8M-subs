00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.380
 Hello, Vyacheslav Slobodchuk 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.970
 Photoshop channel online 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.040
 and our mysterious operator artem 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.139
 the aperture which today does not work in 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:16.360
 quality smoke machine but however 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:20.380
 present here seems so today 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.140
 it will be about 1 fichechki which usually 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.980
 consider aerobatics 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.660
 photographing at least 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.390
 lovers are about using manual mode 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.680
 m mode which is right here on this 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.960
 rotary disks are designated by letter m 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.399
 usually on camera 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.550
 in this manual mode you can set 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.840
 any parameters you need and in 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.940
 Basically, this would all be great. 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.070
 if you knew exactly which parameters 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.730
 you need in this case usually 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.800
 most 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.960
 it either doesn't bother or just 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.930
 afraid to use it and now I 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.739
 tell you how it is very simple and easy 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.850
 put yourself in the service 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:00.730
 I'll use this technique almost 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.280
 always something and I wish you in principle what 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.780
 need from photos first of all as 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.549
 minimum photo must be 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.380
 normal exposed ie she 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.570
 should not be too light and not 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.600
 everything else should be too dark 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.950
 already for the second time even if it is very 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.290
 sharp or vice versa there will be very 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.689
 softly sweeping the size of the background or will be there 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.479
 beautiful some 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.979
 the shag in the frame it all loses its 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.720
 the meaning is all secondary if she herself 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.210
 the photo is too dark or vice versa 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.490
 too light knocked out therefore the most 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.920
 the main thing is the first thing we need is 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.450
 to have a normal exposure but 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.119
 when you use automatic 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.960
 camera mode camera selects god 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.869
 what news is he 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.479
 they are firstly controlled by some 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.100
 considerations of design engineers in 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.050
 secondly they are very strong unstable 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.220
 because the slightest change in 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.530
 illumination 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.150
 scenes that is you are shooting for example 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.670
 something in the forest you were there the wind blew 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.040
 the leaves parted became a little lighter 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.520
 you parameters have changed you click on 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.759
 a button 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.040
 leaves you already have converged situation again 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.479
 changed photos turned out dark 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.159
 or vice versa there may be light 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.190
 so that you always get 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.110
 stable and predictable results in 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.140
 first secondly so you understand why 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.940
 It is necessary and it is very necessary, we 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.489
 doing this first shots you always 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.320
 can do on the machine either in 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.420
 green mode or in some kind there 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.120
 from creative modes either fell automat 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.120
 in priority priority mode priority 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.680
 aperture and something else you still have you 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.209
 do in the first frame is best 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.209
 Of course for this use mode Fri 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.819
 then he saw the most so 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.580
 convenient in mode by you doing some 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.530
 trial frame and then look at this 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.190
 snapshot if this snapshot 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.780
 you are quite satisfied then you just then 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.690
 on the display, see what parameters 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.450
 brought the camera for this shot 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:58.250
 for example there the diaphragm let's say it was there 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:02.110
 6 1 6 3 or rather there is a single exposure 200 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.880
 seconds you go to m mode 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.890
 set the same parameters in this 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.690
 wheels and take a few shots with 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.160
 different angles and you will always have 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.920
 you will not have a stable result 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.870
 no change from that 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.610
 probably there something has changed 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.380
 not in the frame still plays what role 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.120
 which option x expo metering using 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.680
 Now you need this camera too 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.890
 think if you don't know about it in 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.950
 m mode you can forget about it and not 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.540
 bother with it so repeat 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:39.000
 you make one trial frame in n mode 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.460
 then look at the display 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.720
 parameters you chose the camera as well 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.480
 minimum shutter speed and aperture 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.190
 go to mode for and put these 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.350
 the most parameters and do as much as you want 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.970
 Frame, you always frame exposure 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.810
 will be the same always you are enough 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.250
 light or there is enough dark frame 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.730
 second option when you did a trial 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.630
 the frame and the camera you on the Urals something 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.280
 somehow measured wrong 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.070
 the photo was either too 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.140
 too light or too dark you 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.060
 Again, see Take a picture 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.920
 on the display, see what shutter speed and 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.840
 what aperture was for this frame and 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.670
 just to fix the situation 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.440
 choose a slightly longer shutter speed 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.170
 for example if photos happened 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.290
 too dark or open up there and 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.450
 aperture wider or can do 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.370
 slightly increase exposure and increase 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.070
 excerpt and slightly open 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.320
 aperture or vice versa if you have 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.960
 the photo turned out too light you 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.540
 clamp aperture a little bit or 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.690
 do shorten shutter speed do more 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.820
 one trial frame mode if all 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.730
 ok you already do okay shots with 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.440
 these parameters in the snapshot mode 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.230
 still too light too too 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.110
 dark you still slightly change 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.850
 shutter speed and aperture and try again 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.740
 than good such an option we always you 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.280
 will bring more stable predictable 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.200
 results 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.200
 when you finally got normal 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.080
 you have already planned frame in m mode 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.350
 This mode of exposure will be constantly 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.870
 you can always here for this story 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.380
 take as many pictures as you like 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.450
 which one 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.700
 what is the metering system now 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.660
 it doesn't matter how they change 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.210
 lighting conditions 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.550
 do you have a common say frame exposure 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.000
 will always be the same 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:27.290
 here look another snapshot here 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.150
 example this is a shot against the window the most 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.760
 difficult option you have a camera in 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.820
 such conditions can with a very large 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.420
 likely to score in the exposure and if 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:41.090
 you need a bright window and well-developed 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.390
 dark plan you use this option 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.550
 if you need to work the opposite 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.100
 light plan outside the window and some silhouettes 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.720
 on the dark window again you use 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.870
 this option this option you 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.540
 guarantees maximum and predictable 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.470
 and as close as possible to what you 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.460
 expect the results that's all 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.320
 until new meetings with you was vyacheslav 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.470
 weakly than she photo crowd oh yes 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:09.170
