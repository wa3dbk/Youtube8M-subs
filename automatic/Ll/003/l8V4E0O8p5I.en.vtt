00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.860
 Hello everyone today with us 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.860
 little package wrapped I have a knife but 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.550
 it's already open because it's just 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.990
 links they are not track numbers and I opened 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.160
 to put that here all the same 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.989
 come let's show you this interesting 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.960
 thing 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:42.309
 cheap it's here with us 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:48.440
 mini lens for mobile phone 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:50.690
 worth this lens dollar 1 dollar so 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.420
 let's see here that we have 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.309
 is picking 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:03.619
 that's what it seems like sometime 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:07.180
 I was so still and let the bag have 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.180
 we only get one lens 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:15.700
 here is such 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.939
 this is how it is with us 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.860
 Wait 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:24.260
 on honda beat releases 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.260
 this is all done 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.689
 blamed yes now twist 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.710
 so the lid on us is classic on us 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:46.190
 no characteristics like this 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.990
 give it to the wide-angle 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.040
 wide and macro is 2 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.820
 probably here and now this place is a bag 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.880
 how well, how convenient just took put 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.040
 a little bit got the author but let's do it right away 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.000
 we test something and here such 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:10.619
 fasteners are we on the one hand from here 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.130
 Well, so he fastens on us and a 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.920
 here it is with us as my soft gum for 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.060
 order to draw on the screen 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.040
 let's see how it is at all 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.489
 test it and it's all back and e 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.140
 dts and i.e. whose dm is not a bad camera 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:35.220
 so the whole print because the glass 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.560
 dota take a picture of our knife now we 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.560
 let's do it on ordinary cameras 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.050
 so take 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.350
 but here's a picture of us 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.810
 and I spent there anything else 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.590
 here is a little bit like this 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.590
 everything looks 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.549
 and now we 'll do it now 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:29.010
 will block 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:35.290
 and on the chain im here it is like this on camera 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:38.400
 so here we need so here so we 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.400
 let's get a look 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:48.480
 so that means 3 now but the only thing 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.610
 that I immediately like what we have here 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.760
 that is, under this phone pretty 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.620
 large lens and accordingly not here 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.400
 these are the margin of the minimum 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:05.940
 virtually none 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.940
 I clean this here and here yes you and 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:16.180
 now put these translations see 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.630
 see yes you can see the difference that let's 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:27.400
 let's make flash now turn off flash 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:30.000
 here is such a yellow model so new here 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.210
 our flash 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.250
 but not but of course here 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.890
 no matter why death cost you 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.510
 it seemed that after all the angle is wide 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:48.340
 here there is so now let's 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:55.440
 try it carefully this is quick 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.440
 grown let's try macro photography 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:03.370
 macro shooting this we remove and let's 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:06.210
 cap and photograph so procedure 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.210
 the same 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.159
 crayfish 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.800
 went there 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.010
 I don't like macro very much 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.010
 takes off 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:09.870
 do you know macro? 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.939
 miss out 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.800
 why not so much because here I am 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:19.330
 made a macro on your lens 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:22.270
 you see what you give 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.050
 and so everything is clearly visible without any 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.870
 lenses 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:29.159
 that is, the conclusion what it means here with us 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.300
 we have two lenses here 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:34.240
 macro lens honestly not 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:37.389
 impressed by this quite good 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.900
 among wide angle or else people 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:42.840
 call the ball for something used 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.969
 of course it is used for 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:49.259
 photographing some big ones 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:52.330
 here are the spaces where volume is felt 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:54.759
 some kind of building that yours can't 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.689
 lens and you have to go far there 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:59.879
 so he got you put on this here 

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:04.000
 they took pictures of her 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:06.639
 I'll try you have promised these were 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.759
 I already have a set of 3 lenses on there they are 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:12.370
 bad were than because they were for 

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:16.300
 iphone and when i had them then he was still 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:19.889
 quieter quieter 1 thl w200 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:23.889
 it means there was but decently this one 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:27.639
 matrix and accordingly when I wore 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:29.589
 these lenses then I have here in the corners here 

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:31.300
 were black it was not beautiful here 

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:33.909
 it is practically not so here it is 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.830
 It will be much better so I will try 

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:38.560
