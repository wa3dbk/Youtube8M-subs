00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:08.099
 well I'm going to start with a 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.990
 cardboard and this card I do not 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.179
 I do not serve for that of measures and three 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.269
 centimeters and things like that I just grab 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.029
 a chunk and a lot and peak as I get 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.050
 right crooked is worth and then of this 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.660
 shiver I'm going to leave to say that a 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.029
 halves of chubs I will not grab I'll 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.410
 decorate and I'm going to cut a little bit and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.060
 successively 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.100
 so I am very bad without a 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.390
 I'm going to make a stroke here 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:41.530
 to make a kind of number 3 as with 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.820
 bangs did not see her now so no 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:49.900
 it's the great science these are told as 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:53.470
 kind to one side and well I'm going to 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.230
 cut no matter what cuts by 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.379
 inside out by the stroke as 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.230
 when you put it as it opens it is not going to 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.270
 see absolutely nothing and if you have there 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.610
 white yellow with which you have 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.590
 trace and then it comes 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:14.619
 that easy of science itself I already 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:16.869
 we have a butterfly now I'm going to do 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.360
 another stroke different from above equal 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:23.850
 as if it was 3 and below I'm going to 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.850
 pull as if they were 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.950
 parenthesis 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:34.180
 I do not remember what these are called 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.930
 conceptual map there's the truth I do not 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.790
 agreement but good I would have him if equal 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.980
 same again I am the same again I return to 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.540
 cut and in which otherwise this 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.540
 different contracts 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.440
 to 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.780
 well here I'm going to fold a bit a 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.600
 little bit bigger and I'm going to make another 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.610
 different butterflies and I followed 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.960
 seeing as it has to come out of butterflies 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.720
 says how I got on doing the stroke 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.360
 to these butterflies obvious then it's not going 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.330
 to be the best perfect but 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.010
 you can make it look your best 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.120
 possible 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.920
 when you are exporting more and well 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.350
 remember that this is a very good idea 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.370
 to decorate your room does not matter 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.590
 that you are single or that you are chavita or 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.170
 that is already greater does not matter here what 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.230
 what matters is that you have wishes 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.020
 that your room looks different 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.060
 but without spending so much cardboard I 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.180
 cost five Mexican pesos are more or 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.720
 least do not be half a dollar a little 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.540
 less than half a dollar 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.310
 nothing is intrinsically that you have a 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.080
 time to sit down and be able to do 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.800
 these things because the truth if you 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.960
 They take quite some time but I'll give it back 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.170
 to repeat being super economic comes 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.230
 nothing else how is it and they are doing it 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.750
 It depends on how big or want 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.990
 girls are cutting their little bit and they're going 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.990
 tracing 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.080
 remember that you must paste them with 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.120
 cold silicone so they do not fall off and if 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.460
 you want them to remove or relocate it 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.130
 you can do without damaging your paint 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.160
 wall without damaging the butterfly 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.440
 I made this black daiichi and it's going to be 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.690
 but I did it because a cousin told me 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.630
 that this where I bought them I say no me 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.820
 I did them and I did them and several told me 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.030
 in instagram that the elda did and 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.830
 that will teach them how it was and well 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.420
 from me it is all I hope it serves you 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.420
 the idea Take care bye
