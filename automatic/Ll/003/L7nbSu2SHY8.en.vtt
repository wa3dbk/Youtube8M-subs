pretty good i did go to the badlands
which<00:00:30.859> isn't<00:00:31.099> a<00:00:31.160> particularly<00:00:31.640> demanding

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
which isn't a particularly demanding

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.630 
which isn't a particularly demanding
area<00:00:32.599> but<00:00:33.380> it<00:00:33.740> looks<00:00:33.950> pretty<00:00:34.070> good<00:00:34.340> it's

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
area but it looks pretty good it's

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.790 
area but it looks pretty good it's
pretty<00:00:34.850> decent<00:00:35.000> I<00:00:35.390> mean<00:00:36.230> it's<00:00:36.380> not<00:00:36.470> quite<00:00:36.740> up

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
pretty decent I mean it's not quite up

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.980 
pretty decent I mean it's not quite up
there<00:00:36.830> with<00:00:37.160> my<00:00:37.370> windows<00:00:37.730> pc<00:00:38.210> but<00:00:38.390> it's<00:00:38.810> pretty

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990 
there with my windows pc but it's pretty

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.840 
there with my windows pc but it's pretty
good<00:00:39.200> but<00:00:39.260> that<00:00:39.410> brings<00:00:39.590> me<00:00:39.890> to<00:00:40.100> my<00:00:40.250> point<00:00:40.280> and

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
good but that brings me to my point and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.750 
good but that brings me to my point and
it's<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:41.690> thing<00:00:41.930> whenever<00:00:42.200> Apple<00:00:42.920> introduced

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
it's the thing whenever Apple introduced

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.090 
it's the thing whenever Apple introduced
a<00:00:44.000> new<00:00:44.450> operating<00:00:44.960> system<00:00:45.170> they<00:00:45.650> introduce<00:00:46.070> a

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
a new operating system they introduce a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.700 
a new operating system they introduce a
few<00:00:46.550> cool<00:00:47.180> new<00:00:47.390> features<00:00:47.900> but<00:00:48.320> there's<00:00:48.530> never

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
few cool new features but there's never

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.150 
few cool new features but there's never
ever<00:00:49.070> a<00:00:49.370> big<00:00:50.090> reason<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:51.260> upgrade<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:51.860> know<00:00:51.950> I

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
ever a big reason to upgrade you know I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.970 
ever a big reason to upgrade you know I
very<00:00:52.970> rarely<00:00:53.060> see<00:00:53.990> something<00:00:54.500> that<00:00:54.620> means<00:00:54.860> oh

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
very rarely see something that means oh

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.410 
very rarely see something that means oh
I've<00:00:55.190> got<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:55.520> have<00:00:55.700> it<00:00:55.730> I've<00:00:55.910> got<00:00:55.940> to<00:00:56.240> have<00:00:56.390> it

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
I've got to have it I've got to have it

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.660 
I've got to have it I've got to have it
it<00:00:56.690> is<00:00:56.930> cool<00:00:57.200> to<00:00:57.260> have<00:00:57.590> a<00:00:57.620> new<00:00:57.920> UI<00:00:58.130> because

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
it is cool to have a new UI because

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.550 
it is cool to have a new UI because
although<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.180> skeuomorphic<00:00:59.990> look<00:01:00.320> of

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
although the skeuomorphic look of

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.460 
although the skeuomorphic look of
leopard<00:01:01.130> was<00:01:01.580> pretty<00:01:02.150> awesome<00:01:02.330> it<00:01:02.900> is<00:01:03.170> a<00:01:03.200> bit

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
leopard was pretty awesome it is a bit

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.990 
leopard was pretty awesome it is a bit
long<00:01:03.590> in<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:03.770> tooth<00:01:03.860> buyers<00:01:04.250> points<00:01:04.699> so<00:01:04.850> it's

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
long in the tooth buyers points so it's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.330 
long in the tooth buyers points so it's
nice<00:01:05.269> to<00:01:05.390> see<00:01:05.539> something<00:01:05.810> refreshing<00:01:06.340> albeit

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
nice to see something refreshing albeit

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.779 
nice to see something refreshing albeit
a<00:01:07.369> little<00:01:07.579> flat<00:01:08.859> and<00:01:09.859> also<00:01:10.039> it's<00:01:10.310> nice<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.640> have

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
a little flat and also it's nice to have

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.529 
a little flat and also it's nice to have
increased<00:01:11.509> integration<00:01:12.140> with<00:01:12.259> iOS<00:01:12.979> devices

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
increased integration with iOS devices

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.270 
increased integration with iOS devices
but<00:01:14.539> there's<00:01:14.719> not<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.109> big<00:01:15.530> selling<00:01:15.920> point<00:01:16.130> and

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
but there's not a big selling point and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.760 
but there's not a big selling point and
I<00:01:16.579> think<00:01:16.789> Apple<00:01:17.719> should<00:01:17.960> really<00:01:18.350> start<00:01:18.619> to

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
I think Apple should really start to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.160 
I think Apple should really start to
focus<00:01:18.979> on<00:01:19.340> improving<00:01:19.579> their<00:01:20.299> gaming<00:01:20.630> side<00:01:21.020> of

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
focus on improving their gaming side of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.169 
focus on improving their gaming side of
things<00:01:21.289> and<00:01:21.679> I<00:01:21.799> think<00:01:22.070> people<00:01:22.159> might<00:01:22.429> say<00:01:22.640> well

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
things and I think people might say well

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:25.719 
things and I think people might say well
Apple<00:01:23.990> want<00:01:24.170> for<00:01:24.740> gamers<00:01:25.340> there<00:01:25.549> for

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
Apple want for gamers there for

Apple want for gamers there for
professionals<00:01:26.299> well<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.630> thing<00:01:26.810> is<00:01:26.840> if<00:01:27.109> you

look at their iPhones their iOS devices

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.690 
look at their iPhones their iOS devices
one<00:01:30.259> of<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.560> biggest<00:01:30.799> selling<00:01:31.159> points<00:01:31.490> for

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
one of the biggest selling points for

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.819 
one of the biggest selling points for
those<00:01:31.850> things<00:01:32.119> is<00:01:32.329> the<00:01:32.509> app<00:01:32.630> store<00:01:32.659> I<00:01:33.109> mean

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
those things is the app store I mean

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.340 
those things is the app store I mean
your<00:01:33.979> iPod<00:01:34.310> Touch<00:01:34.609> really<00:01:35.329> thrives<00:01:35.689> on<00:01:36.259> the

your iPod Touch really thrives on the

your iPod Touch really thrives on the
App<00:01:36.469> Store<00:01:36.499> and<00:01:36.950> it's<00:01:37.700> just<00:01:37.969> the<00:01:38.060> mac<00:01:38.240> app

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
App Store and it's just the mac app

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.440 
App Store and it's just the mac app

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
store in the mac app store in comparison

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.179 
store in the mac app store in comparison
to<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.659> iOS<00:01:41.990> App<00:01:42.170> Store<00:01:42.439> is<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.590> joke<00:01:42.829> it<00:01:42.979> just

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
to the iOS App Store is a joke it just

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.870 
to the iOS App Store is a joke it just
is<00:01:43.340> we<00:01:43.969> get<00:01:44.240> games<00:01:44.539> later<00:01:44.929> on<00:01:45.289> if<00:01:46.009> ever<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:46.819> is

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
is we get games later on if ever it is

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.029 
is we get games later on if ever it is
so<00:01:47.479> that's<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.139> thing<00:01:48.319> that's<00:01:48.469> and<00:01:48.710> it's

if they pull something like that in then
so<00:02:03.289> many<00:02:03.530> people<00:02:03.950> would<00:02:04.069> choose<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.399> buy<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.700> mac

Mavericks to Yosemite they're saying I

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.600 
Mavericks to Yosemite they're saying I
think<00:02:52.930> one<00:02:53.260> guy<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.500> went<00:02:53.680> as<00:02:53.830> far<00:02:54.010> as<00:02:54.070> to<00:02:54.190> say<00:02:54.459> he

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
went from 120 frames per second to 20

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.270 
went from 120 frames per second to 20
and<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:58.270> problem<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.750> because<00:02:58.990> max<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.160> know

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
and the problem is because max you know

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.740 
and the problem is because max you know
they're<00:03:00.430> in<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.580> minority<00:03:00.700> because<00:03:01.240> only

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
they're in the minority because only

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.949 
they're in the minority because only
Apple<00:03:02.580> manufacturer<00:03:03.580> machines<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.209> run<00:03:04.270> mac

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
Apple manufacturer machines that run mac

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.780 
Apple manufacturer machines that run mac
OS<00:03:05.290> whereas<00:03:06.040> there<00:03:06.070> are<00:03:06.250> several

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
OS whereas there are several

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.550 
OS whereas there are several
manufacturers<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.690> make<00:03:07.840> Windows<00:03:08.170> machines

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
manufacturers to make Windows machines

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.470 
manufacturers to make Windows machines
so<00:03:09.100> naturally<00:03:09.880> they're<00:03:10.180> in<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.360> minority

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
so naturally they're in the minority

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.470 
so naturally they're in the minority
that<00:03:11.020> means<00:03:11.830> that<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.280> software<00:03:12.850> update<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.270> fix

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
that means that a software update to fix

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.390 
that means that a software update to fix
those<00:03:13.720> problems<00:03:13.780> is<00:03:14.380> going<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.100> come<00:03:15.280> about

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
those problems is going to come about

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.120 
those problems is going to come about
much<00:03:16.180> slower<00:03:16.510> if<00:03:16.870> ever<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.590> that's<00:03:17.860> something

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
much slower if ever and that's something

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.759 
much slower if ever and that's something
that's<00:03:18.400> very<00:03:18.550> frustrating<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:20.230> when<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:20.500> made

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
that's very frustrating so when I made

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.740 
that's very frustrating so when I made
that<00:03:20.800> original<00:03:21.400> video<00:03:21.519> our<00:03:21.940> max<00:03:22.300> good<00:03:22.540> for

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
that original video our max good for

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.840 
that original video our max good for
gaming<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:23.170> remember<00:03:23.530> saying<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:24.100> there<00:03:24.670> was

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
gaming I remember saying that there was

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.640 
gaming I remember saying that there was
great<00:03:25.180> potential<00:03:25.780> but<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.019> really<00:03:26.290> needs<00:03:26.560> to

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
great potential but it really needs to

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.949 
great potential but it really needs to
be<00:03:26.800> fulfilled<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.370> apple<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.450> develop<00:03:28.840> those

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959

think tomb raider is probably one of the
best<00:03:38.560> games<00:03:38.830> you<00:03:39.100> can<00:03:39.190> get<00:03:39.310> for<00:03:39.489> mac<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:39.670> it

are<00:03:42.130> gems<00:03:42.430> available<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.540> thing<00:03:43.720> is<00:03:43.750> if

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
are gems available and the thing is if

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.590 
are gems available and the thing is if
you<00:03:44.110> took<00:03:44.380> Mac<00:03:44.830> outside<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.090> equation

you took Mac outside of the equation
just<00:03:46.750> considered<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.560> like<00:03:47.709> a<00:03:47.739> console<00:03:48.310> it

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
just considered it like a console it

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.610 
just considered it like a console it
actually<00:03:48.760> be<00:03:48.910> very<00:03:49.150> impressive<00:03:49.750> but<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.350> fact

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
actually be very impressive but the fact

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.400 
actually be very impressive but the fact
is<00:03:50.799> it's<00:03:51.790> very<00:03:52.209> difficult<00:03:52.420> not<00:03:52.870> to<00:03:52.900> look<00:03:53.170> at<00:03:53.320> it

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
is it's very difficult not to look at it

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.330 
is it's very difficult not to look at it
as<00:03:53.560> just<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.360> windows<00:03:55.360> pc<00:03:55.630> but<00:03:56.200> with<00:03:56.410> less<00:03:56.890> games

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340

available and a weaker performance

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.500 
available and a weaker performance
that's<00:03:59.709> it's<00:04:00.310> hard<00:04:00.610> not<00:04:00.820> to<00:04:00.940> look<00:04:01.030> at<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.360> that

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
that's it's hard not to look at it that

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.910 
that's it's hard not to look at it that
way<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:01.870> I<00:04:01.930> wish<00:04:02.110> it<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.410> know<00:04:02.500> I<00:04:02.530> wish<00:04:02.739> that

way and I wish it you know I wish that
wasn't<00:04:03.100> it<00:04:03.280> i<00:04:03.370> really<00:04:03.730> do<00:04:03.820> that's<00:04:04.060> why<00:04:04.180> I'm

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
wasn't it i really do that's why I'm

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.030 
wasn't it i really do that's why I'm
making<00:04:04.630> this<00:04:05.080> video<00:04:05.290> because<00:04:05.440> I<00:04:05.769> want<00:04:05.950> to

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
making this video because I want to

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.190 
making this video because I want to
express<00:04:06.310> my<00:04:06.400> concern<00:04:06.970> I'm<00:04:07.360> not<00:04:07.750> trying<00:04:07.930> to

express my concern I'm not trying to

express my concern I'm not trying to

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
attack Max and there are certainly good

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.199 
attack Max and there are certainly good
reasons<00:04:10.330> to<00:04:10.390> get<00:04:10.630> them<00:04:10.780> but<00:04:11.610> it<00:04:12.610> just<00:04:13.030> feels

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
reasons to get them but it just feels

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.360 
reasons to get them but it just feels
like<00:04:13.360> an<00:04:13.570> area<00:04:13.900> that<00:04:13.930> is<00:04:14.230> in<00:04:14.620> dire<00:04:14.950> need<00:04:15.010> of

for monsier we're going to get
developers<00:04:29.800> on<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.039> side<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:30.580> just<00:04:30.970> be<00:04:31.180> like

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
developers on the side I just be like

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.390 
developers on the side I just be like
I'd<00:04:31.780> be<00:04:32.020> willing<00:04:32.199> to<00:04:32.350> pay<00:04:32.650> for<00:04:32.680> that<00:04:32.979> I<00:04:33.160> think<00:04:33.250> a

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
I'd be willing to pay for that I think a

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.340 
I'd be willing to pay for that I think a
lot<00:04:33.520> of<00:04:33.550> people<00:04:33.610> would<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.150> plenty<00:04:34.810> of<00:04:34.990> people

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
lot of people would and plenty of people

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.830 
lot of people would and plenty of people
would<00:04:35.440> probably<00:04:35.620> think<00:04:35.949> well<00:04:36.669> I<00:04:36.699> was<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.180> little

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
would probably think well I was a little

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.480 
would probably think well I was a little
wary<00:04:38.080> of<00:04:38.199> getting<00:04:38.560> a<00:04:38.620> map<00:04:38.800> before<00:04:39.009> because<00:04:39.400> I'm

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
wary of getting a map before because I'm

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.360 
wary of getting a map before because I'm
a<00:04:39.520> big<00:04:39.759> gamer<00:04:40.000> but<00:04:40.210> now<00:04:40.419> but<00:04:41.110> now<00:04:41.169> I<00:04:41.740> I'm

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
a big gamer but now but now I I'm

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.890 
a big gamer but now but now I I'm
genuinely<00:04:42.699> thinking<00:04:43.150> about<00:04:43.300> getting<00:04:43.419> one<00:04:43.539> so

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
genuinely thinking about getting one so

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.570 
genuinely thinking about getting one so
I<00:04:43.930> think<00:04:44.080> Apple<00:04:44.590> could<00:04:44.740> actually<00:04:44.889> benefit<00:04:45.520> a

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
I think Apple could actually benefit a

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.360 
I think Apple could actually benefit a
lot<00:04:45.669> if<00:04:46.000> be<00:04:46.180> a<00:04:46.419> went<00:04:46.870> down<00:04:47.020> that<00:04:47.169> route<00:04:47.440> and<00:04:47.590> I

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
lot if be a went down that route and I

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.710 
lot if be a went down that route and I
don't<00:04:48.580> think<00:04:48.789> they<00:04:48.880> have<00:04:49.060> anything<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.479> worry

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
don't think they have anything to worry

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.570 
don't think they have anything to worry
about<00:04:49.810> with<00:04:50.319> off<00:04:50.800> professionals

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
about with off professionals

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.240 
about with off professionals
because<00:04:51.970> as<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:52.539> say<00:04:52.810> before<00:04:53.229> they've<00:04:54.069> had

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
because as I say before they've had

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.279 
because as I say before they've had
enormous<00:04:54.580> success<00:04:54.789> with<00:04:55.389> their<00:04:55.509> iOS<00:04:55.720> devices

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
enormous success with their iOS devices

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.050 
enormous success with their iOS devices
their<00:04:56.620> iphone<00:04:57.009> in<00:04:57.130> their<00:04:57.220> ipad<00:04:57.580> by

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
their iphone in their ipad by

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.210 
their iphone in their ipad by
introducing<00:04:58.720> games<00:04:58.990> i<00:04:59.139> mean<00:04:59.289> i<00:04:59.440> think<00:04:59.680> a<00:05:00.009> lot

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
introducing games i mean i think a lot

a difficult decision to make or you

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.820 
a difficult decision to make or you
