now<00:00:48.719> own<00:00:48.899> hle<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.469> mounting<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.100> 128<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.149> this

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
now own hle is mounting the 128 and this

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.869 
now own hle is mounting the 128 and this
is<00:00:51.510> generally<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.079> preferred<00:00:52.620> gun<00:00:53.160> among

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
is generally the preferred gun among

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.660 
is generally the preferred gun among
waffle<00:00:54.750> drivers<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.739> reason<00:00:56.010> why<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.250> it's

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
waffle drivers the reason why is it's

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.619 
waffle drivers the reason why is it's
better<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.510> almost<00:00:57.930> every<00:00:58.770> way<00:00:58.800> than<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.820> 150

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
better in almost every way than the 150

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.820 
better in almost every way than the 150
so<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.010> 150<00:01:02.640> has<00:01:02.850> an<00:01:03.090> intra<00:01:03.600> clip<00:01:03.989> reload<00:01:04.530> time

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
so the 150 has an intra clip reload time

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.130 
so the 150 has an intra clip reload time
of<00:01:05.040> three<00:01:05.250> seconds<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> 128<00:01:06.450> has<00:01:06.659> an<00:01:06.780> intro

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
of three seconds the 128 has an intro

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.160 
of three seconds the 128 has an intro
clip<00:01:07.350> reload<00:01:08.010> time<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.490> two<00:01:09.479> seconds<00:01:10.020> that

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
clip reload time of two seconds that

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.469 
clip reload time of two seconds that
means<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.680> throw<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.010> more<00:01:11.580> damage<00:01:12.030> very

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
means you can throw out more damage very

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.670 
means you can throw out more damage very
quickly<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:14.010> less<00:01:14.310> exposure<00:01:15.259> aim<00:01:16.259> time<00:01:16.619> is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
quickly with less exposure aim time is

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.700 
quickly with less exposure aim time is
better<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> 128<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.450> penetration<00:01:19.259> is

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
better on the 128 the penetration is

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.060 
better on the 128 the penetration is
better<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.610> 128<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:22.080> still<00:01:22.439> has<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> pretty

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
better on the 128 it still has a pretty

better on the 128 it still has a pretty
high<00:01:23.130> alpha<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.810> 560<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.110> since<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.590> only

high alpha of 560 and since you only

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.859 
high alpha of 560 and since you only

have a two second reload time between

have a two second reload time between
shots<00:01:28.500> you're<00:01:29.430> throwing<00:01:30.000> down<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> lot<00:01:30.600> of

shots you're throwing down a lot of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.770 
shots you're throwing down a lot of
damage<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.710> who<00:01:32.070> cares<00:01:32.310> about<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.780> 750

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.560 
damage it's who cares about the 750
damage<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.040> shot<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.640> 150<00:01:36.329> gives

damage that the shot of the 150 gives

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.920 
damage that the shot of the 150 gives
you<00:01:37.340> there's<00:01:38.340> also<00:01:38.579> greater<00:01:38.970> shell<00:01:39.299> velocity

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
you there's also greater shell velocity

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.469 
you there's also greater shell velocity
on<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.320> 128<00:01:41.070> much<00:01:41.460> better<00:01:41.729> shell<00:01:41.970> velocity

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
on the 128 much better shell velocity

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.560 
on the 128 much better shell velocity
which<00:01:42.720> helps<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.409> sniping<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.180> more

which helps in sniping and it's a more

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.380 
which helps in sniping and it's a more

and<00:02:12.130> there's<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.150> big<00:02:13.540> honkin<00:02:14.350> turret<00:02:14.740> on

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
and there's that big honkin turret on

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.730 
and there's that big honkin turret on
top<00:02:14.980> now<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:15.970> turret<00:02:16.569> has<00:02:16.810> another<00:02:17.319> problem

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
top now the turret has another problem

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.270 
top now the turret has another problem
in<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:19.330> armor<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.750> too<00:02:20.410> thin<00:02:20.830> so<00:02:21.040> it's

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
in that the armor is too thin so it's

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.580 
in that the armor is too thin so it's
only<00:02:21.430> about<00:02:21.610> 20<00:02:22.180> millimeters<00:02:22.750> thick<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.440> lot

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
only about 20 millimeters thick in a lot

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.100 
only about 20 millimeters thick in a lot
of<00:02:23.709> places<00:02:23.920> in<00:02:24.400> most<00:02:24.910> places<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.840> it's<00:02:25.959> going

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
of places in most places so it's going

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.260 
of places in most places so it's going
to<00:02:26.200> have<00:02:26.380> over<00:02:26.650> matching<00:02:27.190> problems<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.120> what

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
to have over matching problems and what

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.480 
to have over matching problems and what
over<00:02:28.570> matching<00:02:28.930> is<00:02:29.170> when<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.770> caliber<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.220> the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
over matching is when the caliber of the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.199 
over matching is when the caliber of the
shell<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:31.500> three<00:02:32.500> times<00:02:32.800> as<00:02:33.100> thick<00:02:33.610> as<00:02:33.850> the

shell is three times as thick as the

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.510 
shell is three times as thick as the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
armor that it hits that means it will

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.660 
armor that it hits that means it will
auto<00:02:36.850> penetrate<00:02:37.570> there<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:37.989> no<00:02:38.350> chance<00:02:38.709> for<00:02:39.430> a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
auto penetrate there is no chance for a

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.750 
auto penetrate there is no chance for a
ricochet<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.980> even<00:02:41.980> though<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.280> hull<00:02:42.489> armor

of the waffle is surprisingly strong

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.170 
of the waffle is surprisingly strong
it's<00:02:46.870> kind<00:02:47.020> of<00:02:47.050> like<00:02:47.170> an<00:02:47.350> amx<00:02:47.739> 50b<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.850> turret

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
it's kind of like an amx 50b the turret

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.690 
it's kind of like an amx 50b the turret
is<00:02:49.300> so<00:02:49.510> huge<00:02:49.840> who<00:02:50.080> cares<00:02:50.320> if<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.670> hole<00:02:51.670> is

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
is so huge who cares if the hole is

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.100 
is so huge who cares if the hole is
strong<00:02:52.120> because<00:02:52.269> everyone's<00:02:52.750> just<00:02:52.870> going<00:02:53.019> to

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
strong because everyone's just going to

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.050 
strong because everyone's just going to
go<00:02:53.200> for<00:02:53.350> that<00:02:53.440> massive<00:02:54.010> blimp<00:02:54.489> on<00:02:54.610> top<00:02:54.820> of<00:02:54.970> your

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
go for that massive blimp on top of your

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.380 
go for that massive blimp on top of your
tank<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.830> camouflage<00:02:57.340> on<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.730> tank<00:02:57.940> is<00:02:58.120> very

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
tank the camouflage on the tank is very

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.470 
tank the camouflage on the tank is very
poor<00:02:58.660> as<00:02:58.900> well<00:02:59.290> so<00:02:59.620> make<00:02:59.950> sure<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.850> are<00:03:01.090> behind

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
poor as well so make sure you are behind

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.710 
poor as well so make sure you are behind
some<00:03:01.900> bushes<00:03:02.080> far<00:03:02.769> behind<00:03:02.980> like<00:03:03.880> 15<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.420> 20

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
some bushes far behind like 15 to 20

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.229 
some bushes far behind like 15 to 20
meters<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:05.470> that<00:03:05.650> when<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:05.920> fire<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:07.060> don't

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
meters so that when you fire you don't

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.270 
meters so that when you fire you don't
turn<00:03:07.420> them<00:03:07.630> translucent<00:03:08.560> and<00:03:08.680> everyone<00:03:09.040> can

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
turn them translucent and everyone can

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
range four hundred twenty meters is a

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.150 
range four hundred twenty meters is a
lot<00:03:14.800> even<00:03:15.250> for<00:03:15.459> tier<00:03:15.850> 10<00:03:16.769> even<00:03:17.769> with<00:03:17.980> those

he's<00:03:24.459> gonna<00:03:24.610> pop<00:03:24.880> up<00:03:25.090> behind<00:03:25.209> an<00:03:25.600> amx<00:03:26.019> 50b<00:03:26.410> and

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
he's gonna pop up behind an amx 50b and

he's gonna pop up behind an amx 50b and
yeah<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.250> fifty<00:03:27.610> bees<00:03:27.959> response<00:03:28.959> time<00:03:29.320> is<00:03:29.350> not

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
yeah the fifty bees response time is not

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.750 
yeah the fifty bees response time is not
exactly<00:03:30.670> stellar<00:03:31.120> here<00:03:32.010> but<00:03:33.010> there's<00:03:33.370> nothing

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
exactly stellar here but there's nothing

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.690 
exactly stellar here but there's nothing
he<00:03:34.000> can<00:03:34.209> do<00:03:34.510> even<00:03:35.140> if<00:03:35.380> he<00:03:35.769> would<00:03:36.010> have<00:03:36.130> been

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
he can do even if he would have been

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.600 
he can do even if he would have been
facing<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.420> right<00:03:37.600> direction<00:03:38.160> he<00:03:39.160> couldn't

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
facing the right direction he couldn't

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.930 
facing the right direction he couldn't
have<00:03:39.760> gotten<00:03:40.000> more<00:03:40.299> than<00:03:40.510> two<00:03:40.720> shots<00:03:41.019> off<00:03:41.320> the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
have gotten more than two shots off the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
waffle over performs statistically as

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.039 
waffle over performs statistically as
well<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.310> is<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.610> highest<00:03:45.910> damaging<00:03:46.570> tank<00:03:46.840> at

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
well it is the highest damaging tank at

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.500 
well it is the highest damaging tank at
tier<00:03:47.290> 10<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.860> it<00:03:47.950> is<00:03:48.070> not<00:03:48.310> close<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:49.060> this<00:03:49.360> is

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
tier 10 and it is not close and this is

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.280 
tier 10 and it is not close and this is
after<00:03:49.870> getting<00:03:50.860> nerfed<00:03:51.540> there's<00:03:52.540> no<00:03:52.780> doubt<00:03:52.810> it

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
after getting nerfed there's no doubt it

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.080 
after getting nerfed there's no doubt it
will<00:03:53.410> get<00:03:53.530> nerfed<00:03:53.769> again<00:03:54.100> so<00:03:54.519> get<00:03:54.820> it<00:03:54.940> early

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
will get nerfed again so get it early

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.660 
will get nerfed again so get it early
and<00:03:55.329> abuse<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:55.900> while<00:03:56.049> you<00:03:56.230> have<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.530> chance

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
and abuse it while you have the chance

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.720 
and abuse it while you have the chance
