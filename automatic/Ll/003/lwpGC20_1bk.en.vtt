00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
I'm running portal 2 on my computer

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.349 
I'm running portal 2 on my computer
right<00:00:25.050> now<00:00:25.109> for<00:00:25.619> some<00:00:25.740> reason<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.820> anyways

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
right now for some reason but anyways

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.689 
right now for some reason but anyways
the<00:00:28.349> zombie<00:00:28.949> spawn<00:00:29.130> over<00:00:29.279> there<00:00:29.429> they<00:00:29.550> get

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the zombie spawn over there they get

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.400 
the zombie spawn over there they get
over<00:00:29.939> here<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.960> keep<00:00:31.170> them<00:00:31.349> from

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
over here and you have to keep them from

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.740 
over here and you have to keep them from
getting<00:00:31.619> over<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.070> otherwise<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.730> die<00:00:32.969> easy

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
getting over here otherwise you die easy

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.020 
getting over here otherwise you die easy
simple<00:00:34.260> enough<00:00:34.440> all<00:00:35.160> right<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.579> can<00:00:35.610> start

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
simple enough all right you can start

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.530 
simple enough all right you can start
with<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> bow<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.840> power<00:00:37.430> 10<00:00:38.430> infinity<00:00:39.120> one

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
with the bow the power 10 infinity one

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.979 
with the bow the power 10 infinity one
so<00:00:40.010> one<00:00:41.010> arrow<00:00:41.219> lasts<00:00:41.879> infinite<00:00:42.719> amount<00:00:42.899> of

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
so one arrow lasts infinite amount of

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.170 
so one arrow lasts infinite amount of
times<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.739> guess<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.250> think<00:00:44.550> power<00:00:44.760> 10<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
times I guess I think power 10 is the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.940 
times I guess I think power 10 is the
top<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.590> should<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.070> shot<00:00:47.309> kills<00:00:47.579> and

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
top so it should be one shot kills and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.520 
top so it should be one shot kills and
right<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.160> are<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> TNT<00:00:50.910> cannons<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:52.289> easy

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
right here are the TNT cannons it's easy

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.639 
right here are the TNT cannons it's easy
to<00:00:52.680> kill<00:00:52.829> them<00:00:53.300> with<00:00:54.300> because<00:00:54.870> DNT<00:00:55.320> kills

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
to kill them with because DNT kills

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.069 
to kill them with because DNT kills
things<00:00:55.920> easily<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:57.270> she's<00:00:57.449> far<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.899> sheets

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
things easily that she's far that sheets

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.090 
things easily that she's far that sheets
median<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.559> shoots<00:00:58.770> close<00:01:00.739> you'll<00:01:01.739> see<00:01:01.920> how

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
median that shoots close you'll see how

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.549 
median that shoots close you'll see how
it<00:01:02.160> shoots<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.579> minute<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.320> that's<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
it shoots in a minute and that's the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.350 
it shoots in a minute and that's the
count<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.979> guess<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.369> how<00:01:05.460> much<00:01:05.610> TNT<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.150> have

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
count I guess of how much TNT you have

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.280 
count I guess of how much TNT you have
left<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.500> yeah<00:01:08.070> that's<00:01:08.280> about<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.610> make<00:01:09.060> sure

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
left and yeah that's about it make sure

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.420 
left and yeah that's about it make sure
nope<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.590> peaceful<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.070> got<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.340> on

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
nope it's on peaceful it's got to be on

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.359 
nope it's on peaceful it's got to be on
at<00:01:11.580> least<00:01:11.729> easy<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.450> above<00:01:13.010> for<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.040> zombies

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
at least easy or above for the zombies

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.570 
at least easy or above for the zombies
to<00:01:14.430> spawn<00:01:14.670> obviously<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.280> further<00:01:17.280> ado

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
to spawn obviously but a further ado

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:30.480 
to spawn obviously but a further ado
here<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:18.030> go<00:01:18.890> just<00:01:19.890> start<00:01:24.259> Brown

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:40.730 

is<00:01:31.090> it<00:01:31.619> starting

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:49.320 

start<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.420> command<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> start

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.060

 though they are gone alright this

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.570 
 though they are gone alright this
is<00:01:55.190> how<00:01:55.250> it<00:01:55.370> starts<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:55.940> it<00:01:56.810> should<00:01:57.320> fit<00:01:57.710> that

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
is how it starts and it should fit that

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:13.830 
is how it starts and it should fit that
is<00:01:59.060> useless

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.460

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
coming up from both sides these are

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.809 
coming up from both sides these are
closed<00:02:34.849> on<00:02:35.060> base<00:02:35.299> i<00:02:37.450> freak<00:02:38.450> i<00:02:38.540> suck<00:02:38.780> at<00:02:38.810> this

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.250 

but<00:02:43.819> don't<00:02:44.390> really<00:02:44.629> just<00:02:44.780> shoot<00:02:44.930> myself<00:02:45.049> with

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
but don't really just shoot myself with

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.310 
but don't really just shoot myself with
an<00:02:45.349> arrow

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.750 

did<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.470> just<00:02:52.620> shoot<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:52.890> far<00:02:53.250> away<00:02:53.400> I

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
did that just shoot it far away I

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.020 
did that just shoot it far away I
thought<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:55.130> maybe<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.370> red<00:02:56.550> one<00:02:56.730> shoot

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
thought that maybe the red one shoot

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:06.310 
thought that maybe the red one shoot
close<00:02:58.280> what<00:02:59.280> does<00:02:59.430> white<00:02:59.610> shoot<00:03:04.880> look<00:03:05.880> look

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
close what does white shoot look look

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.410
