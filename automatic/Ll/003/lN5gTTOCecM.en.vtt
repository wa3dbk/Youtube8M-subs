00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.170
 is doing and saw with the webcam for that 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.670
 a desire to take the car 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.740
 photographic 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.000
 however the halloween video is not 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.010
 I can do because I had no ideas 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.590
 hints I tried to do a minimum 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.630
 he was shit and so I like it then 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.010
 I greet these people, however, the first one 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.239
 other close to greet you certainly not 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.190
 you want to follow the greetings but it's gone 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.640
 also because it is a pretty list 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.910
 long 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.969
 then lara anita giulia de mita 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.510
 alessandra valeria simu hazelnut aka 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.510

 clara andrea arianna and diego athletes 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.729
 too many please please but decided 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.159
 to make this video you guys my 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.479
 ideal boy there was no definite one 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:15.189
 that is 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.780
 to me on pg of many boys 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.020
 every single boy was completely 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.049
 different from leonardo practically 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.329
 let's start with the character i like 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.369
 nice guys but not the ones 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.729
 they exaggerate too much because they want to make themselves 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.049
 see I want to see cute little mouse 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.719
 I like them are too exaggerated 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.849
 like mature there is in the mature sense 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.310
 in the sense that they like to joke 

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:43.890
 in any case there are short, touring are the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.569
 use everything but touring and sense to be more 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.299
 mature I can not deny it however sense 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:52.270
 positive, however, certainly logical 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.399
 because I think he should be a boy 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.739
 to take the first step in everything and then 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.759
 if the boys are active after all, yes 

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:05.829
 would complicate I am a struggling 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:08.140
 to jump and then her hair 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:11.950
 beautiful I made the video 7 because 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.880
 I wanted to give more example to myself 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.230
 like romantic guys but really 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.690
 so romantic i like i 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.060
 check that when I imagine mine 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.180
 idea and those songs for those who think that 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.980
 once before other bets 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.480
 boh I always imagine a boy but 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.040
 that there are because but that generates stop 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.750
 that I like those old crap that 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.330
 because it may not know they make you feel 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.000
 social and therefore memorial since yesterday 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.850
 then withdrawn features then 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.740
 obviously there is even if that guy there 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.250
 there will be no such characteristics 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.260
 he does not care 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:50.530
 just so many holes i like them 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.890
 skater and how boys dress 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.260
 calling on the skate we are type 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.420
 all bank sins you'd like i 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.459
 my ideal kids are part exercisers 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.290
 I call music so already a boy 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.160
 of a guitar 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:10.140
 but he can dedicate all the songs to you 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.140
 these things you see here are romantic me 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.770
 physical appearance then for quite a while 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.920
 offered more than that thing that matters 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.920
 less 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:28.760
 for example I like the guy you are 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.760
 however, he doesn't foresee anything or anyway 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.190
 then I like you died man died apart 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.690
 I call blacks there in the sense we want 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.690
 put a chris brown with 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.260
 brad pitt 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.380
 I know the toast finally please 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.730
 you you like but there brown eyes 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.070
 because in her opinion she calls it rock is 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.840
 much more intense than the eye which is not 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.610
 I know it communicates more emotions and less 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.320
 corrupt blockages 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:02.580
 and then all you boys I am 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:09.880
 liked the big nose 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:13.000
 I like pasta because I like the 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.420
 nice side though that the guys are me 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.200
 liked 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:22.410
 they all had everyone and then smiled like 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.410
 the eyes 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.820
 I think the boy falls his smile is 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.750
 everything was physical or interesting 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.330
 ie trained'm not interested indeed 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.750
 I would love nicoli between TV models 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.970
 of abercrombie beckham with the line types 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.900
 does not like simple boys instead 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.160
 connected with the nose patatin I would like 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.500
 that guy I make myself feel 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.560
 special believe me your kind of 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.940
 kids under years if you liked 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.110
 this because you put the houses and if 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.300
 repeated this video you put me 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.180
 also like to believe via the channel if 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.980
 you have already made the man approaches 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.830
 more and more with one member and I don't know 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.950
 still what to do then consider 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.360
 useless though since I no longer do the 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.430
 video dialogue in I wanted to do what 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.430
 something and therefore decided to 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.120
 hello to the chemists
