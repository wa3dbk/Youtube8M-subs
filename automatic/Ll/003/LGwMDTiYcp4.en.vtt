00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
gonna contain elements from globe Buster

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.910 
gonna contain elements from globe Buster
and<00:02:29.330> I'm<00:02:29.600> thinking<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:30.320> my<00:02:30.380> theory<00:02:30.770> you

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
and I'm thinking this is my theory you

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.830 
and I'm thinking this is my theory you
know<00:02:31.100> it<00:02:31.550> quote<00:02:31.790> me<00:02:31.910> from<00:02:32.090> wrong

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
know it quote me from wrong

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.080 
know it quote me from wrong
I'm<00:02:33.350> thinking<00:02:33.770> maybe<00:02:33.980> they're<00:02:34.730> gonna<00:02:34.820> be<00:02:34.970> like

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
I'm thinking maybe they're gonna be like

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.840 
I'm thinking maybe they're gonna be like
rivals<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.900> nowhere<00:02:36.860> ease<00:02:37.040> in<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:37.670> last

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
rivals and nowhere ease in the last

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.520 
rivals and nowhere ease in the last
couple<00:02:38.150> episodes<00:02:38.330> they'll<00:02:38.870> team<00:02:39.080> up<00:02:39.110> and

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
couple episodes they'll team up and

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.960 
couple episodes they'll team up and
they'll<00:02:39.740> have<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:40.010> team<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.400> special<00:02:40.790> that

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
they'll have that team of special that

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.310 
they'll have that team of special that
