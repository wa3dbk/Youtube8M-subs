00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
than once a day and you will get your

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.970 
than once a day and you will get your
splits<00:02:50.150> quickly<00:02:50.900> I<00:02:50.930> mean<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.319> know<00:02:51.469> this<00:02:51.799> isn't

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
splits quickly I mean I know this isn't

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.569 
splits quickly I mean I know this isn't
much<00:02:52.340> but<00:02:53.349> there's<00:02:54.349> nothing<00:02:54.769> really<00:02:55.459> more

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
much but there's nothing really more

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.569 
much but there's nothing really more
that<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.090> can<00:02:56.329> think<00:02:56.540> off<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.840> top<00:02:57.079> of<00:02:57.260> my<00:02:57.409> head

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.000 

but<00:03:01.579> that's<00:03:02.150> basically<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:03.169> and<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.680> can<00:03:03.859> get

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
but that's basically it and you can get

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.030 
but that's basically it and you can get
your<00:03:04.129> splits<00:03:04.480> really<00:03:05.480> fast<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.590> only<00:03:06.650> took<00:03:06.980> me

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
your splits really fast it only took me

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.920 
your splits really fast it only took me
um<00:03:07.579> I<00:03:09.129> don't<00:03:10.129> know<00:03:10.280> because<00:03:11.150> in<00:03:11.419> the<00:03:11.599> summer

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
um I don't know because in the summer

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.589 
um I don't know because in the summer
last<00:03:12.709> year<00:03:13.250> I<00:03:13.280> was<00:03:13.519> really<00:03:13.939> working<00:03:14.120> on<00:03:14.359> them

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
last year I was really working on them
