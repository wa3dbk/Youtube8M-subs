00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.570
 hello to all you are the ccf and a point named liberals 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.710
 so Monday it will be to present the image plan he told me 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.160
 the hockey player a maintenance of the state lands of the Baltic states 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.189
 so in fact a match it will be held it is a machine to win 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.869
 and to this magic we can get a cap what difference 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.500
 and everyone is at his power 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.140
 to him then 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.010
 so let's start with the craft 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.210
 so the work of the machine includes 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.890
 Photo of you 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.290
 in astronomy 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.540
 cellou dalein in the clouds 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.540
 once you're in pain 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.660
 as for them on vacation and so the parts to buy the pipelines 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.950
 all southern countries 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.670
 we have our feet without irony 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.670
 90 spectators of tomorrow 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.980
 and then we have gold coins 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.000
 to get it canceled 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.020
 donkey the disappearance 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.020
 parra is however far from all that gives you 5 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.920
 m you have a good lesson 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.120
 football 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.130
 you can buy another 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.300
 the pieces in Iraq 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.270
 % end 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.480
 without a 6th just percent of canadians the peter p 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.830
 what's better like that 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.620
 so that's sodas basic numbers make life 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.250
 so that finally makes guy saint-pierre 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.040
 he will not be in any case 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.450
 and with gold coins it's more interesting 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.510
 in 2003 you are filmed 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.230
 a noble act 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.850
 but Germany collard 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.360
 franks hore woodcock 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.840
 but the text 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.840
 so everyone appropriates was different than his sales 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.589
 then brf 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.589
 they showed it so what is closed to them 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.279
 e 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:19.289
 this price of 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.119
 instead of skipping ducasse like that 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:23.639
 three pieces of stuffed 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.639
 we can use the fact that the indomitable lions of Geneva 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.779
 everything goes wrong 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.339
 so it's funny 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:38.779
 m after cholera so the evil started for women go faster 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.299
 it increases the speed 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.289
 many parents 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:46.289
 and so there while speed 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.229
 our idea is wrong there are passages any link 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.039
 in fact we can not control 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:57.559
 otherwise I did not find the key but I do not think 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.249
 rocking so and it makes passersby did it 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.979
 but in the face of hyperactivity the full 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.979
 and sometimes it takes like that 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.159
 this is our society whose latin america and not the text so has the stage 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.159
 it's actually closed 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.549
 do it as if you only had the purse 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.129
 we just fell from above 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.209
 before the sarine 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.349
 so that's the normal healthy sodas and a third 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.349
 and so the cans 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.529
 here is dante with the fmi so I see her 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.619
 so it's still so if the winger of 22 years 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:43.059
 here is the young father 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:46.989
 so that was going to be finished for them this nice match backpack 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:51.059
 you have just found the binder with in the description 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:53.559
 and there soon for new ideas
