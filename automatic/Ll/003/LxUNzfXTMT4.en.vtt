00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 for the ancient civilization goes to earth 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.599
 was flat and universe is a bo a square 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.170
 its structure was sustained by 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.269
 a huge tree and hit the tree . 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.699
 life 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.189
 the most believed that this tree united 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.859
 all instances of your universe 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.000
 roots reached the lower world the world 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.300
 of the dead 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.529
 the trunk rested in the middle 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.560
 Earth 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.340
 the branches held the upper world 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.879
 the sky where the gods lived the tree 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.719
 of the Maya was 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.329
 the sum one oss one 1 since the end of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.550
 other simple actions invented 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.000
 Legends about your 1 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.199
 the mother of the forest the mother of the rivers 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.930
 The stairway to heaven assumes one was not the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.809
 center of the Maya universe for nothing is she 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.579
 largest tropical forest tree and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.579
 one of the largest on the planet 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.360
 but you do not have to be a bad person and 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.360
 believe in holy trees to follow 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.150
 air for a sum one here assume a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.729
 always guided the boatmen they are a 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.000
 reference point navigation in rivers 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.000
 from the amazon 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.080
 even though there are many men in the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.869
 the middle of the forest in clayey 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.750
 we will assume assume the soil 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.010
 of the floodplains 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.500
 flooded 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.360
 here in the Amazon basin it usually 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:50.250
 appears on the banks of huge rivers 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:54.390
 always been the main route 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.270
 communication and Amazon knows this 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.570
 geography and the green mass that 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.149
 forest does not help anything in locating 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.970
 any higher sum in the turn margin 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.429
 point of reference so assume a 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.429
 turned forest gps 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.550
 this is one of the most important means of 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.220
 primitive since always until today the man 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.500
 of the forest uses the sapopema that is this 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.410
 part of your soul to say that you are 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:49.280
 coming home or else to warn 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:51.319
 help is lost in the forest. 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.870
 communicating prosaic messages as 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.209
 this one perhaps bringing messages from all 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.060
 the dimensions of the universe with 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.430
 we believed the crash of his 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.780
 soul does not go unnoticed and I will say 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.549
 one thing does not have this kind of damage 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.549
 on her belly also clothes 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.730
 this noisy flow of sap is that 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.370
 this giant bird at its height can 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.390
 reach 70 meters 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.890
 the summit sums such a high rate 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.660
 High is so clear that it seems she 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.110
 is holding the sky as the 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.110
 mayas 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.480
 but in all this time your soul is 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.980
 subject to the winds the storms and 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.310
 your own weight 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.540
 to compensate it balances huge 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.620
 tentacles 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:46.569
 but only by themes that sometimes enter 300 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.569
 meters into the woods 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:06.860
 we are approaching the donation 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:28.450
 When you approach it, you usually 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:56.470
 you already see her signs and if we win 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:05:00.800
 animals usually eat cotton cotton 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.870
 grew floated the future opens soon 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.540
 loose cotton that is flying around 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.870
 flying or traveling does not see with the wind if 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.360
 responsible for spreading the nature and 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.370
 this openness here is also 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.700
 because of her who spread tutelary 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:21.250
 so went taking the coin she goes she goes 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.250
 to have in the space of the same day her 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.130
 everyone respects her by size 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.130
 that she has her looks like the mother of the other 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.110
 whether in heaven or on earth 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.080
 the plants down here living from the water 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.510
 that it produces by communicating through 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.050
 her being guided by her 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:50.720
 the Mayans were right to their soul 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.720
 it is a world in itself it is the tree of life 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:04.160
 here you met the monumental in short 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.160
 one knows trying 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.280
 meet other species on the site
