00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
bat that that was a missed play as he

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.959 
bat that that was a missed play as he
should<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.770> easily<00:00:43.980> got<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> protect

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
should have easily got for the protect

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.880 
should have easily got for the protect
the<00:00:45.090> first<00:00:45.329> turn<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.899> way<00:00:46.200> he<00:00:46.440> could<00:00:46.680> get

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the first turn so that way he could get

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.760

up<00:00:47.070> his<00:00:47.460> poison<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.270> he<00:00:48.899> would<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.170> poisoned

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
up his poison and he would be poisoned

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.920 
up his poison and he would be poisoned
instead<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.430> bird<00:00:50.850> because<00:00:51.270> now<00:00:51.480> since<00:00:51.780> he's

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.999 
actually going to really do any damage
at<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.360> which<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.049> making<00:01:40.350> me<00:01:40.530> think<00:01:40.680> okay

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
at all which is making me think okay

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.859 
at all which is making me think okay
this<00:01:41.189> thing<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.460> definitely<00:01:41.729> some<00:01:42.479> sort<00:01:42.720> of

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
this thing is definitely some sort of

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.050 
this thing is definitely some sort of
belly<00:01:43.110> drum<00:01:43.380> set<00:01:43.710> or<00:01:43.950> something<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.549> mean<00:01:44.880> I

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
don't know I know it's burned but I feel

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.490 
don't know I know it's burned but I feel
like<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.659> still<00:01:48.899> would<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.049> been<00:01:49.229> able<00:01:49.320> to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
like it still would have been able to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.050 
like it still would have been able to
knock<00:01:49.740> me<00:01:49.950> out<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.850> have

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
knock me out because I like have

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.609 
knock me out because I like have
terrible<00:01:51.600> defense<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.079> don't<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> very

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
terrible defense I don't have a very

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.920 
terrible defense I don't have a very
good<00:01:52.710> offense<00:01:53.130> IV<00:01:53.430> stat<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:53.790> all<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.720> really

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
good offense IV stat at all and I really

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.840 
good offense IV stat at all and I really
thought<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.619> thing<00:01:55.680> was<00:01:56.040> some<00:01:56.340> sort<00:01:56.700> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
thought that this thing was some sort of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.459 
thought that this thing was some sort of
you<00:01:57.030> know<00:01:57.060> belly<00:01:57.659> drum<00:01:57.930> set<00:01:59.600> uh-huh<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.899> as

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
you know belly drum set uh-huh but as

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.170 
you know belly drum set uh-huh but as
you<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.649> see<00:02:01.710> player<00:02:02.280> off<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.670> really<00:02:03.030> not

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
you can see player off is really not

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.929 
you can see player off is really not
doing<00:02:03.630> anything<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.259> all<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:05.369> regular<00:02:05.700> play

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
doing anything at all and a regular play

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.940 
doing anything at all and a regular play
rough<00:02:06.210> shouldn't<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.689> able<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.990> probably<00:02:07.409> like

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
rough shouldn't be able to probably like

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.010 
rough shouldn't be able to probably like
mock<00:02:08.640> me<00:02:08.819> out<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.390> decided<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.750> go<00:02:09.840> for

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
mock me out so I just decided to go for

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.809 
mock me out so I just decided to go for
the<00:02:10.110> Volt's<00:02:10.319> which<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.709> think<00:02:11.520> he<00:02:11.610> ends<00:02:11.760> up

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
the Volt's which I think he ends up

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.070 
the Volt's which I think he ends up
telling<00:02:12.060> me<00:02:12.120> later<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.690> thing

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
telling me later that the thing

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.100 
telling me later that the thing
actually<00:02:13.710> belly<00:02:13.920> drum<00:02:14.160> because<00:02:15.150> it's<00:02:15.570> just<00:02:15.810> I

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
actually belly drum because it's just I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.620 
actually belly drum because it's just I
don't<00:02:17.010> know<00:02:17.100> because<00:02:17.520> it's<00:02:17.700> doing<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.390> less

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
don't know because it's doing so less

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.000 
don't know because it's doing so less
damage<00:02:19.050> there<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.470> could<00:02:19.620> have<00:02:19.710> done<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.860> lot

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
damage there it could have done a lot

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.650 
damage there it could have done a lot
more<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.490> mean<00:02:20.850> he<00:02:20.970> can't<00:02:21.150> really<00:02:21.300> go<00:02:21.450> for

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
more I mean he can't really go for

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.720 
more I mean he can't really go for
superpower<00:02:22.080> akward<00:02:22.590> jet<00:02:22.980> or<00:02:23.160> waterfall<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:23.670> I

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
superpower akward jet or waterfall so I

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.280 
superpower akward jet or waterfall so I
couldn't<00:02:23.940> really<00:02:24.060> have<00:02:24.450> seen<00:02:24.660> those<00:02:24.810> moves<00:02:25.110> to

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
couldn't really have seen those moves to

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.810 
couldn't really have seen those moves to
see<00:02:25.440> if<00:02:25.650> he<00:02:25.800> was<00:02:25.890> actually<00:02:26.070> locked<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.580> or<00:02:26.700> not

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
see if he was actually locked in or not

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.410 
see if he was actually locked in or not
so<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:28.350> don't<00:02:28.560> know<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:29.090> anyways<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.240> just

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
so I don't know but anyways I just

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.420 
so I don't know but anyways I just
decided<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.690> go<00:02:30.780> with<00:02:30.870> my<00:02:30.930> high<00:02:31.860> drag<00:02:32.100> on<00:02:32.250> now

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
decided to go with my high drag on now

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.500 
decided to go with my high drag on now

light screen with this clucky which is

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.070 
light screen with this clucky which is
kind<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:35.940> annoying<00:02:36.210> because<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.630> just<00:02:36.840> go<00:02:36.930> for

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
kind of annoying because I just go for

kind of annoying because I just go for
fire<00:02:37.290> blast<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.010> fire<00:02:38.940> blast<00:02:39.300> isn't<00:02:39.900> really

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
fire blast and fire blast isn't really

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.070 
fire blast and fire blast isn't really
going<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.830> do<00:02:41.160> too<00:02:41.610> much<00:02:41.880> at<00:02:42.120> all<00:02:42.270> one<00:02:42.720> because

gonna go for the other screen or maybe

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.530 
gonna go for the other screen or maybe

just some spikes it's not that big of a

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.840 
just some spikes it's not that big of a
deal<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.930> then<00:02:58.350> draining<00:02:58.620> kiss<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.490> I<00:02:59.670> just

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
deal and then draining kiss and I just

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.510 
deal and then draining kiss and I just
should<00:03:00.750> play<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.410> lot<00:03:01.830> better<00:03:02.130> than<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.370> did

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
should play that a lot better than I did

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.300 
should play that a lot better than I did
first<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.600> all<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.750> gets<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.050> crit<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.620> don't<00:03:04.950> think

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
first of all I gets a crit I don't think

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.750 
first of all I gets a crit I don't think
that<00:03:05.490> mattered<00:03:06.440> because<00:03:07.440> it's<00:03:07.980> something

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
that mattered because it's something

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.100 
that mattered because it's something
obviously<00:03:09.240> caught<00:03:09.450> weight<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.870> who<00:03:09.959> knows

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
obviously caught weight to it who knows

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.570 
obviously caught weight to it who knows
maybe<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.530> did<00:03:10.709> maybe<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.070> could<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> little<00:03:11.490> bit

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
maybe it did maybe I could a little bit

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.540 
maybe it did maybe I could a little bit
a<00:03:11.610> little<00:03:11.820> bit<00:03:11.970> but<00:03:12.870> still<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.530> mean<00:03:13.860> he<00:03:14.430> was

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
a little bit but still I mean he was

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.150 
a little bit but still I mean he was
getting<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:14.970> lot<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.360> HP<00:03:15.510> back<00:03:15.860> but<00:03:16.860> what<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.040> was

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
getting a lot of HP back but what I was

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.030 
getting a lot of HP back but what I was
trying<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.400> say<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:19.080> should<00:03:19.800> have

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
trying to say is that I should have

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.680 
trying to say is that I should have
played<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> lot<00:03:21.060> better<00:03:21.180> because<00:03:21.390> usually

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
played that a lot better because usually

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.990 
played that a lot better because usually
I<00:03:22.080> just<00:03:22.110> run<00:03:22.500> my<00:03:22.530> home<00:03:22.800> clucky<00:03:23.250> which<00:03:23.519> is<00:03:23.760> just

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
I just run my home clucky which is just

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.540 
I just run my home clucky which is just
play<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.200> doesn't<00:03:25.650> even<00:03:25.860> have<00:03:26.070> like<00:03:26.310> flash

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
play I doesn't even have like flash

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.160 
play I doesn't even have like flash

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
gleam or anything like that so I

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.540 
gleam or anything like that so I
probably<00:03:31.500> should<00:03:31.830> have<00:03:31.950> thought<00:03:32.100> about<00:03:32.160> him

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
probably should have thought about him

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.960 
probably should have thought about him
you<00:03:32.820> know

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
you know

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.570 
you know
having<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.660> chance<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:34.050> putting<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.190> fair<00:03:35.400> move

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
having the chance of putting a fair move

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.280 
having the chance of putting a fair move
on<00:03:35.760> his<00:03:35.970> klefki<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:36.900> didn't<00:03:37.080> really<00:03:37.170> think

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
on his klefki I just didn't really think

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.050 
on his klefki I just didn't really think
about<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.800> so<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.130> was<00:03:38.430> kind<00:03:38.610> of<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.760> mistake

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
about that so that was kind of a mistake

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.880 
about that so that was kind of a mistake
on<00:03:39.239> my<00:03:39.269> part<00:03:39.390> because<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:40.050> lost<00:03:40.350> my<00:03:40.470> high<00:03:40.650> drag

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
on my part because I lost my high drag

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.030 
on my part because I lost my high drag
on<00:03:41.010> there<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:42.170> this<00:03:43.170> thing<00:03:43.410> went<00:03:43.739> all<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:43.890> way

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
on there and this thing went all the way

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.729 
on there and this thing went all the way
back<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.459> full<00:03:44.640> HP<00:03:45.030> with<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.810> light<00:03:46.290> screen<00:03:46.590> up

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
back to full HP with a light screen up

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.770 
back to full HP with a light screen up
which<00:03:47.010> is<00:03:47.190> not<00:03:47.370> good<00:03:47.700> at<00:03:47.820> all<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.690> can

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
which is not good at all and it can

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.300 
which is not good at all and it can
easily<00:03:48.930> get<00:03:49.140> up<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.380> reflect<00:03:49.709> because<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.160> has

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
easily get up a reflect because it has

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.699 
easily get up a reflect because it has
obviously<00:03:50.850> prankster<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:51.780> now<00:03:52.320> I<00:03:52.350> just<00:03:52.410> had<00:03:52.620> to

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
obviously prankster so now I just had to

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.580 
obviously prankster so now I just had to
switch<00:03:52.890> out<00:03:53.100> I'm<00:03:53.280> gonna<00:03:53.459> go<00:03:53.670> into<00:03:54.120> my

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
switch out I'm gonna go into my

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.320 
switch out I'm gonna go into my
azumarill<00:03:55.590> because<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.010> zoom<00:03:56.190> role<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:56.610> gonna

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
azumarill because the zoom role is gonna

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.150 
azumarill because the zoom role is gonna
try<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.660> do<00:03:57.870> as<00:03:57.989> much<00:03:58.140> damage<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:58.860> klefki

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
try and do as much damage to the klefki

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.560 
try and do as much damage to the klefki
I'm<00:03:59.580> thinking<00:03:59.910> this<00:03:59.970> thing<00:04:00.180> right<00:04:00.330> now<00:04:00.360> is

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
I'm thinking this thing right now is

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.660 
I'm thinking this thing right now is
maybe<00:04:00.750> especially<00:04:01.080> in<00:04:01.320> offensive<00:04:01.650> wall<00:04:01.830> so<00:04:02.640> I

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
maybe especially in offensive wall so I

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.210 
maybe especially in offensive wall so I
decided<00:04:03.000> just<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.300> go<00:04:03.540> up<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:04.019> him<00:04:04.260> anyways<00:04:04.620> but

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
decided just to go up to him anyways but

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.340 
decided just to go up to him anyways but
unfortunately<00:04:05.670> for<00:04:06.180> me<00:04:06.480> he<00:04:06.720> actually<00:04:07.110> it's<00:04:07.260> a

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
unfortunately for me he actually it's a

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.530 
unfortunately for me he actually it's a
Breen<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.590> Jolteon<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.519> that's<00:04:08.970> like

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
Breen and Jolteon and that's like

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.229 
Breen and Jolteon and that's like
terrible<00:04:10.170> this<00:04:11.070> setup<00:04:11.400> wasn't<00:04:11.820> really

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
terrible this setup wasn't really

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.759 
terrible this setup wasn't really
supposed<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:12.630> happen<00:04:13.049> I<00:04:13.170> really<00:04:13.530> don't<00:04:13.709> think

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
supposed to happen I really don't think

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.259 
supposed to happen I really don't think
he<00:04:14.070> expected<00:04:14.519> me<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.670> bring<00:04:14.880> him<00:04:15.000> brought<00:04:15.150> him

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
or bringing his umaril there but he just

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.190 
or bringing his umaril there but he just
got<00:04:17.280> very<00:04:17.459> lucky<00:04:17.609> he<00:04:18.330> now<00:04:18.450> this<00:04:18.570> goes<00:04:18.720> for<00:04:19.109> the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
got very lucky he now this goes for the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.810 
got very lucky he now this goes for the
volt<00:04:19.380> switch<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.890> it's<00:04:20.100> gonna<00:04:20.220> do<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.430> very

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
volt switch and it's gonna do a very

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.909 
volt switch and it's gonna do a very
good<00:04:20.940> amount<00:04:21.180> of<00:04:21.299> damage<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.810> where<00:04:22.560> he<00:04:22.770> can

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
good amount of damage to where he can

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:23.410 
good amount of damage to where he can
bring<00:04:23.039> something

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
bring something

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.020 
bring something
maybe<00:04:23.840> potentially<00:04:24.290> kill<00:04:25.190> me<00:04:25.370> we're<00:04:25.820> just

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030

maybe potentially kill me we're just
going<00:04:26.420> to<00:04:26.450> end<00:04:26.630> up<00:04:26.810> being<00:04:27.050> his<00:04:27.380> Volcarona<00:04:27.890> I<00:04:28.820> am

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
going to end up being his Volcarona I am

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.670 
going to end up being his Volcarona I am
very<00:04:29.510> threatened<00:04:29.930> by<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:30.020> bug<00:04:30.260> bites<00:04:30.470> here

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
very threatened by a bug bites here

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.260 
very threatened by a bug bites here
killing<00:04:31.040> me<00:04:31.160> so<00:04:31.370> I'm<00:04:31.460> gonna<00:04:31.580> decide<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:32.030> switch

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
killing me so I'm gonna decide to switch

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.700 
killing me so I'm gonna decide to switch
out<00:04:32.480> and<00:04:32.600> go<00:04:32.840> back<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:33.170> buy<00:04:33.320> Zoomer<00:04:33.620> all

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
out and go back and buy Zoomer all

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.350 
out and go back and buy Zoomer all
because<00:04:34.280> uber<00:04:34.580> old<00:04:34.700> can<00:04:34.820> pretty<00:04:34.940> much<00:04:35.030> cover

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
because uber old can pretty much cover

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.720 
because uber old can pretty much cover
Volcarona<00:04:35.840> any<00:04:36.170> real<00:04:36.530> way<00:04:36.770> and<00:04:37.010> he<00:04:37.370> should<00:04:37.580> sit

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
Volcarona any real way and he should sit

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.620 
Volcarona any real way and he should sit

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
have kept that around later because he

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.240 
have kept that around later because he

Keeble and yeah I don't know though

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.160 
Keeble and yeah I don't know though

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
power damage so I felt like that was

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.880 
power damage so I felt like that was
gonna<00:05:52.880> kill<00:05:53.090> anyways<00:05:53.450> enough<00:05:53.780> not<00:05:54.350> let<00:05:54.620> me<00:05:54.710> he

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
gonna kill anyways enough not let me he

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.120 
gonna kill anyways enough not let me he
would<00:05:55.130> have<00:05:55.160> kill<00:05:55.400> the<00:05:55.490> next<00:05:55.730> turn<00:05:55.910> so<00:05:56.740> yeah<00:05:57.740> so

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
would have kill the next turn so yeah so

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.100 
would have kill the next turn so yeah so
he's<00:05:58.310> actually<00:05:58.460> not<00:05:58.670> specs<00:05:59.090> so<00:05:59.750> maybe<00:05:59.930> that's

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
he's actually not specs so maybe that's

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.390 
he's actually not specs so maybe that's
why<00:06:00.230> he<00:06:00.440> really<00:06:00.650> wanted<00:06:01.010> to<00:06:01.130> go<00:06:01.220> for<00:06:01.250> the

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:19.449 
sure it works like that maybe I'm wrong

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:21.929 
sure it works like that maybe I'm wrong
maybe<00:07:20.110> he<00:07:20.650> did<00:07:20.830> have<00:07:21.009> an<00:07:21.129> item<00:07:21.460> I<00:07:21.669> don't<00:07:21.849> know

00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:21.939 
maybe he did have an item I don't know

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:24.029 
maybe he did have an item I don't know
but<00:07:22.629> it<00:07:22.870> still<00:07:22.960> did<00:07:23.169> a<00:07:23.199> lot<00:07:23.349> of<00:07:23.379> damage<00:07:23.590> I<00:07:23.830> was

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 
but it still did a lot of damage I was

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:25.800 
but it still did a lot of damage I was
able<00:07:24.159> to<00:07:24.279> talk<00:07:24.430> about<00:07:24.639> unfortunately<00:07:25.419> I<00:07:25.569> did

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:25.810 
able to talk about unfortunately I did

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.749 
able to talk about unfortunately I did
get<00:07:25.900> a<00:07:25.960> critical<00:07:26.199> hit<00:07:26.469> for<00:07:26.500> the<00:07:26.770> head<00:07:26.979> there

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 
get a critical hit for the head there

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:29.459 
get a critical hit for the head there
I<00:07:27.789> still<00:07:28.240> have<00:07:28.330> a<00:07:28.360> zoom<00:07:28.539> role<00:07:28.719> though<00:07:28.870> so<00:07:29.169> it

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:29.469 
I still have a zoom role though so it

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:30.390 
I still have a zoom role though so it
wasn't<00:07:29.680> like<00:07:29.740> a<00:07:29.800> worst<00:07:30.039> thing<00:07:30.250> in<00:07:30.310> the<00:07:30.340> world

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 
wasn't like a worst thing in the world

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.040 
wasn't like a worst thing in the world
and<00:07:31.029> now<00:07:31.180> I<00:07:31.210> decide<00:07:31.449> to<00:07:31.479> go<00:07:31.599> for<00:07:31.659> the<00:07:31.779> bullet

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.050 
and now I decide to go for the bullet

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.600 
and now I decide to go for the bullet
punch<00:07:32.229> against<00:07:32.620> the<00:07:32.740> biggest<00:07:32.979> predator<00:07:33.400> I

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:33.610 
punch against the biggest predator I

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.129 
punch against the biggest predator I
know<00:07:33.669> it's<00:07:33.909> not<00:07:34.000> gonna<00:07:34.180> kill<00:07:34.360> I<00:07:34.599> really<00:07:34.990> know

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:35.139 
know it's not gonna kill I really know

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:37.680 
know it's not gonna kill I really know
for<00:07:35.379> a<00:07:35.440> fact<00:07:35.650> it's<00:07:35.860> not<00:07:35.979> going<00:07:36.219> to<00:07:36.400> but<00:07:37.389> he

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:37.690 
for a fact it's not going to but he

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.790 
for a fact it's not going to but he
can't<00:07:37.719> kill<00:07:38.139> me<00:07:38.319> either

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 
can't kill me either

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.230 
can't kill me either
I<00:07:38.830> mean<00:07:39.069> he<00:07:39.190> could<00:07:39.339> go<00:07:39.460> for<00:07:39.639> a<00:07:39.699> stone<00:07:39.909> each<00:07:40.060> but

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 
I mean he could go for a stone each but

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.659 
I mean he could go for a stone each but
you<00:07:40.330> just<00:07:40.509> saw<00:07:40.629> how<00:07:40.750> much<00:07:41.490> earthquake<00:07:42.490> did

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:42.669 
you just saw how much earthquake did

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:45.149 
you just saw how much earthquake did
there<00:07:42.879> and<00:07:42.909> steinege<00:07:43.659> would<00:07:43.810> only<00:07:43.960> do<00:07:44.169> that

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:45.159 
there and steinege would only do that

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:48.329 
there and steinege would only do that
plus<00:07:45.610> half<00:07:46.089> of<00:07:46.240> earthquake<00:07:46.690> so<00:07:47.560> I<00:07:47.830> could<00:07:48.069> still

00:07:48.329 --> 00:07:48.339 
plus half of earthquake so I could still

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:50.309 
plus half of earthquake so I could still
easily<00:07:48.580> take<00:07:48.969> that<00:07:49.180> and<00:07:49.419> he<00:07:49.479> just<00:07:49.629> would<00:07:49.810> like

00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 
easily take that and he just would like

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:53.399 
easily take that and he just would like
just<00:07:51.120> because<00:07:52.120> Stone<00:07:52.539> Edge<00:07:52.690> could<00:07:52.900> miss<00:07:53.110> so

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:53.409 
just because Stone Edge could miss so

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:55.140 
just because Stone Edge could miss so
although<00:07:54.009> you<00:07:54.190> could<00:07:54.310> get<00:07:54.460> chritmas<00:07:54.729> tonnage
