many<00:04:42.250> cows<00:04:42.520> you<00:04:42.700> need<00:04:42.970> how<00:04:43.960> many<00:04:44.170> calories<00:04:44.440> you

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
many cows you need how many calories you

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.400 
many cows you need how many calories you
need<00:04:44.950> and<00:04:45.160> have<00:04:45.310> what<00:04:45.880> your<00:04:46.210> macros<00:04:46.750> are<00:04:47.020> to

maintain<00:04:48.010> your<00:04:48.220> weight<00:04:48.280> all<00:04:48.940> right<00:04:49.260> then

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
maintain your weight all right then

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.610 
maintain your weight all right then
to<00:04:50.770> lose<00:04:50.980> fat<00:04:51.430> you<00:04:51.880> got<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.180> create<00:04:52.780> a<00:04:52.990> calorie

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
to lose fat you got to create a calorie

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.350 
to lose fat you got to create a calorie
deficit<00:04:54.280> all<00:04:55.000> right

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
deficit all right

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.530 
deficit all right
around<00:04:56.200> 500<00:04:57.100> calorie<00:04:57.400> deficit<00:04:57.910> so<00:04:58.300> if<00:04:58.390> you're

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
around 500 calorie deficit so if you're

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
around 500 calorie deficit so if you're
maintaining<00:04:59.020> your<00:04:59.290> weight<00:04:59.850> on<00:05:00.850> our<00:05:01.440> orders<00:05:02.440> it

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
maintaining your weight on our orders it

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.370 
maintaining your weight on our orders it
just<00:05:03.490> I'm<00:05:03.640> just<00:05:04.120> guessing<00:05:04.300> here<00:05:04.480> let's<00:05:05.260> just

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
just I'm just guessing here let's just

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.360 
just I'm just guessing here let's just
say<00:05:05.440> you're<00:05:05.590> maintaining<00:05:05.920> your<00:05:06.070> weight<00:05:06.190> on

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
say you're maintaining your weight on

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.390 
say you're maintaining your weight on
3000<00:05:07.030> calories<00:05:07.210> all<00:05:07.900> right

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
3000 calories all right

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.280 
3000 calories all right
if<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.640> eat<00:05:11.370> 2500<00:05:12.370> calories<00:05:12.520> so<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.330> 500

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
if you eat 2500 calories so a 500

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.510 
if you eat 2500 calories so a 500
calorie<00:05:14.500> deficit

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
calorie deficit

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.830 
calorie deficit
