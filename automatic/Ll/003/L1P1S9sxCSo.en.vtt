00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello everyone welcome to tech mobile 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.420
 welcome to this new episode today 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.490
 in which we're going to see two applications 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.480
 to put wallpaper wallpaper to 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.480
 our smartphone or tablet 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.730
 good are two applications that to me 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.420
 they have liked a lot are different backgrounds 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.560
 ok let's see the first of them 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.470
 as it will always be more ready here 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.060
 frank wallpaper I'm going to approach is this 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.810
 icon that is here flag wallpaper vale 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:35.079
 good this application has some funds 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.090
 of abstract type is very colorful and 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.040
 let's see it the problem is that it has 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.140
 very few still have it seems to me that 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.059
 has 27 currently that are from this 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.950
 this style is worth good here we are going to 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.600
 see all and the truth that they are quite 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.600
 pimps we can see them 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.140
 expand them if we like we can 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.840
 download it or place it as any 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.250
 the mobile interface is very simple good 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.629
 Well, if you like this type of background 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.300
 this would be one of them was the wallpaper 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.250
 well this totally free 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.080
 in the play clog these follow some 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.990
 funds we can see another for example 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.120
 here we have another one allows us a 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.550
 good fund preview and 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.680
 place it download the next one I'm going to 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.850
 teaching to me is one of the ones that has most 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.120
 liked 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.060
 it's called is here galaxy s 5 and 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.060
 wallpaper by its name seems that 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.550
 it is simply that of the galaxy is 5 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.770
 let's see it this is the icon and this is 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.480
 what you have to download from the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.640
 pleistocene mobile here we play good 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.620
 let's open this application as we see 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.010
 the first tab we see some 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.010
 few funds 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.420
 are not all that many better 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.240
 they serve almost the most used by 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.250
 say it we move to the right and 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.220
 we found the stock funds these yes 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.620
 those of the galaxy 65 because the famous one 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.140
 It has the galaxy s 5 and many others that 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.690
 they come like this in bluish tones of agreement 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.600
 the application as in the previous one gives us 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.700
 the option to put it as a wallpaper 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.080
 or download it we already have 100 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.450
 downloaded put the favorites is 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.010
 pretty complete but what is it 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.780
 really interesting about this application 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.380
 because it's not the four funds that 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.230
 come from galaxy s 5 or this from here is 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.580
 this little tab here where we see the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.080
 different resolutions that we have 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.080
 click where you put stop 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.720
 and as we see we see a lot of 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.490
 galaxy terminal phones s3 ls 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:39.180
 4 the htc one x for example the one that I 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.970
 I have placed would be the lg the chief reflex 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.740
 we have it here we press and we get out 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.960
 all the funds that appear by 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.000
 defect in the terminal this is what 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.010
 really interesting we have all the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.150
 default funds that appear are worth 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.280
 example that I have it put in my 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.650
 smartphone would be this one here that I 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.569
 Like very much 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.180
 well with anyone if we go by 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.810
 example htc one x then they will appear 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.530
 the funds that appear in the htc or in x 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.590
 for example in motogp 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.930
 we see the typical funds of 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.060
 motogp for example this one is pretty 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.860
 complete since we have our 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.260
 layout any wallpaper 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.000
 any model phone model and 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.459
 they are updating, they are adding 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.890
 new so if you like to have in your 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.440
 phone some blow because of some 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.690
 original specific model because this is 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.040
 your application I said these are the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.930
 applications that I wanted to teach I hope 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.760
 that you liked it if it's been like that 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.709
 you give a like up and see you in 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.709
