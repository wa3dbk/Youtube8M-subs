 to be prepared

 He said that we must wait to be well 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:15.159

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.519
 In the missions you will have at your disposal various vehicles between 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.519
 them but in their next position 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.310
 we all want 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.270
 factors like the cross interface with controls the new air throne of 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.240
 recognition 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.240
 that will help locate the enemy before being seen 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.680
 two 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.970

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.170
 viii 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.300
 but the truth a careful enemy soldier 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.850
 is within the scope of any kind of being destroyed I recommend that you 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.850
 keep at a safe altitude 7 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.590
 villa 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.330
 you num 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.240
 they do not know 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.920
 of the encounter that when a drone marks a soldier a red marker appears for 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.549
 indicate your position will remain on the soldiers while the vehicle is 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.619
 find nearby but be careful if the drone leaves the area the markers 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.619
 recognition disappear 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.640
 and do not forget that the more you use the drone to recognize one more threat 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.580
 reliable data will collect 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.260
 after 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
 before this I think we are finalizing their work 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.990
 have things
