00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.139 

so<00:00:01.140> this<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.500> model<00:00:02.010> for<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.399> blood<00:00:02.700> vessels

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
so this is a model for the blood vessels

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.300 
so this is a model for the blood vessels
as<00:00:03.389> we<00:00:03.720> can<00:00:03.959> try<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.529> figure<00:00:04.799> out<00:00:04.920> we're<00:00:05.220> going

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
as we can try to figure out we're going

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.849 
as we can try to figure out we're going
to<00:00:05.400> look<00:00:05.609> at<00:00:05.759> both<00:00:05.870> the<00:00:06.870> different<00:00:07.560> types<00:00:07.710> of

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
to look at both the different types of

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:08.930 
to look at both the different types of
blood<00:00:07.950> vessels<00:00:08.309> that<00:00:08.400> we<00:00:08.460> have<00:00:08.550> which<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.730> the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
blood vessels that we have which is the

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.270 
blood vessels that we have which is the
artery<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.540> vein<00:00:09.570> artery<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.740> one<00:00:11.130> in

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
artery and a vein artery is the one in

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.770 
artery and a vein artery is the one in
the<00:00:11.309> center<00:00:11.610> here<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:11.880> then<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.330> veins<00:00:12.540> are

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
the center here and then the veins are

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.470 
the center here and then the veins are
the<00:00:12.900> two<00:00:13.110> here<00:00:13.679> delineated<00:00:14.490> by<00:00:14.580> these<00:00:14.910> valves

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
the two here delineated by these valves

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.390 
the two here delineated by these valves
valves<00:00:15.990> are<00:00:16.080> only<00:00:16.199> found<00:00:16.379> on<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.890> veins<00:00:17.130> and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
valves are only found on the veins and

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.720 
valves are only found on the veins and
what<00:00:18.240> next<00:00:18.660> we're<00:00:18.869> gonna<00:00:19.020> do<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.490> take<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.580> look

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
what next we're gonna do is take a look

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
what next we're gonna do is take a look
at<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.880> different<00:00:21.119> layer<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.539> can<00:00:21.660> see

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
at the different layer and we can see

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.599 
at the different layer and we can see
that<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.050> contrast<00:00:22.650> between<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
that in the contrast between the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.950 
that in the contrast between the
difference<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.150> arteries<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.930> veins

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
difference in the arteries and the veins

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.580 
difference in the arteries and the veins
so<00:00:26.150> first<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.359> foremost<00:00:27.689> let's<00:00:28.470> get

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
so first and foremost let's get

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.050 
so first and foremost let's get
orientated<00:00:29.070> as<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.490> could<00:00:29.609> imagine<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
orientated as you could imagine the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.550 
orientated as you could imagine the
arteries<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.660> center<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:31.140> traveling

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
arteries in the center here traveling

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.280 
arteries in the center here traveling
upwards<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.340> then<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> vein<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.329> actually<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
upwards and then the vein is actually a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.020 
upwards and then the vein is actually a
vessel<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.010> splits<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.610> goes<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.880> either

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
vessel that splits and goes on either

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.670 
vessel that splits and goes on either
side<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> artery<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.140> probably<00:00:37.410> easier

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
side of the artery it's probably easier

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.040 
side of the artery it's probably easier
to<00:00:37.710> take<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> look<00:00:38.219> at<00:00:38.309> from<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> top<00:00:38.820> view<00:00:39.050> as

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
to take a look at from the top view as

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.900 
to take a look at from the top view as
you<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.379> see<00:00:40.530> from<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.219> little<00:00:41.579> kind<00:00:41.760> of

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
you can see from this little kind of

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.010 
you can see from this little kind of
aspect<00:00:43.940> many<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.090> different<00:00:45.570> layers<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.930> we

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
aspect many of different layers that we

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.110 
aspect many of different layers that we
have<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.739> let's<00:00:47.309> start<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.850> kind

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
have here so let's start with this kind

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.680 
have here so let's start with this kind
of<00:00:48.210> view<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:49.620> way<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.760> we're<00:00:51.390> gonna<00:00:51.480> go

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
of view in this way so we're gonna go

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.279 
of view in this way so we're gonna go
for<00:00:52.160> starting<00:00:53.160> from<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> inside<00:00:54.000> out<00:00:54.239> or<00:00:54.629> from

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
for starting from the inside out or from

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.680 
for starting from the inside out or from
the<00:00:55.440> most<00:00:55.620> closest<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.430> lumen<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.090> what<00:00:57.570> you'll

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the most closest or lumen in what you'll

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.360 
the most closest or lumen in what you'll
find<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> endothelium<00:00:59.190> that's

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
find is we have the endothelium that's

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.069 
find is we have the endothelium that's
all<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> yellow<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.270> makes<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.690> very<00:01:00.809> very

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
all the yellow that makes it very very

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.969 
all the yellow that makes it very very
smooth<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.010> very<00:01:02.520> very<00:01:02.760> nice<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.539> able<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
smooth and very very nice to be able to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.800 
smooth and very very nice to be able to
not<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.159> any<00:01:05.309> platelets<00:01:05.760> attached<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.360> so

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
not have any platelets attached to so

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.000 
not have any platelets attached to so
that's<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.170> call<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> endothelium

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
that's what we call the endothelium

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.130 
that's what we call the endothelium
simple<00:01:08.340> squamous<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.750> directly

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
simple squamous and just directly

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.600 
simple squamous and just directly
underneath<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.979> take<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.280> closer

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
underneath that if you take a closer

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.530 
underneath that if you take a closer
look<00:01:12.770> you'll<00:01:13.770> find<00:01:14.090> these<00:01:15.090> different<00:01:15.420> layers

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
look you'll find these different layers

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.289 
look you'll find these different layers
if<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:15.960> kind<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.170> go<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.320> little<00:01:16.590> tighter<00:01:17.299> we'll

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
if we kind of go a little tighter we'll

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.570 
if we kind of go a little tighter we'll
find<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.049> endothelium<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.310> right<00:01:20.549> on

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
find the endothelium is just right on

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.249 
find the endothelium is just right on
top<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> basement<00:01:21.420> membrane<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.110> this

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
top of the basement membrane so this

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.300 
top of the basement membrane so this
little<00:01:22.470> white<00:01:22.619> little<00:01:22.799> thing<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
little white little thing is the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.330 
little white little thing is the
basement<00:01:23.490> membrane<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:24.450> top<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.340> internal

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
basement membrane on top of the internal

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.149 
basement membrane on top of the internal
elastic<00:01:26.759> lamina<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.600> artery<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
elastic lamina for the artery on the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.740 
elastic lamina for the artery on the
vein<00:01:29.369> side<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.030> could<00:01:30.150> notice<00:01:30.180> there's

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
vein side as you could notice there's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.120 
vein side as you could notice there's
just<00:01:31.020> really<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.350> endothelium<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:31.979> then

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
just really just endothelium and then

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.380 
just really just endothelium and then
just<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.400> little<00:01:32.520> bit<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.939> connective<00:01:33.360> tissue

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
just a little bit of connective tissue

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.020 
just a little bit of connective tissue
there's<00:01:34.290> no<00:01:34.500> internal<00:01:34.829> elastic<00:01:35.310> lamina<00:01:35.460> here

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
there's no internal elastic lamina here

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.630 
there's no internal elastic lamina here
or<00:01:36.479> at<00:01:36.720> least<00:01:36.979> demonstrated<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.520> we'll

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
or at least demonstrated and so we'll

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.149 
or at least demonstrated and so we'll
find<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.210> internal<00:01:39.720> elastic<00:01:40.020> lamina<00:01:40.380> here

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
find the internal elastic lamina here
