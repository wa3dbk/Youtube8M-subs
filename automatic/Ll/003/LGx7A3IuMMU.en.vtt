00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.410
 the desert lost the coachman hundreds 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.000

 leave just today since good and 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.050
 you know that the gta 5 for pc is already 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.490
 little bit of leaving comes just the 14th 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.529
 April and today we are already Asia and miss 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.380
 nothing and good then on the platform 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.450
 sting it seems that how to say it has come out 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.090
 a new option a new information 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.079
 of the game of jeta 5 for pc that sting 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.120
 a platform on which we can 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.180
 book and buy cubes for pc 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.290
 Well, it has updated by this way 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.579
 to say it they want to be the platform of 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.440
 There are a few things that are missing so that 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.120
 come out is I have for pc then the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.710
 gta 5 information has changed 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.570
 on that platform so to speak and has 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.739
 come out an information which tells us 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.809
 it's not filtered information is 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.640
 information which may cost the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.399
 brought to light and this information we 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.380
 says that gta 5 for pc or was the one 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.870
 is 5 for pc will occupy 65 gigas 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.070
 if I'm listening there and that's 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.610
 a lot of little looks then for you to do 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.490
 an idea the gta 5 for play 4 and xbox one 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.340
 did not reach 50 gb I think or think 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.630
 that does not reach 250 GB and imagine that it was 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.360
 5 to play four which one looks 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.290
 incredibly well then imagine 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.030
 card 5 to apply another time when 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.570
 arrived at the 50 imaginary girls for 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.370
 65 gigabyte pc 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.720
 incredible that has been followed in a lot 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.370
 better and apart then he has to bring more 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.900
 content because if it weighs badly this assumes 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.790
 that not everything will be in plan of graphics 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.840
 he knew that he will also bring more content already 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.610
 you know how good if I have a new 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.020
 car if they put some new missions and 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.360
 they put new game mode for all that 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.560
 also enters what occupies the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.690
 game therefore if it occupies more space 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.880
 in PC, because he supposes that it was also because 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.650
 one of the things is but I do not wait 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.140
 that yes the others is simply the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.640
 graphic I guess I do not know how that 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.270
 it was empty subway create that district let 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.640
 the comments on this topic seems 65 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.680
 gigabyte is that it is a fool is a 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.200
 damn asshole but an eraser and I 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.960
 I think that little game can start 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.340
 that amount the vegetable 5 are in the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.259
 top of the heaviest games I would say 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.009
 because I identify that she is a damn 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.049
 burrada 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.670
 so I recommend that you do not erase 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.549
 everything you have on your pc if you go 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.739
 to 5 for pc the space to which it is 5 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.360
 for pc because you're going to have to erase 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.640
 a lot of things because also the 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.890
 hard disks of computers should be 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.930
 for example I put in 250 gigas 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.099
 European technician's main hard drive 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.709
 be the main hard disk itself 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.569
 then imagine 250 gigas in total per 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.459
 65 gigaba for the cretaceous for heavy 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.319
 What is uncle, please? 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.359
 incredible what the game can be 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.849
 It has been nothing because I am already wishing that 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.829
 come out and know that they have dedicated all 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.629
 those gigas has is amazing how it 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.769
 has to see everything Asian by these and 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.629
 basically everything is known and left the ex 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.019
 favorite stage sowers and see you 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.019
 in the next
