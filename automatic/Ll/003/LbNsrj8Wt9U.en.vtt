achievements and you see how it's like a
bracket<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:10.110> looks<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.500> bracket<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.400> my

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
bracket it looks like a bracket so my

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.990 
bracket it looks like a bracket so my
best<00:01:11.880> guess<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:13.110> 2k<00:01:13.560> NBA<00:01:13.920> 2k<00:01:14.340> heroes<00:01:14.790> is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
best guess for what 2k NBA 2k heroes is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.700 
best guess for what 2k NBA 2k heroes is
this<00:01:15.299> maybe<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.439> some

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
this maybe it's going to be like some

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.200 
this maybe it's going to be like some
brand<00:01:16.979> new<00:01:17.070> tournaments<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.939> thing<00:01:18.180> that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
brand new tournaments have a thing that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.690 
brand new tournaments have a thing that
you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:18.840> I'm<00:01:19.439> not<00:01:19.740> sure<00:01:19.950> if<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.369> true

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you can do I'm not sure if it's for true

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.760 
you can do I'm not sure if it's for true
moda<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.270> would<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.570> kind<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.900> cool<00:01:21.960> maybe

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
moda that would be kind of cool maybe

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.320 
moda that would be kind of cool maybe
having<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.369> own<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.759> know<00:01:23.850> obviously<00:01:24.000> you
