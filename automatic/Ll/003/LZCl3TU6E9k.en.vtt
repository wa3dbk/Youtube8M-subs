getting<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.799> mean<00:01:37.799> they<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.520> playing<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:38.970> so

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
getting it mean they just playing it so

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.910 
getting it mean they just playing it so
well<00:01:39.329> early<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.200> we'll<00:01:40.350> never<00:01:40.470> get<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.770> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
well early on so we'll never get to a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.230 
well early on so we'll never get to a
point<00:01:41.100> where<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.460> start<00:01:41.549> split-pushing

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
point where you can start split-pushing

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.819

because<00:01:42.899> his<00:01:43.049> team<00:01:43.290> will<00:01:43.409> then<00:01:43.439> just<00:01:43.710> get

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
because his team will then just get

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.350 
because his team will then just get
engaged<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.460> they<00:01:44.520> would<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.670> weaker<00:01:45.210> in

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
engaged on it they would be weaker in
