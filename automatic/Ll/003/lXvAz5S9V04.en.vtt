00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 and nice to all of you guys I 'm hooks 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.670
 player and welcome back to my channel 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.519
 meanwhile I already didn't want the wrong weapon 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.620
 take them dance sing for mr 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.049
 and then we are today we are with a live up 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.490
 advanced warfare much to the sun e house 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.279
 let's see what will come out 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.199
 meanwhile here are the four well-known ohs 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.000
 they kill us at least that much 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.160
 of mr 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.779
 and we are on the solar map and the class 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.680
 he is using right now 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.059
 is mr with a mowing target taken one 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:37.320
 there's another laborer and viewfinder 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:41.219
 handle and in any case I tell you immediately 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.010
 which where after this gameplay I will also do 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.450
 but other tutorials also came one 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.579
 territorial then others that it is 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.980
 of course I will always alternate gameplay 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.530
 tutorial how I always did italic 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.410
 we can two games in a row and how 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.250
 secondary or placed in the evil of 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.180
 Fortunately here I can see here it 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.390
 as secondary I had the Atlas 45 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.560
 elite edition or this alarms us 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.640
 my square only because of the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.170
 silencer 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.830
 in the meantime we are this thing not there 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.450
 they discover and as a hub of tex 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.530
 to invisibility even if it is not that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.600
 now it served me so much 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.210
 so we see peace is us always 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.580
 all here as I use tactics 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.409
 the one at least here with weapons with 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.150
 which I can afford it we are already at 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.210
 his blood status uses a tactic 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.119
 to check and a location for 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.630
 bluetooth and leg control one 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.119
 posting and indeed look carefully 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.189
 it's not camper I control one 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.439
 location there is a slice of the map 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.950
 as if there is a cake I check one 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.680
 slice of that cake to understand one 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.420
 part of that map so that here it is 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.770
 but now for example I try not to do 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.479
 penetrate 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.820
 means nowhere is this 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.979
 penetrated, however , I killed a lot 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.979
 even if penetrated it is not very nice to 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.539
 say as a somewhat allusive thing in the meantime 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:13.760
 we already have the bombing unpublished 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:13.760
 card but I have to take shelter 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.820
 here we make five games we do 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.130
 1221 happens and then check this 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.290
 part of the map and I don't say 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.010
 enter nobody here is good put one 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:35.330
 beautiful turret and in this way with the 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.060
 machine does not explode here now try a 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.300
 enter this way I don't do the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.560
 check our eolas background whole 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.380
 the situation under control 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.930
 in the meantime, you have heard excuses me noises 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.580
 because our little niece is on it 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.680
 so we are already 4ward for attention 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.440
 5 as warbirds fifth bla bol world 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.240
 guys know they are killing we're already 15 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.420
 indeed, without animating, here it is 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.430
 here comes the good bite that we are 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.030
 a great danger though if it gives me a shit 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.470
 dead actor 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:12.230
 meanwhile the car is frightening it here 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:16.450
 here is the other sneijder who punctually 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:20.900
 marco this takes me i'm not leaving e 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.900
 best promo ran to my form 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.700
 what strikes we do in the meantime it explodes 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.080
 car that i am eating october but 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.080
 therefore it keeps some its own 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:35.889
 here it is instead for now, however, that we talk 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:39.069
 in critical position as rewards or 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.659
 places with detection of threats and colors 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.060
 of failure and detection suit 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:46.629
 threatens normal bombing the 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.139
 boosted werder with here is the camper in 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:52.150
 all world bird boosted with defensive 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.739
 it seems to me that this fact is repaired in a hurry 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.329
 who practically checked for whom 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.730
 didn't know fast for controlled 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.079
 from artificial intelligence and can 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.000
 be checked also by us if 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.459
 we want and think about protecting the 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.840
 player 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.449
 here or if they are expected I don't want to 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.169
 both are not so much we are already 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:14.379
 activates 17 stuff like that here it is 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:17.410
 arm from two snipers but better 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:22.479
 don't take them for that we'll die 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.990
 definitely all commercial 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.990
 shot 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.130

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.320

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.310
 who is working from here we check 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.020
 here they managed to enter mine 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.810
 mate and coward pulls back cat 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.670

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.120
 well but 20 rows can tire you out 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:54.870
 something scary comes out today 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.790

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.660
 however I wanted to buy me let's get to 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.730
 flight shelter I understand the cons 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.990
 I thought I was taking black examples lessons 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.580
 the specific one for that game 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.720
 however intense of walls ever having 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.420

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.100

 to turn the triple garage 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.050
 what stands there I would say to use 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.889
 But hopefully I will not not now 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.639
