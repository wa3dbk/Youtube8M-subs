11<00:00:34.469> millimeter<00:00:34.860> will<00:00:35.550> work<00:00:35.760> with<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.300> go<00:00:37.170> ahead

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
11 millimeter will work with so go ahead

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.330 
11 millimeter will work with so go ahead
and<00:00:37.440> loosen<00:00:37.590> those<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:40.100> they're<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> be
