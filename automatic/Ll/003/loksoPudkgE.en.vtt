00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:07.710
 good afternoon, good afternoon on behalf of 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.679
 University college of the Borja engineer 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.519
 Mr. Alberto GarcÃ­a Aspe, we want to give you 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.849
 the welcome 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.130
 lord jimmy lush who is already old 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.630
 all of you know that he returns to his 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.199
 home 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.199
 jimmy welcome 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.390
 if nothing if imagined and dreamed of 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.239
 throughout my career when I left Cougars 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.630
 several tigers was one of my goals 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.280
 the active power in house good contract 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.790
 in seems that for two years 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.230
 loan for two years and I'm happy that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.330
 I'll tell you it 's from the days more 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.830
 happy of my career 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.989
 I have to be a very positive leader 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.340
 because there are many young people who obviously 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.629
 will limit much what we do 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.290
 great those who come not only 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.450
 jaime lozano sevilla now of luis no 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.399
 romagnoli is not we are people of 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.720
 experience that it has to be we have 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.329
 than to be positive leaders and that 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.530
 young people and joined them to the people 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.990
 a lot of experience there is good here 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.670
 let's make equipment again a 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.470
 team protagonist and that is very strong 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.050
 and that I fought for championships and I had 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.690
 a great connection with him manuel 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.330
 he commented a lot on the first tone 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.310
 we met was like we had 34 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.840
 tournaments playing together and good 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.850
 it is difficult to achieve that the truth that 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.680
 is 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.700
 it seems to me that the forward who passes more 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.340
 of position goal and well I tell you that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.409
 I wish I do not know if they have thought about that not the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.720
 directive but I always say is 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.280
 important to have players who can 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.659
 combine and can attend that 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.610
 way inside the court then 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.700
 hopefully on my part I will obviously try to 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.710
 help everyone and obviously there is manuel 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.509
 that feels like at home and that you go 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.570
 very good because if that really happens 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.729
 the team would win my goal and fought 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.950
 to make blue champion I lost three 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.990
 finals in morelia one and the team that 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.399
 I go I do not have another thing in mind no if not 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.759
 he has nothing to do in the game 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.759
 professional
