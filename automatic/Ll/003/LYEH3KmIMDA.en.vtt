00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.710
 throw in this episode of capristo tv 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.580
 Let's take a look at our carbon 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.950
 production 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.810
 We look at our specialists 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.720
 over the shoulder and accompany one 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.509
 bonnet for the ferrari 458 spider 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.000
 through all development steps up to the 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.379
 finished product 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.780
 we want to emphasize that all 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.710
 work steps with us but in 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.239
 Germany will be the first 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.640
 steps on the way to the finished 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.770
 Product is first the idea and the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.079
 design our development department 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.289
 creates a sketch with a pencil and 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.289
 paper 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.910
 in parallel, we scan the vehicle 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.910
 with a 3d scanner 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.570
 the resulting model of the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.030
 vehicle shows us the existing 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.850
 Free space allows a high precision 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.620
 in the manufacturing process and supports us 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.840
 when creating 3d model of 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.790
 Hood 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.040
 to give a better impression of shape 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.080
 to get a sense of touch and homogeneity 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.640
 then we push the model in 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.640
 our 3d printer 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.210
 when the creative part is completed 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.130
 Let's start the preparation for the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.870
 production 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.909
 First of all, two shapes are formed 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.909
 Milled solid aluminum block 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.229
 We produce from this positive form 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.470
 then two negative forms in which 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.120
 the hoods are made 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.400
 meanwhile, the 3d model will continue 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.769
 we start working with the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.569
 programming and simulation of the five 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.610
 axis milling machine as soon as the 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.410
 We can finish with negative form 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.090
 start the production of the first week 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.069
 the pre impregnated carbon will be 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.069
 carefully inserted in the form 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.720
 Afterwards the carbon parts will be added 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.920
 130 degrees and under high pressure in the 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.920
 baked autoclave 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.870
 this is followed by the quality control 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.810
 Finally, the parts on and 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.090
 Milled to a high precision 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.310
 to ensure repeatability 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.030
 this task will be our six axis 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.030
 left to the robot 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.750
 and now again the individual 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.750
 development steps in overview 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.570

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.700
