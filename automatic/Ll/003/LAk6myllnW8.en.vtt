00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
extension of the game right but that's

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.670 
extension of the game right but that's
it<00:02:16.440> but<00:02:16.920> ok<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:18.239> is<00:02:18.450> what<00:02:18.629> a<00:02:18.780> pre<00:02:19.170> it's

yes<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.439> combats<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:01.040> little<00:03:01.219> bit<00:03:01.340> better<00:03:01.459> but

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
yes the combats a little bit better but

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.729

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
first it seems cool because there's

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.319 
first it seems cool because there's
three<00:03:21.470> locations<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.189> go<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.609> motel<00:03:22.790> and
