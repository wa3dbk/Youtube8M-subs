right<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.010> is<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:39.150> perfect<00:01:39.630> place<00:01:40.320> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
right here is the perfect place to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.160 
right here is the perfect place to
actually<00:01:40.920> plant<00:01:41.550> this<00:01:41.790> eco<00:01:42.119> log<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.960> going

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
actually plant this eco log it is going

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.600 
actually plant this eco log it is going
to<00:01:43.259> look<00:01:43.440> beautiful<00:01:45.680> you<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.920> want<00:01:47.190> to<00:01:47.280> keep<00:01:47.460> in

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
to look beautiful you do want to keep in

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.330 
to look beautiful you do want to keep in
mind<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.300> a<00:01:48.390> multi<00:01:48.869> phase<00:01:49.200> process<00:01:49.950> so

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
mind that it's a multi phase process so

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.880 
mind that it's a multi phase process so
phase<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.360> obviously<00:01:51.780> preparing<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
phase one is obviously preparing the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.540 
phase one is obviously preparing the
ground<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:54.560> actually<00:01:55.560> planting<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.310> seed

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
ground for actually planting the seed

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.609 
ground for actually planting the seed
and<00:01:56.850> since<00:01:57.150> we're<00:01:57.330> basically<00:01:57.960> starting<00:01:58.320> from

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
and since we're basically starting from

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.010 
and since we're basically starting from
scratch<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:59.009> I'm<00:01:59.940> just<00:02:00.180> breaking<00:02:00.450> off<00:02:00.720> all

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
scratch here I'm just breaking off all

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.899 
scratch here I'm just breaking off all
of<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.320> debris<00:02:01.620> any<00:02:02.390> twigs<00:02:03.740> any<00:02:04.850> sort<00:02:05.850> of

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
of the debris any twigs any sort of

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.509 
of the debris any twigs any sort of
little<00:02:06.150> pieces<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.510> rock

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:07.519 
little pieces of rock

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:11.380 
little pieces of rock
I'm<00:02:08.519> also<00:02:08.760> scouring<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.780> earth<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.230> little<00:02:10.470> bit

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
I'm also scouring the earth a little bit

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.509 
I'm also scouring the earth a little bit
and<00:02:12.390> that's<00:02:13.080> really<00:02:13.320> going<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.620> help<00:02:13.920> when<00:02:14.459> I

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
and that's really going to help when I

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.610 
and that's really going to help when I
lay<00:02:14.880> down<00:02:14.910> see

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
lay down see

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.850 
lay down see
what's<00:02:17.620> going<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.860> happen<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:20.230> grass<00:02:20.620> is

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
what's going to happen is the grass is

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.920 
what's going to happen is the grass is

going to be patches where the seed

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.590 
going to be patches where the seed
hasn't<00:02:25.720> exactly<00:02:26.050> taken<00:02:26.680> hold<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.370> as<00:02:27.610> it's

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
hasn't exactly taken hold so as it's
