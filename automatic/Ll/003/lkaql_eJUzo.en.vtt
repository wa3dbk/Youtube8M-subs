Clark I've seen before that's because
you<00:00:29.550> use<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> digital<00:00:30.390> clock<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.050> tells

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you use a digital clock that just tells

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.110 
you use a digital clock that just tells
you<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> time<00:00:31.710> right<00:00:31.980> there<00:00:32.279> that's<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
you the time right there that's the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.150 
you the time right there that's the
normal<00:00:33.480> clock<00:00:33.780> tell<00:00:34.770> them<00:00:34.890> how<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.100> works

the big hands on the twelve that

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.229 
the big hands on the twelve that
represents<00:02:08.280> zero<00:02:08.549> minutes<00:02:08.759> because<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
represents zero minutes because it's the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.930 
represents zero minutes because it's the
start<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.810> hour<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:10.500> then<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.760> big

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
start of the hour and then if the big

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.020 
start of the hour and then if the big
hand<00:02:12.209> moves<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.049> one<00:02:13.459> it's<00:02:14.459> been<00:02:14.670> five

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
hand moves to the one it's been five

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.089 
hand moves to the one it's been five
minutes<00:02:16.099> so<00:02:17.099> understand<00:02:17.549> understand<00:02:19.099> all

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
minutes so understand understand all

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.759 
minutes so understand understand all
right<00:02:20.610> very<00:02:20.910> well<00:02:21.209> if<00:02:21.840> that's<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.379> case<00:02:22.440> and

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
right very well if that's the case and

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.619 
right very well if that's the case and
the<00:02:22.860> number<00:02:23.069> two<00:02:23.310> would<00:02:23.849> be<00:02:23.910> five<00:02:24.269> more

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
the number two would be five more

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.740 
the number two would be five more
minutes<00:02:24.930> past<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.890> one<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.940> would<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.269> ten

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
minutes past the one so it would be ten

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.369 
minutes past the one so it would be ten
minutes

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
minutes

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.619
