inflation technique for an X bed mat
with<00:00:19.170> an<00:00:19.260> integrated<00:00:19.650> pump<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.369> case<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
with an integrated pump in this case the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.480 
with an integrated pump in this case the
sing<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.779> 7<00:00:22.500> pump<00:00:22.800> Andy<00:00:23.670> thanks<00:00:24.539> Kyle<00:00:25.369> let<00:00:26.369> me

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.330 
sing that 7 pump Andy thanks Kyle let me
show<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.730> how<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.090> do<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:28.070> there<00:00:29.070> are<00:00:29.160> several

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
show you how I do this there are several

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.240 
show you how I do this there are several
ways<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:29.970> that's<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.420> usual<00:00:30.750> thing<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.170> do

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
ways but that's the usual thing I do

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.030 
ways but that's the usual thing I do
take<00:00:32.250> out<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.579> mat<00:00:33.260> you're<00:00:34.260> coming<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.739> camp

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
take out the mat you're coming to camp

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.880 
take out the mat you're coming to camp
so<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.430> suggest<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.390> puttin<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:37.469> mat<00:00:37.649> into

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
so I suggest just puttin the mat into

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.209 
so I suggest just puttin the mat into
your<00:00:38.190> tent<00:00:40.610> roll<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:42.530> open<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> inflation

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
your tent roll it up open the inflation

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.819 
your tent roll it up open the inflation
valve<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:46.020> let<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.260> sit<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
valve and then just let it sit for a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.000 
valve and then just let it sit for a
while<00:00:47.420> after<00:00:48.420> maybe<00:00:48.629> half<00:00:48.989> an<00:00:49.140> hour<00:00:49.289> or<00:00:49.770> an

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
while after maybe half an hour or an

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.639 
while after maybe half an hour or an
hour<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.640> come<00:00:50.820> back<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> will<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.960> self

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
hour you come back and it will be self

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.220 
hour you come back and it will be self
inflated<00:00:53.219> by<00:00:53.370> let's<00:00:54.210> say<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> third<00:00:54.840> or<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> half

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
inflated by let's say a third or a half

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.700 
inflated by let's say a third or a half
to<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.070> old<00:00:56.489> volume<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.050> already<00:00:58.320> does

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
to it's old volume so it already does

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.380 
to it's old volume so it already does
the<00:00:59.550> work<00:00:59.730> itself

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the work itself

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.280 
the work itself
partially<00:01:01.280> okay<00:01:02.510> you<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.809> opened<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
partially okay you have opened the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.710 
partially okay you have opened the
inflation<00:01:04.830> valve<00:01:04.860> already<00:01:05.670> now<00:01:05.970> there's<00:01:06.270> two

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
inflation valve already now there's two

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.969 
inflation valve already now there's two
hands<00:01:07.820> drawn<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.990> place<00:01:10.470> your<00:01:10.710> hands

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
hands drawn on here so place your hands

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.080 
hands drawn on here so place your hands
exactly<00:01:11.159> how<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.909> shows<00:01:12.860> left<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.549> right

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
exactly how it shows left one here right

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.670 
exactly how it shows left one here right
one<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.659> then<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.650> start<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.610> push<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:18.530> do<00:01:19.530> it

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
one here then just start to push I do it

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.390 
one here then just start to push I do it
slowly<00:01:19.950> first

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
slowly first

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.340 
slowly first
you<00:01:22.880> can<00:01:23.060> increase<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.420> speed<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.990> can<00:01:27.170> do<00:01:27.290> it

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
you can increase the speed you can do it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.540 
you can increase the speed you can do it
fast<00:01:27.890> as<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:28.400> wish<00:01:29.950> you<00:01:30.950> can<00:01:31.100> even<00:01:31.280> make<00:01:31.490> a

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
fast as you wish you can even make a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.940 
fast as you wish you can even make a
little<00:01:31.820> competition<00:01:32.240> out<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.660> it<00:01:32.840> will<00:01:33.770> take

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
little competition out of it will take

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.090 
little competition out of it will take
you<00:01:34.100> typically<00:01:34.490> like<00:01:34.700> one<00:01:34.940> 1/2<00:01:35.240> minutes<00:01:36.100> if

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
you typically like one 1/2 minutes if

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.400 
you typically like one 1/2 minutes if
you're<00:01:37.310> real<00:01:37.490> fast<00:01:37.850> that's<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:38.420> minute<00:01:39.110> I'd<00:01:39.770> say

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
you're real fast that's a minute I'd say

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.850 
you're real fast that's a minute I'd say
as<00:01:42.410> you<00:01:42.590> see<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:43.280> already<00:01:43.490> grows<00:01:43.940> up<00:01:44.590> now<00:01:45.590> be

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
as you see it already grows up now be

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.480 
as you see it already grows up now be
very<00:01:46.040> sure<00:01:46.460> that<00:01:47.270> your<00:01:47.450> left<00:01:47.630> hand<00:01:47.810> is<00:01:48.460> in<00:01:49.460> the

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
very sure that your left hand is in the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.540 
very sure that your left hand is in the
back<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:50.150> acts<00:01:50.780> as<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:52.630> closing<00:01:53.630> well<00:01:54.550> each

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
back and acts as a closing well each

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.719 
back and acts as a closing well each
time<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:56.000> push<00:01:56.180> down<00:01:56.260> your<00:01:57.260> left<00:01:57.500> hand<00:01:57.860> closes

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
time you push down your left hand closes

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.410 
time you push down your left hand closes
the<00:01:59.119> back<00:02:00.190> 12<00:02:01.190> which<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.700> inflation<00:02:02.000> well

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
the back 12 which is the inflation well

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.120 
the back 12 which is the inflation well
and<00:02:03.010> this<00:02:04.010> way<00:02:04.220> it<00:02:04.340> pushes<00:02:04.580> in<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:05.090> air<00:02:06.130> which

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
and this way it pushes in the air which

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.449 
and this way it pushes in the air which
is<00:02:07.160> soaked<00:02:07.640> up<00:02:07.940> by<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.240> foam<00:02:08.830> into<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.979> mount

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
is soaked up by the foam into the mount

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.640 
is soaked up by the foam into the mount
now<00:02:11.360> it's<00:02:11.630> already<00:02:11.930> almost<00:02:12.320> full<00:02:14.080> okay<00:02:15.080> there

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
now it's already almost full okay there

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.180 
now it's already almost full okay there
you<00:02:15.800> go

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
you go

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.510 
you go
I<00:02:16.600> really<00:02:17.600> like<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.959> fully<00:02:18.770> inflated<00:02:19.400> Lee

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
I really like it fully inflated Lee

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.850 
I really like it fully inflated Lee
cause<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.030> more--<00:02:20.270> it's<00:02:20.630> inflated<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.650> warm

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
cause the more-- it's inflated to warm

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.250 
cause the more-- it's inflated to warm
ideas<00:02:22.480> now<00:02:23.480> there<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.810> go<00:02:23.959> that's<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:25.209> now

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
ideas now there you go that's it now

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
ideas now there you go that's it now
close<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.530> valve<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:29.540> best<00:02:29.750> way<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:31.010> just

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
close the valve the best way is you just

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.390 
close the valve the best way is you just
go<00:02:32.269> around<00:02:32.570> with<00:02:32.810> your<00:02:32.840> thumb<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:33.709> push<00:02:34.190> it

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
go around with your thumb and push it
