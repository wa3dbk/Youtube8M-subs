00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:05.759
 hocking disappointment with the magnifying glass horses in a matter of fashion 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:13.549
 this cinematographic genre is the one that has most used the figure of the horse 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.509
 as a fundamental part that the cast 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.579
 The cowboys, always accompanied by their horses, have succeeded in 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:25.000
 The presence of this beautiful animal is as vital as that of the mythical 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.899
 characters from the west 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.240
 each director carefully chooses the type of kino for each character 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.070
 Your race skin color should be coupled to the script 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.310
 as well as casting for actors that is done for horses that 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.080
 their respective ankles 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.840
 in our america they are not used by the general I like wild and 40 hours 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.580
 that were those who inhabited the lands of the far west 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.900
 and in some cases widening tuts painted horses spitzer life 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.400
 a horse that performs the functions of artists must have a daughter while 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.540
 that if I fixed 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.830
 so as not to be frightened by noise with what happens cascÃ³n red 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.399
 generally in the shooting scenes the actors doing a pantomime 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:11.730
 without bullets 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.470
 that are then added digitally 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.560
 and in some cases according to standard &amp; poor's 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.600
 Although it does not seem like it, the scenes in the villages are of great precision 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.290
 there are many horses on stage moments that at the same time in different 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.470
 directions simulating the everyday 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.650
 usually the extra horses with riders 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.650
 but there are coaches off camera coordinating actions 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.230
 there are so many high complexity shots and the cart or diligences to all 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.300
 speed with horse creditor jeans that require all a preparation 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.400
 previous 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.490
 generators with horses 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.880
 actors and dom 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.210
 on the other hand the actors 15 kilos must train previously at the end to generate 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.330
 mutual trust and affection 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.010
 in the sample shows us exemplary titles that expose the btc quina and 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.289
 the spectacular 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.349
 these stunningly aesthetic animals 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.789
 a scene of galley a pursuit and this a walk possess an incredible 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.199
 visual presence 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.199
 the horse has always been present in the life of man 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:24.229
 and when it emerged from cinema, it also became part of the seventh art 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.930
 the genre of the western can not exist without equine co-stars face-to-face 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.930
 that this kind of 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:36.849
 so much burden explains
