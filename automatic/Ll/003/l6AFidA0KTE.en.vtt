00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 you people these crystals and today 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.380
 we find ourselves for a video rather 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.560
 particular as I had you 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.710
 warned speaks about the game jt at 6 to 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.300
 about gene amy for example 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.340
 wash your hands and all that was a 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.500
 example a little rotten but here we can 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.330
 always consider I will also put the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.980
 little simulation in this video the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.260
 so I hope this presents it to you 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.910
 big novelty in gta 5 compared to 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.130
 other gta can really see her 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.840
 appart and everything but especially in fact we have 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.519
 such interactions like watching the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.109
 telly but for example take a shower 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.940
 me personally it shocked me enough 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.870
 I found it pretty fan even though 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.520
 other people can not 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.660
 really looked at roof in the process of 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.090
 take a shower sofia small 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.640
 glitch also that exists and that in gta 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.210
 iv if we look good it's not great 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.399
 teacher 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.750
 finally that's what it's creepy in 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.399
 does the apartments they have 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.110
 do a lot of work in there and 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.550
 like to actually live leslie bendis who 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.989
 is the director of rockstar north as 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.050
 what they love to optimize their game 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.109
 that is to say finally two series 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.210
 in series end of gta iv gt to 5 and gta 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.149
 5 age and six and two cottages at 6 to 7 gta 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.710
 they'll do that ultimately optimizes 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.110
 the game for them to be better in 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.880
 better and that it attracts even more 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.200
 people that's what he was going to maybe 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.560
 that they will take for a madman but in 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.020
 made 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.270
 rockstar have already planned several gites 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.830
 and in advance in terms of history two 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.200
 protagonists and it was an accident 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.090
 for example we can not find 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.930
 I hope in this future gta there and without 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.030
 told me a lot about it 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.650
 the shower to have a small 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 pretty funny cinematics or in terms of 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.909
 toilet some pretty funny stuff 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.320
 like that to brush our teeth and where we have 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.909
 a lot of talk but it's something 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.200
 in my opinion that will not appear why 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.939
 do this stuff and especially to 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.590
 what is it going to serve not take a shower 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.900
 in gta 5 it's an interest too 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.729
 somewhere because actually 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.100
 finally we will remove all these 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.869
 traces of blood on oneself so you have to 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.670
 that if there is an interest in the game and 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.869
 especially also because rockstar are only 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.310
 not there and it's still this 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.610
 what did the roadster director say 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.189
 Nov 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.080
 they do not want to finally implanted finally 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.810
 planted on 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.610
 things in that game and that are going 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.230
 serve to actually finally a little 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.870
 strictly nothing here is you watch 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.630
 just this little simulation something 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.580
 said but who is I found that enough 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.950
 fun because finally the person did 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.540
 thought about what kind of things we are 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.820
 of interactions for example with the 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.630
 shower or for example be it I 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.860
 am not washing my hands 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.120
 or some pretty funny stuff like 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.620
 it may be that some people 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.020
 are going to find this stuff ah that's 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.670
 relou but in any case I think it 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.920
 can maybe also be assange is 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.360
 conceivable for a price I was I 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.970
 do not know what you think about it 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.650
 I find it rather fun especially 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.240
 to see just the person in the process of 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.040
 take a shower and that's it 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.840
 do his little thing tranquillou and you 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.190
 you can do nothing I think 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.380
 that you can sing but otherwise it's 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.570
 whatever good drinks term I've been 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.220
 pretty disappointed in this gta there for example a 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.740
 all con thing but the hot dog that is 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.209
 still something 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.430
 finally here we are going to say a term of 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.590
 food in the united states everything down 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.959
 that they fell everywhere 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.519
 we sell hot dogs and all in the 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.209
 street and wise and by all recently that 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.370
 GTA 5 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.950
 yet we have to los Santos so 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.819
 here we are in los angeles and where there is 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.370
 still drug sellers 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.480
 normally also here is the fact that we 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.190
 can not fit into some 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.930
 shops and where I find that very 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.640
 also disappointing not to see the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.260
 possibility as for example in gta 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.030
 iv we could go back he was not buying 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.040
 involved a little hamburger though but 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.540
 that he was eating in 5 seconds it was 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.489
 still so much fun so that I find 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.230
 it's very disappointing and I hope they will 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.610
 interact on it and maybe created from 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.370
 again in the end maybe we can get 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.500
 also say that gta 5 was designed from 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.000
 so that we can not eat 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.980
 in the game is really worth I speak 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.569
 here are two in a restaurant or take a 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.190
 something like that 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.260
 well it was more of a kind of mcdo 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.849
 we could where we could go but 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.650
 I think maybe it was designed 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.849
 also so that in gta if we can 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.709
 find those kinds of things that have 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.329
 extremely miss he knew it very 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.590
 well 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.599
 maybe if or if they want here they are 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.890
 wanted because in the old 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.379
 generations of consoles it's also 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.920
 difficult to develop this kind of game 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:57.630
 who are so fat and who has 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.850
 really need to be limited 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.650
 optimize thoroughly so basically in order to 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.240
 to make a picture quality is just 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.920
 you also have another view 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.430
 little simulation maybe he's risking 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.640
 to please you 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.710
 this is for example a trick 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.180
 with me I would have thought in a in his 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.190
 apartment squarely do his little 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.230
 food or stuff like that or so 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.850
 outright when we go to some sort of 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.230
 small supermarket that I stick to it can 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.900
 find a little in los angeles 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.070
 so we see the water santos and well the 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.870
 opportunity to buy little tricks 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.370
 I do not ask for a big this from 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.380
 food but that way we can quickly 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.480
 have a snack at home 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.250
 he has the interest would be simply to 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.050
 regain a little a gauge finally the gauge 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.550
 of his life may not be complete but 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.490
 here is gaining some accuracy of its 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.170
 life using a little bit of that kind 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.370
 of interaction that are rather fun and at 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.170
 her dreams 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.460
 this is something I think 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.110
 it can be once so it's the end 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.090
 of this video there I hope this 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.280
 video will please you I will send it too 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.040
 this video with star I think I hope 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.720
 not that I will give them ideas this 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.160
 I give them ideas it's really 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.630
 no good sign for them know they have 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.860
 not thought about that stuff and I 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.200
 think you really have to think about it 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.000
 any price in priority I will also talk 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.620
 of other things so if you can 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.330
 help me all thanks 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.320
 frankly it makes me great pleasure to 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.660
 help me because I can now I 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.210
 put a little more time to do this 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.470
 kind of videos there and then and then 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.580
 that's pretty much all wrong with his 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.260
 staff and then I tell you to 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.260
 the impressive fall show is out 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.750
 he
