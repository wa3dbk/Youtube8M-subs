focuses<00:00:55.530> which<00:00:56.039> will<00:00:56.219> make<00:00:56.370> more<00:00:56.579> sense<00:00:56.640> when

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
focuses which will make more sense when

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.939 
focuses which will make more sense when
we<00:00:57.149> go<00:00:57.210> into<00:00:57.329> population<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.620> for<00:00:58.800> right<00:00:58.890> now

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
we go into population but for right now

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.670 
we go into population but for right now
I'll<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.670> show<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.910> quick<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.410> is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
I'll just show you a quick on so this is

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.410 
I'll just show you a quick on so this is
not<00:01:01.949> just<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:04.070> province<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.820> affects<00:01:06.270> a

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
not just on a province it affects a

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.210 
not just on a province it affects a
region<00:01:07.140> which<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.619> see<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:08.010> these<00:01:08.159> are

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
region which you can see here these are

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.679 
region which you can see here these are
the<00:01:08.340> regions<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> world<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:12.000> put<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.299> here

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
the regions of the world so put one here

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.190 
the regions of the world so put one here
it<00:01:12.840> also<00:01:12.960> affects<00:01:13.140> here<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:15.049> but<00:01:16.049> let's

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
it also affects here and here but let's

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.920 
it also affects here and here but let's
just<00:01:16.409> see<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.340> two<00:01:18.000> national<00:01:18.450> focuses<00:01:18.840> we

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
just see we have two national focuses we

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.330 
just see we have two national focuses we
can<00:01:19.080> set<00:01:19.290> their<00:01:20.100> national<00:01:20.549> focus<00:01:21.110> will

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
can set their national focus will

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.880 
can set their national focus will
basically<00:01:23.600> push<00:01:24.600> something<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.259> happen<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.799> a

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
basically push something to happen in a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.830 
basically push something to happen in a
region<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.810> can

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
region so you can see here we can

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.170 
region so you can see here we can
attract<00:01:28.500> immigrants<00:01:29.040> migrants<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.939> 20

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
attract immigrants migrants of 20

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.370 
attract immigrants migrants of 20
percent<00:01:30.450> more<00:01:30.540> likely<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> choose<00:01:31.049> this

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
percent more likely to choose this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.730 
percent more likely to choose this
region<00:01:32.570> capsule<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.659> 50%<00:01:33.900> more<00:01:34.290> likely<00:01:34.680> to

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
region capsule is 50% more likely to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.370 
region capsule is 50% more likely to
build<00:01:34.890> railroads<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:37.020> wire<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.320> very

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
build railroads the wire is very

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.679 
build railroads the wire is very
important<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:37.950> promotion<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.540> can

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
important is promotion so we can

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.859 
important is promotion so we can
encourage<00:01:40.470> people<00:01:40.860> who<00:01:41.040> live<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.579> region

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
encourage people who live in this region

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.380 
encourage people who live in this region
to<00:01:42.869> become<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> certain<00:01:43.740> job<00:01:44.009> type<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.210> also

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
to become a certain job type we can also

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.870 
to become a certain job type we can also
increase<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> textile<00:01:46.500> industry<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.729> can

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
increase the textile industry so we can

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.880 
increase the textile industry so we can
make<00:01:48.000> people<00:01:48.180> want<00:01:48.509> these<00:01:48.689> things<00:01:48.930> more<00:01:49.290> we

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
make people want these things more we

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.800 
make people want these things more we
can<00:01:50.040> also<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.340> party<00:01:50.850> loyalty<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.509> can<00:01:51.659> make

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
can also do party loyalty so we can make

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.480 
can also do party loyalty so we can make
people<00:01:52.200> more<00:01:52.409> loyal<00:01:52.680> towards<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> certain<00:01:53.250> pie

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
people more loyal towards a certain pie

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.780 
people more loyal towards a certain pie
and<00:01:53.790> all<00:01:54.390> these<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:54.750> very<00:01:55.470> very<00:01:55.829> useful<00:01:56.009> for

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
and all these are very very useful for

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
hopefully that will solve our problem

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.310 
hopefully that will solve our problem

you<00:06:54.860> use<00:06:55.040> it<00:06:55.190> right<00:06:55.480> now<00:06:56.480> you<00:06:56.540> can<00:06:56.690> pretty<00:06:57.080> much

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140 
you use it right now you can pretty much

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.960 
you use it right now you can pretty much
just<00:06:57.260> ignore<00:06:57.680> population<00:06:58.250> and<00:06:58.370> never<00:06:58.550> use<00:06:58.760> it

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
except for national focuses but if you

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:05.600

then it can become very useful soft
search<00:07:05.870> tool<00:07:06.200> and<00:07:06.500> query<00:07:07.250> tool<00:07:07.960> so<00:07:08.960> that

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
search tool and query tool so that

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.080
