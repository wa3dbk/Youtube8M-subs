00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.769
 let's prepare oreo cookie cake 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:09.580
 the ingredients that we need are 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:11.980
 between 35 and 40 cookies oreo 200 grams 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.610
 of white sugar 400 of cheese type 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.519
 philadelphia 600 of cream 35% of matter 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.070
 fat 10 grams of gelatin 80's 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:23.199
 butter 180 milliliters of milk more 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.830
 a little 5 oreo more 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.259
 mini oreo to decorate we begin 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.490
 separating the filling cream from the 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.800
 cookies 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.840
 and we will reserve the cookies in a bowl 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.840
 and the cream we will dip it in a saucepan 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.670
 once we have all the creampie of the 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:49.399
 Cookies in the saucepan add the sugar and 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.199
 the philadelphia type cheese we what 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.839
 We use white label because it comes out 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.809
 Quite cheaper and does not change anything 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:59.360
 the taste we can also use this type 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.039
 of light cheese or with less fat though 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.170
 the cream will be left with a little bit of 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.170
 less body but we will subtract calories 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.420
 we are melting it slowly and it goes 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.400
 being a paste 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.790
 then we will add a splash of milk 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.680
 about 40 milliliters to help us 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.890
 that is not so thick and melt a 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.680
 little bit more now at 180 milliliters 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.720
 of milk added to a cup we are going to 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.250
 put the neutral gelatine 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.250
 we dissolve it well 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.390
 and we add to our cream we have 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.250
 than having the field over medium heat of such 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.850
 so that the cream does not boil and what 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.220
 we will keep like this a couple of minutes 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.080
 then we will remove the saucepan from the fire and 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.250
 we will throw the cream in a bowl so that 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.800
 go tempering a bit 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.260
 meanwhile we are going to crush the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.530
 cookies without the cream with a 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.479
 crusher or blender what you have 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.900
 and we will leave them very finite as a 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.900
 polvito 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:12.780
 Now let's separate from all the dust 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.780
 of cookies a little less than half 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:22.390
 and we reserve it and to the rest we add it 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.390
 butter in ointment 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.730
 we crush everything well and if we see that 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.460
 we need to add a little bit of 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.290
 milk too little enough to 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.290
 help us make a dough 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.020
 once we have the dough in our 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.030
 silicone mold we are going to add it and the 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.680
 let's crush to make the base of 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.599
 our cake 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.829
 we have to try to leave as much 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.829
 flat we can 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.230
 done this we will reserve it in the fridge 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:03.670
 while we continue with the next step 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.099
 that will be semi ride the cream 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.650
 If I say if I ride, I mean, no 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:13.140
 it is necessary to leave it very hard 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.140
 simply with enough consistency 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.010
 It is important not to separate from the 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.470
 blender you know that if you do not know 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.780
 could cut it is better to be attentive 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.930
 for 5 minutes because it also does not 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.819
 it takes nothing 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.909
 As you can see, it is not assembled at all 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.900
 so it does not yellowish peaks 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.390
 like other times 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.360
 and now we are going to add lass cream 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.840
 I pray little by little and doing 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.280
 enveloping movements with the spatula 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.280
 We are going to mix it well 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.070
 it's about that we have a kind of 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.070
 homogeneous museum 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.000
 in this part we have to insist 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.160
 quite because even if we get a 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.310
 Tiny cream then kuajara in the fridge 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.130
 for the gelatin now with the help of 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.260
 a mouthpiece and a pastry bag 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.080
 let's reserve two or three teaspoons 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.500
 of the cream and we're going to leave it in 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.500
 fridge 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.990
 we continue throwing the filling on top of 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.990
 our base 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.710
 and we're going to smooth everything we can 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.230
 with the help of a spatula or a 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.040
 what you have is important 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.930
 leave it well planito and we are going to put it 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.610
 to the fridge you know that we 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.100
 like to have the cakes a day to 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.090
 another but with about 4 or 5 hours in the 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.910
 fridge will be enough and we rescue the 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.910
 Oreo powder that we had left 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.890
 and that we had booked and we're going to 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.510
 extend for our cake with a lot 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:09.370
 careful and also leaving it very planito 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.200
 finally we rescue the cream that 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.230
 we had in the pastry bag and we do 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.990
 some little squares delimiting the rations 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.110
 of the cake that will be between 8 and 10 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.450
 rations finally we put the mini 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.490
 or if they are large we will leave them 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.010
 half of them will be placed and the 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.310
 we put back in the fridge for a while 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.320
 before unmolding it to demold the 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.420
 As the silicone molds we do not have 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.750
 to put a knife and simply with 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:41.569
 much care and a lot of love we will separate 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:44.330
 the mold of the plate 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:46.490
 and now we have our cake 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.069
 oreo cookies that as you see is like 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.749
 a giant oreo this cake we have 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.419
