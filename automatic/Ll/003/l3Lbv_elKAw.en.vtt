00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.099 

I<00:00:04.069> think<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.759> release<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.299> hearthstone<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.959> is

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
I think the release of hearthstone is is

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.560 
I think the release of hearthstone is is
really<00:00:07.379> important<00:00:07.740> for<00:00:07.859> Blizzard<00:00:08.210> at<00:00:09.210> a

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
really important for Blizzard at a

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.770 
really important for Blizzard at a
broader<00:00:10.049> level<00:00:10.849> it's<00:00:11.849> kind<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.269> step<00:00:12.599> out<00:00:12.750> of

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
broader level it's kind of a step out of

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.259 
broader level it's kind of a step out of
our<00:00:12.990> comfort<00:00:13.019> zone<00:00:13.530> it's<00:00:14.370> not<00:00:14.700> all<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:15.000> big

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
our comfort zone it's not all that big

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.730 
our comfort zone it's not all that big
far<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.690> step<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.110> know<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.290> a<00:00:16.320> warcraft

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
far of a step you know it's a warcraft

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.550 
far of a step you know it's a warcraft
game<00:00:16.920> but<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.790> being<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.630> accessible<00:00:19.320> right

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
game but just being so accessible right

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.410 
game but just being so accessible right
and<00:00:19.740> that's<00:00:19.890> really<00:00:20.220> exciting<00:00:20.550> previous<00:00:21.270> to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
and that's really exciting previous to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.880 
and that's really exciting previous to
this<00:00:21.540> you<00:00:21.810> know<00:00:21.870> all<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.050> our<00:00:22.230> games<00:00:22.440> have<00:00:22.740> been

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
this you know all of our games have been

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.310 
this you know all of our games have been
like<00:00:23.160> 50-plus<00:00:23.820> person<00:00:24.300> teams<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.050> have<00:00:25.140> been

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
like 50-plus person teams and have been

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.740 
like 50-plus person teams and have been
multi<00:00:25.770> year<00:00:25.980> development<00:00:26.430> cycles<00:00:26.940> and<00:00:27.180> we

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
multi year development cycles and we

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.270 
multi year development cycles and we
really<00:00:27.990> wanted<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.230> see<00:00:28.410> could<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:29.070> make<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280 
really wanted to see could we make a

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.490 
really wanted to see could we make a
game<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.940> lived<00:00:30.300> up<00:00:30.450> to<00:00:30.480> our<00:00:30.630> epic<00:00:30.990> standards

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
game that lived up to our epic standards

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.229 
game that lived up to our epic standards
but<00:00:31.950> as<00:00:32.040> much<00:00:32.189> smaller<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.700> scope<00:00:32.940> we're

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
but as much smaller in scope we're

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.939 
but as much smaller in scope we're
loosening<00:00:33.660> up<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.960> little<00:00:33.989> bit<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.589> we're

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
loosening up a little bit and we're

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.919 
loosening up a little bit and we're
developing<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:36.149> could<00:00:36.300> say<00:00:36.480> at<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.629> smaller

00:00:36.919 --> 00:00:36.929 
developing you could say at a smaller

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:39.020 
developing you could say at a smaller
scale<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.679> at<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> same<00:00:38.219> level<00:00:38.609> of<00:00:38.699> quality

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
scale but at the same level of quality

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.849 
scale but at the same level of quality
the<00:00:39.210> same<00:00:39.510> level<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.989> investment<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.620> same

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
the same level of investment the same

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.650 
the same level of investment the same
level<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.219> passion<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.820> what<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.239> really<00:00:42.480> want

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
level of passion and what we really want

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.239 
level of passion and what we really want
to<00:00:42.749> prove<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.019> ourselves<00:00:43.140> was<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.100> could

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:44.249 
to prove to ourselves was that we could

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:46.099 
to prove to ourselves was that we could
still<00:00:44.460> kind<00:00:44.609> of<00:00:44.730> go<00:00:44.820> back<00:00:44.999> to<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.329> old<00:00:45.390> garage

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
still kind of go back to that old garage

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:47.810 
still kind of go back to that old garage
programmer<00:00:46.800> days<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.309> small<00:00:47.579> team

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
programmer days of a small team

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.479 
programmer days of a small team
accomplished<00:00:48.390> means<00:00:48.600> something<00:00:48.960> really<00:00:49.050> fun

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.520 

so<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.610> started<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.120> team<00:00:57.870> within<00:00:58.110> blizzard

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
so we started this team within blizzard

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040 
so we started this team within blizzard
that<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.860> called<00:00:59.100> team<00:00:59.370> five<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.870> whole

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
that we called team five and the whole

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.200 
that we called team five and the whole
mandate<00:01:01.470> for<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.769> team<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.370> keep<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> team

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
mandate for the team was keep the team

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
mandate for the team was keep the team
very<00:01:03.449> small<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.159> think

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
very small and you have to really think

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.609 
very small and you have to really think
of<00:01:05.670> ways<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.390> develop<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.810> game<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.290> might<00:01:07.470> be

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
of ways to develop a game that might be

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.260 
of ways to develop a game that might be
non-traditional<00:01:08.130> within<00:01:08.700> Blizzard's<00:01:09.030> walls

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
non-traditional within Blizzard's walls

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.460 
non-traditional within Blizzard's walls
it<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> team<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.140> was<00:01:10.259> put<00:01:10.350> together

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
it was a team that was put together

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.710 
it was a team that was put together
specifically<00:01:11.190> for<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.520> title<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.630> have

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
specifically for this title and we have

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.290 
specifically for this title and we have
about<00:01:12.899> 15<00:01:13.860> hardcore<00:01:14.490> ninjas<00:01:14.909> who<00:01:15.030> kind<00:01:15.210> of

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
about 15 hardcore ninjas who kind of

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.790 
about 15 hardcore ninjas who kind of
jumped<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.170> really<00:01:16.409> want<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.649> get<00:01:16.740> a

Blizzard in the glorious Golden Age back
in<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.179> day<00:01:33.330> I'm<00:01:33.539> we<00:01:33.720> all<00:01:33.869> came<00:01:34.050> up<00:01:34.110> playing

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
in the day I'm we all came up playing

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.499 
in the day I'm we all came up playing
Magic<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.130> Gathering<00:01:35.160> in<00:01:35.670> Jihad<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.030> all

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
Magic the Gathering in Jihad and all

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.850 
Magic the Gathering in Jihad and all
sorts<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.899> card<00:01:37.110> games<00:01:37.170> when<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.619> when<00:01:37.830> that

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
sorts of card games when that when that

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.830 
sorts of card games when that when that
scene<00:01:38.160> was<00:01:38.340> really<00:01:38.550> blowing<00:01:38.789> up<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.330> I<00:01:39.570> think

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
scene was really blowing up so I think

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.090 
scene was really blowing up so I think
there's<00:01:40.140> something<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.649> fundamental

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
there's something really fundamental

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.399 
there's something really fundamental
about<00:01:41.850> TCG's<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:44.310> our<00:01:44.460> shop<00:01:44.820> anytime<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.869> we

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.659 
to play for a really long time but that
doesn't<00:04:53.560> necessarily<00:04:53.680> mean<00:04:54.100> that<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.520> game
