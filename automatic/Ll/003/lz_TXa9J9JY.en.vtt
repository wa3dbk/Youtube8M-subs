 Oh Domo is Ken Nakazawa writer longing a little straw and the office of the president of their own are belong to today 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.510
 A talk book of Asuka Kyo sensei 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:19.450
 Because I had a constitution, a little 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:23.110
 Better here if you can not let that little like a pleased to introduce this sound also serves as a thank 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.370
 Well, I am a member of the soccer office I belong to 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:32.580
 I'd remember the happiness of Yamaguchi SatoshiTaro Turtle Company 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:33.180
 The movement of Asukakyo sensor has been respected since I was a primary school student, but Okyo in front of Daikyo 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.520
 but 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:43.230
 Well then I love both of these two people, but well , well , I'm in front of the pussy is Hana Yamaguchi 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.160
 I heard that it is a faint flower, but I swear I'm swearing that if it is 212 people, it is Asuka faction 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.390
 But 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.149
 Both of us are really big list already 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.940
 It is going to go, and these two people are not the first time this time, so this kind of feeling stands in this talk 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:59.039
 Really something I Teru 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.820
 Once it is gone Do I say a little dangerous I mean content that well especially Yamanoi's 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.840
 But I do not know what is correct say that that the other whispered 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.399
 Such a thing because I am Well work also is well together 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:19.560
 The content like the one that I would like to enter is so great I'm sorry in the so-called political sense 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:25.159
 Even if there are talks, it is difficult to name various mediums and writers of the same industry, and various tough conditions. 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:29.689
 It's amazing I'm saying this is a book like a title that will usually reveal such intense Yaba information 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.130
 Well, the title is so but the big deal is that it is not written, and the pattern is written 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.899
 The author's name is 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:40.700
 It seems like it's decided that it's going to decide Maam It's a great irresponsible really a source of information 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:44.520
 Name aska's anymore their own nor Mr. Yamaguchi from him this book of I'd often 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:52.590
 Hey that Tteyuu are saying this only of things out 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:57.450
 No , it's difficult for me to fight so far, I'm too hostile to me 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.590
 It's name Te guy in the media quite like this but I have one's soccer and 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.479
 Place 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.540
 After all I think it's hard to say I think it's true I think I'm not touching the bookstore at all 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.720
 but 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:16.510
 In the fifth place really that other TV or something like that 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:21.720
 By all means Ya because things like not write can not say whether the are Truly full written 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:27.510
 By all means now that I really did not have this in-house but this was a really interesting book 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:29.000
 The taboo is exposing the intense yaba information that I could not talk on the dome TV 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.580
 By all means 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.710
 The Senkaku issue is also being tackled by the US 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:42.490
 It 's okay to write something like this , I'm a little worried with Japanese books like this 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:47.860
 If you just look at the table of contents, it may be a good idea to read it a little bit now 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:53.110
 Table of Contents apparatus to change the personality in that only one second case Toka this do is but the description is often of 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:58.330
 I think the Lost Kingdom Well, under such circumstances but it was a shocking already read this fine has been developed 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.600
 In the country where the name of the country is firmly turned , the opportunity to change the personality of a person in a moment is invented 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.720
 Thank you 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.560
