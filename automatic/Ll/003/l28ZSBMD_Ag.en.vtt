00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
dominant biglan I don't think there's

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.800

anybody<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.700> league<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:14.940> can<00:01:15.150> even<00:01:15.600> come

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
anybody in the league that can even come

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.190 
anybody in the league that can even come
close<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.170> Dwight<00:01:16.650> now<00:01:16.940> he's<00:01:17.940> so<00:01:18.240> fast

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
close to Dwight now he's so fast

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.440 
close to Dwight now he's so fast
and<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.680> things<00:01:20.890> he<00:01:21.040> does<00:01:21.070> defensively<00:01:21.490> just

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
and the things he does defensively just

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.960 
and the things he does defensively just
really<00:01:23.170> separates<00:01:23.740> him<00:01:23.950> from<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.610> rest<00:01:24.820> of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
really separates him from the rest of

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.410 
really separates him from the rest of
the<00:01:25.060> centers<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.540> this<00:01:25.630> room

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
the centers in this room

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.030 
the centers in this room
and<00:01:26.750> that's<00:01:26.900> why<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:27.110> teamed<00:01:27.440> I<00:01:27.620> think<00:01:27.860> they're

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
and that's why I teamed I think they're

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.770 
and that's why I teamed I think they're
draping<00:01:28.520> themselves<00:01:29.000> all<00:01:29.150> over<00:01:29.180> him<00:01:29.659> every

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
draping themselves all over him every

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.350

time<00:01:30.020> he<00:01:30.170> gets<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.440> ball<00:01:30.470> inside<00:01:31.100> he<00:01:32.000> has<00:01:32.180> to

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
time he gets the ball inside he has to

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.510 
time he gets the ball inside he has to
deal<00:01:32.540> with<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:32.780> lot<00:01:33.140> of<00:01:33.350> physical<00:01:33.740> contact<00:01:33.800> and
