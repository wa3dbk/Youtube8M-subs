00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.290
 Good night guys. 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.830
 I just installed the tv module from 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.990
 central multimedia jetta clarion 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.080
 try to explain some things here that 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.520
 what I've learned 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.500
 I bought a short time ago today is the second 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.960
 The day I'm stirring 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.789
 I'm still learning but let's go 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.160
 try to explain how to have a module 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:31.019
 of tv here the way to see what you can 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.300
 access it a touch on the screen the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.960
 garage then the sign here is a little 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.550
 weak 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.550
 the focus also weak here are 14 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.550
 stations 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.879
 so here it is of the four lines as 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.170
 four stations now what now 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:53.010
 globe and sbt and the network life is that you 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.590
 can select the changes by this 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:02.160
 earth or back here is here 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.439
 or direct in control using the motors 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.850
 down only correcting the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.650
 information that I gave forum problem 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.479
 saying that by pressing the button here the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.220
 bluetooth that you answered at the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.140

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.970
 phone number on the original car's 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.479
 attends has no nothing happens near 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.860
 this button but here the radio with you 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.990
 tighten the new name can not move on 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.400
 half the volume passes through the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.240
 radios 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:44.369
 the volume and passes the radio to the other 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:46.770
 here in the case of the channel grid that is 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.420
 passing in the case how to teach them to ride 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.820
 does not pass the next ones 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.130
 programs that will move the grid 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.899
 programming 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:08.270
 here is the configuration I have today man 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:11.360
 Portuguese English and Spanish Spanish 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:21.660
 English and Portuguese 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:28.280
 mode is is tsf power brightness control 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.280
 shine and rescue back 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.070
 I have a rain information system 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.660
 pressed and raucci system information 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:43.530
 or because it looks like the date and time 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:47.490
 the version to scan the channels 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.530
 laying here in these fields 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.870
 I can select individual frequency 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:58.740
 and what to do full quality scan 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.360
 very good sound well have the bass are 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.730
 more concentrated cool 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.580
 the definition is quite different from the 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.800
 of these switches you use the cable is 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.930
 this and I think the rs up to a bit of 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.520
 of sound quality is just what 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.959
 I have to tell the rest of the 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:25.530
 able to get the maps on the 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:27.780
 maps did not download by amapa radar point 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.320
 with the bad radars and managed to 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.110
 to install the radars in the 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.239
 goiÃ¢nia worked well and easy to 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:42.590
 install it just copy and paste it into the 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:48.000
 navigation and dedicating and then have the 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:51.930
 the sparrows takes pictures and also the 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.340
 traffic lights that have q have q also take 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.130
 photos and pass the red above the 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.660
 specific speed it speaks at the time 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.090
 when the picture-taking radar 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:05.130
 swimming speed control or just 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:07.880
 normal speed radar but thank you 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.880
 even more severe
