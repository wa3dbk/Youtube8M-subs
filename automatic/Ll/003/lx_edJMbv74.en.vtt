00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
and be a family along the way I think

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.619 
and be a family along the way I think
people<00:00:55.800> learn<00:00:56.399> more<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.359> they

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
people learn more and I think they

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.970 
people learn more and I think they
progressed<00:00:58.079> more<00:00:58.260> when<00:00:58.410> they've<00:00:58.559> got<00:00:58.739> love<00:00:58.949> in

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980

progressed more when they've got love in
their<00:00:59.219> lives<00:00:59.429> and<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.699> think<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.090> everybody

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
their lives and I think that everybody

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.779 
their lives and I think that everybody
all<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.289> teachers<00:01:01.739> give<00:01:01.949> them<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.340> much<00:01:02.519> love

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
all the teachers give them so much love

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.160 
all the teachers give them so much love
and<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.090> much<00:01:03.120> encouragement<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.899> that's<00:01:04.019> why

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
and so much encouragement and that's why

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.780 
and so much encouragement and that's why
they<00:01:04.320> keep<00:01:04.500> getting<00:01:04.680> better<00:01:04.830> because<00:01:05.519> they

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
they keep getting better because they

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.160 
they keep getting better because they
want<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> get<00:01:06.210> better<00:01:06.360> not<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:06.840> half

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
want to get better not because half
