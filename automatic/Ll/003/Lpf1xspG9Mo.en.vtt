00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
 then the vehicle should be on the move 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.150
 that's percent 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.940
 Puncture damage very likely or if that with the suspension so that 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.139
 Car at least 1 percent should be Ms. Homburger on Eric Pleskow accident 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.139
 how useful 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.589
 St 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.700
 which the company is involved in a role 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.750
 the start number 30 Karl Angerer from Wednesday a duel with milk this 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.170
 Aggressiveness of Allan McNish 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.480
 they hope that things went well, put the tire piles 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.100
 of course, a hit has not looked for judges now the safety 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.430
 Car is out logically her e10 car not relocated 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.290
 yes this is this cute game between GC and prototypes did not work 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.950
 the Ferrari has closed "the principle of the North Sea 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.100
 negotiated 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.000
 Roth used the liquidator ac3 Mel b tipped and principle unfortunately in one 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.510
 other direction 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.830
 catapulted as he wanted to drive unmanageable heavy impact in the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.300
 tire wall 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.420
 and percent hope that there neither the spectators nor the photographer and also 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.960
 if he did nothing 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.670
 because the fly some parts more 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.720
 As I said it was fierce but through the tire piles and the IT 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.799
 Safety of the vehicles we hope that the emergency service 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.970
 while Ferrari had sat Anthony Beltoise 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.810
 yes I think I could not see him in the rearview mirror you can see 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.970
 probably only 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.500
 a car 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.170
 at least they have more and more canteens one audi's in the other not 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.650
 12 SÃ©bastien Loeb moved in from Wernigerode and can call it that 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.729
 I guess he did not think that he is now north shore you can 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.810
 could not see that which clearly obscured that car buyers in between 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.250
 the evil accident of the scared faces at the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.460
 Pauli responsible earlier this year head of development Michael dick 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.960
 clearly there is what is built thank God breathe 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.000
 thank goodness shaken certainly 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.620
 speaks for the safety of the vehicles, thank God, absolutely great 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.539
 moving moments imprinted Wolfgang Ullrich 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:13.759
 that was looked violent 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.459
 cooperate and we have not been seen for many years 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.169
 I have to say application so 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.169
 fierce impact really 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.969
 Heinrich be honest I'm not so relieved but so completely 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.449
 calms the world that has been seen there but there is a lot of stamina 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:33.000
 And way, the spectators started there as well as downshot photographers 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.409
 Mule-post gone there I was not at all white 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.810
 that really all hail on Danube from this drifter 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.179
 are not affected 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.459
 is that very good, but in the end nothing happened is a guarantee 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.129
 is the hail really bad caught on the bike 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.159
 one has flown in so that's it 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.049
 an ugly thing that did not get along well anymore 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.080
 that was almost from both of today's security standards 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.400
 but expect such a horror impact but the big question is something he is 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.269
 happened behind the guardrail 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.209
 other than luck that it did not pass over the guardrail 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.230
 also that two adults fractions second home Burda on the 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.039
 would fly on the other side 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:09.819
 There was still a lot of trouble going on, which was the biggest 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.499
 Brooks factor that the car has not gone over the guardrail 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.579
 into the ProTour Count crowd in there 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.279
 after all, that was really not open 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.129
 flying parts
