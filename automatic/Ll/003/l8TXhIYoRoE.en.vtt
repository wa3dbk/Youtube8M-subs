lawn there are two main reasons why you

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.640 
lawn there are two main reasons why you
should<00:00:16.700> aerate<00:00:17.060> the<00:00:17.660> first<00:00:18.020> is<00:00:18.260> soil

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
should aerate the first is soil

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.850 
should aerate the first is soil
compaction<00:00:19.190> and<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:20.030> second<00:00:20.480> is<00:00:20.630> that<00:00:21.020> you

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
compaction and the second is that you

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.770 
compaction and the second is that you
can<00:00:22.040> easily<00:00:22.190> check<00:00:22.610> to<00:00:22.790> see<00:00:22.970> if<00:00:23.060> your<00:00:23.270> lawn<00:00:23.480> has

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:23.780 
can easily check to see if your lawn has

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.650 
can easily check to see if your lawn has
either<00:00:24.110> of<00:00:24.380> these<00:00:24.590> problems<00:00:25.660> compaction

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
either of these problems compaction

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.630 
either of these problems compaction
comes<00:00:27.020> from<00:00:27.320> weight<00:00:27.590> on<00:00:27.800> top<00:00:28.130> of<00:00:28.370> the<00:00:28.490> soil

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
comes from weight on top of the soil

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.210
