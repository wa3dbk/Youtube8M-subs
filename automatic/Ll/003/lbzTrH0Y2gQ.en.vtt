00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.850
 to decorate the pockets what we're going 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.210
 to do is leave the part that we are going to 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.210
 Bend 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.670
 in this case I'm going to make a cross 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.689
 then remember that this takes a 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.630
 stitching then we will work from 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.060
 here the long I do not know what they're going to 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.770
 do is what you want and go to 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.380
 depend on the drawing that you want 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.090
 do 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.090
 in this case I show you 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.430
 to 0 for example a cross 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.930
 with the machine that we have at home we go 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.930
 to tackle with the same machine 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.670
 so that we stay exactly the same is 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:58.180
 what we are going to do is we are going to give the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.490
 back with the other pocket we are going to join 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:06.820
 that we are well matched 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.820
 once we have it that way we squeeze 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:18.400
 and we will have the drawing too 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.400
 here what we do is re mark it 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.550
 this is so that we stay exactly 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.430
 in the same place the two silos 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.640
 remember that you are going to doubled 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.220
 folded and goes with the stitching we put 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.900
 side at the same height 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.520
 as you will see we are left exactly 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.220
 same now we go to the machine that you 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.940
 I show how we are going to do what 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.780
 let's do first is to bring 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.420
 the machine instead of going to be 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.840
 make buttonholes in case you have 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.000
 a similar machine we're going to put the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.370
 stitch at zero 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.620
 or 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.230
 if it is not in the same one with which they are made 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.900
 the eyelets and we will take you to the 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.090
 stitch number 5 that would be the stitching 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.569
 larger 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.970
 once we have it there we lower the 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.970
 Machine at the foot of the machine 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.280
 in this place and we started to work 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.370
 we rotate or we put the garment where 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.110
 let's do it again and go back to 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.680
 do the same work until you get to the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.680
 desired height 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.709
 then choose the threads that fit 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.749
 and there you have a way of doing 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.450
 then you have to wash and remove everything 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:04.549
 which are the spots and this way already 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.069
 decorate this one pocket then with the 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:10.840
 pespunte you will see how beautiful it is me 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.719
 what we are going to do now crush the 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.340
 topstitch and wear the seam again 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:20.720
 in the middle 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.300
 straight stitch jános csák is to say it 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.390
 we reach 0 and we will give the width 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.090
 of desired point 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.280
 to make the stitching with two threads 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.220
 as I say we are going to put two centuries 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.650
 we celebrated it with the two centuries and the 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.290
 we passed the two threads also 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.640
 once this is so with the same 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.890
 foot let's fold the garment for him 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.190
 the centimeters that you have left for 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.450
 Bend 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.840
 and we are going to give it 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.590
 the stitching always taking us 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.260
 guide that we have here of the foot then 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.709
 we support 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.930
 not so on the edge we left a little bit and 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.400
 we started to do normal sewing 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.400
 straight with two centuries 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.840
 once this step is done what we do 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.840
 is we put back 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.180
 just that the hairline of the foot 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.610
 As you can see here, it will be supported 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.070
 about the line that we have already made of 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.510
 backstitch 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.890
 we lower the needle 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.890
 and we are going to guide 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:39.580
 on this line that the foot does not pass the 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.580
 line that we have already cooked 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.380
 already in this way you have done the 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.410
 stitching with the drawing you want 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:56.699
 give in this case we made a cross 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:59.039
 you can also do any line 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.470
 what you want to do if not what is the 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:04.590
 so closed point I'm going to make another 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.919
 mold today I forgive another model with the zig 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.229
 more open zag where you can go playing 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.120
 with the embroidery that you want to make 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.400
 well I wanted to show that with a machine 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.440
 that we have in your house you can do 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.849
 cute embroidery without having to put 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.699
 other things 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.699
 to the machine and this machine has 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.680
 the little machines 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.110
 that are not machines have other 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.370
 names this is to address but in 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.520
 this case I am showing you that 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.260
 only with zero and zig stitches 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.570
 zag we are doing some beautiful 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.190
 Embroidery for pockets already in others 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.290
 the video I'll show you 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.330
 Different embroidery that we can make 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.190
 with the machines that we have in our 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.020
 house as well as letters and a lot 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.670
 of more good things I hope that I have 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.550
 liked this idea put it into practice 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:55.700
 and remember what I always say to you before 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.700
 to do it at work since you're going to 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.170
 use grabs small pieces of 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.930
 fabric that always when we cut 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:06.140
 they usually stay and they go out taking you andá 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.169
 practicing with different postures that 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.419
 you can do them 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.639
 remember that if you are going to use without 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:16.270
 in this case it has to be needle 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:20.080
 number 9 if it is thicker 16 and if it is more 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.969
 finite a needle number 9 yes good we 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.009
 we see in the next video I hope that you 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:26.099
 have served this idea and put it in 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.099
 practice
