of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> block<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.100> basically<00:01:11.760> everybody<00:01:12.450> is

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
of the block and basically everybody is

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.170 
of the block and basically everybody is
clogging<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.320> line<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.400> when<00:01:14.520> Brady

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
clogging up the line so then when Brady

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.780 
clogging up the line so then when Brady
tries<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> dive<00:01:16.320> he<00:01:16.619> dies<00:01:16.799> right<00:01:17.130> into<00:01:17.460> his<00:01:17.580> guy

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
tries to dive he dies right into his guy

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.880 
tries to dive he dies right into his guy
if<00:01:18.299> you'd<00:01:18.659> say<00:01:18.810> he<00:01:19.020> diving<00:01:19.380> right<00:01:19.560> into<00:01:19.710> his

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
if you'd say he diving right into his

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.940 
if you'd say he diving right into his
guy<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.630> he<00:01:21.630> doesn't<00:01:22.200> even<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.530> back<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
guy and he doesn't even get back to the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.710 
guy and he doesn't even get back to the
line<00:01:23.130> he<00:01:23.400> probably<00:01:23.640> actually<00:01:23.880> lost<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.509> few

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
line he probably actually lost a few

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.020 
line he probably actually lost a few
inches<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:26.159> right<00:01:26.369> there<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.610> how

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
inches and that right there is how

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.910 
inches and that right there is how
you're<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> stop

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.470 

so<00:01:35.920> once<00:01:36.100> again<00:01:36.250> let's<00:01:36.790> let's<00:01:37.060> look<00:01:37.210> at<00:01:37.360> that

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
so once again let's let's look at that

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.980 
so once again let's let's look at that
one<00:01:37.630> I<00:01:40.680> put<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:41.770> go<00:01:42.510> I'm<00:01:43.510> looking<00:01:43.750> at<00:01:43.870> this

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.400 
not at the science of how to do it
exactly<00:02:00.750> basically<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:01.780> have<00:02:01.870> my<00:02:01.990> two<00:02:02.050> guys

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
exactly basically I have my two guys

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.260 
exactly basically I have my two guys
rushing<00:02:02.830> in<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.040> this<00:02:03.490> is<00:02:03.640> clogging<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.090> line

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
rushing in and this is clogging the line

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.270 
rushing in and this is clogging the line
because<00:02:04.390> brady<00:02:04.720> is<00:02:04.840> trying<00:02:05.230> to<00:02:05.320> dive<00:02:05.830> where

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
because brady is trying to dive where

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.970 
because brady is trying to dive where
these<00:02:06.610> guys<00:02:06.850> are<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:08.110> basically<00:02:08.470> brady<00:02:08.680> dives

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:08.980 
these guys are so basically brady dives

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.980 
these guys are so basically brady dives
into<00:02:09.250> him<00:02:09.490> and<00:02:09.640> he<00:02:09.910> falls<00:02:10.149> pretty<00:02:10.690> much<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:10.960> the

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
into him and he falls pretty much on the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.320 
into him and he falls pretty much on the
line<00:02:11.050> once<00:02:11.440> again<00:02:11.590> it's<00:02:12.220> as<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.670> said<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:13.030> all

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
line once again it's as I said it's all

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.420 
line once again it's as I said it's all
about<00:02:13.450> trying<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.870> get<00:02:14.080> guys<00:02:14.290> right<00:02:14.710> there<00:02:14.740> to

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
about trying to get guys right there to

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.780 
about trying to get guys right there to
stop<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.180> penetration<00:02:16.810> from<00:02:16.930> happening

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:29.040 

there<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.910> go<00:02:22.060> just<00:02:22.450> like<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:28.050> like

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
there you go just like that just like

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.750 
there you go just like that just like
that<00:02:29.170> all<00:02:29.620> day<00:02:29.650> just<00:02:30.040> bring<00:02:30.280> up<00:02:30.400> all<00:02:30.610> those

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
that all day just bring up all those

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:40.650 
that all day just bring up all those
guys<00:02:31.000> you'll<00:02:31.660> stop<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.050> every<00:02:32.230> time

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.720 

you
