the steering wheel which you know it's

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.340 
the steering wheel which you know it's
fairly<00:01:24.060> common<00:01:24.270> nowadays<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.930> makes<00:01:25.110> such

a<00:01:25.470> difference<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.920> these<00:01:26.100> large<00:01:26.310> journeys

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
a difference on these large journeys

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
a difference on these large journeys
because<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.299> didn't<00:01:27.540> learn<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.810> drive<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
driving cruise control made a huge

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.920
