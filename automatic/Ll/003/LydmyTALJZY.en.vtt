 winter pool closure 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.140
 caution 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.379
 it is absolutely forbidden to listen to the pools because this operation 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.969
 could damage irreparably villain here hey 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.400
 however, it would force it to restore properly in the spring 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.770
 after the long and expensive police that can only be done by a technician 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.220
 specialized 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.580
 also never leave materials in the bottom of the pool because it could 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.580
 cause damage oh but who is to 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.170
 during the autumn and until the water temperature is above 12 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.570
 degrees Celsius the current and regular maintenance of the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.570
 pool 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.810
 when the water temperature drops below 12 carats we can start it 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.560
 active wintering 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.560
 which consists in keeping the filtration system operational even if in 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.560
 ritual manner 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.120
 to check once a month that the optimal values â€‹â€‹will be 7, 2 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.120
 same to you, you are 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.460
 if the ph is out of these values, make the correction of the minor disputes 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.990
 or easy plus 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.540
 before the winter closure also carry out a shock treatment 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.540
 with icycle arci 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.490
 during these treatments keep the filtration system running for 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.490
 24 hours 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.799
 daily filtering must be carried out in the coldest hours in 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.680
 kind early in the morning following the table in the guide for 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.680
 engine maintenance 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.810
 in the case of very cold temperatures 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.500
 that often make the system start below zero 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.159
 filtration for at least 6 times a day for a time of one hour each 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.519
 in an area where the temperature frequently drops below zero yes 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.989
 recommends the use of anti-freeze anti-friction testing system which starts 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.069
 automatically the pump when the outside temperature drops below two 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.859
 great 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:29.010
 The ideal water during the winter will always be around 10 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:32.009
 centimeters below the tiles of our rock edge 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.869
 too full by gravity 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:41.139
 guarantees the correct level but will need to be checked periodically 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.030
 that sucks of this discharge inside the writing 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.030
 he has not taken possession of leaves or anything 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.379
 if there is ice on the surface of the pool there is no ice 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.290
 worry 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.719
 and don't break Rome 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.010
 because it could cause irreparable cuts in the air 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.939
 is strongly recommended during the winter period to limit the 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.169
