00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 the lanus is good with you today we 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.390
 let's talk about casting as fiber 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.390
 glass 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.699
 with this is the first video of the subject 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.699
 We're going to do a massive molding. 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:32.360
 using a rigid shape because it is a 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:35.629
 cheaper and easier to produce 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.820
 so let's go step by step at work 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.559
 everything starts with mold making in the 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.399
 In my case I'll make the cast 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.129
 20mm offset or trim the 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.760
 tico-tico taking care to make the 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.760
 best possible 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.239
 We'll use a piece of mdf later. 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.760
 compensated to form a 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:03.859
 for easy removal 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.110
 After the finished piece I'll wear blankets 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.509
 because it is cheaper 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.840
 and then I eat mold is very narrow I 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.610
 I'm cutting into small pieces. 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.690
 larger molds do not have to cut one 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:22.399
 small work with epoxy resin sq 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:28.520
 2001 and deserving is sic 3154 which are 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:31.850
 old acquaintances here on the canal the way 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.229
 was isolated with very fine plastic that 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.640
 will allow is to disassemble form 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.610
 easy at the end 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.560
 It is important to observe and take 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.719
 process care so as not to tear this 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.840
 plastic and then we started to 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:52.909
 layered fibers and 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:56.750
 resin starting with fiber is very 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:00.619
 important to get all fiber well drunk 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.969
 make sure that it is absorbing the 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:08.030
 resin with this resin begins to 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:11.090
 work in 18 minutes she starts to 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.980
 reaction, it is important not to prepare 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.310
 resin in one go 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.980
 I preferred to prepare myself gradually and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.380
 median of the necessary is prepared more 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.890
 this also prevents waste of 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.890
 material 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.209
 the important thing is Capixaba in this 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.139
 compression and prevent blisters 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.139
 unwanted 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.980
 You need not be left one 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.580
 resin layer over the layers of 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:44.990
 fiber as the whole set will be 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.500
 I thought later that I missed the 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.130
 sequence of images of thinking in us is 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.640
 important to see even a little above 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:59.930
 gives shape and then think to close with 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.300
 plastic and think with another piece of mdf 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.930
 as was done in the background. 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.930
 is to tighten with clamps 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:13.430
 Good thanks to the classic you can see 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.460
 demoulding is very simple and these 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.850
 small burrs that remain 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.370
 that really did not lack material is 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.920
 Of course you do not have to leave much more 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.920
 this burr is a good sign in this case 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.570
 came back with your character is 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.960
 relatively simple 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.190
 give to use the sanding drill is 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.080
 Turkey 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.900
 the process is very smooth is a material 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.400
 which is soft to machine and at the same time 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:55.420
 very high resistance is important. 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.420
 always wear a mask and goggles 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:06.170
 the finish i have to use ypehu varnish 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.600
 to universum picking since I 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.710
 I put a detail in the way on the cable 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.650
 of this part 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.500
 in addition the greens is much faster 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.510
 to be made than a polish 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.250
 good staff just to complete and 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.440
 reinforcing need not be 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.540
 necessarily made a slingshot 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.760
 can be manufactured anything by piece 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.400
 It is so stiff even foot for a 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.310
 garden bench can be done with this 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.690
 material replacing the cast iron in 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.930
 some situations you want to have a 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.660
 exclusive bank this stuff will come out 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.660
 much cheaper than a production of 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.070
 a form of cast iron mold 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.890
 It's just that you guys can do it there. 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.560
 with simple materials and tools is a 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.500
 material is still a technique to be 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.170
 a little more explored certain staff is 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.540
 I hope you have enjoyed with 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.540
 A hug to everyone and until the next
