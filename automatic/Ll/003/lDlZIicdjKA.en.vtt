00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:03.500 
all right I bought one of those

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.270 
all right I bought one of those
helicopters<00:00:04.500> from<00:00:04.589> China<00:00:04.890> 18<00:00:05.400> bucks<00:00:06.170> to<00:00:07.280> float

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
helicopters from China 18 bucks to float

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.350 
helicopters from China 18 bucks to float
and<00:00:08.460> flew<00:00:08.550> around<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.880> little<00:00:08.970> bit

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
and flew around a little bit

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:18.950 
and flew around a little bit
crashed<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.080> few<00:00:10.230> times<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:14.030> yeah<00:00:17.960> there's

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
crashed it a few times and yeah there's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.220 
crashed it a few times and yeah there's
the<00:00:19.140> motor<00:00:19.400> motors<00:00:21.289> battering<00:00:22.289> electronics

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
the motor motors battering electronics

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.630 
the motor motors battering electronics
and<00:00:25.230> we've<00:00:25.320> got<00:00:25.470> an<00:00:25.590> extra<00:00:25.920> tail<00:00:26.160> rotor<00:00:26.460> with

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
and we've got an extra tail rotor with

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.689 
and we've got an extra tail rotor with
it<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.810> reverse<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.410> polarity<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.039> one<00:00:29.609> of

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
it so I reverse the polarity on one of

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.130 
it so I reverse the polarity on one of
the<00:00:29.789> motors<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.750> doesn't<00:00:30.960> run<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
the motors so it doesn't run the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.990 
the motors so it doesn't run the
opposite<00:00:31.529> way<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.630> I<00:00:33.630> got<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:35.090> fan<00:00:37.790> to<00:00:38.790> air

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000
