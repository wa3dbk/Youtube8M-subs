soccer knows that this match was
sensitive<00:03:09.579> match<00:03:09.819> not<00:03:10.510> because<00:03:10.750> it's

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
sensitive match not because it's

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.409 
sensitive match not because it's
important<00:03:11.409> and<00:03:11.560> Egyptian<00:03:12.370> li<00:03:12.489> but<00:03:12.969> because<00:03:13.299> it

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
was preceded by a lot of tension so the

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.770 
was preceded by a lot of tension so the
police<00:03:17.099> would<00:03:18.099> not<00:03:18.220> enforce<00:03:18.729> in<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.510> stadium

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
police would not enforce in the stadium

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.930 
police would not enforce in the stadium
and<00:03:20.079> outside<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.650> stadium<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.729> same

and outside the stadium and the same

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.240 
and outside the stadium and the same
happens<00:03:22.449> in<00:03:22.659> Cairo<00:03:23.049> Stadium<00:03:23.560> where<00:03:23.709> we<00:03:23.829> had<00:03:24.010> a
