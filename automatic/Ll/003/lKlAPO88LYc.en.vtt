drawing that shows two kidneys everyone
has<00:02:39.130> two<00:02:39.340> kidneys<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.780> ureters<00:02:41.260> which<00:02:41.560> is

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
has two kidneys and the ureters which is

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.100 
has two kidneys and the ureters which is
where<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.310> urine<00:02:42.670> goes<00:02:42.720> connect<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.960> the

where the urine goes connect to the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.790 
where the urine goes connect to the
bladder<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.940> when<00:02:45.940> we<00:02:46.150> look<00:02:46.510> at<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.810> CT<00:02:47.410> scan

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
bladder and when we look at a CT scan

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.070 
bladder and when we look at a CT scan
we're<00:02:48.310> looking<00:02:48.610> for<00:02:48.820> abnormalities<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.870> in

we're looking for abnormalities and in

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.530 
we're looking for abnormalities and in
this<00:02:50.380> set<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.710> drawings<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.790> can<00:02:51.820> see<00:02:52.300> what

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
this set of drawings you can see what

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.440 
this set of drawings you can see what
you<00:02:52.690> might<00:02:52.960> expect<00:02:53.770> to<00:02:53.890> see<00:02:54.220> if<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.820> patient<00:02:55.300> had

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
you might expect to see if a patient had

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.700 
you might expect to see if a patient had
a<00:02:55.480> tumor<00:02:56.110> which<00:02:56.710> ranges<00:02:57.250> in<00:02:57.430> sizes<00:02:58.710> nicely

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
a tumor which ranges in sizes nicely

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.890 
a tumor which ranges in sizes nicely
shown<00:02:59.980> on<00:03:00.160> these<00:03:00.250> drawings<00:03:00.580> so<00:03:01.450> let<00:03:01.630> me<00:03:01.720> show

shown on these drawings so let me show

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.680 
shown on these drawings so let me show
you<00:03:01.990> some<00:03:02.200> CT<00:03:02.680> scans<00:03:03.070> here's<00:03:03.880> how<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.150> kidneys

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
you some CT scans here's how the kidneys

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.990 
you some CT scans here's how the kidneys
look<00:03:04.960> when<00:03:05.620> we<00:03:05.800> give<00:03:06.070> that<00:03:06.280> either<00:03:06.520> nated

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
look when we give that either nated

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.360 
look when we give that either nated
contrast<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.810> kidneys<00:03:08.260> tend<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.860> look<00:03:09.010> white

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
contrast the kidneys tend to look white

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.520 
contrast the kidneys tend to look white
you<00:03:09.970> can<00:03:10.150> see<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.540> kidneys<00:03:10.990> are<00:03:11.020> functioning

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
you can see the kidneys are functioning

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.920 
you can see the kidneys are functioning
we<00:03:12.430> look<00:03:12.670> at<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.910> kidneys<00:03:13.300> and<00:03:13.480> we<00:03:13.600> see<00:03:13.780> the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
we look at the kidneys and we see the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.410 
we look at the kidneys and we see the
function<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.650> both<00:03:14.830> kidneys<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.730> the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
function of both kidneys and the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.960 
function of both kidneys and the
symmetric<00:03:17.080> function<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.770> the<00:03:17.950> kidneys<00:03:18.430> you

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
symmetric function of the kidneys you

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.750 
symmetric function of the kidneys you
can<00:03:19.150> see<00:03:19.390> also<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.020> blood<00:03:20.320> vessels<00:03:20.830> this<00:03:21.460> is

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
can see also the blood vessels this is

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.910 
can see also the blood vessels this is
within<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.180> minute<00:03:22.480> after<00:03:22.780> we<00:03:23.110> start<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.590> study

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
within a minute after we start the study

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.580 
within a minute after we start the study
if<00:03:24.310> we<00:03:24.880> wait<00:03:25.120> more<00:03:25.480> than<00:03:25.540> three<00:03:25.720> or<00:03:26.350> four

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
if we wait more than three or four

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.430 
if we wait more than three or four
minutes<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.130> we<00:03:27.370> rescan<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.120> kidneys<00:03:28.810> here's

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
minutes and we rescan the kidneys here's

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.250 
minutes and we rescan the kidneys here's
how<00:03:29.680> it<00:03:29.860> looks<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.790> kidneys<00:03:31.360> are<00:03:31.390> now<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:31.900> can

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
how it looks the kidneys are now you can

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.220 
how it looks the kidneys are now you can
see<00:03:32.440> they<00:03:32.590> look<00:03:32.800> white<00:03:33.390> excreting<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.420> urine

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
see they look white excreting the urine

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.380 
see they look white excreting the urine
and<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.470> urine<00:03:36.070> which<00:03:36.250> has<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.580> contrast<00:03:37.180> in

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
and the urine which has the contrast in

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.470 
and the urine which has the contrast in
it<00:03:37.570> is<00:03:37.720> nicely<00:03:38.440> seen<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:39.430> that's<00:03:39.520> -<00:03:39.880> normally

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
it is nicely seen and that's - normally

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.080 
it is nicely seen and that's - normally
functioning<00:03:40.810> kidneys<00:03:41.710> and<00:03:41.950> here's<00:03:42.730> one<00:03:43.060> more

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
functioning kidneys and here's one more

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.300 
functioning kidneys and here's one more
example<00:03:43.300> of<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:44.050> and<00:03:44.470> these<00:03:44.710> are<00:03:44.890> very<00:03:45.100> nice

there<00:03:48.370> is<00:03:48.580> something<00:03:49.210> going<00:03:49.570> on<00:03:49.720> let<00:03:50.350> me<00:03:50.440> just

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
there is something going on let me just

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.590 
there is something going on let me just
show<00:03:50.800> you<00:03:50.830> a<00:03:50.950> couple<00:03:51.190> examples<00:03:51.880> of<00:03:52.000> what<00:03:52.060> renal

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
show you a couple examples of what renal

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.290 
show you a couple examples of what renal
tumors<00:03:53.050> might<00:03:53.260> look<00:03:53.470> like<00:03:53.610> here's<00:03:54.610> one<00:03:54.970> case

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
tumors might look like here's one case

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.120 
tumors might look like here's one case
we're<00:03:55.630> looking<00:03:55.810> at<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.200> right<00:03:56.380> kidney<00:03:56.980> and

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
we're looking at the right kidney and

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.660 
we're looking at the right kidney and
I've<00:03:57.400> circled<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.800> tumor<00:03:59.800> that's<00:04:00.190> about<00:04:00.520> an

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
I've circled a tumor that's about an

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
I've circled a tumor that's about an
inch<00:04:00.910> in<00:04:01.180> size<00:04:01.800> here's<00:04:02.800> another<00:04:03.250> example<00:04:03.520> of<00:04:04.090> a

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
inch in size here's another example of a

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.130 
inch in size here's another example of a
tumor<00:04:05.140> in<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.530> patient's<00:04:06.040> left<00:04:06.400> kidney<00:04:07.140> you

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
tumor in the patient's left kidney you

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.990 
tumor in the patient's left kidney you
can<00:04:08.350> see<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.860> measure<00:04:09.190> is<00:04:09.400> probably<00:04:09.850> about

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
can see this measure is probably about

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.200 
can see this measure is probably about
four<00:04:10.840> or<00:04:10.870> five<00:04:11.170> inches<00:04:11.500> in<00:04:11.740> size<00:04:12.100> is<00:04:12.460> a<00:04:12.520> larger

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
four or five inches in size is a larger

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.289 
four or five inches in size is a larger
tumor<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:14.140> can<00:04:14.170> see<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.680> extent<00:04:15.130> of<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:15.490> or<00:04:15.760> in

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
tumor you can see the extent of it or in

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.870 
tumor you can see the extent of it or in
this<00:04:16.510> case<00:04:16.870> with<00:04:17.410> a<00:04:17.440> more<00:04:17.739> extensive<00:04:18.190> tumor

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
this case with a more extensive tumor

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.000 
this case with a more extensive tumor
well<00:04:19.420> not<00:04:19.630> only<00:04:19.840> is<00:04:20.170> there<00:04:20.380> a<00:04:20.410> tumor<00:04:20.799> in<00:04:20.890> the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
well not only is there a tumor in the

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.730 
well not only is there a tumor in the
kidney<00:04:21.549> but<00:04:22.150> it's<00:04:22.330> spread<00:04:22.720> into<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.290> venous
