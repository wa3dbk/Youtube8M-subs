00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
have that gleam and carbon fiber I mean

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.270 
have that gleam and carbon fiber I mean
I<00:03:20.990> ain't<00:03:21.320> really<00:03:21.440> going<00:03:21.710> to<00:03:21.770> do<00:03:21.890> a<00:03:21.920> carbon

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
I ain't really going to do a carbon

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
fiber fix on these that carbon fiber is

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.420 
fiber fix on these that carbon fiber is
okay<00:03:25.010> with<00:03:25.190> me<00:03:26.680> only<00:03:27.680> time<00:03:27.890> I'm<00:03:28.070> really<00:03:28.280> going

that<00:03:31.370> checkered<00:03:31.940> carbon<00:03:32.450> fiber<00:03:33.010> I'll<00:03:34.010> do<00:03:34.160> a

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
that checkered carbon fiber I'll do a

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.660 
that checkered carbon fiber I'll do a
fix<00:03:34.580> if<00:03:34.760> it<00:03:35.270> comes<00:03:35.480> like<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:35.959> souls<00:03:36.830> are<00:03:37.010> icy

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
fix if it comes like that souls are icy
