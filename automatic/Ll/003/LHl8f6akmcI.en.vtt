00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
coming up on YouTube which they're most

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.999 
coming up on YouTube which they're most
likely<00:01:27.330> already<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.320> then<00:01:28.710> they<00:01:28.829> can

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
likely already on and then they can

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.440 
likely already on and then they can
interact<00:01:29.189> with<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.640> live<00:01:29.850> stream<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.299> just

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
interact with your live stream and just

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.390 
interact with your live stream and just
already<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:31.049> there<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.950> people<00:01:32.189> who<00:01:32.280> are

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
already be there so the people who are

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.010 
already be there so the people who are
already<00:01:32.579> established<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.270> YouTube<00:01:33.630> would

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
already established on YouTube would

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.960 
already established on YouTube would
probably<00:01:34.710> use<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:35.189> over<00:01:35.549> something<00:01:35.939> like

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
probably use this over something like

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.999 
probably use this over something like
twitch<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.259> easier<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.890> get

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
twitch because it's just easier to get

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.499 
twitch because it's just easier to get
their<00:01:38.159> audience<00:01:38.520> involved<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.150> would

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
their audience involved and would

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.060 
their audience involved and would
probably<00:01:39.930> give<00:01:40.079> them<00:01:40.259> higher<00:01:40.530> numbers

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
probably give them higher numbers

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.410 
probably give them higher numbers
something<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.759> would<00:01:41.880> make<00:01:42.030> me<00:01:42.150> want<00:01:42.360> to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
something that would make me want to

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.090 
something that would make me want to

to do that is to give everyone quality
options<00:01:55.979> which<00:01:56.280> claims<00:01:56.610> they<00:01:56.759> can't<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.149> this

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
options which claims they can't do this

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.700 
options which claims they can't do this
for<00:01:57.509> small<00:01:57.719> streamers<00:01:58.110> because<00:01:58.409> they<00:01:58.500> don't

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
for small streamers because they don't

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.709 
for small streamers because they don't
have<00:01:58.770> enough<00:01:59.159> money<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.820> they<00:02:00.329> don't<00:02:00.479> really

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
have enough money and they don't really

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.910 
have enough money and they don't really
have<00:02:00.840> enough<00:02:00.869> people<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.380> really<00:02:01.680> make<00:02:01.890> this

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
have enough people to really make this

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130 
have enough people to really make this
happen<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.430> guess<00:02:02.490> well<00:02:03.030> Google<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.600> one<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
happen I guess well Google is one of the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.109 
happen I guess well Google is one of the
richest<00:02:04.560> companies<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> world<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.700> they

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
richest companies in the world and they

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.819 
richest companies in the world and they
could<00:02:06.329> definitely<00:02:06.659> do<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.649> would

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
could definitely do this and this would

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.900 
could definitely do this and this would
definitely<00:02:08.129> make<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.250> lot<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.670> smaller

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
definitely make a lot of the smaller

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.309 
definitely make a lot of the smaller
streamers<00:02:09.270> come<00:02:09.450> over<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.660> Google<00:02:09.989> because<00:02:10.110> a

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
streamers come over to Google because a

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.660 
streamers come over to Google because a
lot<00:02:10.590> more<00:02:10.739> people<00:02:11.039> would<00:02:11.099> actually<00:02:11.340> be<00:02:11.580> able

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
lot more people would actually be able

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.050 
lot more people would actually be able
to<00:02:11.790> watch<00:02:12.000> them<00:02:12.300> because<00:02:12.780> if

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
to watch them because if

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.330 
to watch them because if
no<00:02:13.390> not<00:02:13.750> everyone<00:02:14.140> has<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.530> best<00:02:14.890> internet

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
no not everyone has the best internet

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.070 
no not everyone has the best internet
and<00:02:15.550> not<00:02:15.640> everyone<00:02:16.120> can<00:02:16.300> load<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.569> stream<00:02:16.930> at

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
and not everyone can load a stream at

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.140 
and not everyone can load a stream at
source<00:02:17.410> quality<00:02:17.739> so<00:02:18.430> this<00:02:18.550> would<00:02:18.700> be<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.849> big

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
source quality so this would be a big

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.670 
source quality so this would be a big
step<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.599> favor<00:02:19.870> for<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.170> lot<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:20.470> small

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
step in favor for a lot of small

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.380 
step in favor for a lot of small
streamers<00:02:21.069> to<00:02:21.280> youtube<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:21.910> something<00:02:22.300> i

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
really see it is if they draw up a

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.250 
really see it is if they draw up a
contract<00:03:09.010> like<00:03:09.489> MLG<00:03:09.940> TV<00:03:10.360> did<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:10.930> actually

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260
