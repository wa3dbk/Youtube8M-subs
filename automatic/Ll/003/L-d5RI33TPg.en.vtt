00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:25.289
 video of this simulator in 2015 but faro 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:28.590
 not a gameplay is more a tutorial or 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.859

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.390
 so cool 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.400
 we have is the symbol of the euro and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.720
 amount of money we have to 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.450
 start the game 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.969
 I'm not recording in my recording 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.550
 of gameplay to which you are making my 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.120
 success or actually farm series 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.829
 my farm or thriving on the farm 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.590
 I'm not playing in it, I did. 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.780
 another recording to do this tutorial 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.220
 As you can see there we have five 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.490

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.490
 there are those who like I can like and I can 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.290
 not liking but the tip is for who 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.670
 either because you start with little 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.509
 money you have are many 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.310

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.409
 can buy as you can see here 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.560
 Let's look at an example of the 63 families each 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.070
 one of them here have prices and capacities 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.689
 many different 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.720
 this first one here you want to buy 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.680
 that you start with it with only one 105 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.189
 one thousand euros 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.990
 impossible for you to buy with 5,989 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.810
 we have up to the value of 415 thousand 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.170
 so if you want to be playing like this 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.329
 like money or just just try 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.670

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.100
 you can use editorial that is the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.950
 infinite money tutorial 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.290

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:11.220
 world start we're going to here 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:12.959
 part of the save and let's do is is the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.870
 Putting this money, let's say 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.760

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.970
 let's go there 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.680
 searched for the most 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.010

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.630
 nine hundred and something but there is that 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.740
 reduce because the passage of time is the 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.120
 maintenance of farm equipment 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.140
