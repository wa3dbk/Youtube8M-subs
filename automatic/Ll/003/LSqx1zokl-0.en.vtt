it<00:00:27.849> is<00:00:27.970> brittle<00:00:28.539> you<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:30.039> use<00:00:30.489> this<00:00:30.729> in<00:00:30.999> your

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
it is brittle you can use this in your

the dried beef in a food processor I
guess<00:00:59.110> you<00:00:59.260> could<00:00:59.410> use<00:00:59.590> a<00:00:59.620> blender<00:01:00.220> or<00:01:00.460> a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
guess you could use a blender or a

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.150 
guess you could use a blender or a
mortar<00:01:00.970> and<00:01:01.120> pestle<00:01:01.739> you're<00:01:02.739> going<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:02.950> want

to<00:01:03.220> get<00:01:03.400> this<00:01:03.640> you<00:01:04.000> know<00:01:04.770> finely<00:01:05.770> shredded<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
to get this you know finely shredded the

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.630 
to get this you know finely shredded the
food<00:01:08.289> processor<00:01:08.950> was<00:01:09.100> definitely<00:01:09.549> the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
food processor was definitely the

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.609 
food processor was definitely the
easiest<00:01:09.869> way<00:01:10.869> to<00:01:10.899> do<00:01:11.200> it<00:01:11.380> I<00:01:11.969> uh<00:01:12.969> I<00:01:13.840> guess<00:01:14.350> you

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
easiest way to do it I uh I guess you

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.349 
easiest way to do it I uh I guess you
could<00:01:14.770> use<00:01:14.979> a<00:01:15.009> blender<00:01:15.520> but<00:01:15.729> here<00:01:15.909> you<00:01:16.030> see<00:01:16.060> how

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:16.359 
could use a blender but here you see how

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.080 
could use a blender but here you see how
powdery<00:01:16.869> it<00:01:17.079> is<00:01:17.259> I'm<00:01:17.619> adding<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:18.850> my

out<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.350> see<00:02:20.380> how<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.680> tasted<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.940> also<00:02:22.570> wanted

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
out to see how it tasted I also wanted

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.010 
out to see how it tasted I also wanted
to<00:02:23.080> see<00:02:23.260> if<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.530> could<00:02:23.590> cut<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.450> suet<00:02:25.450> content

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
to see if I could cut the suet content

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.440 
to see if I could cut the suet content
of<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.200> recipe<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:26.980> guess<00:02:27.550> what<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.120> can't

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
of the recipe and guess what you can't

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.980 
of the recipe and guess what you can't
it<00:02:28.750> says<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.350> cup<00:02:29.710> of<00:02:29.890> suet<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:31.420> need<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.780> use<00:02:31.960> a

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
it says a cup of suet you need to use a

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.490 
it says a cup of suet you need to use a
cup<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.620> rendered<00:02:32.980> suet<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:33.640> your<00:02:33.790> recipe<00:02:34.500> I

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
cup of rendered suet in your recipe I

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.000 
cup of rendered suet in your recipe I
will<00:02:36.040> post<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.520> amounts<00:02:37.480> below<00:02:37.930> since<00:02:38.830> it's

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
will post the amounts below since it's

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.190 
will post the amounts below since it's
deer<00:02:39.280> hunting<00:02:39.610> season<00:02:39.850> I<00:02:40.270> would<00:02:40.390> bet<00:02:41.170> that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
deer hunting season I would bet that

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.690 
deer hunting season I would bet that
this<00:02:41.500> would<00:02:41.710> be<00:02:41.860> really<00:02:42.130> good<00:02:42.460> with<00:02:42.670> some

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
this would be really good with some

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.920 
this would be really good with some
venison<00:02:43.450> I<00:02:44.100> did<00:02:45.100> not<00:02:45.310> die<00:02:45.640> we<00:02:46.570> haven't<00:02:46.810> been

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
venison I did not die we haven't been

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.900 
venison I did not die we haven't been
lucky<00:02:47.200> enough<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.530> get<00:02:47.770> a<00:02:47.830> deer<00:02:48.130> yet<00:02:48.370> this<00:02:48.580> year

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
lucky enough to get a deer yet this year

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.050 
lucky enough to get a deer yet this year
so<00:02:49.840> I'm<00:02:50.620> using<00:02:51.070> a<00:02:51.870> beef<00:02:52.870> for<00:02:53.140> my<00:02:53.290> recipe

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
so I'm using a beef for my recipe

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.540 
so I'm using a beef for my recipe
this<00:02:55.060> will<00:02:55.930> definitely<00:02:56.200> store<00:02:56.740> for<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.070> very

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
this will definitely store for a very

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.180 
this will definitely store for a very
very<00:02:57.700> long<00:02:58.060> time<00:02:58.330> I<00:02:59.050> would<00:02:59.410> think<00:02:59.740> that<00:02:59.890> if<00:03:00.070> you

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
very long time I would think that if you

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.280 
very long time I would think that if you
added<00:03:00.459> nuts<00:03:00.910> that<00:03:01.300> it<00:03:01.420> would<00:03:01.540> go<00:03:01.720> rancid

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
added nuts that it would go rancid

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.240 
added nuts that it would go rancid
quicker<00:03:02.770> because<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:04.060> oil<00:03:04.300> content<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:06.130> was

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
quicker because the oil content that was

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.830 
quicker because the oil content that was
one<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.550> big<00:03:06.730> reasons<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:07.330> wanted<00:03:07.600> to<00:03:07.690> make

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
one of the big reasons I wanted to make

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.040 
one of the big reasons I wanted to make
this<00:03:08.050> how<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.680> Indians<00:03:09.310> made<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.880> I<00:03:10.510> want<00:03:10.959> to

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
this how the Indians made it I want to

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.230 
this how the Indians made it I want to
do<00:03:11.170> an<00:03:11.290> experiment<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:12.010> see<00:03:12.310> how<00:03:12.550> long<00:03:13.060> the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
do an experiment to see how long the

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.500 
do an experiment to see how long the
stuff<00:03:13.540> will<00:03:13.780> actually<00:03:14.260> last<00:03:14.970> they<00:03:15.970> said<00:03:16.270> four

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
stuff will actually last they said four

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.120 
stuff will actually last they said four
years<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.480> want<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.080> I<00:03:20.290> want<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.650> test<00:03:20.920> that

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
years so I want to I want to test that

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.690 
years so I want to I want to test that
theory<00:03:21.459> out<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:23.620> does<00:03:23.860> taste<00:03:24.130> good<00:03:24.280> I'm<00:03:24.550> just

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
theory out it does taste good I'm just

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.390 
theory out it does taste good I'm just
hoping<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.090> lasts<00:03:25.390> that<00:03:25.630> long<00:03:26.100> but<00:03:27.100> here<00:03:27.310> you

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
hoping that lasts that long but here you

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.640 
hoping that lasts that long but here you
can<00:03:27.580> see<00:03:27.760> it's<00:03:27.910> starting<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.450> wide<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:29.200> bind<00:03:29.410> up

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
can see it's starting to wide to bind up

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
can see it's starting to wide to bind up
pretty<00:03:29.890> quick<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.450> lined<00:03:32.080> a<00:03:32.320> glass<00:03:32.680> pan<00:03:33.100> here

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
pretty quick so I lined a glass pan here

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.699 
pretty quick so I lined a glass pan here
and<00:03:34.019> with<00:03:35.019> parchment<00:03:35.500> paper<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:37.680> what<00:03:38.680> I

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
and with parchment paper and the what I

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.680 
and with parchment paper and the what I
originally<00:03:38.950> had<00:03:39.459> made<00:03:39.670> this<00:03:39.850> I<00:03:40.060> made<00:03:40.269> it<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.510> lot

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
originally had made this I made it a lot

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.140 
originally had made this I made it a lot
thinner<00:03:41.110> I<00:03:41.799> definitely<00:03:42.580> think<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.910> would<00:03:43.000> be

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
thinner I definitely think it would be

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.880 
thinner I definitely think it would be
better<00:03:43.360> if<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.690> made<00:03:43.959> it<00:03:43.989> about<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.350> half<00:03:44.620> inch

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
better if you made it about a half inch

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.070 
better if you made it about a half inch
thick<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.810> I'm<00:03:47.140> going<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.940> be<00:03:48.940> pushing<00:03:49.810> this

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
thick so I'm going to be pushing this

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.750 
thick so I'm going to be pushing this
down<00:03:50.320> into<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.709> pan<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.780> forming<00:03:52.780> it<00:03:52.870> into

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
down into the pan and forming it into

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.420 
down into the pan and forming it into
about<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:54.820> half<00:03:55.120> inch<00:03:55.360> thick<00:03:55.510> slab<00:03:56.290> so<00:03:57.160> I<00:03:57.190> can

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
about a half inch thick slab so I can

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.930 
about a half inch thick slab so I can
cut<00:03:57.580> it<00:03:57.700> into<00:03:57.880> little<00:03:58.180> candy<00:03:58.720> bars<00:03:59.790> candy<00:04:00.790> bar

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
cut it into little candy bars candy bar

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.630 
cut it into little candy bars candy bar

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.730 
and like I said about a half-inch thick
slab<00:04:55.130> I'm<00:04:55.490> going<00:04:55.640> to<00:04:55.700> try<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:56.320> make<00:04:57.320> it<00:04:57.380> so<00:04:57.710> that

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
slab I'm going to try to make it so that

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.730 
slab I'm going to try to make it so that
I<00:04:57.890> have<00:04:58.130> nice<00:04:58.370> even<00:04:59.110> edges<00:05:00.110> so<00:05:00.350> when<00:05:00.470> I<00:05:00.530> cut<00:05:00.860> it

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740

and<00:05:03.740> I<00:05:03.860> tried<00:05:04.160> to<00:05:04.370> roll<00:05:04.940> this<00:05:05.210> out<00:05:05.420> with<00:05:05.930> a

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
and I tried to roll this out with a

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.900 
and I tried to roll this out with a
rolling<00:05:06.530> pin<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:07.070> first<00:05:07.400> time<00:05:08.080> I<00:05:09.220> I<00:05:10.220> came<00:05:10.550> to

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
rolling pin the first time I I came to

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.780 
rolling pin the first time I I came to
the<00:05:11.000> conclusion<00:05:11.150> it's<00:05:11.690> a<00:05:11.810> lot<00:05:11.990> easier<00:05:12.170> to<00:05:12.740> uh

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
the conclusion it's a lot easier to uh

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.570 
the conclusion it's a lot easier to uh
