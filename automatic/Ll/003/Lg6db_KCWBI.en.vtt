too old for this
but<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.559> turns<00:00:10.860> out<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.309> pretty<00:00:11.519> good<00:00:11.759> fit

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
but it turns out it's a pretty good fit

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.660

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
process now I wasn't too impressed with

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.720 
process now I wasn't too impressed with
the<00:00:30.900> art<00:00:31.170> style<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.859> game<00:00:31.980> that's<00:00:32.369> not<00:00:32.579> to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
the art style of this game that's not to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.490 
the art style of this game that's not to
say<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.000> doesn't<00:00:33.180> look<00:00:33.420> good<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:34.140> nothing

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
say it doesn't look good just nothing

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.049 
say it doesn't look good just nothing
really<00:00:34.530> caught<00:00:34.980> my<00:00:35.160> eye<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.550> some<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
really caught my eye in some of the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.360 
really caught my eye in some of the
levels<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.899> thought<00:00:37.230> needed<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.739> level

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
levels that I thought needed it level

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.310 
levels that I thought needed it level
presentation<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> whole<00:00:39.510> was<00:00:39.780> quite<00:00:40.020> dull

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
presentation on the whole was quite dull

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.979 
presentation on the whole was quite dull
and<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.860> felt<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.250> was<00:00:41.430> lacking<00:00:41.670> detail<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and I felt it was lacking detail and

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.569 
and I felt it was lacking detail and
that<00:00:43.110> made<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.469> bit<00:00:43.649> harder<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.100> me<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.280> get

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
that made it a bit harder for me to get

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.490 
that made it a bit harder for me to get
into<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> game<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> overworld<00:00:46.230> of

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
into the game but the overworld of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.040 
into the game but the overworld of
Ninjago<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.399> cool<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.940> fly<00:00:48.149> around<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
Ninjago is cool to fly around in and the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.750 
Ninjago is cool to fly around in and the
vehicle<00:00:49.590> based<00:00:49.800> levels<00:00:50.250> were<00:00:50.430> better

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
vehicle based levels were better

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.330 
vehicle based levels were better
presented<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.420> my<00:00:51.930> opinion<00:00:52.440> character

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
presented in my opinion character

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.729 
presented in my opinion character
animations<00:00:54.000> were<00:00:54.180> really<00:00:54.690> good<00:00:54.899> especially

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
animations were really good especially

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.010 
animations were really good especially
when<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.039> combat<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.730> added<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> gameplay

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
when in combat and added to the gameplay

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.799 
when in combat and added to the gameplay
experience<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.730> fun<00:01:00.059> trying<00:01:00.359> out<00:01:00.539> all

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
experience and it is fun trying out all

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.569 
experience and it is fun trying out all
the<00:01:00.930> different<00:01:01.289> characters<00:01:01.500> checking<00:01:02.489> out

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the different characters checking out

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.830 
the different characters checking out
all<00:01:02.789> their<00:01:03.000> different<00:01:03.329> quirks<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
all their different quirks and

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.109 
all their different quirks and
animations<00:01:04.439> loads<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.460> choose<00:01:05.700> from<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.090> well

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
animations loads to choose from as well

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.630 
animations loads to choose from as well
like<00:01:07.049> all<00:01:07.260> Lego<00:01:07.500> games<00:01:07.830> there<00:01:08.070> was<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> strong

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
like all Lego games there was a strong

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.399 
like all Lego games there was a strong
sense<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.090> humor<00:01:09.420> throughout<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.960> game<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
sense of humor throughout the game and

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.590 
sense of humor throughout the game and
honestly<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.159> thought<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.610> was<00:01:11.820> pretty<00:01:12.150> comical

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
honestly I thought it was pretty comical

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.390 
honestly I thought it was pretty comical
at<00:01:12.869> times<00:01:13.170> even<00:01:13.500> though<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.979> pretty<00:01:14.250> much

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
at times even though this is pretty much

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.969 
at times even though this is pretty much
for<00:01:14.670> kids<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.299> expected<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.350> be<00:01:16.500> pretty

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
for kids I expected it to be pretty

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.340 
for kids I expected it to be pretty
rubbish<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.909> was<00:01:18.060> pleasantly<00:01:18.810> surprised

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
rubbish and I was pleasantly surprised

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.429 
rubbish and I was pleasantly surprised
awesome<00:01:20.340> soundtrack<00:01:20.700> 2<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.869> even

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
awesome soundtrack 2 for this one I even

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.469 
awesome soundtrack 2 for this one I even
enjoyed<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> music<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.549> option<00:01:24.060> screen

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
enjoyed the music on the option screen

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.350 
enjoyed the music on the option screen
so<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.560> expect<00:01:26.070> more<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.759> same<00:01:27.000> game

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
so you can expect more of the same game

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.969 
so you can expect more of the same game
player<00:01:27.689> you're<00:01:27.960> already<00:01:28.229> used<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
player you're already used to and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.980 
player you're already used to and
probably<00:01:29.820> loved<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.299> you're<00:01:30.509> anything<00:01:30.750> like

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
probably loved if you're anything like

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.230 
probably loved if you're anything like
me<00:01:31.049> although<00:01:31.500> there<00:01:32.250> wasn't<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.700> great<00:01:32.970> deal<00:01:33.180> of

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
me although there wasn't a great deal of

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.390 
me although there wasn't a great deal of
building<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.350> which<00:01:34.560> sounds<00:01:35.009> strange

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
building going on which sounds strange

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.580 
building going on which sounds strange
but<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.030> was<00:01:36.150> more<00:01:36.329> about<00:01:36.570> pulling<00:01:36.960> levers<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
but it was more about pulling levers and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.520 
but it was more about pulling levers and
figuring<00:01:38.490> out<00:01:38.670> simple<00:01:39.180> puzzles<00:01:39.600> rather<00:01:40.229> than

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
figuring out simple puzzles rather than
