camping<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.470> do<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.619> lot<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.890> moving<00:01:53.579> around<00:01:53.790> from

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
camping I do a lot of moving around from

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.080 
camping I do a lot of moving around from
place<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.810> place<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.700> when<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.790> get<00:01:56.909> into

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
place to place and when you get into

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.459 
place to place and when you get into
these<00:01:57.210> positions<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.960> don't<00:01:58.110> want<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.320> be

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
these positions you don't want to be

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.590 
these positions you don't want to be
them<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:59.070> long<00:01:59.340> periods<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.790> time<00:01:59.939> they<00:02:00.450> may

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
them for long periods of time they may

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.139 
them for long periods of time they may
be<00:02:00.659> useful<00:02:00.960> then<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.490> may<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.640> useful<00:02:02.880> when

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
be useful then and it may be useful when

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.609 
be useful then and it may be useful when
you<00:02:03.210> come<00:02:03.390> back<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.689> them<00:02:03.810> but<00:02:04.170> if<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.290> stay

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
you come back to them but if you stay

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.190 
you come back to them but if you stay
there<00:02:05.119> usually<00:02:06.119> people<00:02:06.450> will<00:02:06.600> start<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.960> catch

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
there usually people will start to catch

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.510 
there usually people will start to catch
on<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.439> what's<00:02:07.680> going<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:08.039> through<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> grenades

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
on to what's going on through a grenades

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.330 
on to what's going on through a grenades
some<00:02:10.520> tags<00:02:10.760> you<00:02:10.880> know<00:02:11.000> whatever<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:13.190> these

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
some tags you know whatever and in these

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.290 
some tags you know whatever and in these
spots<00:02:13.990> there's<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.110> lot<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.470> things<00:02:15.710> you<00:02:15.920> can<00:02:16.070> do

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
spots there's a lot of things you can do

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.270 
spots there's a lot of things you can do
of<00:02:17.300> course<00:02:17.660> you'll<00:02:18.020> have<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.380> cover<00:02:18.620> which<00:02:19.100> is

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
of course you'll have the cover which is

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.390 
of course you'll have the cover which is
a<00:02:19.460> very<00:02:20.240> useful<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.900> then<00:02:21.440> these<00:02:21.530> foster<00:02:21.800> most

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
a very useful and then these foster most

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.400 
a very useful and then these foster most
likely<00:02:22.760> going<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.000> be<00:02:23.060> able<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.930> head<00:02:24.140> glitch

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
likely going to be able to head glitch

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.140 
likely going to be able to head glitch
and<00:02:24.740> for<00:02:25.400> those<00:02:25.460> of<00:02:25.520> you<00:02:25.670> don't<00:02:25.730> know<00:02:26.000> what

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
and for those of you don't know what

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.690 
and for those of you don't know what
head<00:02:26.420> glitching<00:02:26.750> is<00:02:27.080> it<00:02:27.860> means<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.520> you're

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
head glitching is it means that you're

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.880 
head glitching is it means that you're
behind<00:02:29.030> cover<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.690> can<00:02:29.870> see<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.350> enemy<00:02:30.500> and

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
behind cover you can see the enemy and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.530 
behind cover you can see the enemy and
they<00:02:31.190> can<00:02:31.370> just<00:02:31.550> barely<00:02:31.820> see<00:02:32.030> your<00:02:32.270> head<00:02:32.510> even

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
they can just barely see your head even

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.680 
they can just barely see your head even
though<00:02:32.900> you'll<00:02:33.170> have<00:02:33.230> your<00:02:33.530> gun<00:02:33.830> over<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.460> and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
though you'll have your gun over it and

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.970 
though you'll have your gun over it and
the<00:02:35.690> reason<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.080> kallah<00:02:36.290> glitch<00:02:36.620> is<00:02:36.800> just

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
the reason the kallah glitch is just

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.400 
the reason the kallah glitch is just
because<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.370> doesn't<00:02:37.670> quite<00:02:37.880> make<00:02:38.600> sense<00:02:38.660> that

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
because it doesn't quite make sense that

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.350 
because it doesn't quite make sense that
you<00:02:40.220> can<00:02:40.400> have<00:02:40.520> your<00:02:40.640> gun<00:02:40.820> up<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.120> they<00:02:41.210> can

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
you can have your gun up but they can

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.640 
you can have your gun up but they can
only<00:02:41.450> see<00:02:41.690> your<00:02:41.810> head<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:42.140> not<00:02:42.290> your<00:02:42.320> gun

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
only see your head and not your gun

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.110 
only see your head and not your gun
that's<00:02:43.070> why<00:02:43.250> some<00:02:43.430> people<00:02:43.640> call<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.880> glitch

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
that's why some people call it a glitch

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.850 
that's why some people call it a glitch
right<00:02:44.990> here<00:02:45.170> I<00:02:45.200> want<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.440> go<00:02:45.500> ahead<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.740> point

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
right here I want to go ahead and point

right here I want to go ahead and point
out<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.250> really<00:02:46.790> good<00:02:46.940> example<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.840> power

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
out a really good example of the power

out a really good example of the power
position<00:02:48.290> as<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.670> can<00:02:49.760> see<00:02:49.850> i<00:02:49.880> just<00:02:50.150> picked<00:02:50.330> up

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
position as you can see i just picked up

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.730 
position as you can see i just picked up

those two kills and i'm behind this
cover<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.280> i<00:02:52.460> was<00:02:52.610> able<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.820> get<00:02:52.910> two<00:02:53.330> more

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
it happens it's the unfortunate truth of

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.140 
it happens it's the unfortunate truth of
this<00:03:06.260> game<00:03:06.560> death<00:03:07.460> streaks<00:03:07.700> don't<00:03:07.910> belong<00:03:08.090> in

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
this game death streaks don't belong in

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.390 
this game death streaks don't belong in
there<00:03:08.360> but<00:03:08.570> that's<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:09.050> whole<00:03:09.260> nother<00:03:09.400> that's

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
there but that's a whole nother that's

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.300 
there but that's a whole nother that's
all<00:03:10.580> another<00:03:10.790> story<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.240> tell<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:13.040> let's<00:03:13.190> go

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
all another story to tell so let's go

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.900 
all another story to tell so let's go
ahead<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:14.500> dissect<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:16.010> little<00:03:16.400> bit<00:03:16.670> right

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
ahead and dissect that little bit right

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.700 
ahead and dissect that little bit right
there<00:03:16.940> where<00:03:17.360> I<00:03:17.390> got<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:17.660> nice<00:03:18.050> kill<00:03:18.410> streak

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
there where I got that nice kill streak

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.780 
there where I got that nice kill streak
so<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:20.630> phrase<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.260> power<00:03:21.620> position<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:22.640> let's

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
so the phrase is power position so let's

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.940 
so the phrase is power position so let's
talk<00:03:22.910> about<00:03:22.970> positioning<00:03:23.810> first<00:03:24.110> as<00:03:24.350> you<00:03:24.860> can

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
talk about positioning first as you can

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.510 
talk about positioning first as you can
see<00:03:25.220> i<00:03:25.430> was<00:03:26.090> in<00:03:26.330> explore<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.260> enemy<00:03:27.710> was

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
see i was in explore the enemy was

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.480 
see i was in explore the enemy was
coming<00:03:29.000> out<00:03:29.180> at<00:03:29.450> me<00:03:29.870> back<00:03:30.740> there<00:03:31.010> was<00:03:31.250> most

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
coming out at me back there was most

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.980 
coming out at me back there was most
likely<00:03:31.640> their<00:03:31.970> most<00:03:32.150> recent<00:03:32.330> spawn<00:03:32.780> and

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
likely their most recent spawn and

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.930 
likely their most recent spawn and
that's<00:03:33.110> why<00:03:33.260> there's<00:03:33.440> so<00:03:33.620> many<00:03:33.740> there<00:03:34.070> and<00:03:34.340> I

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
that's why there's so many there and I

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.090 
that's why there's so many there and I
knew<00:03:35.510> that<00:03:35.810> would<00:03:36.230> probably<00:03:36.470> be<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.830> area

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
knew that would probably be the area

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.950 
knew that would probably be the area
that<00:03:37.250> they<00:03:37.340> were<00:03:37.400> spon<00:03:37.760> if<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.150> was<00:03:38.360> back<00:03:38.690> there

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
that they were spon if I was back there

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.410 
that they were spon if I was back there
so<00:03:39.740> part<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.040> this<00:03:40.160> is<00:03:40.460> really<00:03:40.670> understanding

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
so part of this is really understanding

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.510 
so part of this is really understanding
map<00:03:41.750> flow<00:03:42.170> where<00:03:42.710> people<00:03:43.040> are<00:03:43.130> coming<00:03:43.160> from

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
map flow where people are coming from

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.130 
map flow where people are coming from
and<00:03:43.880> that's<00:03:44.180> something<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:44.600> you'll<00:03:44.870> pick<00:03:45.110> up

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
and that's something that you'll pick up

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.380 
and that's something that you'll pick up
as<00:03:45.440> time<00:03:45.650> goes<00:03:45.830> on<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.340> just<00:03:47.210> like<00:03:47.360> that

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
as time goes on and just like that

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.590 
as time goes on and just like that
you'll<00:03:47.810> pick<00:03:48.080> up<00:03:48.520> where<00:03:49.520> the<00:03:49.880> best<00:03:50.090> spots<00:03:50.390> are

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
you'll pick up where the best spots are

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.600 
you'll pick up where the best spots are
for<00:03:51.170> getting<00:03:51.560> into<00:03:51.740> these<00:03:51.830> power<00:03:52.100> positions

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
for getting into these power positions

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.110 
for getting into these power positions
like<00:03:53.210> the<00:03:53.420> bridge<00:03:53.630> there<00:03:53.900> be<00:03:54.400> be<00:03:55.400> dom<00:03:55.670> that<00:03:55.970> is

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
like the bridge there be be dom that is

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.730 
like the bridge there be be dom that is
a<00:03:56.300> non-playing<00:03:56.930> domination<00:03:57.350> current<00:03:57.560> point

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
a non-playing domination current point

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.020 
a non-playing domination current point
kill<00:03:57.860> confirm<00:03:58.220> but<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:58.760> know<00:03:58.880> what<00:03:58.970> i'm

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
kill confirm but you know what i'm

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.550 
kill confirm but you know what i'm
saying<00:03:59.330> is<00:03:59.480> a<00:04:00.230> great<00:04:00.500> spot<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:02.170> then<00:04:03.170> the

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
saying is a great spot and then the

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.160 
saying is a great spot and then the
second<00:04:03.980> part<00:04:04.010> of<00:04:04.280> it<00:04:04.430> is<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:05.420> power<00:04:05.780> which

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
second part of it is the power which

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.280 
second part of it is the power which
that<00:04:07.160> can<00:04:07.520> just<00:04:07.670> simply<00:04:08.030> be<00:04:08.150> put<00:04:08.360> as<00:04:08.540> being<00:04:09.140> in

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
that can just simply be put as being in

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.370 
that can just simply be put as being in
an<00:04:09.410> area<00:04:09.650> where<00:04:10.430> people<00:04:10.910> are<00:04:11.270> had<00:04:11.870> difficulty

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
an area where people are had difficulty

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.810 
an area where people are had difficulty
killing<00:04:12.620> you<00:04:12.680> kiss<00:04:12.860> your<00:04:12.980> behind<00:04:13.310> cover<00:04:13.490> and

killing you kiss your behind cover and

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.790 
killing you kiss your behind cover and
you'll<00:04:14.450> be<00:04:14.570> able<00:04:14.660> to<00:04:14.780> get<00:04:14.960> kills<00:04:15.290> because

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
you'll be able to get kills because

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.200 
you'll be able to get kills because
there'll<00:04:16.070> be<00:04:16.100> people<00:04:16.370> running<00:04:16.760> at<00:04:16.880> you<00:04:17.030> and

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.210 
there'll be people running at you and

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.460 
there'll be people running at you and
they

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
they

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.490 
they
won't<00:04:17.590> have<00:04:17.709> covered<00:04:18.750> no<00:04:19.750> one<00:04:19.900> when<00:04:20.260> it<00:04:20.350> comes

won't have covered no one when it comes

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.740 
won't have covered no one when it comes
to<00:04:20.620> these<00:04:20.709> power<00:04:20.950> positions<00:04:21.459> at<00:04:21.760> first<00:04:22.210> may

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
to these power positions at first may

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.750 
to these power positions at first may
seem<00:04:23.020> like<00:04:23.470> yeah<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:23.830> kind<00:04:24.190> of<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.340> strange<00:04:24.550> idea

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
seem like yeah I kind of a strange idea

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.950 
seem like yeah I kind of a strange idea
i<00:04:25.000> don't<00:04:25.270> know<00:04:25.360> if<00:04:25.480> i'll<00:04:25.600> be<00:04:25.630> able<00:04:25.750> to

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
i don't know if i'll be able to

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.360 
i don't know if i'll be able to
implement<00:04:26.320> that<00:04:26.590> into<00:04:26.800> my<00:04:26.890> game<00:04:26.950> or<00:04:27.250> not

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
implement that into my game or not

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.710 
implement that into my game or not
that's<00:04:27.820> probably<00:04:28.180> what's<00:04:28.330> going<00:04:28.480> through

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
that's probably what's going through

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.170 
that's probably what's going through
some<00:04:28.930> people's<00:04:29.200> heads<00:04:29.380> right<00:04:29.560> now<00:04:29.730> but<00:04:30.730> it's

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
some people's heads right now but it's

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.450 
some people's heads right now but it's
something<00:04:31.480> that<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:31.900> will<00:04:32.320> pick<00:04:32.860> up<00:04:33.010> on<00:04:33.190> and

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
something that you will pick up on and

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.160 
something that you will pick up on and
to<00:04:33.520> start<00:04:33.790> doing<00:04:34.090> automatically<00:04:34.750> when<00:04:35.140> I

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
to start doing automatically when I

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.750 
to start doing automatically when I
started<00:04:35.500> playing<00:04:35.680> call<00:04:35.920> of<00:04:35.950> duty<00:04:36.070> back<00:04:36.520> in

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
started playing call of duty back in

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.060 
started playing call of duty back in
cod4<00:04:37.150> world<00:04:37.660> of<00:04:37.750> war<00:04:37.870> area<00:04:38.170> I<00:04:38.350> just<00:04:38.680> ran<00:04:38.920> around

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
cod4 world of war area I just ran around

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.530 
cod4 world of war area I just ran around
like<00:04:39.250> an<00:04:39.430> idiot<00:04:39.520> all<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:39.970> time<00:04:40.180> and<00:04:40.360> didn't

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
like an idiot all the time and didn't

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.360 
like an idiot all the time and didn't
really<00:04:40.720> understand<00:04:41.260> this<00:04:41.410> but<00:04:42.010> as<00:04:42.160> I<00:04:42.310> started

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
really understand this but as I started

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.430 
really understand this but as I started
playing<00:04:42.790> more<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.120> started<00:04:43.600> to<00:04:43.780> get<00:04:44.170> better

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
playing more I started to get better

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.460 
playing more I started to get better
fuel<00:04:45.160> for<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.670> game<00:04:45.850> how<00:04:46.630> things<00:04:46.960> work<00:04:47.230> like

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
fuel for the game how things work like

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.140 
fuel for the game how things work like
this<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:47.950> it<00:04:48.400> would<00:04:48.520> definitely<00:04:48.760> improve

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
this and it would definitely improve

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.270 
this and it would definitely improve
your<00:04:49.540> game<00:04:49.690> it<00:04:50.230> won't<00:04:50.500> be<00:04:50.620> something<00:04:51.010> that<00:04:51.190> you

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
your game it won't be something that you

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.790 
your game it won't be something that you
can<00:04:51.490> just<00:04:52.150> learn<00:04:52.510> overnight<00:04:53.080> you'll<00:04:53.560> have<00:04:53.650> to

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
can just learn overnight you'll have to

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.010 
can just learn overnight you'll have to
play<00:04:54.010> on<00:04:54.190> all<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.460> maps<00:04:54.670> and<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.540> really<00:04:55.900> good
