00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
much of your striker is very strong he

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.560 
much of your striker is very strong he
is<00:00:55.350> very<00:00:55.620> strong<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.250> doesn't<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.910> exactly

is very strong but doesn't have exactly
that<00:00:57.809> much<00:00:58.020> aggression<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> takes<00:00:59.160> away<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
that much aggression so it takes away a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.090 
that much aggression so it takes away a
bit<00:01:00.059> from<00:01:00.239> his<00:01:00.390> strength<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.780> my<00:01:00.930> opinion<00:01:01.260> okay

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
bit from his strength in my opinion okay

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.340

guess<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.250> will<00:02:05.430> be<00:02:05.579> an<00:02:05.670> advantage<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.390> him

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
guess that will be an advantage for him

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.389 
guess that will be an advantage for him
because<00:02:06.960> he<00:02:07.170> looks<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.619> big<00:02:07.979> when<00:02:08.250> you're

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
because he looks so big when you're

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.040 
because he looks so big when you're
playing<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.729> him<00:02:08.879> good<00:02:09.330> heading<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.780> height<00:02:10.020> i

playing of him good heading in height i

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.190 
playing of him good heading in height i
mean<00:02:10.470> he's<00:02:11.039> here<00:02:11.400> 645<00:02:11.910> by<00:02:12.360> his<00:02:12.510> jumping<00:02:12.959> and

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
accuracy wasn't that great so he didn't

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.510 
accuracy wasn't that great so he didn't
