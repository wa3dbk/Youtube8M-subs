game with awesome ideas can be ruined by

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.060 
game with awesome ideas can be ruined by
bad<00:00:35.790> execution<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.140> we're<00:00:37.680> talking<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
bad execution and we're talking the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:51.110 
bad execution and we're talking the
Einstein<00:00:38.700> ideas<00:00:39.559> caveman<00:00:40.559> execution<00:00:50.120> alright

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
Einstein ideas caveman execution alright

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.750 
Einstein ideas caveman execution alright
so<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.809> maybe<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.170> doesn't<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.500> instan<00:00:53.370> ideas

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
so so maybe it doesn't have instan ideas

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.090 
so so maybe it doesn't have instan ideas
but<00:00:54.120> prehistoric<00:00:55.050> man<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.469> actually<00:00:56.010> an

your typical 2d platformer in fact it it

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.569 
your typical 2d platformer in fact it it
almost<00:02:03.209> plays<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> 3d<00:02:04.409> game<00:02:04.679> at<00:02:04.829> times<00:02:05.069> so

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
almost plays like a 3d game at times so

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.100 
almost plays like a 3d game at times so
you're<00:02:05.670> not<00:02:05.789> always<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.090> running<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
you're not always just running to the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.690 
you're not always just running to the
end<00:02:07.229> point<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.739> game<00:02:07.860> often<00:02:08.250> involves

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
end point the game often involves

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.539 
end point the game often involves
specific<00:02:09.269> objectives<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.319> example<00:02:10.709> find<00:02:11.340> all

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
specific objectives for example find all

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.580 
specific objectives for example find all
three<00:02:11.760> stones<00:02:12.209> hidden<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> level<00:02:13.260> and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
three stones hidden in the level and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.620 
three stones hidden in the level and
bring<00:02:13.860> them<00:02:13.980> back<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.400> open<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.760> path<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.329> mean

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
bring them back to open a path I mean

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.900 
bring them back to open a path I mean
the<00:02:15.840> gameplays<00:02:16.290> obviously<00:02:16.769> in<00:02:16.890> 2d<00:02:17.220> but<00:02:17.459> with

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
the gameplays obviously in 2d but with

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.210 
the gameplays obviously in 2d but with
the<00:02:18.060> searching<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.959> vehicles<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:20.100> the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
the searching and the vehicles and the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.059 
the searching and the vehicles and the
open<00:02:21.000> feel<00:02:21.389> of<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.750> levels<00:02:22.079> this<00:02:22.620> game<00:02:22.829> does<00:02:23.040> a

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
open feel of the levels this game does a

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:32.390 
open feel of the levels this game does a
lot<00:02:23.220> more<00:02:23.280> than<00:02:23.489> just<00:02:23.670> side<00:02:24.269> scroll<00:02:31.400> another

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
lot more than just side scroll another

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.220 
lot more than just side scroll another
nice<00:02:32.639> touch<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.660> game<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:33.930> looks

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
nice touch is that the game just looks

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.559 
nice touch is that the game just looks
great<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.859> mean<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.160> thing<00:02:35.340> came<00:02:35.489> out<00:02:35.639> in<00:02:35.730> 1995

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
great I mean this thing came out in 1995

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.809 
great I mean this thing came out in 1995
so<00:02:36.600> that's<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.590> pretty<00:02:37.769> late<00:02:38.130> release<00:02:38.489> for<00:02:38.730> the

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
so that's a pretty late release for the

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.879 
so that's a pretty late release for the
Super<00:02:39.120> NES<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.810> obviously<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.470> looks<00:02:40.620> the

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
Super NES and obviously it looks the

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:41.210 
Super NES and obviously it looks the
part

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
part

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.640 
part
it's<00:02:41.400> colorful<00:02:41.870> sprites<00:02:42.870> are<00:02:43.079> great<00:02:43.380> they're

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
it's colorful sprites are great they're

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.309 
it's colorful sprites are great they're
huge<00:02:44.130> bosses<00:02:44.690> prehistoric<00:02:45.690> man<00:02:45.900> looks<00:02:46.139> like<00:02:46.290> a

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
huge bosses prehistoric man looks like a
