00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
basically it's going to be England

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.900 
basically it's going to be England
Northern<00:02:53.380> Ireland<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:54.100> Wales<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.700> what<00:02:54.850> are

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
Northern Ireland and Wales so what are
