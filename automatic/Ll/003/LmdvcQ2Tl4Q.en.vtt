00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
this is the hydro cubis fight and this

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.990 
this is the hydro cubis fight and this
is<00:00:17.529> still<00:00:17.680> part<00:00:17.860> of<00:00:18.040> the<00:00:18.100> boss<00:00:18.370> cult<00:00:18.640> are<00:00:18.880> the

is still part of the boss cult are the

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.580 
is still part of the boss cult are the
the<00:00:19.210> level<00:00:19.480> gauntlet<00:00:19.870> since<00:00:20.080> that<00:00:20.230> previous

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
the level gauntlet since that previous

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.320 
the level gauntlet since that previous
set<00:00:20.800> point<00:00:21.100> so<00:00:21.280> if<00:00:21.400> you<00:00:21.520> die<00:00:21.700> here<00:00:22.060> you<00:00:22.210> will

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
set point so if you die here you will

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.330 
set point so if you die here you will
have<00:00:22.360> to<00:00:22.630> do<00:00:22.750> that<00:00:22.930> entire<00:00:23.350> previous<00:00:23.890> video

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
have to do that entire previous video

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.609 
have to do that entire previous video
all<00:00:24.580> over<00:00:24.880> again<00:00:25.150> so<00:00:25.480> I<00:00:25.720> would<00:00:26.230> pretty<00:00:26.470> much

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
all over again so I would pretty much

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.710 
all over again so I would pretty much
say<00:00:26.980> if<00:00:27.340> you<00:00:27.400> need<00:00:27.699> to<00:00:27.850> use<00:00:27.970> items<00:00:28.360> to<00:00:28.539> stay

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
say if you need to use items to stay

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.390 
say if you need to use items to stay
alive<00:00:28.960> feel<00:00:29.410> free<00:00:29.560> to<00:00:29.650> do<00:00:29.920> so<00:00:30.160> it<00:00:30.280> will<00:00:30.369> just

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
alive feel free to do so it will just

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.100 
alive feel free to do so it will just
make<00:00:30.670> it<00:00:30.699> a<00:00:30.910> whole<00:00:31.090> lot<00:00:31.119> less<00:00:31.480> frustrating

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
make it a whole lot less frustrating

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.110 
make it a whole lot less frustrating
that<00:00:32.920> I<00:00:32.980> completely<00:00:33.460> ignore<00:00:33.789> the<00:00:33.940> cats

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
that I completely ignore the cats

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.029 
that I completely ignore the cats
because<00:00:34.269> there's<00:00:34.510> a<00:00:34.539> lot<00:00:34.569> of<00:00:34.749> them<00:00:34.960> and<00:00:35.140> just

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
because there's a lot of them and just

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.399 
because there's a lot of them and just
focus<00:00:36.370> on<00:00:36.429> Hydra<00:00:36.730> Kubis<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:37.329> once<00:00:37.989> you<00:00:38.140> knock

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:38.409 
focus on Hydra Kubis and once you knock

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:39.959 
focus on Hydra Kubis and once you knock
off<00:00:38.559> his<00:00:38.679> limbs<00:00:38.949> you<00:00:39.190> want<00:00:39.339> to<00:00:39.399> swap<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.760> the

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
off his limbs you want to swap to the

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:42.959 
off his limbs you want to swap to the
the<00:00:40.379> lunar<00:00:41.379> Sat<00:00:41.589> the<00:00:41.769> lunar<00:00:42.129> staff<00:00:42.399> sorry<00:00:42.729> and

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
the lunar Sat the lunar staff sorry and

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.239 
the lunar Sat the lunar staff sorry and
do<00:00:43.420> it<00:00:43.569> the<00:00:43.839> ultimate<00:00:44.229> technique<00:00:44.769> and<00:00:45.039> if<00:00:45.159> you

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:45.249 
do it the ultimate technique and if you

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:47.189 
do it the ultimate technique and if you
get<00:00:45.370> lucky<00:00:45.550> you'll<00:00:46.089> kill<00:00:46.359> a<00:00:46.389> cup<00:00:46.690> of<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.929> cat<00:00:47.109> a

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
get lucky you'll kill a cup of the cat a

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.389 
get lucky you'll kill a cup of the cat a
couple<00:00:47.440> of<00:00:47.499> the<00:00:47.589> cats<00:00:47.769> with<00:00:47.979> the<00:00:48.069> technique

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
couple of the cats with the technique

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.689 
couple of the cats with the technique
itself<00:00:48.760> there<00:00:49.479> right<00:00:49.719> then<00:00:49.929> there<00:00:50.319> I<00:00:50.559> got<00:00:51.039> it

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
itself there right then there I got it

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.250 
itself there right then there I got it
was<00:00:51.850> a<00:00:51.879> bit<00:00:51.999> of<00:00:52.089> a<00:00:52.120> mistake<00:00:52.210> on<00:00:52.569> my<00:00:52.629> part<00:00:52.749> what

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
was a bit of a mistake on my part what

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.139 
was a bit of a mistake on my part what
happens<00:00:53.589> is<00:00:53.769> is<00:00:53.949> both<00:00:54.159> the<00:00:54.190> arms<00:00:54.609> let<00:00:54.789> out<00:00:54.909> bits

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
happens is is both the arms let out bits

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.360 
happens is is both the arms let out bits
of<00:00:55.299> essence<00:00:55.659> and<00:00:55.870> if<00:00:56.499> you're<00:00:56.679> lucky<00:00:56.829> both<00:00:57.190> of

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
of essence and if you're lucky both of

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.879 
of essence and if you're lucky both of
them<00:00:57.489> will<00:00:57.639> both<00:00:57.879> let<00:00:58.269> out<00:00:58.420> a<00:00:58.449> full<00:00:58.899> charge<00:00:59.199> so

00:00:59.879 --> 00:00:59.889 
them will both let out a full charge so

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:01.289 
them will both let out a full charge so
that<00:01:00.010> you<00:01:00.100> can<00:01:00.249> do<00:01:00.339> to<00:01:00.370> ultimate<00:01:00.940> techniques

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
that you can do to ultimate techniques

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:02.879 
that you can do to ultimate techniques
off<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.690> same<00:01:01.899> bunch<00:01:02.170> of<00:01:02.289> essence<00:01:02.559> like<00:01:02.709> right

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:02.889 
off the same bunch of essence like right

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:04.860 
off the same bunch of essence like right
now<00:01:03.069> if<00:01:03.789> I'd<00:01:03.999> have<00:01:04.089> had<00:01:04.120> that<00:01:04.360> blue<00:01:04.540> essence

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
now if I'd have had that blue essence

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.179 
now if I'd have had that blue essence
just<00:01:05.080> they're<00:01:05.260> available<00:01:05.560> I'd<00:01:05.979> have<00:01:06.100> been

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
just they're available I'd have been

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:07.800 
just they're available I'd have been
able<00:01:06.310> to<00:01:06.460> do<00:01:06.640> a<00:01:06.670> second<00:01:07.180> ultimate<00:01:07.539> technique

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
able to do a second ultimate technique

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.020 
able to do a second ultimate technique
on<00:01:08.020> Hydra<00:01:08.409> and<00:01:08.590> he<00:01:09.250> would<00:01:09.399> have<00:01:09.490> felt<00:01:09.700> it<00:01:09.850> big

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
on Hydra and he would have felt it big

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.319 
on Hydra and he would have felt it big
time<00:01:10.210> but<00:01:10.479> instead<00:01:10.570> I<00:01:11.100> didn't<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.310> right<00:01:13.149> now

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
time but instead I didn't and right now

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.569 
time but instead I didn't and right now
I'm<00:01:13.689> at<00:01:13.869> that<00:01:13.990> point<00:01:14.170> where<00:01:14.289> I've<00:01:14.409> kind<00:01:14.680> of<00:01:14.829> all

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
I'm at that point where I've kind of all

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.039 
I'm at that point where I've kind of all
that<00:01:15.789> were<00:01:15.880> pretty<00:01:16.030> sloppy<00:01:16.240> just<00:01:16.780> got<00:01:16.869> to<00:01:16.960> take

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
that were pretty sloppy just got to take

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.620 
that were pretty sloppy just got to take
out<00:01:17.229> that<00:01:17.350> second<00:01:17.799> am<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:19.060> that<00:01:19.180> I<00:01:19.240> can<00:01:19.299> do<00:01:19.479> my

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
out that second am so that I can do my

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.779 
out that second am so that I can do my
my<00:01:19.810> lunar<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.289> hopefully<00:01:20.740> chain<00:01:21.430> those<00:01:21.609> two

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
my lunar and hopefully chain those two

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.330 
my lunar and hopefully chain those two
attacks<00:01:22.119> but<00:01:22.570> we'll<00:01:22.719> soon<00:01:22.930> find<00:01:22.960> out<00:01:23.350> so<00:01:23.649> swap

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
attacks but we'll soon find out so swap

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.130 
attacks but we'll soon find out so swap
back<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.030> lunar<00:01:25.240> soon<00:01:25.630> as<00:01:25.750> you<00:01:25.810> take<00:01:25.960> rid

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
back to the lunar soon as you take rid

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.740 
back to the lunar soon as you take rid
of<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.289> arms<00:01:26.590> with<00:01:26.799> it<00:01:27.090> do<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.240> on<00:01:28.329> landing

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
of the arms with it do the on landing

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.230 
of the arms with it do the on landing
into<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.500> ultimate<00:01:29.680> technique<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.399> then

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
into the ultimate technique and then

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.730 
into the ultimate technique and then
hopefully<00:01:31.659> if<00:01:31.810> you<00:01:31.929> kill<00:01:32.079> a<00:01:32.109> cat<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.469> can<00:01:32.560> use

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
hopefully if you kill a cat you can use

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.260 
hopefully if you kill a cat you can use
their<00:01:33.009> essence<00:01:33.399> to<00:01:33.640> do<00:01:33.729> another<00:01:33.969> quick<00:01:34.179> one

problem<00:04:28.930> with<00:04:29.050> this<00:04:29.169> fight<00:04:29.410> because<00:04:29.590> the

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
problem with this fight because the

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.760 
problem with this fight because the
double<00:04:30.430> arrow<00:04:30.610> it's<00:04:31.300> it's<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:31.990> only<00:04:32.380> ultimate

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
double arrow it's it's the only ultimate

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.559 
double arrow it's it's the only ultimate
technique<00:04:33.069> that's<00:04:33.310> got<00:04:33.460> range<00:04:33.759> because<00:04:34.330> it

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569 
technique that's got range because it

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:36.689 
technique that's got range because it
literally<00:04:35.110> fires<00:04:35.380> an<00:04:35.590> energy<00:04:35.919> wave<00:04:36.069> it's<00:04:36.490> just

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
literally fires an energy wave it's just

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.460 
literally fires an energy wave it's just
like<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:37.060> scythe<00:04:37.270> only<00:04:37.930> I<00:04:37.960> think<00:04:38.199> the<00:04:38.259> sides

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
like the scythe only I think the sides

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.529 
like the scythe only I think the sides
got<00:04:38.740> some<00:04:38.949> better<00:04:39.160> distance<00:04:39.699> on<00:04:39.880> ninja<00:04:40.360> gaiden

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
got some better distance on ninja gaiden

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.379 
got some better distance on ninja gaiden
two<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.380> it's<00:04:41.889> easily<00:04:42.430> one<00:04:42.699> of<00:04:42.759> the<00:04:42.880> cheapest

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
two and it's easily one of the cheapest

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.270 
two and it's easily one of the cheapest
but<00:04:43.660> most<00:04:43.900> effective<00:04:44.440> ultimate<00:04:44.919> techniques

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
but most effective ultimate techniques

fish to farm or it will lead into the

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.080 
fish to farm or it will lead into the
next<00:06:14.830> section<00:06:15.099> of<00:06:15.310> the<00:06:15.430> level<00:06:15.669> if<00:06:15.759> you<00:06:15.819> want<00:06:16.000> to

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
next section of the level if you want to

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.490 
next section of the level if you want to
take<00:06:16.240> it<00:06:16.270> whether<00:06:16.539> the<00:06:16.810> tunnel<00:06:17.080> will<00:06:17.259> flood

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 
and then we can carry on and move

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:23.010 
and then we can carry on and move
towards<00:06:20.110> the<00:06:20.289> the<00:06:20.590> upcoming<00:06:20.830> Alma<00:06:21.219> fight<00:06:22.020> and

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
towards the the upcoming Alma fight and

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.390 
towards the the upcoming Alma fight and
who<00:06:23.199> actually<00:06:23.349> think<00:06:23.650> that<00:06:23.740> this<00:06:23.800> area<00:06:24.039> here

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
who actually think that this area here

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.309 
who actually think that this area here
is<00:06:24.430> the<00:06:24.669> better<00:06:24.849> area<00:06:25.240> to<00:06:25.419> farm<00:06:25.750> girls<00:06:26.050> fish

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 
is the better area to farm girls fish

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.080 
is the better area to farm girls fish
but<00:06:26.889> it's<00:06:27.009> also<00:06:27.159> the<00:06:27.370> area<00:06:27.699> where<00:06:27.849> you<00:06:27.880> can

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
but it's also the area where you can

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.760 
but it's also the area where you can
take<00:06:28.330> the<00:06:28.509> most<00:06:28.750> damage<00:06:29.199> because<00:06:29.380> it<00:06:29.500> seems<00:06:29.650> to

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
take the most damage because it seems to

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.219 
take the most damage because it seems to
be<00:06:29.860> more<00:06:30.039> of<00:06:30.099> them<00:06:30.400> but<00:06:31.180> also<00:06:31.630> if<00:06:31.990> you<00:06:32.110> get

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
be more of them but also if you get

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:33.480 
be more of them but also if you get
carried<00:06:32.500> away<00:06:32.590> fighting<00:06:32.889> you<00:06:33.159> can<00:06:33.310> trigger

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
carried away fighting you can trigger

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.800 
carried away fighting you can trigger
the<00:06:33.669> cutscene<00:06:34.000> so<00:06:34.150> it's<00:06:34.270> probably<00:06:34.449> the<00:06:34.690> more

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
the cutscene so it's probably the more

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.079 
the cutscene so it's probably the more
dangerous<00:06:35.199> area<00:06:35.560> to<00:06:35.650> do<00:06:35.770> it<00:06:35.889> in<00:06:36.039> but<00:06:36.639> if<00:06:36.940> you

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:37.089 
dangerous area to do it in but if you

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:38.370 
dangerous area to do it in but if you
comfortable<00:06:37.449> with<00:06:37.539> fighting<00:06:37.930> ghosts<00:06:38.139> fish

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
comfortable with fighting ghosts fish

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.750 
comfortable with fighting ghosts fish
then<00:06:38.589> you<00:06:38.680> don't<00:06:38.830> have<00:06:38.949> to<00:06:39.070> worry<00:06:39.250> they're<00:06:39.729> not

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
then you don't have to worry they're not

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.070 
then you don't have to worry they're not
the<00:06:40.000> most<00:06:40.029> challenging<00:06:40.570> of<00:06:40.630> enemies<00:06:40.930> it's

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
the most challenging of enemies it's

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.180 
the most challenging of enemies it's
just<00:06:41.260> when<00:06:41.349> they<00:06:41.469> grab<00:06:41.650> you<00:06:41.680> you<00:06:41.919> have<00:06:42.070> to

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
just when they grab you you have to

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.540 
just when they grab you you have to
share

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
share

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.250 
share
