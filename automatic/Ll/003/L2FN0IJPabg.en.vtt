what<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.780> did<00:01:01.109> was<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.320> make<00:01:01.620> chairs<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.399> could

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
what I did was just make chairs I could

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.700 
what I did was just make chairs I could
have<00:01:03.210> done<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.329> Lauda's<00:01:03.960> or<00:01:04.110> something<00:01:04.439> but

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
have done like Lauda's or something but

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.929 
have done like Lauda's or something but
I<00:01:04.860> thought<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.100> was<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.369> stick<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> chairs

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
I thought I was just stick the chairs

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.840 
I thought I was just stick the chairs
because<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.299> easier<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.580> sit

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
because it's easier so I just sit

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.550 
because it's easier so I just sit
literally<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.450> sat<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.750> removing<00:01:10.229> made

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
maybe I might change it because I

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.760 
maybe I might change it because I
haven't<00:01:33.450> actually<00:01:33.540> built<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.020> yeah<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.740> I

might put it there I didn't quite get
around<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.360> doing<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:37.170> that's<00:01:37.770> not

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
around to doing that but that's not

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.499 
around to doing that but that's not
important<00:01:38.520> because<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.759> don't<00:01:39.030> go<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.240> very

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
important because I don't go to it very

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.969 
important because I don't go to it very
often<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:40.079> only<00:01:40.259> only<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.710> repair

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
often it's only only be to repair

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.410 
often it's only only be to repair
barracks<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:41.520> make<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.759> cheaper<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.000> myself

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
barracks just make it cheaper for myself

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.590 
barracks just make it cheaper for myself
here<00:01:43.049> I've<00:01:43.320> got<00:01:43.500> all<00:01:43.680> table<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.790> was<00:01:45.240> using<00:01:45.390> this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
here I've got all table I was using this

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300 
here I've got all table I was using this
for<00:01:45.810> all<00:01:45.930> planks<00:01:46.320> at<00:01:46.439> first<00:01:46.649> because<00:01:46.860> if<00:01:47.189> you

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
for all planks at first because if you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.429 
for all planks at first because if you
go<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.610> construction<00:01:47.970> skill<00:01:48.479> guide

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439

surfaces<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.619> services<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.310> don't<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.210> but

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
surfaces in services I don't know but

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.260 
surfaces in services I don't know but
oak<00:01:54.930> dining<00:01:55.229> table<00:01:55.680> there<00:01:55.799> at<00:01:55.890> 22<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.579> was<00:01:56.969> doing

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
oak dining table there at 22 I was doing

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.630 
oak dining table there at 22 I was doing
them<00:01:57.479> until<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.810> could<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.049> all<00:01:58.229> coladas<00:01:58.829> which

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
them until I could do all coladas which

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.090 
them until I could do all coladas which
if<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.299> go<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.200> hard<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.469> find<00:02:01.649> things<00:02:01.920> in

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
if I go it's so hard to find things in

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.980 
if I go it's so hard to find things in
here<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.310> think<00:02:02.430> storage<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.659> storage

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
here I think storage it's in storage

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.969 
here I think storage it's in storage
thing

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
thing

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.320 
thing
Oh<00:02:05.299> Claddagh<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:07.459> very<00:02:08.459> free<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.060> did<00:02:09.239> this

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
Oh Claddagh is very free so I did this

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.059 
Oh Claddagh is very free so I did this
until<00:02:09.660> very<00:02:09.869> free<00:02:10.050> construction<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.770> then<00:02:11.039> I

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
until very free construction and then I

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.770 
until very free construction and then I
did<00:02:11.250> Lauda's<00:02:11.700> which<00:02:11.970> are<00:02:12.090> actually<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.510> here

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
did Lauda's which are actually in here

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.000 
did Lauda's which are actually in here
but<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.260> have<00:02:13.500> removed

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
but I have removed

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.149 
but I have removed
the<00:02:14.220> minute<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:15.000> probably<00:02:15.510> will<00:02:15.810> get<00:02:15.959> every<00:02:16.230> TV

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
the minute I probably will get every TV

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.830 
the minute I probably will get every TV
I'll<00:02:17.400> probably<00:02:17.580> keep<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:17.970> room<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.480> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
I'll probably keep this room and the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.179 
I'll probably keep this room and the
reason<00:02:19.079> I<00:02:19.170> probably<00:02:19.319> keep<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.709> because<00:02:19.950> it

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
reason I probably keep it is because it

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.649 
reason I probably keep it is because it
basically<00:02:20.400> it's<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> best<00:02:21.269> way<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.420> train

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
basically it's the best way to train

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.740 
basically it's the best way to train
construction<00:02:22.260> or<00:02:22.670> using<00:02:23.670> expensive<00:02:24.269> planks

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
construction or using expensive planks

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.270 
construction or using expensive planks
all<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.140> way<00:02:25.230> until<00:02:25.439> you<00:02:25.500> can<00:02:25.620> do<00:02:25.739> oak<00:02:25.890> dungeon

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
all the way until you can do oak dungeon

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.430 
all the way until you can do oak dungeon
doors<00:02:26.489> which<00:02:27.150> are<00:02:27.360> at<00:02:27.799> 74<00:02:29.870> yeah<00:02:30.900> oak<00:02:31.049> dungeon

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
doors which are at 74 yeah oak dungeon

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.869 
doors which are at 74 yeah oak dungeon
door<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.739> that's<00:02:31.829> probably<00:02:32.129> the<00:02:32.310> way<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.640> get

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
door and that's probably the way to get

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.430 
door and that's probably the way to get
99<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.450> won't<00:02:33.690> cost<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.019> an<00:02:34.110> absolute

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
99 that won't cost you an absolute

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.140 
99 that won't cost you an absolute
fortune<00:02:34.680> know<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.519> I'm<00:02:35.610> gonna<00:02:35.700> get<00:02:35.849> 99

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
fortune know that I'm gonna get 99

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.280 
fortune know that I'm gonna get 99
construction<00:02:36.569> but<00:02:36.659> I'm<00:02:36.720> just<00:02:36.930> saying<00:02:37.110> I'm

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
construction but I'm just saying I'm

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.170 
construction but I'm just saying I'm
leaving<00:02:37.709> gonna<00:02:38.069> leave<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.340> there<00:02:38.370> ready<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.150> I

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
leaving gonna leave it there ready so I

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.819 
leaving gonna leave it there ready so I
now<00:02:39.390> have<00:02:39.420> two<00:02:39.750> bedrooms<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.379> didn't<00:02:40.680> actually

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
now have two bedrooms I didn't actually

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.800 
now have two bedrooms I didn't actually
train<00:02:41.250> construction<00:02:41.730> with<00:02:41.879> a<00:02:41.909> butler<00:02:42.120> as<00:02:42.390> you

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
train construction with a butler as you

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.119 
train construction with a butler as you
can<00:02:42.930> see<00:02:43.049> there's<00:02:43.200> no<00:02:43.290> Butler<00:02:43.560> walking<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.040> the

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
can see there's no Butler walking in the

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.399 
can see there's no Butler walking in the
house<00:02:44.310> basically<00:02:45.090> what<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.480> do<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.750> used<00:02:46.319> the

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
house basically what I do is used the

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:47.899 
house basically what I do is used the
ring<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.680> dealing<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.220> teleport<00:02:47.579> back<00:02:47.730> the

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
ring of dealing to teleport back the

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:49.699 
ring of dealing to teleport back the
castle<00:02:48.060> walls<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.629> then<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:49.049> had<00:02:49.230> runes<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.650> my

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
castle walls and then I had runes in my

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.039 
castle walls and then I had runes in my
invent<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.069> teleport<00:02:50.430> back<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.730> house

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
invent a teleport back to the house

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.390 
invent a teleport back to the house
which<00:02:52.049> I<00:02:52.200> could<00:02:52.319> just<00:02:52.470> run<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.920> make<00:02:53.069> them

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
which I could just run and make them

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.430 
which I could just run and make them
make<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.940> loris<00:02:54.180> remove<00:02:54.480> them<00:02:54.659> it<00:02:54.959> took<00:02:55.200> quite

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
make the loris remove them it took quite

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.960 
make the loris remove them it took quite
a<00:02:55.590> little<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.069> took<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.280> little<00:02:56.400> while<00:02:56.670> it

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
a little it took a little while it

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.140 
a little it took a little while it
wasn't<00:02:57.209> too<00:02:57.359> long<00:02:57.599> but<00:02:58.489> so<00:02:59.489> it<00:02:59.549> wasn't<00:02:59.790> too<00:02:59.940> bad

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
wasn't too long but so it wasn't too bad

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.740 
wasn't too long but so it wasn't too bad
but<00:03:00.180> oh<00:03:00.569> well<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:01.639> don't<00:03:02.639> plan<00:03:02.879> really<00:03:03.389> on<00:03:03.540> data

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
but oh well I don't plan really on data

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.740 
but oh well I don't plan really on data
anymore<00:03:04.139> I<00:03:04.319> will<00:03:04.799> get<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.040> butler<00:03:05.340> first

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
anymore I will get a butler first

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.000 
anymore I will get a butler first
training<00:03:06.750> construction<00:03:07.200> some<00:03:07.379> more<00:03:07.530> so

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
training construction some more so

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.349 
training construction some more so
basically<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.670> is<00:03:08.819> where<00:03:08.940> I've<00:03:09.060> got<00:03:09.209> all<00:03:09.329> my

basically this is where I've got all my
important<00:03:10.049> stuff<00:03:10.079> in<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.349> house<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.739> have<00:03:11.069> a

well without having a button you have to

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.259 
well without having a button you have to
constantly<00:03:34.069> start<00:03:35.069> building<00:03:35.400> one<00:03:35.430> again<00:03:35.730> so

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
constantly start building one again so

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.729 
constantly start building one again so
this<00:03:36.569> is<00:03:36.629> the<00:03:36.840> room<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.139> lecture<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.530> if<00:03:37.650> I

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
this is the room of the lecture and if I

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.189 
this is the room of the lecture and if I
click<00:03:40.879> show<00:03:41.879> you<00:03:41.940> how<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.209> build<00:03:42.419> it<00:03:42.629> but

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
click show you how to build it but

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.559 
click show you how to build it but
basically<00:03:43.500> it's<00:03:43.680> level<00:03:43.889> 67<00:03:44.549> lectern<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.239> big

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
basically it's level 67 lectern to big

basically it's level 67 lectern to big
house<00:03:45.810> tabs<00:03:46.109> because<00:03:47.069> ideally<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.549> would<00:03:47.639> like

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
house tabs because ideally I would like

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.550 
house tabs because ideally I would like
to<00:03:48.000> have<00:03:48.120> kept<00:03:48.239> missing<00:03:48.389> my<00:03:48.540> own<00:03:48.660> some<00:03:49.349> of<00:03:49.379> my

to have kept missing my own some of my
own<00:03:49.739> house<00:03:50.010> tabs<00:03:50.310> because<00:03:50.519> they're<00:03:50.790> kind<00:03:50.970> of

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
own house tabs because they're kind of

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.789 
own house tabs because they're kind of
useful<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.449> use<00:03:51.720> rather<00:03:52.049> than<00:03:52.290> just<00:03:52.470> telephone

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
useful to use rather than just telephone

useful to use rather than just telephone

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
at all that is literally just an oak

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.979 
at all that is literally just an oak
older<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.760> doesn't<00:03:59.849> need<00:04:00.120> that<00:04:00.299> high<00:04:00.569> of<00:04:00.930> a

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
older it doesn't need that high of a

older it doesn't need that high of a
construction<00:04:01.379> level<00:04:01.739> maybe<00:04:02.040> I'll<00:04:02.250> be<00:04:02.370> here

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
construction level maybe I'll be here

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:07.460 
construction level maybe I'll be here
Chapel<00:04:03.769> all<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.919> 45<00:04:05.370> construction<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.470> the

Chapel all the 45 construction and the
reason<00:04:07.799> I<00:04:07.859> want<00:04:08.069> it<00:04:08.190> is<00:04:08.310> just<00:04:08.519> so<00:04:08.609> that<00:04:08.790> for<00:04:09.329> the

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
reason I want it is just so that for the

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.360 
reason I want it is just so that for the
simple<00:04:09.690> use<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:10.139> that<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.620> can<00:04:10.799> actually<00:04:10.949> pray

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
simple use of that I can actually pray

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.670 
simple use of that I can actually pray
in<00:04:11.489> my<00:04:11.609> house<00:04:11.870> see<00:04:12.870> what<00:04:12.900> I'm<00:04:13.109> doing<00:04:13.319> Slayer

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
tell you do a house after a task which

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.550 
tell you do a house after a task which
is<00:04:15.389> ideally<00:04:15.750> why<00:04:15.870> I<00:04:15.900> wanted<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.199> house<00:04:16.289> taps

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
is ideally why I wanted the house taps

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.020 
is ideally why I wanted the house taps
so<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.159> can<00:04:17.280> just<00:04:17.400> go<00:04:17.489> up<00:04:17.519> through<00:04:17.789> there<00:04:18.000> and

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
so you can just go up through there and

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.599 
so you can just go up through there and
I've<00:04:18.209> also<00:04:18.359> got<00:04:18.449> a<00:04:18.570> glue<00:04:18.810> over<00:04:19.019> here<00:04:19.579> now<00:04:20.579> a

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
I've also got a glue over here now a

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.949 
I've also got a glue over here now a
funny<00:04:20.909> thing<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.150> know<00:04:21.269> about<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:21.570> glory<00:04:21.870> I

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
funny thing to know about the glory I

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.629 
funny thing to know about the glory I
think<00:04:22.200> it's<00:04:22.320> 47<00:04:22.830> construction<00:04:23.219> for<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.400> glory

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
think it's 47 construction for the glory

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.300 
think it's 47 construction for the glory
but<00:04:24.450> for<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.690> glory<00:04:24.930> you<00:04:25.440> need<00:04:25.560> an<00:04:25.710> uncharged

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
but for the glory you need an uncharged

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.590 
but for the glory you need an uncharged
one<00:04:26.610> which<00:04:26.760> is<00:04:26.880> quite<00:04:27.000> weird

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
one which is quite weird

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.870 
one which is quite weird
that<00:04:28.080> means<00:04:28.290> if<00:04:28.440> you<00:04:28.530> got<00:04:28.710> 47<00:04:29.130> construction

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
that means if you got 47 construction

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.940 
that means if you got 47 construction
before<00:04:30.450> any<00:04:30.810> wondered<00:04:31.170> heroes<00:04:31.530> you<00:04:31.830> can

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
before any wondered heroes you can

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.560 
before any wondered heroes you can
actually<00:04:32.070> get<00:04:32.460> teleports<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:33.120> glory<00:04:33.360> in

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
actually get teleports of a glory in

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.540 
actually get teleports of a glory in
your<00:04:33.690> house<00:04:33.810> so<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.740> don't<00:04:35.010> know<00:04:35.100> why<00:04:35.280> you<00:04:35.340> need

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
your house so I don't know why you need

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.860 
your house so I don't know why you need
an<00:04:35.640> uncharged<00:04:36.030> one<00:04:36.210> but<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.450> only<00:04:36.600> need<00:04:36.750> an

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
an uncharged one but you only need an

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.360 
an uncharged one but you only need an
uncharged<00:04:37.320> one<00:04:37.620> which<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:38.010> quite<00:04:38.190> interesting

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
uncharged one which is quite interesting

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.910 
uncharged one which is quite interesting
a4<00:04:39.000> but<00:04:39.930> yeah<00:04:40.050> I've<00:04:40.260> my<00:04:40.380> glory<00:04:40.590> there<00:04:40.770> that's

recharging glory so using glories

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.900 
recharging glory so using glories
manually<00:04:54.840> is<00:04:54.990> not<00:04:55.260> that<00:04:55.580> exciting<00:04:56.580> if<00:04:56.820> a

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
manually is not that exciting if a

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.760 
manually is not that exciting if a
prospector<00:04:57.450> mate<00:04:57.600> so<00:04:57.810> I<00:04:57.840> also<00:04:58.140> have<00:04:58.320> a<00:04:58.380> portal

room to the West now I've only built one

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.230 
room to the West now I've only built one
portal<00:05:01.200> frame<00:05:01.410> because<00:05:01.740> that's<00:05:02.310> all<00:05:02.430> I<00:05:02.490> need

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
portal frame because that's all I need

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.630 
portal frame because that's all I need
and<00:05:03.660> my<00:05:03.840> life<00:05:04.410> game<00:05:04.680> and<00:05:04.830> they<00:05:04.920> you<00:05:05.070> say<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:05.310> have

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
and my life game and they you say I have

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.820 
and my life game and they you say I have
pretty<00:05:06.030> much<00:05:06.210> very<00:05:06.750> similar<00:05:06.870> setup<00:05:07.350> listen<00:05:07.770> in

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
pretty much very similar setup listen in

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.010 
pretty much very similar setup listen in
fact<00:05:08.340> this<00:05:08.760> setups<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.210> little<00:05:09.450> bit<00:05:09.570> better<00:05:09.750> for

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
fact this setups a little bit better for

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.650 
fact this setups a little bit better for
me<00:05:10.430> it's<00:05:11.430> quite<00:05:11.640> similar<00:05:12.060> to<00:05:12.300> what<00:05:12.390> I<00:05:12.420> used<00:05:12.450> to

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
me it's quite similar to what I used to

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.150 
me it's quite similar to what I used to
have<00:05:12.810> but<00:05:12.930> I've<00:05:13.050> changed<00:05:13.260> up<00:05:13.500> over<00:05:13.860> here<00:05:14.040> the

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
have but I've changed up over here the

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.760 
have but I've changed up over here the
problem<00:05:14.490> needs<00:05:14.610> to<00:05:14.700> be<00:05:14.790> further<00:05:15.000> over<00:05:15.270> east

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
problem needs to be further over east

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.290 
problem needs to be further over east
but<00:05:16.770> I<00:05:16.800> only<00:05:16.980> have<00:05:17.130> one<00:05:17.160> frame<00:05:17.610> now<00:05:17.940> you'll<00:05:18.150> see

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
but I only have one frame now you'll see

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.240 
but I only have one frame now you'll see
it's<00:05:18.420> not<00:05:18.480> filled<00:05:18.840> in<00:05:18.990> yet<00:05:19.200> this<00:05:19.710> is<00:05:19.890> because<00:05:20.130> I

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
it's not filled in yet this is because I

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.850 
it's not filled in yet this is because I
need<00:05:20.400> to<00:05:20.460> do<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.670> course<00:05:20.970> desert<00:05:21.390> treasure<00:05:21.860> to

is the teleport to canvas and that's

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.370 
is the teleport to canvas and that's
what<00:05:27.180> I<00:05:27.240> want<00:05:27.420> to<00:05:27.480> put<00:05:27.570> there<00:05:27.750> because<00:05:28.050> kind<00:05:28.320> of

but<00:05:57.810> I<00:05:57.840> do<00:05:57.960> need<00:05:58.290> 55<00:05:58.650> construction<00:05:59.190> for<00:05:59.310> that

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
but I do need 55 construction for that

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.710 
but I do need 55 construction for that
that's<00:05:59.520> why<00:05:59.670> I<00:05:59.700> didn't<00:05:59.970> build<00:06:00.120> it<00:06:00.330> now

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
that's why I didn't build it now

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.640 
that's why I didn't build it now
remember<00:06:02.360> but<00:06:03.360> I<00:06:03.390> will<00:06:03.660> get<00:06:03.810> 55<00:06:04.170> construction

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
remember but I will get 55 construction

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.020 
remember but I will get 55 construction
if<00:06:04.770> I<00:06:04.860> ever<00:06:05.010> start<00:06:05.280> using<00:06:05.460> barrows<00:06:05.790> gear

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
if I ever start using barrows gear

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.120 
if I ever start using barrows gear
frequently<00:06:06.630> because<00:06:06.900> I'll<00:06:07.020> need<00:06:07.230> it<00:06:07.380> and<00:06:07.500> then

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
frequently because I'll need it and then

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.890 
frequently because I'll need it and then
here's<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.550> larder<00:06:09.030> which<00:06:09.150> I<00:06:09.330> was<00:06:09.420> building<00:06:09.810> I

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
here's the larder which I was building I

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.500 
here's the larder which I was building I
think<00:06:10.080> it's<00:06:10.230> eat<00:06:10.590> or<00:06:10.860> planks<00:06:11.280> /<00:06:11.520> so<00:06:12.210> you<00:06:12.300> can<00:06:12.420> do

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
think it's eat or planks / so you can do

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.720 
think it's eat or planks / so you can do
quite<00:06:12.690> a<00:06:12.750> few<00:06:12.840> an<00:06:13.110> invent<00:06:13.500> it<00:06:14.160> only<00:06:14.400> takes<00:06:14.610> a

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 
quite a few an invent it only takes a

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.160 
quite a few an invent it only takes a
few<00:06:14.760> per<00:06:15.060> end<00:06:15.210> run<00:06:15.390> and<00:06:15.600> you<00:06:15.690> get<00:06:15.840> good<00:06:16.020> X

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170 
few per end run and you get good X

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.780 
few per end run and you get good X
because<00:06:16.620> if<00:06:16.860> you<00:06:16.980> didn't<00:06:17.220> know<00:06:17.310> construction

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
because if you didn't know construction

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.930 
because if you didn't know construction
actually<00:06:18.030> works<00:06:18.240> on<00:06:18.390> XP<00:06:18.810> based<00:06:19.080> per<00:06:19.530> plank<00:06:20.040> so

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
actually works on XP based per plank so

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.770 
actually works on XP based per plank so
that<00:06:21.630> means<00:06:21.930> that<00:06:22.580> if<00:06:23.580> you<00:06:24.150> build<00:06:24.360> a<00:06:24.480> chair

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
that means that if you build a chair

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.800 
that means that if you build a chair
that<00:06:25.050> uses<00:06:25.320> one<00:06:25.680> or<00:06:25.890> plank<00:06:26.250> it<00:06:26.520> will<00:06:27.060> get<00:06:27.720> you

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
that uses one or plank it will get you

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.600 
that uses one or plank it will get you
say<00:06:27.960> 50<00:06:28.380> XP<00:06:28.710> I'm<00:06:28.830> not<00:06:28.950> sure<00:06:29.100> exactly<00:06:29.340> what<00:06:29.520> it

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
say 50 XP I'm not sure exactly what it

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.650 
say 50 XP I'm not sure exactly what it
is<00:06:29.730> but<00:06:29.880> if<00:06:30.000> you<00:06:30.060> build<00:06:30.300> something<00:06:30.630> like

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
is but if you build something like

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.210 
is but if you build something like
requires<00:06:31.200> 10<00:06:31.440> or<00:06:31.590> lunch<00:06:31.830> they'll<00:06:32.010> get<00:06:32.100> your

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
requires 10 or lunch they'll get your

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.820 
requires 10 or lunch they'll get your
500<00:06:32.700> XP<00:06:32.970> basically<00:06:33.960> you<00:06:34.410> want<00:06:34.590> to<00:06:34.620> do<00:06:34.740> the

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
500 XP basically you want to do the

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.500 
500 XP basically you want to do the
things<00:06:35.040> that<00:06:35.100> you<00:06:35.430> use<00:06:35.550> most<00:06:35.760> all<00:06:36.060> points<00:06:36.419> at

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
things that you use most all points at

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.020 
things that you use most all points at
once<00:06:36.690> because<00:06:36.960> it's<00:06:37.050> much<00:06:37.200> faster<00:06:37.380> obviously

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
once because it's much faster obviously

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.920 
once because it's much faster obviously
also<00:06:39.030> a<00:06:39.060> thing<00:06:39.210> to<00:06:39.330> know<00:06:39.480> is<00:06:39.630> that<00:06:39.660> when<00:06:39.870> you

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
also a thing to know is that when you

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.450 
also a thing to know is that when you
use<00:06:40.080> normal<00:06:40.440> planks<00:06:40.650> you<00:06:40.680> do<00:06:40.860> need

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
use normal planks you do need

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.999 
use normal planks you do need
you<00:06:42.270> need<00:06:42.449> nails<00:06:43.050> and<00:06:43.530> you<00:06:43.590> go<00:06:43.680> for<00:06:43.800> it<00:06:43.860> it

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009 
you need nails and you go for it it

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:45.350 
you need nails and you go for it it
takes<00:06:44.190> quite<00:06:44.340> a<00:06:44.430> while<00:06:44.520> because<00:06:45.000> you<00:06:45.090> actually

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
takes quite a while because you actually

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.420 
takes quite a while because you actually
have<00:06:45.509> to<00:06:45.690> succeed<00:06:46.169> before<00:06:46.259> the<00:06:46.530> nails<00:06:46.710> but

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
have to succeed before the nails but

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.529 
have to succeed before the nails but
anyway<00:06:47.699> that's<00:06:47.880> all<00:06:48.060> I<00:06:48.120> wanted<00:06:48.360> to<00:06:48.419> mention
