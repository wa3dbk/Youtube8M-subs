it off but if he obviously doesn't write

it off but if he obviously doesn't write
me<00:01:04.290> back

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
me back

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.469 
me back
and<00:01:05.220> even<00:01:05.640> though<00:01:05.729> telling<00:01:06.060> someone<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.360> you

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
and even though telling someone that you

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.240 
and even though telling someone that you
like<00:01:06.630> them<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> incredibly<00:01:07.470> difficult<00:01:07.740> you

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
like them is incredibly difficult you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.410 
like them is incredibly difficult you
have<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.520> understand<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:08.939> they<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
have to understand that they have to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.330 
have to understand that they have to
know<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:10.020> you're<00:01:10.200> interested<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.740> them<00:01:10.950> for

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
know if you're interested in them for

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.620 
know if you're interested in them for
them<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> make<00:01:11.670> their<00:01:11.790> mind<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.299> this

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
them to make their mind up and this

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.609 
them to make their mind up and this
isn't<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.080> boys<00:01:13.229> because<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.530> know

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
isn't just for boys because I know

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.050 
isn't just for boys because I know
plenty<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.979> girls<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:14.580> afraid<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.939> take

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
plenty of girls that are afraid to take

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.820 
plenty of girls that are afraid to take
the<00:01:15.150> first<00:01:15.299> step<00:01:15.600> because<00:01:16.020> bills<00:01:16.259> if<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.740> are

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the first step because bills if not are

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.740 
the first step because bills if not are
more<00:01:17.070> scalar<00:01:17.430> projection<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.299> even<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
more scalar projection so even if it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.149 
more scalar projection so even if it
make<00:01:18.930> things<00:01:19.049> awkward<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.860> better<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
make things awkward it's better to

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.649 
make things awkward it's better to
regret<00:01:20.250> saying<00:01:20.670> something<00:01:21.119> than<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> not<00:01:21.509> say

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
regret saying something than to not say

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.179 
regret saying something than to not say

in a previous blog post and it's

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.050 
in a previous blog post and it's
something<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.979> find<00:01:29.220> incredibly<00:01:29.759> hard<00:01:29.970> to

after effects I made a blog post on this
on<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:15.010> couple<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.490> days<00:02:15.610> ago<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.030> I'm<00:02:16.150> not<00:02:16.240> gonna

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
on a couple of days ago so I'm not gonna

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.030 
on a couple of days ago so I'm not gonna
go<00:02:16.480> into<00:02:16.600> too<00:02:16.660> much<00:02:16.750> detail<00:02:17.020> you<00:02:17.620> can<00:02:17.740> go<00:02:17.860> read

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
go into too much detail you can go read

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.440 
go into too much detail you can go read
that<00:02:18.070> for<00:02:18.250> yourself<00:02:18.580> but<00:02:18.970> yeah<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:19.300> any

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450

that for yourself but yeah like any
relationship<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:20.200> think<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.470> thinking<00:02:20.740> it

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
relationship I think that thinking it

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.320 
relationship I think that thinking it
through<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.340> definitely<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:21.880> positive<00:02:22.030> thing

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
through is definitely a positive thing

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.450 
through is definitely a positive thing
to<00:02:22.450> do<00:02:22.570> because<00:02:22.960> you<00:02:23.380> can<00:02:23.560> plan<00:02:23.950> out<00:02:24.190> what's

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
to do because you can plan out what's

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.980 
to do because you can plan out what's
gonna<00:02:24.610> happen<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.270> that<00:02:25.480> way<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:25.660> can<00:02:25.810> react

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
gonna happen and that way you can react

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.690 
gonna happen and that way you can react
to<00:02:26.020> coordinating<00:02:26.620> but<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.070> is<00:02:27.190> incredibly

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
to coordinating but this is incredibly

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.250 
to coordinating but this is incredibly
important<00:02:28.240> if<00:02:28.330> you're<00:02:28.480> university<00:02:29.080> or

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
important if you're university or

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.450 
important if you're university or
college<00:02:29.590> or<00:02:29.830> somewhere<00:02:30.100> that<00:02:30.190> you'll<00:02:30.370> be

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
college or somewhere that you'll be

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.920 
college or somewhere that you'll be
seeing<00:02:30.670> people<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.970> lot<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.540> mean<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:31.750> not<00:02:31.840> be

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
seeing people a lot so I mean you not be

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.630

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
seen these people day in and day out

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.890 
seen these people day in and day out
you've<00:02:34.090> really<00:02:34.360> need<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.600> think<00:02:34.780> things

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
you've really need to think things

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.600 
you've really need to think things
through<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.560> don't<00:02:36.040> only<00:02:36.190> think<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.460> yourself

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
through and don't only think of yourself

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.400 
through and don't only think of yourself
but<00:02:37.090> think<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.330> also<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.690> people<00:02:37.840> around<00:02:38.140> you

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
but think of also the people around you

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.020 
but think of also the people around you
because<00:02:38.530> sometimes<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.040> can<00:02:39.070> affect<00:02:39.370> them<00:02:39.490> too

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
because sometimes it can affect them too

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.000 
because sometimes it can affect them too

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
today and originally I was like well if

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.360 
today and originally I was like well if
a<00:02:46.540> guy's<00:02:46.720> interested<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.350> girls<00:02:47.530> should<00:02:48.250> he

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
a guy's interested in girls should he

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.160 
a guy's interested in girls should he
start<00:02:48.580> wearing<00:02:48.850> girls<00:02:49.060> clothing<00:02:49.360> what

start wearing girls clothing what

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.449 
start wearing girls clothing what
and<00:02:50.440> then<00:02:50.530> after<00:02:50.740> working<00:02:50.920> out<00:02:51.070> like<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.310> math

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
and then after working out like a math

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.040 
and then after working out like a math
equation<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:52.209> realized<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.870> kind<00:02:53.020> of

means<00:02:53.200> embrace<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.980> traits<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.670> person
