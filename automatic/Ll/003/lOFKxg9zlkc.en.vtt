the<00:01:07.979> bearing<00:01:08.280> system<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.700> really<00:01:08.939> nice

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
the bearing system is really nice

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.370 
the bearing system is really nice
absolutely<00:01:10.590> no<00:01:10.740> blade<00:01:11.010> play<00:01:12.170> it's<00:01:13.170> just

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
absolutely no blade play it's just

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:22.660 
absolutely no blade play it's just
awesome<00:01:13.610> know<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.950> lockup<00:01:18.590> is<00:01:19.590> halfway<00:01:20.070> now

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.539 

but<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.570> let<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.259> slide<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.430> no

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
but if you let it slide on with no

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.319 
but if you let it slide on with no
pressure<00:01:28.340> it's<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:29.670> bit<00:01:29.759> earlier<00:01:30.119> so

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
pressure it's a little bit earlier so

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.520 
pressure it's a little bit earlier so
I'll<00:01:30.780> cover<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.259> my<00:01:31.439> video<00:01:33.380> let's<00:01:34.380> get

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
I'll cover that in my video let's get

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:52.710 
I'll cover that in my video let's get
this<00:01:34.650> open

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.000 

well<00:01:53.720> it<00:01:53.840> looks<00:01:54.080> like<00:01:54.260> I<00:01:54.380> could<00:01:54.560> probably<00:01:54.800> open

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
well it looks like I could probably open

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.390 
well it looks like I could probably open
this<00:01:55.250> up<00:01:55.490> but<00:01:55.940> that's<00:01:56.330> no<00:01:56.570> fun

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
this up but that's no fun

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:39.090 
this up but that's no fun
let's<00:01:58.400> cut<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:58.640> open<00:02:21.560> fine<00:02:21.800> everywhere

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:52.199 

g-shock<00:02:40.450> it's<00:02:41.450> your<00:02:41.570> typical<00:02:41.810> box<00:02:50.830> g-shock

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
g-shock it's your typical box g-shock

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:02.399 
g-shock it's your typical box g-shock
it's<00:02:53.209> your<00:02:53.330> typical<00:02:53.540> tent

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:12.070 

here<00:03:03.409> it<00:03:03.500> is<00:03:03.590> y'all

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.120 

the<00:03:12.590> GD<00:03:13.100> 100<00:03:13.820> I<00:03:14.500> think<00:03:15.500> this<00:03:15.680> is<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.950> GD<00:03:16.910> 100<00:03:17.450> BW

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
the GD 100 I think this is the GD 100 BW

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.520 
the GD 100 I think this is the GD 100 BW
-<00:03:19.130> one<00:03:20.980> for<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.070> mirror<00:03:22.960> look<00:03:23.960> at<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:24.230> that

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
- one for that mirror look at that that

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.820 
- one for that mirror look at that that
is<00:03:24.560> just<00:03:24.950> wicked<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.050> all<00:03:27.230> black<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:27.800> I

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
is just wicked and it's all black so I

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.190 
is just wicked and it's all black so I
can<00:03:28.010> beat<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.280> crap<00:03:28.520> out<00:03:28.700> of<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:28.910> thing<00:03:29.200> and

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
can beat the crap out of this thing and

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.560 
can beat the crap out of this thing and
it'll<00:03:30.440> still<00:03:30.710> keep<00:03:30.890> on<00:03:31.070> going<00:03:34.300> let's<00:03:35.300> get<00:03:35.420> this

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
it'll still keep on going let's get this

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:45.430 
it'll still keep on going let's get this
puppy<00:03:35.810> on<00:03:41.620> man<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:42.980> think<00:03:43.550> that<00:03:44.050> that<00:03:45.050> list

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
puppy on man I think that that list

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.200 
puppy on man I think that that list
carbon<00:03:45.830> fiber<00:03:46.070> is<00:03:46.310> just<00:03:46.490> going<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.700> be<00:03:46.850> a<00:03:46.880> nice

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
carbon fiber is just going to be a nice

00:03:47.210 --> 00:04:09.440 
carbon fiber is just going to be a nice
EDC<00:03:48.400> combo

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:17.300 

look<00:04:10.050> at<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.260> y'all<00:04:11.780> just<00:04:12.780> incredible<00:04:16.310> I've

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
look at that y'all just incredible I've

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.710 
look at that y'all just incredible I've
never<00:04:17.489> seen<00:04:17.760> anything<00:04:17.970> like<00:04:18.120> that<00:04:18.359> look<00:04:18.660> at

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
never seen anything like that look at

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.949 
never seen anything like that look at
that<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:19.410> see<00:04:19.680> me<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:21.209> resin<00:04:21.540> feels<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:21.870> little

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
that you see me the resin feels a little

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.110 
that you see me the resin feels a little
different<00:04:22.140> it's<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.500> softer<00:04:23.310> than<00:04:23.790> that<00:04:24.000> one

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
different it's a softer than that one

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.370 
different it's a softer than that one
over<00:04:24.360> there<00:04:25.730> you<00:04:26.730> got<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.030> PVD<00:04:27.690> coat<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.200> as

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
over there you got the PVD coat and as

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.500 
over there you got the PVD coat and as
what<00:04:28.560> I'm<00:04:28.650> guessing<00:04:29.040> it's<00:04:29.430> PVD<00:04:29.910> but<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.270> is

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
what I'm guessing it's PVD but it is

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.420 
what I'm guessing it's PVD but it is
