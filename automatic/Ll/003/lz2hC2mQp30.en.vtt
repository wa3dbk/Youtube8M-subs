00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 good morning people are still diverse we are 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.420
 here on youtube now grant the micro 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.509
 and welcome I'm going to mystery ship 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.509
 we are here in a fourth room the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.130
 fourth millennium that no man pussy 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.010
 we are in the channel of etb nolan as 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.330
 I always bring you an experiment that 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.460
 comes directly from the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.590
 river laboratories and where they have 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.320
 made the new version of mac 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.510
 they took out a good trailer that came out 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.130
 the weapons of all the heroes all the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.130
 skills the sword of ribes in the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.790
 banana de soracÃ¡ went out we go all everything 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.070
 the calico that comes with the price 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.710
 Well, if you look closely at the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.690
 minute 1 of exactly this video the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.070
 I leave here a screen because I can not 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.379
 put the whole video because they would be 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.809
 so I leave you a screenshot 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.190
 of the minute 1 and also I leave you the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.070
 video the description in case you want it 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.320
 see comes a kind of slug not the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.570
 you see here that it is a green thing 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.790
 and goes to a trap with a candy and 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.010
 you will say but if the weapons come out what the fuck 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.040
 is this this has nothing to do with any 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.650
 hero, here everything started and I'm going to 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.570
 explain step by step what it is that 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.690
 we believe the users of live play ens 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.259
 What is this bug, as I told you? 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.000
 at the beginning it is supposed ball is a 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.950
 experiment as you can see here that you 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.280
 I leave a little picture with a cart in which 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.320
 come out toilets and there is do whatever 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.750
 the slug in the snail or whatever that is 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.619
 that is and put in the glass jar 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:38.880
 and they say the name of the bug this is because 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.200
 llama sean amorphous fight I do not know how 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.759
 pronounced in English so I do not 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.759
 ask and according to the paper is a 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.800
 test is an experiment and good in a 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.560
 principle the pamphlet this says that 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.869
 it has a great speed of division of 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.910
 cells and sign the scientist here 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.429
 who created it and for the time being we are not 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.690
 they say nothing else in the first pub you touch 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.480
 they send us 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.830
 and good as you see here we already have a 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 second full in which they leave 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.729
 syringes and always the dough comes out 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.590
 Green is viscous that is going to be 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.250
 that will be formed our possible 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.220
 champion and in the second pamphlet we 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.530
 says this bug is growing to a 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.160
 very fast pace and it is impossible 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.100
 stop it also in the second paragraph 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.980
 tells us that he is capable of vocalizing is 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.980
 say that you can talk or communicate 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.990
 and in the third paragraph it tells us that 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.480
 spontaneously this individual is altered 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.880
 biologically that is to say by altering its 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.680
 structure as you have already seen the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.630
 slug in the video because it can change 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.360
 he catches the way it does not happen pse 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.160
 nothing because it divides the cells but if 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.650
 you think that this ends here you are very 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.560
 wrong past a few days we 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.580
 they sent another photo another note in which 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.240
 they inform us that zac likes them a lot 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.550
 the sweets 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.230
 that's why we should have seen him in 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.470
 the video or taking a cupcake or a 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.540
 Chick that is very flexible not to mention 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.190
 that can be divided as you see here in 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.890
 the photo can be divided in the cases 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.720
 that he wants 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.400
 and also says in the report that when 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.500
 you are exposed to music because you can 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.340
 get up to dance so you can 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.110
 listening to sounds is not deaf and as 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.750
 I told you then that he is capable of speaking 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.760
 some laboratory vocabulary and that 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.060
 he likes very much the sweets he feeds 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.200
 of muffin buns and candies 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.450
 of whatever it is but all sweet 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.190
 he also says that this guy with what 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.610
 small that is already you can perform 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.920
 incredible amounts of damage tons of 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.870
 size as you see here in the note the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.300
 specimen this well answers very well 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.730
 the stimuli up to the high places and 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.099
 at low temperatures that has endured or 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.500
 be that it is a bug pretty billet this 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:02.010
 it's the second report that they sent us and 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.440
 let's see the third report then in 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.790
 the third report as I told you 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.970
 they tell us they were doing tests 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.769
 contact and he got away from the 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.019
 test chamber that is to say with some 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.840
 power you have can leave 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.870
 habitats and not only that says that has 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.359
 created a link with the creators and 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.210
 who want to be free is to say the already 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.100
 that this as you see here the note wants 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.389
 be free or you want to escape that will be 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.389
 at your leisure and you do not want to be in the 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.280
 laboratory and they also inform us how 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.560
 you see here that some scientists then 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.260
 they have escaped have sent a 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.790
 authorization to escape and have left 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.789
 the project and they have left the lab 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.569
 so I do not know who will plot all of us 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.909
 with the 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:47.819
 report that we have and we will see does 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.679
 already a little bit more grown up and it's not 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.169
 a slug as it was before but now 

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:55.050
 he's a pretty bent guy who looks like 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.699
 things of the fantastic four I'll 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.999
 I put here the last photo sent to us 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:02.550
 from the laboratory and as you can see 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:05.759
 it seems ma jin bush birds it appears the 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:09.029
 ego like a jin wook with the pigtail state 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.889
 the horn this and the big hands those that 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.629
 has and so a little soft even 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:16.439
 to date we only know this that you 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:18.119
 I have counted enough we already know and good 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:21.240
 I leave you here has finished the 

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:22.830
 report we will continue the next day when 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.169
 upload more news and more photos of this 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.369
 champion this has been all friends we
