x8<00:00:00.690> that's<00:00:01.680> our<00:00:01.829> new<00:00:02.040> helicopter<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:03.620> bigger

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
x8 that's our new helicopter a bigger

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.340 
x8 that's our new helicopter a bigger
payload<00:00:05.100> capacity<00:00:05.700> longer<00:00:06.569> flight<00:00:06.810> times<00:00:07.049> and

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
payload capacity longer flight times and

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.299 
payload capacity longer flight times and
grievous<00:00:07.770> models<00:00:09.260> we're<00:00:10.260> advertising<00:00:10.620> I

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
grievous models we're advertising I

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.120 
grievous models we're advertising I
think<00:00:11.700> one<00:00:12.179> kilogram<00:00:12.780> per<00:00:12.990> payload<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:13.920> that

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
think one kilogram per payload so that

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.700 
think one kilogram per payload so that
lets<00:00:14.340> us<00:00:14.580> support<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.540> gimballed<00:00:16.260> camera

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
lets us support the gimballed camera

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.330 
lets us support the gimballed camera
systems<00:00:17.190> digital<00:00:18.060> SLR<00:00:18.810> cameras<00:00:19.350> as<00:00:19.529> well

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
systems digital SLR cameras as well

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.580 
systems digital SLR cameras as well
so<00:00:21.340> this<00:00:21.789> camera<00:00:22.270> up<00:00:22.660> here<00:00:22.869> right<00:00:23.050> now<00:00:23.320> is<00:00:23.560> a

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
so this camera up here right now is a

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.630 
so this camera up here right now is a
cloud<00:00:24.310> cap<00:00:24.640> taste<00:00:25.539> system<00:00:26.349> it's<00:00:26.980> a<00:00:27.099> stabilized

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
cloud cap taste system it's a stabilized

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.060 
cloud cap taste system it's a stabilized
camera<00:00:27.910> system<00:00:28.480> so<00:00:28.930> if<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.380> helicopters

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
camera system so if the helicopters

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.380 
camera system so if the helicopters
moving<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:31.539> camera<00:00:31.810> stays<00:00:32.230> stable<00:00:32.559> and<00:00:33.390> you

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
moving the camera stays stable and you

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.729 
moving the camera stays stable and you
always<00:00:34.510> have<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.840> clear<00:00:35.199> image<00:00:35.320> of<00:00:35.559> what

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
always have a clear image of what

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.900 
always have a clear image of what
they're<00:00:35.920> working<00:00:36.070> out

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.530 

also<00:00:40.910> allows<00:00:41.420> for<00:00:41.590> so<00:00:42.590> right<00:00:42.890> now<00:00:43.540> the

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
also allows for so right now the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.870 
also allows for so right now the
helicopter<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.380> camera<00:00:45.739> are<00:00:45.920> moving<00:00:46.250> we

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
helicopter and the camera are moving we

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.479 
helicopter and the camera are moving we
put<00:00:47.090> it<00:00:47.210> on<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.450> stabilized<00:00:47.960> mode<00:00:48.489> the

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
put it on the stabilized mode the

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.700 
put it on the stabilized mode the
helicopter<00:00:50.120> keeps<00:00:50.300> moving<00:00:50.780> cameras<00:00:51.559> a

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
helicopter keeps moving cameras a

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.920 
helicopter keeps moving cameras a
station

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
station

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.660 
station
so<00:00:53.650> come<00:00:54.040> on<00:00:54.190> let's<00:00:54.880> go<00:00:55.000> up<00:00:55.510> here<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.920> is<00:00:57.040> this

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
so come on let's go up here this is this

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.340 
so come on let's go up here this is this
is<00:00:57.880> a<00:00:57.910> different<00:00:58.330> one<00:00:58.420> this<00:00:58.540> is<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.750> low<00:00:59.140> light

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
is a different one this is a low light

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
is a different one this is a low light
system<00:00:59.800> so<00:00:59.830> for<00:01:00.520> nighttime<00:01:00.880> operations<00:01:02.370> very

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
system so for nighttime operations very

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.870 
system so for nighttime operations very
very<00:01:03.730> low<00:01:03.970> lux<00:01:04.210> I<00:01:04.510> think<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.839> point<00:01:05.230> 0<00:01:05.620> 0<00:01:05.770> 0<00:01:06.220> 1

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
very low lux I think the point 0 0 0 1

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.330 
very low lux I think the point 0 0 0 1
loss<00:01:07.050> so<00:01:08.050> operates<00:01:08.500> in<00:01:08.620> very<00:01:08.920> low<00:01:09.130> lighting

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
loss so operates in very low lighting

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.120 
loss so operates in very low lighting
conditions<00:01:09.970> this<00:01:10.960> one<00:01:11.200> up<00:01:11.350> here<00:01:11.500> also<00:01:11.740> allows

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
conditions this one up here also allows

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.320 
conditions this one up here also allows
us<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.580> do<00:01:12.729> target<00:01:13.300> tracking<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.910> if<00:01:15.910> we<00:01:15.970> want

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
us to do target tracking so if we want

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.540 
us to do target tracking so if we want
to<00:01:18.030> follow<00:01:19.030> a<00:01:19.180> target

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.030 

and<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.000> want<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.330> follow<00:01:24.510> him<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.620> camera

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
and we want to follow him the camera

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.010 
and we want to follow him the camera
will<00:01:26.160> stay<00:01:26.430> locked<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.210> target<00:01:27.690> until

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
will stay locked on that target until

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.010 
will stay locked on that target until
either<00:01:28.740> something<00:01:29.280> happens<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.820> uses<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.660> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
either something happens and uses that a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.930 
either something happens and uses that a
visual<00:01:31.980> contact<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.450> want<00:01:33.660> to<00:01:33.840> move<00:01:34.020> off

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
visual contact or we want to move off

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.930 
visual contact or we want to move off
target<00:01:35.940> so<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.960> i<00:01:37.110> move<00:01:37.260> the<00:01:37.470> helicopter

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
target so if i move the helicopter

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.930 
target so if i move the helicopter
the<00:01:40.330> camera<00:01:40.780> still<00:01:41.020> stays<00:01:41.980> on<00:01:42.250> that<00:01:42.460> target

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
the camera still stays on that target

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.440 
the camera still stays on that target
and<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.660> same<00:01:43.870> thing<00:01:44.080> with<00:01:44.230> the<00:01:44.260> kick

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
and the same thing with the kick

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.300 
and the same thing with the kick
this<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.140> something<00:01:47.439> about<00:01:47.500> this<00:01:47.829> it's<00:01:48.219> a

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
this is something about this it's a

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.550 
this is something about this it's a
controller<00:01:48.789> taping<00:01:49.090> stuff<00:01:49.240> yes<00:01:49.570> yeah<00:01:49.990> there's

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
controller taping stuff yes yeah there's

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.800 
controller taping stuff yes yeah there's
independent<00:01:51.430> motors<00:01:51.789> for<00:01:52.060> each<00:01:52.180> rotor<00:01:52.509> blade

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
independent motors for each rotor blade

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.620 
independent motors for each rotor blade
message<00:01:53.469> two<00:01:53.680> Moto's<00:01:54.009> yep<00:01:54.850> so<00:01:55.149> there's<00:01:55.360> this
