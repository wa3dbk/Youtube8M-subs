00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
off and this stuff has the tendency to

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.310

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
get a little brittle as it as it gets it

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.490 
get a little brittle as it as it gets it
older<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:42.890> exposed<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.430> Sun<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.260> there<00:02:45.260> we

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
older and exposed to Sun so there we

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.230 
older and exposed to Sun so there we
have<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.770> north<00:02:46.100> side<00:02:46.370> protected<00:02:47.000> from<00:02:47.120> the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
have the north side protected from the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.500 
have the north side protected from the
wind<00:02:48.940> okay<00:02:49.940> on<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.780> next<00:02:50.990> one<00:02:51.200> that's

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
wind okay on to the next one that's

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.290
