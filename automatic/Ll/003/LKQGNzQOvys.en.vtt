what<00:01:22.470> really<00:01:22.920> pulled<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.400> out<00:01:23.549> was<00:01:23.820> when<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
what really pulled it out was when the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.260 
what really pulled it out was when the
DP<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.900> she<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.680> pulled<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.880> beauty

I<00:01:29.340> think<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> challenge<00:01:30.659> was<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.869> find<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.810 
I think the challenge was to find the
language<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> movie<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.340> how<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
language of the movie and how to

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.910 
language of the movie and how to
