them<00:02:02.960> he's<00:02:03.590> drawing<00:02:04.310> double<00:02:04.700> teams<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.330> I

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
them he's drawing double teams and I

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.960 
them he's drawing double teams and I
think<00:02:06.830> Nash<00:02:07.039> is<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.340> perfect<00:02:07.670> guy<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.759> play

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
think Nash is the perfect guy to play

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:18.059 
think Nash is the perfect guy to play
off<00:02:08.119> of<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.739> it<00:02:09.739> helps<00:02:09.979> both<00:02:10.130> our<00:02:10.310> games

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.690

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
shots which we now have a bunch of guys

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.090 
shots which we now have a bunch of guys
that<00:02:47.209> can<00:02:47.870> hit<00:02:48.049> shots<00:02:48.290> not<00:02:48.530> just<00:02:48.769> one<00:02:48.920> or<00:02:48.950> two

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
that can hit shots not just one or two

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.120 
that can hit shots not just one or two
on<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.900> we<00:02:51.170> move<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.500> ball<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.829> way<00:02:51.950> we're

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
on and we move the ball the way we're

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.190 
on and we move the ball the way we're
moving<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.519> there's<00:02:53.180> no<00:02:53.420> reason<00:02:53.900> that<00:02:53.930> we

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
moving it there's no reason that we

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.300 
moving it there's no reason that we
don't<00:02:54.380> win<00:02:54.530> every<00:02:54.950> game<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.489> know<00:02:56.590> as<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.620> team

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:08.380 

right

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.239 

well<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.420> think<00:03:09.599> so<00:03:09.989> I'm<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.530> know<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.739> think

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:11.249 
well I think so I'm you know I think

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:13.520 
well I think so I'm you know I think
winning<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.269> I<00:03:12.299> think<00:03:12.749> you<00:03:12.870> do<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.019> think

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
winning and that I think you do I think

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.160 
winning and that I think you do I think
it's<00:03:13.650> perfect<00:03:14.010> that's<00:03:14.659> there's<00:03:15.659> no<00:03:15.810> way<00:03:16.109> you

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
it's perfect that's there's no way you

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.959 
it's perfect that's there's no way you
wouldn't<00:03:16.829> want<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.010> play<00:03:17.159> this<00:03:17.370> way<00:03:17.549> there's

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:17.969 
wouldn't want to play this way there's

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.569 
wouldn't want to play this way there's
no<00:03:18.480> way<00:03:18.599> and<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.620> think<00:03:19.709> they<00:03:20.010> fill<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.489> you

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
no way and I think they fill it and you

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:21.949 
no way and I think they fill it and you
can<00:03:20.730> see<00:03:20.879> it<00:03:20.969> in<00:03:21.060> her<00:03:21.150> face<00:03:21.329> as<00:03:21.569> you<00:03:21.659> can<00:03:21.780> see<00:03:21.900> in
