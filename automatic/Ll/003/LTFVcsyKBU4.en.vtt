00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.270
 Y 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.539
 good morning we present a new boom 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:24.980
 boxing in this case is from a mini pc with 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.310
 windows of the brand dell inc model that 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.310
 tf1 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.870
 it's a very small box one normal 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.640
 in these devices 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.829
 well here we have the mini pc 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.160
 Of course the size is really 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.160
 small 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.570
 as the front and still small of the 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.570
 sector 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 is that I want a metallic finish on 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.460
 after another protector 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.150
 it's a really small size 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.299
 the truth is that it weighs a little bit this 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.050
 surely it is going to the battery 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.050
 the internal battery that it carries makes 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.800
 be a little over 1000 normal pc 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.320
 Wishing the ring good you know that 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.920
 it's about a small mini pci that leads to 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:36.240
 a shock intel atom 330 and 735 efe up 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.420
 2.8 city and it takes us a couple of rows 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.140
 ram and in 32 gigs and warehouse but what 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.929
 normal 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:49.759
 lately it's worth at the connectivity level 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:49.759
 web up on a couple of USB 2.0 ports 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.070
 a port 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.800
 microusb that will be the hotel and also 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.270
 micro port hmm was going to present place 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.020
 our monitor or television 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:09.099
 a microsd card reader 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.190
 a 3.5 mm jack for audio us 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:15.910
 we can put between some headphones and 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.440
 finally a small power button 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.020
 As you can see, everything is concentrated in the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.640
 rear part 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.420
 bojan have put some usb the truth 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.550
 on one side make it more accessible but 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.520
 good 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.220
 the truth is that the floor the design is 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:38.320
 pretty good and it's very finite 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.320
 let's see the accessories that brings 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:46.120
 to this case 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.120
 we have a cable 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.100
 hm 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.820
 with the 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.820
 with all 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:01.540
 aside micro h md not serve to 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:06.099
 connect it to the berlin and on the other with hdmi 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.220
 more macho you can stop our monitor or 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.640
 TV 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.830
 which is also not a manual 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.830
 precisely the most signed sign 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.430
 with some specifications of how 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:24.990
 connect it in case you're not able 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.920
 really useful 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.920
 finally 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:36.360
 there is a usb cable here one will serve 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:40.810
 to connect the bei ling the mini pc 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.220
 to the power supply 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.989
 all these heats a source of 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.870
 5 volt external power 2 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.069
 amps that will give us the protection 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:55.549
 cost solution to move this junk 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:04:02.870
 as you see here and I am already connected to 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:02.870
 mini pc and that does not bring the big thing
