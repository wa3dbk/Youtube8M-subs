first off whenever you can help it
the<00:00:43.710> motorcycle<00:00:44.430> should<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.789> facing<00:00:45.059> forward

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
the motorcycle should be facing forward

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.330 
the motorcycle should be facing forward
if<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.300> unavoidable<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.469> transport<00:00:50.219> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
if it's unavoidable you can transport a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.619 
if it's unavoidable you can transport a
motorcycle<00:00:50.940> backwards

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
motorcycle backwards

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.420 
motorcycle backwards
for<00:00:52.020> example<00:00:52.379> I've<00:00:52.469> had<00:00:52.620> two<00:00:52.800> gold<00:00:53.070> wings<00:00:53.280> in

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
for example I've had two gold wings in

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.100 
for example I've had two gold wings in
the<00:00:53.489> back<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:53.879> truck<00:00:54.120> before<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.870> had

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the back of this truck before and I had

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.660 
the back of this truck before and I had
to<00:00:55.289> put<00:00:55.500> one<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.770> them<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:55.949> backwards<00:00:56.160> because

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
to put one of them in backwards because

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.860 
to put one of them in backwards because
they<00:00:56.789> were<00:00:56.879> fully<00:00:57.090> dressed<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.690> was<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
they were fully dressed and that was the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
they were fully dressed and that was the
only<00:00:57.930> way<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.230> would<00:00:58.289> fit<00:00:58.530> around<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
only way it would fit around the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.779 
only way it would fit around the
fairings<00:00:59.250> but<00:01:00.800> when<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.920> strap<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> bike<00:01:02.609> down

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
fairings but when you strap a bike down

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.020 
fairings but when you strap a bike down
you<00:01:02.969> need<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.239> take<00:01:03.420> advantage<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
you need to take advantage of the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.080 
you need to take advantage of the
expansion<00:01:06.170> pressure<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.670> forks

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
expansion pressure of the of the forks

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.270 
expansion pressure of the of the forks
and<00:01:09.330> that'll<00:01:10.200> only<00:01:10.439> work<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.890> bike<00:01:11.250> is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and that'll only work if the bike is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.280 
and that'll only work if the bike is
facing<00:01:12.030> forward<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.450> make<00:01:12.869> sure<00:01:12.900> your<00:01:13.140> bike<00:01:13.229> is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
facing forward so make sure your bike is

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.469 
facing forward so make sure your bike is
facing<00:01:13.770> forwards<00:01:14.130> you're<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> want<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
facing forwards you're going to want to

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.249 
facing forwards you're going to want to
be<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.840> first<00:01:16.080> gear<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:18.049> you'll<00:01:19.049> need<00:01:19.200> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
be in first gear and you'll need a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.070 
be in first gear and you'll need a
couple<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.890> attachment<00:01:20.700> points<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.869> my

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
couple of attachment points I have on my

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.390 
couple of attachment points I have on my

forwards<00:01:42.150> down<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:45.829> so<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.340> kind<00:01:47.579> of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
forwards down and out so it is kind of

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.120 
forwards down and out so it is kind of
important<00:01:48.060> where<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.420> where<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.590> attach<00:01:49.680> the

would<00:04:08.170> be<00:04:08.290> significant<00:04:08.980> effort<00:04:09.280> then<00:04:09.940> you're

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
would be significant effort then you're

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.530 
would be significant effort then you're
probably<00:04:10.300> at<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.290> good<00:04:11.500> place<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:12.060> as<00:04:13.060> you<00:04:13.390> can

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
probably at a good place and as you can

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.470 
probably at a good place and as you can
see<00:04:13.750> now<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.930> bike<00:04:17.109> is<00:04:17.350> absolutely<00:04:18.040> connected

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
see now the bike is absolutely connected

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.460 
see now the bike is absolutely connected
to<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:19.570> bed<00:04:19.750> of<00:04:20.020> the<00:04:20.229> truck

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
to the bed of the truck

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.680 
to the bed of the truck
it's<00:04:22.470> not<00:04:22.650> going<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.860> go<00:04:22.979> anywhere<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:24.360> crank

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
it's not going to go anywhere and crank

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.439 
it's not going to go anywhere and crank
it<00:04:24.810> maybe<00:04:25.169> one<00:04:25.530> more<00:04:25.919> and<00:04:26.280> that's<00:04:26.879> that<00:04:27.180> and

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
it maybe one more and that's that and

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.300 
it maybe one more and that's that and
really<00:04:28.110> that's<00:04:28.229> all<00:04:28.440> you<00:04:28.620> need<00:04:28.830> you<00:04:29.099> don't

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
really that's all you need you don't

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.189 
really that's all you need you don't
have<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.759> put<00:04:29.970> straps<00:04:30.360> in<00:04:30.599> the<00:04:30.690> back<00:04:30.870> if<00:04:31.080> you

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
have to put straps in the back if you

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.020 
have to put straps in the back if you
don't<00:04:31.379> want<00:04:31.560> to<00:04:31.800> all<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:32.639> need<00:04:32.849> are<00:04:33.000> two

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
don't want to all you need are two

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.640 
don't want to all you need are two
straps<00:04:33.479> and<00:04:33.629> that's<00:04:33.780> good<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.110> go<00:04:34.139> across<00:04:34.440> the

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
straps and that's good to go across the

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.809 
straps and that's good to go across the
country<00:04:35.659> if<00:04:36.659> you<00:04:36.960> do<00:04:37.139> want<00:04:37.379> to<00:04:37.699> put<00:04:38.699> your

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
country if you do want to put your

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.119 
country if you do want to put your
straps<00:04:39.090> in<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.330> back<00:04:39.360> then<00:04:40.289> you<00:04:40.680> should

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
straps in the back then you should

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.330 
straps in the back then you should
attach<00:04:41.479> two<00:04:42.479> lower<00:04:42.750> points<00:04:43.319> so<00:04:44.009> you'll<00:04:44.159> have

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
attach two lower points so you'll have

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.129 
attach two lower points so you'll have
these<00:04:44.490> down<00:04:44.699> in<00:04:44.789> the<00:04:44.879> bed<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.720> attach<00:04:45.960> the

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
these down in the bed you attach the

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.379 
these down in the bed you attach the
lower<00:04:46.259> points<00:04:46.710> than<00:04:46.919> your<00:04:47.129> front<00:04:47.340> straps<00:04:47.699> this

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
lower points than your front straps this

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.749 
lower points than your front straps this
is<00:04:48.569> because<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.680> effort<00:04:50.099> in<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.280> back<00:04:50.490> is

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
is because the effort in the back is

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.050 
is because the effort in the back is
basically<00:04:51.569> just<00:04:51.690> going<00:04:52.050> to<00:04:52.580> work<00:04:53.580> against

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
basically just going to work against

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.230 
basically just going to work against
like<00:04:54.210> side-to-side<00:04:54.690> swaying<00:04:55.319> motion<00:04:55.889> of<00:04:56.550> the

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
like side-to-side swaying motion of the

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.240 
like side-to-side swaying motion of the
motorcycle<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.409> mean<00:04:58.560> you'd<00:04:58.740> have<00:04:58.889> to<00:04:59.039> go

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
motorcycle and I mean you'd have to go

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.279 
motorcycle and I mean you'd have to go
around<00:04:59.580> a<00:04:59.729> serious<00:05:00.210> corner<00:05:00.629> in<00:05:00.840> order<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.169> get

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
around a serious corner in order to get

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.559 
around a serious corner in order to get
anything<00:05:01.590> out<00:05:01.949> of<00:05:01.979> any<00:05:02.819> movement<00:05:03.090> out<00:05:03.360> of<00:05:03.449> this

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
anything out of any movement out of this

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.529 
anything out of any movement out of this
but<00:05:03.960> all<00:05:04.770> you<00:05:04.949> want<00:05:05.159> is<00:05:05.370> this<00:05:05.610> really

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
but all you want is this really

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.770 
but all you want is this really
horizontal<00:05:07.969> lateral<00:05:08.969> strap<00:05:09.539> that<00:05:09.719> goes

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
horizontal lateral strap that goes

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.779 
horizontal lateral strap that goes
across<00:05:10.050> here<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:10.530> you<00:05:10.680> can<00:05:10.889> attach<00:05:11.159> you<00:05:11.669> know

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
across here and you can attach you know

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.969 
across here and you can attach you know
right<00:05:12.090> this<00:05:12.629> part<00:05:12.900> of<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.020> frame<00:05:13.229> here<00:05:13.650> or<00:05:13.860> you

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
right this part of the frame here or you

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.490 
right this part of the frame here or you
can<00:05:14.099> go<00:05:14.219> up<00:05:14.250> here<00:05:14.580> if<00:05:14.669> you<00:05:14.729> want<00:05:15.000> to<00:05:15.409> but<00:05:16.409> it

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
can go up here if you want to but it

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.649 
can go up here if you want to but it
should<00:05:16.680> be<00:05:16.770> a<00:05:16.800> nice<00:05:16.979> low<00:05:17.310> hook<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:20.509> you<00:05:21.509> know

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
should be a nice low hook and you know

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.010 
should be a nice low hook and you know
so<00:05:22.319> that's<00:05:22.469> basically<00:05:22.919> it<00:05:23.750> obviously<00:05:24.750> if<00:05:24.870> this

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
so that's basically it obviously if this

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.399 
so that's basically it obviously if this
is<00:05:25.199> your<00:05:25.319> first<00:05:25.529> time<00:05:27.139> transporting<00:05:28.139> a

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
is your first time transporting a

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.499 
is your first time transporting a
vehicle<00:05:28.740> and/or<00:05:28.979> transporting<00:05:29.940> a<00:05:29.969> motorcycle

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
vehicle and/or transporting a motorcycle

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.930 
vehicle and/or transporting a motorcycle
in<00:05:30.569> your<00:05:30.690> vehicle<00:05:31.080> take<00:05:31.319> it<00:05:31.469> easy<00:05:31.620> so<00:05:32.039> you<00:05:32.069> know

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
in your vehicle take it easy so you know

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.459 
in your vehicle take it easy so you know
how<00:05:33.180> your<00:05:33.360> truck<00:05:33.599> is<00:05:33.750> going<00:05:33.870> to<00:05:33.960> respond<00:05:34.349> to

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
how your truck is going to respond to

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:38.209 
how your truck is going to respond to
the<00:05:34.650> extra<00:05:34.979> weight<00:05:36.440> also<00:05:37.440> it's<00:05:37.979> not<00:05:38.159> just

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:38.219 
the extra weight also it's not just

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:40.249 
the extra weight also it's not just
weight<00:05:38.880> I<00:05:39.120> mean<00:05:39.210> it's<00:05:39.330> not<00:05:39.419> like<00:05:39.479> just<00:05:40.050> putting

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 
weight I mean it's not like just putting

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:41.450 
weight I mean it's not like just putting
four<00:05:40.529> hundred<00:05:40.800> pounds<00:05:41.009> of<00:05:41.039> sand<00:05:41.279> in<00:05:41.430> your

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
four hundred pounds of sand in your

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.290 
four hundred pounds of sand in your
truck<00:05:41.759> because<00:05:42.150> this<00:05:43.020> um<00:05:43.550> this<00:05:44.550> motorcycle<00:05:44.909> is

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
truck because this um this motorcycle is

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.790 
truck because this um this motorcycle is
relatively<00:05:45.750> high<00:05:46.020> up<00:05:46.229> so<00:05:46.380> it's<00:05:46.500> got<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.650> high

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
relatively high up so it's got a high

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.370 
relatively high up so it's got a high
center<00:05:47.130> of<00:05:47.159> gravity<00:05:47.279> so<00:05:48.110> especially<00:05:49.110> if<00:05:49.319> you

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
center of gravity so especially if you

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.930 
center of gravity so especially if you
have<00:05:49.500> a<00:05:49.560> lifted<00:05:50.009> truck<00:05:50.250> and<00:05:50.460> especially<00:05:50.879> if

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
have a lifted truck and especially if

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.670 
have a lifted truck and especially if
you<00:05:51.029> have<00:05:51.150> a<00:05:51.180> smaller<00:05:51.569> lifted<00:05:52.110> truck<00:05:52.379> you'll

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
you have a smaller lifted truck you'll

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.610 
you have a smaller lifted truck you'll
find<00:05:52.979> that<00:05:53.719> your<00:05:54.719> truck<00:05:54.960> we're<00:05:55.169> going<00:05:55.319> to<00:05:55.379> lope

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
find that your truck we're going to lope

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.379 
find that your truck we're going to lope
around<00:05:56.009> corners<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:56.550> we'll<00:05:56.940> be<00:05:57.029> a<00:05:57.060> little<00:05:57.300> bit

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
around corners and we'll be a little bit

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.409 
around corners and we'll be a little bit
more<00:05:57.539> unsteady<00:05:58.020> but<00:05:58.969> you<00:05:59.969> really<00:06:00.150> don't<00:06:00.240> need

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
more unsteady but you really don't need

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:01.730 
more unsteady but you really don't need
anything<00:06:00.659> special<00:06:00.810> to<00:06:01.229> transport<00:06:01.680> a

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
anything special to transport a

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.180 
anything special to transport a
motorcycle<00:06:02.370> I<00:06:02.550> put<00:06:03.300> two<00:06:03.680> cb750<00:06:04.680> s<00:06:04.889> in<00:06:04.979> the<00:06:05.069> back
