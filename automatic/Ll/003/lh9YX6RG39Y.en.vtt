these I would say they even out 20 or
ten<00:05:08.310> dollars<00:05:08.699> so<00:05:09.449> now<00:05:10.169> we're<00:05:10.380> running<00:05:10.530> into

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
ten dollars so now we're running into

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.999 
ten dollars so now we're running into
about<00:05:11.310> 50<00:05:12.120> bucks<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:12.660> then<00:05:13.349> the<00:05:13.560> question<00:05:13.680> is

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009

for all of you is this worth fifteen
dollars<00:05:16.080> i<00:05:16.229> would<00:05:16.410> argue<00:05:16.560> if<00:05:16.889> they<00:05:16.919> listed

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729

dollars i would argue if they listed
this<00:05:17.880> they<00:05:18.060> probably<00:05:18.270> listed<00:05:18.660> at<00:05:19.020> fifteen

this they probably listed at fifteen

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.969 
this they probably listed at fifteen
dollars<00:05:20.070> but<00:05:20.910> overall<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:22.500> value<00:05:22.830> of<00:05:22.889> this

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
dollars but overall the value of this

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.860 
dollars but overall the value of this
box<00:05:23.310> is<00:05:23.580> hovering<00:05:24.000> right<00:05:24.270> around<00:05:24.419> the<00:05:24.660> price

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
before but the rest of things I've never

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.350

heard<00:05:42.750> of<00:05:42.930> or<00:05:43.289> knew<00:05:43.949> existed<00:05:44.310> so<00:05:45.180> these<00:05:45.300> are

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
heard of or knew existed so these are

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.140 
heard of or knew existed so these are
three<00:05:45.479> new<00:05:45.870> things<00:05:46.260> that<00:05:46.620> they<00:05:47.520> had<00:05:47.729> and<00:05:48.000> then

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
three new things that they had and then

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.390 
three new things that they had and then
something<00:05:48.690> that<00:05:48.930> I<00:05:48.960> actually<00:05:49.139> wanted<00:05:49.860> that

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
something that I actually wanted that

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.939 
something that I actually wanted that
they<00:05:50.550> ended<00:05:50.610> up<00:05:50.760> sending<00:05:51.180> in<00:05:51.300> there<00:05:51.949> so

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
they ended up sending in there so

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.010 
they ended up sending in there so
overall<00:05:53.250> the<00:05:53.940> question<00:05:54.300> is<00:05:54.419> really<00:05:54.570> do<00:05:54.930> you

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
overall the question is really do you

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.070 
overall the question is really do you
think<00:05:55.259> this<00:05:55.380> is<00:05:55.409> 70<00:05:55.800> worth<00:05:56.130> $75<00:05:57.120> I<00:05:57.330> think<00:05:57.960> it's

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
think this is 70 worth $75 I think it's

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.379 
think this is 70 worth $75 I think it's
right<00:05:58.229> at<00:05:58.380> that<00:05:58.500> $75<00:05:59.280> more<00:05:59.610> but<00:06:00.270> that's

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
right at that $75 more but that's

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.719 
right at that $75 more but that's
because<00:06:00.630> I<00:06:00.810> have<00:06:01.310> experience<00:06:02.310> with<00:06:02.430> some<00:06:02.639> of

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
because I have experience with some of

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.810
