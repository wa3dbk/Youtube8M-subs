00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
unfortunate turn out to this board all

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.290 
unfortunate turn out to this board all
right

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
right

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.610 
right
two<00:04:23.300> stars<00:04:23.630> at<00:04:23.900> one<00:04:24.110> star<00:04:26.260> 116<00:04:27.260> she<00:04:27.440> obviously

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
two stars at one star 116 she obviously

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.830 
two stars at one star 116 she obviously
got<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.040> coin<00:04:28.310> star<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:29.030> probably<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.690> mini

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
got the coin star and probably the mini

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.690 
got the coin star and probably the mini
game<00:04:29.990> yeah<00:04:30.350> she<00:04:30.830> got<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.100> mini<00:04:31.250> game<00:04:31.400> start

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
game yeah she got the mini game start

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.920 
game yeah she got the mini game start
with<00:04:31.880> Daisy<00:04:32.590> obviously<00:04:33.590> one<00:04:34.480> point<00:04:35.480> star<00:04:35.750> goes

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
with Daisy obviously one point star goes

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.030 
with Daisy obviously one point star goes
to<00:04:35.960> Daisy

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.650 

happening<00:04:41.040> space<00:04:41.310> goes<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.760> page<00:04:44.270> so<00:04:45.270> guess

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
happening space goes to page so guess

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.270 
happening space goes to page so guess
what<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:45.960> means<00:04:46.020> I<00:04:46.530> got<00:04:46.950> dead<00:04:47.340> last<00:04:47.640> again

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
what that means I got dead last again

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.160 
what that means I got dead last again
this<00:04:50.460> is<00:04:50.580> like<00:04:50.760> every<00:04:51.120> other<00:04:51.240> board<00:04:51.630> maybe<00:04:51.960> the

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
this is like every other board maybe the

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.840 
this is like every other board maybe the

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
board and the terrible of this board so

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.090 
board and the terrible of this board so
whatever<00:05:04.070> and<00:05:06.230> peach<00:05:07.230> didn't<00:05:07.560> keep<00:05:07.710> up<00:05:07.950> the

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
whatever and peach didn't keep up the

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.130

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
tradition of getting at least third

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.790 
tradition of getting at least third
since<00:05:10.650> I<00:05:10.800> got<00:05:11.010> four<00:05:11.900> therefore<00:05:12.900> we<00:05:13.500> will<00:05:13.620> not

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
since I got four therefore we will not

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.880 
since I got four therefore we will not
be<00:05:13.980> seeing<00:05:14.250> her<00:05:14.490> than<00:05:14.730> X<00:05:14.880> board<00:05:15.260> nor<00:05:16.260> will<00:05:16.680> we
