 in the minor that says 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:23.820
 it seemed like a normal day two brothers a 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:27.710
 destination a mother and a dad seven years 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.190

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.030

 And what is the choir began to be 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.950
 gave in 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.520
 in my little soul
