00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.220 
there and magnet there
so<00:04:35.340> then<00:04:35.460> when<00:04:35.670> the<00:04:35.850> door<00:04:36.000> shuts<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.780> catches

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
so then when the door shuts it catches

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.490 
so then when the door shuts it catches
on<00:04:37.380> same<00:04:38.280> with<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.550> front<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:39.900> stock<00:04:40.170> strap

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
on same with the front the stock strap

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.800 
on same with the front the stock strap
so<00:04:41.160> it's<00:04:41.490> got<00:04:41.640> a<00:04:41.670> pretty<00:04:42.030> funky<00:04:42.330> steering

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
so it's got a pretty funky steering

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.230 
so it's got a pretty funky steering
mechanism<00:04:43.400> on<00:04:44.400> there<00:04:44.640> and<00:04:44.790> I<00:04:44.850> didn't<00:04:45.060> want<00:04:45.210> it

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
mechanism on there and I didn't want it

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.000 
mechanism on there and I didn't want it
to<00:04:45.420> make<00:04:45.960> something<00:04:46.230> that<00:04:46.440> was<00:04:46.500> already<00:04:46.740> there

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
to make something that was already there

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:56.660 
to make something that was already there
that<00:04:47.250> works<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.330> that's<00:04:52.880> okay<00:04:55.340> what<00:04:56.340> actually

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
that works and that's okay what actually

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.390 
that works and that's okay what actually
opens<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.270> doors<00:04:57.510> is<00:04:58.080> just<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.920> stranded

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
opens the doors is just the stranded

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.340 
opens the doors is just the stranded
selfie<00:04:59.820> it<00:05:00.270> lifts<00:05:00.540> up<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:00.810> it<00:05:00.930> pushes<00:05:01.110> on<00:05:01.230> the

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
selfie it lifts up and it pushes on the

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.800 
selfie it lifts up and it pushes on the
door<00:05:01.500> and<00:05:01.620> opens<00:05:01.860> it<00:05:01.920> and<00:05:02.400> when<00:05:02.640> it<00:05:02.850> shuts<00:05:03.240> and

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
door and opens it and when it shuts and

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.140 
door and opens it and when it shuts and
if<00:05:03.900> you<00:05:04.020> can<00:05:04.170> see<00:05:04.380> it<00:05:04.530> there<00:05:04.710> there's<00:05:05.640> a<00:05:05.850> little

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
if you can see it there there's a little

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.540 
if you can see it there there's a little
string<00:05:06.630> so<00:05:07.050> when<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:07.740> when<00:05:08.010> the<00:05:08.100> strap<00:05:08.310> comes

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
string so when it when the strap comes

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.730 
string so when it when the strap comes
down<00:05:08.730> it<00:05:09.120> pushes<00:05:09.360> on<00:05:09.630> that<00:05:09.780> string<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.260> it

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
down it pushes on that string and it

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.140 
down it pushes on that string and it
pulls<00:05:10.980> the<00:05:11.190> door<00:05:11.370> shut

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
pulls the door shut

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.660 
pulls the door shut
same<00:05:12.360> on<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.630> front
