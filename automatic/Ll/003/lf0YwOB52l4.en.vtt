00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
majority of the time it it is a bad risk

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.630 
majority of the time it it is a bad risk
though<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.050> bad<00:00:58.260> choice<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.640> there's

teens<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.220> list<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:36.560> via<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:38.009> map<00:01:38.310> if

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
teens in that list so via this map if

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.630 
teens in that list so via this map if
you<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.420> easy<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:40.049> control<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.650> map<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.369> you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
you is easy to control this map as you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.120 
you is easy to control this map as you
seen<00:01:42.150> previously<00:01:42.780> i<00:01:42.840> throw<00:01:43.200> my<00:01:43.229> motion<00:01:43.740> sensor

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
seen previously i throw my motion sensor

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.539 
seen previously i throw my motion sensor
in<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.430> middle<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> map<00:01:45.509> because<00:01:46.549> that's

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
in the middle of the map because that's

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.740 
in the middle of the map because that's
where<00:01:47.759> they<00:01:47.850> spawn<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.270> majority<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
where they spawn the majority of the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.660 
where they spawn the majority of the
time<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.409> control<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:50.520> least

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
time if you can control like at least

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.230 
time if you can control like at least
one<00:01:51.000> end<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.420> map<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:52.860> easily<00:01:53.240> high

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
one end of the map you can easily high

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.230 
one end of the map you can easily high
chance<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.720> them<00:01:54.840> spawning<00:01:55.170> underneath<00:01:55.649> and

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
chance of them spawning underneath and

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.750 
well honestly I'd rather see you all
brand<00:03:46.530> new<00:03:46.650> maps<00:03:46.829> but<00:03:46.950> if<00:03:47.070> they're<00:03:47.220> going<00:03:47.489> to

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
brand new maps but if they're going to

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.610 
brand new maps but if they're going to
bring<00:03:47.910> max<00:03:48.630> back<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:49.049> would<00:03:49.109> have<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.500> have

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
bring max back it would have to have

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.289 
bring max back it would have to have
been<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.829> cod4<00:03:50.040> map<00:03:50.430> because<00:03:50.670> those<00:03:50.850> maps<00:03:51.090> were

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
been a cod4 map because those maps were

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.170 
been a cod4 map because those maps were
just<00:03:51.620> amazing<00:03:52.620> like<00:03:52.859> compared<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.609> mw2<00:03:53.760> and

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
just amazing like compared to mw2 and

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.120 
just amazing like compared to mw2 and
MDA<00:03:54.510> maps<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.140> you've<00:03:55.260> got<00:03:55.410> nothing<00:03:55.560> on<00:03:55.859> cod4

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
MDA maps that you've got nothing on cod4

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.430 
MDA maps that you've got nothing on cod4
maps<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.730> just<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.570> layout<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.230> whole

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
maps the just the layout and the whole

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.410 
maps the just the layout and the whole
feel<00:03:58.829> of<00:03:58.859> them<00:03:59.250> from<00:03:59.519> like<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.820> campaign<00:04:00.239> and

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
feel of them from like the campaign and

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.810 
feel of them from like the campaign and
that<00:04:00.510> was<00:04:00.660> just<00:04:00.780> amazing<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:01.709> it's<00:04:02.609> shame

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
that was just amazing and it's shame

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.120 
that was just amazing and it's shame
that<00:04:02.940> they're<00:04:03.120> not<00:04:03.239> green<00:04:03.450> back<00:04:03.690> but<00:04:04.130> it's

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
that they're not green back but it's

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.759 
that they're not green back but it's
good<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.489> they're<00:04:05.640> bringing<00:04:05.970> back<00:04:06.000> a

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
good that they're bringing back a

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.500 
good that they're bringing back a
terminal<00:04:07.769> I<00:04:07.799> guess<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:10.010> this<00:04:11.010> matches<00:04:11.220> over<00:04:11.510> 30

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
terminal I guess so this matches over 30

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.420 
terminal I guess so this matches over 30
