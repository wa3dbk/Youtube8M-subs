way to help myself make it a lot easier
of<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.620> process<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:51.410> when<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.440> first<00:00:52.800> put<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:52.980> my

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
of a process so when I first put on my

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.010 
of a process so when I first put on my
corset<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.789> went<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.059> bed<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> first<00:00:54.570> time

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
corset it went to bed for the first time

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.619 
corset it went to bed for the first time
I<00:00:55.260> was<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:55.980> Oh<00:00:56.190> can't<00:00:56.879> breathe<00:00:57.149> can't

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
I was just like Oh can't breathe can't

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.709 
I was just like Oh can't breathe can't
breathe<00:00:57.899> huh<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.180> where<00:01:00.329> your<00:01:00.510> first

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
breathe huh so this is where your first

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.450 
breathe huh so this is where your first
trick<00:01:01.079> comes<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.800> probably<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.340> most

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
trick comes in and probably the most

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.100 
trick comes in and probably the most
important<00:01:03.000> trick<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.629> need<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.960> know

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
important trick that you need to know

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.230 
important trick that you need to know
while<00:01:04.619> sleeping<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.220> corset<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.820> that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
while sleeping in your corset and that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.570 
while sleeping in your corset and that
is<00:01:06.420> wearing<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.990> about<00:01:07.229> two<00:01:07.470> inches<00:01:07.830> looser

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
is wearing it about two inches looser

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.250 
is wearing it about two inches looser
than<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.850> normally<00:01:09.000> would<00:01:09.299> while<00:01:09.840> being<00:01:10.049> up

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
than you normally would while being up

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.780 
than you normally would while being up
in<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.740> moving<00:01:11.070> around<00:01:11.159> during<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.580> day

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
in it and moving around during the day

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.840 
in it and moving around during the day
and<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.750> reason<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.590> because<00:01:13.890> when

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and the reason for that is because when

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.840 
and the reason for that is because when
you<00:01:14.939> go<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.060> sleep<00:01:15.619> your<00:01:16.619> abdomen<00:01:17.310> your

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
you go to sleep your abdomen your

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.570 
you go to sleep your abdomen your
muscles<00:01:18.240> your<00:01:18.810> organs<00:01:19.259> everything<00:01:19.680> relaxes

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
muscles your organs everything relaxes

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.090 
muscles your organs everything relaxes
so<00:01:20.790> you're<00:01:21.180> actually<00:01:21.689> going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.140> expanding

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
so you're actually going to be expanding

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.429 
so you're actually going to be expanding
all<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.759> lot<00:01:24.000> more<00:01:24.240> than<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.659> are<00:01:24.930> when

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
all that a lot more than you are when

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.380 
all that a lot more than you are when
you're<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.100> moving<00:01:26.430> around<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.090> awake

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
you're up and moving around and awake

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.640 
you're up and moving around and awake
and<00:01:27.420> aware<00:01:27.720> um<00:01:28.939> so<00:01:29.939> when<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.659> actually<00:01:30.960> relax

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and aware um so when you actually relax

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.850 
and aware um so when you actually relax
and<00:01:32.509> two<00:01:33.509> inches<00:01:33.869> makes<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.320> huge<00:01:34.799> difference

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
and two inches makes a huge difference

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.730 
and two inches makes a huge difference
because<00:01:35.460> when<00:01:36.299> you're<00:01:36.420> relaxing<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.350> mean

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
because when you're relaxing I mean

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.679 
because when you're relaxing I mean
that's<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> feel<00:01:39.119> very<00:01:39.450> claustrophobic

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
that's going to feel very claustrophobic

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.140 
that's going to feel very claustrophobic
which<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.619> did<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.009> me<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.430> lot<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.970> said

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
which it did to me and a lot like I said

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.230 
which it did to me and a lot like I said
a<00:01:42.180> lot<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.360> people<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.899> experience<00:01:42.960> um

those<00:03:31.450> reasons<00:03:31.930> are<00:03:32.230> if<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.860> are<00:03:33.130> very

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
those reasons are if you are very

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.430 
those reasons are if you are very
athletic<00:03:33.670> person<00:03:34.510> that<00:03:34.660> does<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.810> lot<00:03:35.020> of<00:03:35.170> ab

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
athletic person that does a lot of ab

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.830 
athletic person that does a lot of ab
exercises<00:03:36.100> you're<00:03:36.970> especially<00:03:37.570> going<00:03:37.750> to

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
exercises you're especially going to

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.510 
exercises you're especially going to
benefit<00:03:38.320> from<00:03:38.380> wearing<00:03:38.980> these<00:03:39.160> at<00:03:39.490> night

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
benefit from wearing these at night

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.390 
benefit from wearing these at night
because<00:03:40.150> we<00:03:41.020> do<00:03:41.200> most<00:03:41.410> of<00:03:41.500> our<00:03:41.620> repairing<00:03:42.280> of

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
because we do most of our repairing of

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.550 
because we do most of our repairing of
our<00:03:42.520> body<00:03:42.820> during<00:03:43.630> our<00:03:43.780> REM<00:03:44.050> sleep<00:03:44.410> um<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:46.750> any

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
our body during our REM sleep um so any

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.790 
our body during our REM sleep um so any
torn<00:03:48.100> muscles<00:03:48.610> or<00:03:49.410> anything<00:03:50.410> that<00:03:50.680> you've

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
torn muscles or anything that you've

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.790 
torn muscles or anything that you've
been<00:03:50.980> working<00:03:51.430> out<00:03:51.640> or<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:52.840> you've<00:03:53.230> injured

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
been working out or that you've injured

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.979 
been working out or that you've injured
like<00:03:54.370> I<00:03:54.550> said<00:03:54.760> as<00:03:54.910> most<00:03:55.120> of<00:03:55.300> its<00:03:55.420> repairing

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
like I said as most of its repairing

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.840 
like I said as most of its repairing
during<00:03:56.290> this<00:03:56.410> time<00:03:56.709> while<00:03:56.980> we<00:03:57.100> actually<00:03:57.280> are

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
during this time while we actually are

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.390 
during this time while we actually are
in<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.989> really<00:03:59.920> deep<00:04:00.730> level<00:04:01.060> of<00:04:01.390> sleep<00:04:01.920> so<00:04:02.920> if

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
in a really deep level of sleep so if

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.750 
in a really deep level of sleep so if
you<00:04:04.390> especially<00:04:05.080> do<00:04:05.739> like<00:04:06.130> I<00:04:06.280> said<00:04:06.340> ab

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
you especially do like I said ab

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.120 
you especially do like I said ab
exercises<00:04:07.450> where<00:04:07.840> your<00:04:07.959> body<00:04:08.200> is<00:04:08.380> needing<00:04:08.830> to

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
exercises where your body is needing to

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.310 
exercises where your body is needing to
repair<00:04:09.580> your<00:04:09.760> muscles<00:04:10.209> when<00:04:10.570> you<00:04:10.750> sleep<00:04:11.050> a

repair your muscles when you sleep a
corset<00:04:11.980> is<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.190> perfect<00:04:12.610> time<00:04:12.850> to<00:04:12.880> kind<00:04:13.270> of

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
corset is the perfect time to kind of

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.270 
corset is the perfect time to kind of
hold<00:04:13.570> yourself<00:04:14.020> in<00:04:14.170> place<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.950> let<00:04:15.040> your<00:04:15.130> body

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
hold yourself in place and let your body

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.210 
hold yourself in place and let your body
repair<00:04:15.880> into<00:04:16.390> that<00:04:16.570> hourglass<00:04:17.230> shape<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:18.100> is

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
repair into that hourglass shape that is

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.280 
repair into that hourglass shape that is
one<00:04:18.520> advantage<00:04:18.760> that<00:04:19.630> sleeping<00:04:20.169> in<00:04:20.260> your

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
one advantage that sleeping in your

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.350 
one advantage that sleeping in your
corset<00:04:20.830> gives<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:21.310> as<00:04:21.520> opposed<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.030> wearing

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
corset gives you as opposed to wearing

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.260 
corset gives you as opposed to wearing
it<00:04:22.510> during<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.870> day<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.340> can't<00:04:24.340> say<00:04:24.580> for<00:04:25.210> sure

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
it during the day I can't say for sure

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
it during the day I can't say for sure
how<00:04:25.660> much<00:04:25.960> of

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
how much of

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.990 
how much of
of<00:04:26.410> an<00:04:26.620> advantage<00:04:26.980> that<00:04:27.340> gives<00:04:27.550> you<00:04:27.790> because

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
of an advantage that gives you because

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.180 
of an advantage that gives you because
obviously<00:04:28.870> everyone's<00:04:29.260> different<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:29.770> if<00:04:30.100> I

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
obviously everyone's different so if I

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.280 
obviously everyone's different so if I
had<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.400> test<00:04:30.670> subject<00:04:30.850> on<00:04:31.210> this<00:04:31.390> person<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:31.990> a

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
had a test subject on this person and a

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.920 
had a test subject on this person and a
test<00:04:32.500> subject<00:04:32.710> on<00:04:33.130> this<00:04:33.460> person<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.210> one<00:04:34.690> war

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
test subject on this person and one war

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.420 
test subject on this person and one war
then<00:04:35.110> while<00:04:35.320> they<00:04:35.440> are<00:04:35.500> awake<00:04:35.740> in<00:04:35.770> one<00:04:36.190> war

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
then while they are awake in one war

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.550 
then while they are awake in one war
then<00:04:36.580> why<00:04:36.730> they<00:04:36.880> were<00:04:36.940> asleep<00:04:37.300> their<00:04:38.200> bodies

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
then why they were asleep their bodies

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.880 
then why they were asleep their bodies
both<00:04:38.710> metabolized<00:04:39.370> differently<00:04:39.540> they<00:04:40.540> both

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
both metabolized differently they both

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.070 
both metabolized differently they both
react<00:04:41.890> differently<00:04:42.490> so<00:04:42.940> I<00:04:43.300> can't<00:04:43.720> say<00:04:44.050> for

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
react differently so I can't say for

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.550 
react differently so I can't say for
sure<00:04:44.380> and<00:04:44.770> exact<00:04:45.160> oh<00:04:45.840> this<00:04:46.840> is<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.020> percentage

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
sure and exact oh this is a percentage

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.140 
sure and exact oh this is a percentage
that<00:04:47.890> it's<00:04:48.100> going<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:48.400> make<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.640> difference<00:04:49.000> why

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
that it's going to make a difference why

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.270 
that it's going to make a difference why
you<00:04:49.210> sleep<00:04:49.630> it's<00:04:49.900> not<00:04:50.140> necessarily<00:04:50.830> like<00:04:51.010> that

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
you sleep it's not necessarily like that

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.060 
you sleep it's not necessarily like that
but<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.150> do<00:04:52.210> know<00:04:52.750> for<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.080> fact<00:04:53.140> that<00:04:53.680> since<00:04:53.950> we

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
but I do know for a fact that since we

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.620 
but I do know for a fact that since we
do<00:04:54.280> most<00:04:54.520> of<00:04:54.640> our<00:04:54.760> repair<00:04:55.150> during<00:04:55.480> our

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
do most of our repair during our

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.110 
do most of our repair during our
sleeping<00:04:56.140> and<00:04:56.350> especially<00:04:57.340> if<00:04:57.670> you're<00:04:57.850> a<00:04:57.880> very

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
sleeping and especially if you're a very

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.210 
sleeping and especially if you're a very
athletic<00:04:58.690> person<00:04:58.960> it<00:04:59.410> would<00:04:59.530> be<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.710> great<00:05:00.040> idea

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
athletic person it would be a great idea

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.190 
athletic person it would be a great idea
to<00:05:00.580> actually<00:05:00.700> sleep<00:05:01.180> in<00:05:01.300> your<00:05:01.450> corset<00:05:01.870> or<00:05:02.080> at

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
least do you know a few hours during the

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.630 
least do you know a few hours during the
night<00:05:04.930> while<00:05:05.350> you<00:05:05.470> are<00:05:05.680> doing<00:05:06.070> most<00:05:06.220> of<00:05:06.580> the
