00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:10.899
 outside of Guadalajara 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:12.659
 this past week 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:13.449
 to listen 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.129
 the critic 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.789
 by oscar tarqui jagland 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.150
 this section 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.150
 Thank you 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.169
 cornet 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.779
 it's very dramatic about kiev contrasts because we were left alone when you came 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.270
 to challenge you t 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.660
 Well, your colleagues are very advanced 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.350
 useless this disadvantage that is all the dynamics that have been generated and the advance 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.150
 to be happy the teachers 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.510
 but I think in this case it's the song and the circumstances the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.850
 real removal 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.530
 what is determining that there is a very big difference between your 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.250
 interpretations 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.820
 she was handcuffed you project stressful mood 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.180
 you can not get to the situation in which Julian 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.100
 this song dressed in a suit made to measure then I see very strong 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.920
 Perez described as false but I think that people know how completita 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.510
 this side 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.140
 Julia for me 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.140
 there has not been any surprise with you 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.520
 it's exasperating because you've gotten tight 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.200
 here the difference 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.280
 between the two this the voice of julia you hear healthy 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.210
 that can continue to hold the songs that you put 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.750
 because you listen 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.300
 a good placement 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.750
 in 2007 you hear affected 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.150
 I do not know if really if you physically have a tenesaca disease some 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.940
 problem yes yes since the girl this one is listened to very affected arrived the moment 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.570
 in which 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.460
 you heard too much Christ 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.900
 too 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.010
 and then one started busti maple 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.890
 because it was what is doing is it is 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.880
 I felt that you are doing it up to the vocal cords fish 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.880
 we are starting in the min 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.349
 and I am me 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.970
 what is not understood without me jp 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.859
 good to listen to happen 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.259
 I do not know if it was something like that with a speech therapist 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:20.119
 In particular 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.429
 I used to like your hoarse voice, I remember it 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:25.409
 but what I heard tonight 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.539
 it was not that year 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:29.639
 I really invite you 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.609
 here it continues is with some singing classes but before 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.439
 with johnny back 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:36.649
 from the heart 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:39.939
 because it's worrying that's the only difference and julia 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.599
 because physically 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.599
 he moved much better than you that's a shame 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:48.679
 it is a shame 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:53.029
 that you do not know how to move on stage when you arrive here all this time 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:53.999
 okey 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.999
 the only difference that I find is local 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:58.779
 after 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:00.009
 giles 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.009
 arturo lopez gavito 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:05.909
 to me in particular 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.500
 It impresses me so much 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.259
 what we have already reached 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:11.180
 this is 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.090
 it's a scandal it's a scary thing all we're seeing is from 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.479
 shame 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:17.690
 is true love i 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.299
 Haiti 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.680
 falconí you also had your flight united nothing to offer this the flight 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.680
 came from the academy 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.659
 when the same line of songs is once again given to the student 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.189
 that he has been given again 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.879
 7 concerts in a row 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.979
 when he talks to the student again 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:43.329
 that does not understand that this tide of mulalillo that is already accumulated in 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.359
 and again sing the same 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.699
 and I'm going to sing it just as badly 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.949
 and go back to singing without offering anything to this audience again that is 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.249
 tired and sixth boring julia obviously 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.539
 plus 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.649
 I do not know why this service gives you 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:04.409
 I do not get it 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.579
 when 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.140
 a show toro rosso 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.559
 what I just read 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.229
 mud 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:16.109
 I hope the mister is so funny 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.559
 cecilia artes liver 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:20.719
 well it has been generating causing people 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.550
 aliverti inside the can 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.719
 because today 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:25.710
 out there 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.779
 people say 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:29.259
 the one of the sr 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.279
 Julie is not the singer who has to prove 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.559
 that's what he can do 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.729
 master this teacher beto says that it is not true 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.490
 our challenge 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.779
 I caught you ask a big favor by failing 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:47.779
 with the respect that I do not have of all these years 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.610
 prepare this student 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.279
 why straighten 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:55.000
 and do not be the controversy and the gossip 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.110
 what a student of the academy will eat 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.280
 doing whatever comes up they prop up like kayak that after eight concerts what 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.270
 I repeat it still does not arise 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.550
 and yes the question here is that millet gave him not enter 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.069
 for my millet cugat that voice 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:12.400
 because so far 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.400
 it needed 19 very ugly civilians 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.439
 but before he is required 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:23.939
 we begin to continue everything 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:26.009
 what do you decide 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.009
 stays there is already within the generation of 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:36.889
 I have nothing to prove miller has nothing to do and what not 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.189
 more details 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:45.509
 zoido says that the attention given to the world completely July we do not die 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.400
 I want to make sense 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.400
 in containing spending 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.800
 the one of maría criminal cell 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.699
 it does not mean that if you have to get off that brick put your feet 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.159
 on the street to land 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.800
 start with unit 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.199
 From the beginning 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.599
 because you do not go well 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.539
 do not feel 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.249
 your voice is not going to hold 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:19.699
 what they have been doing all these weeks 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:20.900
 I do not think so 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.900
 Argentina 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.309
 there is the final decision 

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:30.739
 he has not avoided in the academy 5
