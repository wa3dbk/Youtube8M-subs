00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.530 
Leslie history we've got gas pedal down
there<00:02:23.040> looks<00:02:23.220> like<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.370> volume<00:02:23.670> pedal<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:24.390> it's

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
there looks like a volume pedal but it's

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.660 
there looks like a volume pedal but it's
not<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> volume<00:02:25.050> pedal<00:02:25.080> what<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.069> does<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.490> gives

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
not a volume pedal what it does it gives

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.930 
not a volume pedal what it does it gives
infinite<00:02:27.270> speed<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.860> infinite<00:02:29.790> speed

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
infinite speed to the infinite speed

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.300 
infinite speed to the infinite speed
control<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> Leslie<00:02:30.750> while<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.650> pedals

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
control to the Leslie while the pedals

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.170 
control to the Leslie while the pedals
all<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.580> way<00:02:32.670> back

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
all the way back

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.570 
all the way back
it<00:02:33.690> sounds<00:02:34.110> slow<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.770> further<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.250> depress

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
it sounds slow the further you depress

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.120 
it sounds slow the further you depress
the<00:02:35.760> pedal<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.780> faster<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.350> Leslie<00:02:37.680> goes<00:02:37.860> and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
the pedal the faster the Leslie goes and

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.490 
the pedal the faster the Leslie goes and
you<00:02:38.220> can<00:02:38.370> stop<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:39.030> at<00:02:39.180> any<00:02:39.330> point<00:02:39.690> between

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
you can stop it at any point between

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.350 
you can stop it at any point between
slow<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.100> fast<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.520> got<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.640> customer's<00:02:42.120> speed

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
slow and fast and got a customer's speed

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.580 
slow and fast and got a customer's speed
so<00:02:42.900> here<00:02:43.110> we<00:02:43.200> aren't<00:02:43.470> slow<00:02:45.080> I'm<00:02:46.080> gonna<00:02:46.260> advance

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
so here we aren't slow I'm gonna advance

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.190 
so here we aren't slow I'm gonna advance
the<00:02:46.860> pedal<00:02:47.390> about<00:02:48.390> half<00:02:48.630> way<00:02:48.930> now<00:02:51.110> there's<00:02:52.110> a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
the pedal about half way now there's a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.360 
the pedal about half way now there's a
Leslie<00:02:52.680> speed<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.880> is<00:02:54.209> not<00:02:54.570> common<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.370> little

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
Leslie speed that is not common a little

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.670 
Leslie speed that is not common a little
bit<00:02:56.489> a<00:02:56.670> little<00:02:56.760> bit<00:02:57.000> faster<00:02:57.450> than<00:02:57.630> slow<00:02:58.380> but

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
bit a little bit faster than slow but

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.810 
bit a little bit faster than slow but
slower<00:02:58.950> than<00:02:59.190> fast<00:03:00.200> make<00:03:01.200> sense<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:05.580> all<00:03:05.700> the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
slower than fast make sense and all the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.710 
slower than fast make sense and all the
way<00:03:05.910> down<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.959> classic<00:03:07.380> Leslie<00:03:11.540> I'm<00:03:12.540> gonna

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
way down is the classic Leslie I'm gonna

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.460 
way down is the classic Leslie I'm gonna
go<00:03:12.870> back<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.290> strat<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:14.959> switch<00:03:15.959> channels

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
go back to a strat and switch channels

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:25.039 
go back to a strat and switch channels
go<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.830> crunch<00:03:17.100> channel<00:03:23.630> Stevie<00:03:24.630> Ray<00:03:24.810> lick

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
go to the crunch channel Stevie Ray lick

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.810 
go to the crunch channel Stevie Ray lick
that<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.230> can't<00:03:25.560> play<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:28.010> when<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.640> got<00:03:29.790> a

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
that I can't play and when the you got a

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:43.750 
that I can't play and when the you got a
little<00:03:30.060> slow<00:03:30.239> Leslie<00:03:30.630> some<00:03:30.900> real<00:03:31.110> nice<00:03:31.290> crunch

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.009 

you<00:03:44.760> can<00:03:44.909> also<00:03:45.030> use<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:45.450> pedal<00:03:45.750> as<00:03:45.840> an

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
you can also use that pedal as an

you can also use that pedal as an

throughout<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.579> years<00:03:53.790> we're<00:03:54.450> playing<00:03:54.750> and

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
throughout the years we're playing and

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.720

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
we get a particularly high emotional

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.209 
we get a particularly high emotional
part<00:03:56.939> we<00:03:57.060> spin<00:03:57.359> that<00:03:57.510> Leslie<00:03:57.870> fast<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.829> bring

00:03:59.209 --> 00:03:59.219 
part we spin that Leslie fast and bring

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:00.740 
part we spin that Leslie fast and bring
it<00:03:59.340> down<00:03:59.370> well<00:03:59.730> now<00:03:59.849> the<00:03:59.909> guitars<00:04:00.329> can<00:04:00.510> do<00:04:00.629> the

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
it down well now the guitars can do the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.869 
it down well now the guitars can do the
same<00:04:00.959> thing<00:04:01.260> but<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.219> guitars<00:04:02.549> can<00:04:02.760> do

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879

with<00:04:04.319> in<00:04:04.560> keyboard<00:04:04.769> Leslie<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.459> that's

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
with in keyboard Leslie and that's

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.050 
with in keyboard Leslie and that's

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
say in a studio you can put anything

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.430 
say in a studio you can put anything
through<00:05:41.220> it<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:41.550> quarter<00:05:41.940> inch<00:05:42.120> in<00:05:42.419> with<00:05:43.229> them

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
through it and quarter inch in with them

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.390 
through it and quarter inch in with them
with

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
with

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.850 
with
just<00:05:45.639> foot<00:05:45.850> to<00:05:46.030> regular<00:05:46.930> footswitch<00:05:47.320> so<00:05:47.800> you

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
just foot to regular footswitch so you

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.719 
just foot to regular footswitch so you
don't<00:05:48.070> need<00:05:48.190> that<00:05:48.340> big<00:05:48.610> bulky<00:05:50.520> preamp<00:05:51.520> box

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
don't need that big bulky preamp box

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:53.909

with<00:05:51.970> the<00:05:52.090> big<00:05:52.270> cord<00:05:52.570> that<00:05:52.720> always<00:05:53.050> fails<00:05:53.320> yeah

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
with the big cord that always fails yeah

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.950 
with the big cord that always fails yeah
so<00:05:54.490> so<00:05:54.910> the<00:05:55.030> only<00:05:55.120> downside<00:05:55.600> is<00:05:55.810> that<00:05:55.840> you

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
so so the only downside is that you

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.689 
so so the only downside is that you
