the most I think it's brought it down to
that<00:00:53.430> 274<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:56.090> if<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.420> recall<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.809> think

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
that 274 and if I can recall I think

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.380 
that 274 and if I can recall I think
that's<00:00:58.320> right<00:00:58.590> anyway<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.340> was<00:00:59.489> rushing<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.149> but

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390
