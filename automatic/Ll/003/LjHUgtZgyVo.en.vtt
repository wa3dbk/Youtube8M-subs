it again dude what's it because you can
well<00:00:54.530> it's<00:00:54.860> nothing<00:00:55.039> together<00:00:55.340> this<00:00:55.640> just<00:00:56.450> my

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
well it's nothing together this just my

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.139

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.170 
I think maybe because that you learn a
song<00:01:01.910> to<00:01:02.780> 10<00:01:03.079> the<00:01:03.469> tornadoes<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.189> warp<00:01:04.489> you<00:01:05.000> can
