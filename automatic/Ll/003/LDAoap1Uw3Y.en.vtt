00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.700
 it is not much of a hit 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:19.210
 place to an end men cry 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:21.480
 but after that for me November 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.480
 December 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.630
 so we can not attach a duck 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.800
 give him an hour 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:45.640
 it's a duck it's not like a goose 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:47.949
 or will be missing in this setting a duck 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.980
 be aware that if we did not put a will 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:58.960
 at every corner of the duck park the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:01:00.370
 go out and go home he gets 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:07.420
 fout it comes outside that does not have 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:09.610
 necessarily need shelter know that 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.720
 before sending any animals 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.210
 for any animal at the slaughterhouse 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.550
 we will attack him on a cow yvonne 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.850
 pig anything we will address them 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:25.360
 only thing that the duck can not 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.190
 to do everything on his own he got fat 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.289
 all the time manage are also his 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.580
 food 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.470
 we can give him very big 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.369
 quantities to change the duck do not 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.700
 will not address himself against 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.530
 fox noises to migratory 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.259
 it will go to him naturally to 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.329
 to be able to cross the seas and continents 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.270
 he has no use of 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.640
 grease what's wrong with you 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.380
 ten escaped 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.759
 so he'll just handle everything to his 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.170
 food 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.540
 so there the force-feeding what is it 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.970
 that he complained we will handle 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.729
 the feeding the ghost will be 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:08.220
 always at will but what is 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.220
 will feed him but on corn 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.350
 so for the duck to address more 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.040
 quickly and to reduce losses in 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.400
 the excrement 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.840
 we will just fill the grain of 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.680
 corn or dive it into hot water 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.420
 hours will allow ducks to export 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.360
 the maximum energy contained in the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.700
 seed we find to their part pulled into 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.070
 the excrement so the period of force-feeding 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.690
 team period quite short 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.960
 it will last 14 days here on 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.880
 operations 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.040
 so the first week is a phase 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.780
 pre gavage we will go so we will 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.100
 give small amounts to be able to 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.690
 grow his qualities to give them 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:55.450
 almost a third of their weight at 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:58.420
 last week then this 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.870
 it is beautiful it is state that is 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.700
 that in the team very firmly 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:10.900
 I have then I blow why spring 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:13.540
 the time that it takes about to 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.680
 doctors treat well if I am you 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.680
 only a shed is everywhere 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:32.780
 either we will fill the pocket they 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.990
 fell down is called the crop well if I 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.990
 am 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.750
 m 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.210
 so we are told how is the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.950
 blow a little bit of attention as the clock if 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.610
 simply to pack the maximum of 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.610
 corn will not see 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.700
 here you can all that corn 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.970
 so we will always be able to stay with 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.260
 whole grain corn to leave to 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.889
 ducks all these functions of 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:29.030
 digestion our industrialists accelerates the 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.139
 process orders him flour 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.350
 they went there were the duck two days 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.350
 less
