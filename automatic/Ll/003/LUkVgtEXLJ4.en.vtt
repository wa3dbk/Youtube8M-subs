00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.770
 It was one of the agreements adopted 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.720
 this was happening 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.720
 city ​​quesada 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:19.890
 hello welcome to a car toread legorreta tutorial my name of joseph 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.279
 maria arrate goals 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.369
 and I'm going to make a sketch to be able to take it in our but before 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.199
 I will teach a couple of important aspects for those who start 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.359
 in the divo 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.470
 primary objects to start drawing 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.430
 as in the 3d we will have an eclipse a capsule a cube 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.670
 and a pyramid could 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.370
 this will guide us when we start our drawing 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.220
 the circle will serve us for the ways of the head shoulders knees and frames 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.070
 the capsule is not forgotten 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.550
 for what will be the arms legs and feet 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.590
 the cube with a rectangle 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.640
 will be good for the trunk 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.120
 and the angle ponzi pyramid will be good for the pelvis 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.130
 These forms for the roads may vary since their name indicates they are 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.290
 days and as such we can reform them depending on the position 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.050
 of the character 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.830
 and adapt them in a practical way to facilitate our drawing 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.980
 Basic proportions for drawing 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.450
 this would be in case of deficit of a realistic drawing 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.920
 Here I show you two examples of proportions 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.060
 first the distance from the apparent to the chin will be equal to one 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.500
 open hand 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.120
 and secondly the length of a leg will be equal to that of an arm that 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.520
 will allow us to have an adequate proportion in a realistic drawing given that 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.100
 a caricature the head ends of cetera 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.250
 will vary depending on the physical aspects 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.250
 of the person or a drawing that we have invented 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.420
 and before starting with the video of the sketch that I made 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.969
 I will explain next 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.360
 I wanted to comment here 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.159
 I have a channel on youtube 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.619
 that is called joseph graphic 1 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.619
 and now we will start with the exploitation of lithium 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.729
 to start as you see the left of the video 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:25.269
 It has left us some images with the materials with which I made night 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.309
 how will it be 2 h 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.719
 with which we will make the tracks 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.049
 for the drawing 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.769
 then we will use pel 6b which would be a softer charcoal 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.039
 and with which we could define 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:43.599
 in what would be the all day 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.739
 and finally 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.379
 a black marker 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.590
 it would not matter 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.899
 the model as long as it's a 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.969
 a black fine-tip pen to be able 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:55.489
 of determinant 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.489
 of equipment brand 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:01.219
 now that Carlos what will be 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.939
 the way how to start a drawing 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.759
 I always begin by defining the path of the head 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.899
 and I continue doing as they do the port roads 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:15.839
 the ways n as you see have changed a little the original way circulated the 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:17.249
 capsule lock 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:21.119
 that's because with time each one looks for a way to define the ways 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.529
 and the debate in Angola with the desired for the position that camps 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.359
 the next thing that is to explain scene the tortilla inside the circle of the 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:32.399
 head 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:37.139
 those days depending on the position in which we put them to play was the 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.139
 perspective of the face before the yes 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.649
 where the tracks cross 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:43.979
 Of the face 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:47.449
 by logic they will analyze our character 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.840
 above the eyes that the vertical line 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.340
 we will be left in the middle unless they are our character 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.549
 following the pica 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.409
 in define what will be the character's mouth 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.079
 and finally in the horizontal guide 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.179
 in the end 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.429
 ecolo we want the works 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:12.900
 and finally the goal the drawing 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.070
 It will depend on our imagination and our drawing style 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:22.229
 and good let us finish watching the video and decided that soon 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.229
 will come a destabilization tutorial 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.080
 with those bodies adobe illustrator 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.639
 about this sketch 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.919
 and what will be of great use to many - they are superfluous 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:38.189
 and good, he waited for us 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:43.269
 insalud for everyone and until next time
