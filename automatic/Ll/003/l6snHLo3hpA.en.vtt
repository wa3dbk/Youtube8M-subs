00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.469
 So hello to all of you so welcome the presentation of the packaging 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.179
 fully customizable 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.619
 already started this video by a first shot of mouth 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.179
 percent against the giants who buys objects and for those who put 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.089
 negative evaluations 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.169
 so obviously 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.889
 when you buy something that can happen if you break but that's 

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:35.210
 not the right model to try it's not the right format the first thing to do 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.960
 is obviously to contact the seller quite stupidly 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.100
 it sounds silly but there are some who are part of it 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.830
 which directly sticks to negative evolutions 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.780
 e so keeping head of the broken object or objects that will not go so what I 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.380
 find it completely stupid 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.970
 so when you have a problem with an object that she knows so that 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.580
 a strong mandate mahon and design to you contact us me I'm here for you 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.200
 listen I'm here seven days a week 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.240
 % and so wanted to contact Chinese direct when you have a concern so 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.180
 Or you send me the object if you do not like it I'll refund you 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.140
 for otherwise I wanted to change against against that we are the same thing is a 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.900
 other designer our format or another object 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.340
 % but especially contact me when you have a problem it's no use of 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.960
 do not say anything and put a negative assessment that makes it progress 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.580
 the schmilblick 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.580
 So here's that little joke we have before the presentation 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.120
 so now for his attacks by the junta 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.409
 but otherwise inspired 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.499
 pretty modern do not expect something with a light mechanism and 

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:34.410
 other stuff 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.450
 for fernand floor area it was a plastic stand 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.800
 you can actually slide any dial inside 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.820
 but if his mom rafael advantage in mind is that when you buy a 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.780
 momentum lodges any 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.120
 percent and after a while if you want the lowest instincts 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.140
 you put it% 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.270
 either the trash can or in the attic where she or elsewhere 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.240
 % which is not the case with mine if you ever want to 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.670
 do not like photos anymore and well you 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.780
 at the sound of the dials you created another one and you leave them in this 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.780
 a godsend of which some glitches lasted for years and years 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.879
 you can already customize it in euro as many times as you want it is 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.399
 what it is 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.849
 for editing valiant nothing more simple in fact my service and the 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.849
 mechanism in the hole left the crusts 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.289
 but until then nothing complicated 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:32.339
 there are people who can not do it 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.989
 then in net on al air 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.239
 designer pÃ©guy 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.109
 the points of the minutes 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.099
 and the needles 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.720
 second one either we pay attention when we do not manipulate when we debate and 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.930
 already to guide them when we manipulate them because they are enough 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.349
 fragile 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.689
 e stone took place 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.870
 to his sons but well once finished up and it turns in a year and a half 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:55.499
 touch 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:57.409
 it works 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.339
 so to cathy afp 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:03.879
 while a second huge benefit for seven years when people over being 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.319
 fully customizable 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.319
 for 100 th sites does not tick ticks ticks 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:14.229
 so go completely silent so you can go it's easily in 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:17.229
 a room all night you will not hear it but absolutely not 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.059
 that's it for the concept presentation in their age so that frame years that 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.489
 you can change at will you can reprint others at home 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.870
 silent mechanism and so I come back to my hangover in case of 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.949
 problem we contacted it's all stupid 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.949
 % and so if you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me too 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.059
 So here I am I thought I went around for this clock no 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:42.329
 edible at the cost of your attention
