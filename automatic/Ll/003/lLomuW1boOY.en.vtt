00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.219
 at least no smoked salmon we 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.270
 need potatoes cream fraiche mine 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.129
 here is with herbs we can 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.110
 We also need quite normal 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.550
 fresh vegetable stock and process 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.230
 you have the potato and peel it 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.320
 then climb into small 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.520
 cube 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.920
 then we take the zucchini 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.379
 whoever wants to hang can do this me 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.870
 read the bowl and get on it 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.770
 diced 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.960
 Now it's going to be a quarter of a liter 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.420
 vegetable stock prepared on the crisis 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.010
 is usually a heaped teaspoon on 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.960
 250 milliliters of water 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.299
 I have something for my brothers, though 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.100
 made stronger and we go in there 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.920
 now the diced potatoes and 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.030
 as well as the mincing of the zucchini we 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.610
 Put the pot on a stove top 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.350
 bring the content to a boil and cologne 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.259
 has everything until the potatoes white 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.750
 So as to take about ten minutes after 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.250
 We take the pot from the stove and touch everything 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.470
 and I have a new blender 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.110
 and made the going ruckzuck 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.420
 touching how much here was that could 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.650
 of course decide for yourself 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.540
 Then we give the cup of cream 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.329
 fraiche with of course only the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.520
 content and stir this no and what we do 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.110
 a few bets have to win 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.370
 we taste 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.980
 only season with pepper 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.200
 and also the small cut ones 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.729
 with tips and again 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.729
 Carry out thoroughly 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.420
 Now the dax has to be diced a bit 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.490
 be and really small 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.090
 Cutting is better than bigger pieces 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.619
 allow 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.600
 You can also give it a short time beforehand 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.020
 give into the freezer because then lets 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.490
 he finally cut himself better 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.160
 Let's take the sliced salmon with you 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.990
 add to the soup and leave 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.120
 Now pull it in the soup 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.400
 that does not mean cooking anymore 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.830
 maybe heat something again 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.690
 but no more and then this can 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.000
 delicious soup to be served 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.230
 For me it was a different kind of 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.120
 processing of zucchini 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.040
 I can only really give you the soup 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.540
 I wish you much fun 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.860
 while cooking and then quite good appetite 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.480
 and if you prefer zucchini 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.310
 would like to prepare something else 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.920
 maybe stuffed zucchini in 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.410
 tomato sauce or even a sweet variation 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.780
 for example, as apple zucchini guglhupf 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.030
 then just have a look at them 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.720
 by means of and if not yet 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.489
 done 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.980
 Of course, I am very pleased about one 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.630
 Abo I still have to say until 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.630
 Next time bye
