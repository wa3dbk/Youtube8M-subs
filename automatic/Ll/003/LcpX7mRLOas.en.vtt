00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:09.660
 in this video I want to explain 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.650
 show me how I struggle with overheating 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:20.789
 here is such a healing for the desire the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:25.260
 microprocessor on the table very early personally 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:29.580
 I thought up exploitation 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.420
 in the summer this building he would like 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.680
 heats up 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.630
 motorcycle start to work intermittently and 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.760
 all that 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:45.710
 further after immediately when you can 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:50.660
 it will not start in this case 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:55.940
 we need to modify that very well, 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:01:00.660
 Ignition will need to find old 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:05.330
 switch with you 2008 9 or 099 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:12.060
 no matter well i'm very old there 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:18.600
 it is so shrink small and harness 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:23.210
 wires also VAZ 2108 07 also fits 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.210
 and the hall sensor love 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:40.400
 so let's start well I already took it all apart 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:44.909
 and now you need to get rid of it 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.420
 we take a soldering iron do not send these here all 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.420
 right then 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.020
 gently slowly 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.150
 we don't need all this 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:59.080
 put aside here 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.730
 unscrew these bolts 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:47.160
 We see here this is also vnutryanku 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:51.720
 the switch here is built in already 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:57.540
 Well, this regulator as at speed 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:02.110
 everything we have now we need it 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:08.110
 ottudova to throw it from there you 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:10.510
 pull out need to solder once soldering 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.569
 and slowly unscrew the bolts for this 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:19.750
 need to know a little soldering iron 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:24.240
 and here, too, there was this 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.240
 will need to be removed
