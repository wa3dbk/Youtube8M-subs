 super rich are super easy to make and 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.660
 obviously they are very nutritious so 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.850
 if you want to see how they prepare 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.279

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.099
 delicious zucchini pizzas 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.650
 we will occupy as many ingredients as you 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.590
 you want only two are indispensable 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.870
 and they are the zucchini and a base 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.820
 tomato sauce the base of sauce 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.700
 tomato can be the one you want 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.559
 use you can use one for pizza 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.559
 or one that you decide to perform 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.220
 you will use the vegetables that you most 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:59.890
 Like this time I used chile 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:06.500
 morrÃ³n yellow tomato onion onion 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:10.250
 green spinach and green chayote 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.740
 and basil the procedure is super 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.560
 simple and the first step will be to cut 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.360
 the ends of our zucchini and 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.360
 then cut them in half 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.310
 after we cut all our 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.990
 zucchini in half what we will do 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.720
 It will be with the help of a spoon 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.070
 eliminate all seeds from the center 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.070
 of our zucchini 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.850
 and we have to have something like that 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.520
 The next step will be to add our 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.680
 tomato sauce base and you can add 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.870
 as much as you want I put 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.590
 approximately one tablespoon per 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.590
 zucchini 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.610
 after this our next step 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.400
 is to add as many vegetables as you 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.410
 you wish I did it this way and 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.410
 It really looks very pretty 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.600
 since you put in your zucchini all 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.910
 vegetables as you wish the next step 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.490
 is to add seasonings I use 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.030
 just a little pepper but 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.920
 you can add salt if you wish so 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.750
 that our zucchini were such and 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.170
 how do you want the next step is 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.670
 preheat our oven to 400 degrees and 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.040
 then we will place our 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.830
 zucchini on a tray to put them 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.120
 baked in an approximate time of 20 a 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.120
 25 minutes 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.630
 since they are ready I added him 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.330
 Fresh basil but you can leave them 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.330
 well if you want and ready to enjoy them 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.930
