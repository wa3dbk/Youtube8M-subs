 savior let's open it 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.910

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.150
 realize I can be totally 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.930
 again let's open it out of cameras 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.930
 well quickly 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.020
 meanwhile you can take advantage 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:56.110
 see this bag and here we have the game 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.380
 super mario 3d land this game is for 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.360
 over 7 years to see it in 3d and it 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.210
 can play also in 2d but the truth 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.420
 to appreciate the cameras and the effects 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.420
 it is advisable to see the 3d so let's go 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.690
 to see the back and better lateral 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.300
 the side part here we have the intent 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:21.190
 310 here is the logo that will appear 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:24.310
 on nintendo 310 and super mario 3d land and 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.690
 red letters and logo 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.750
 Nintendo will back 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.350
 Mario says he is launching into a new adventure 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 in a new dimension as you can 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.300
 give account we have a new a new 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.350
 item that is the box that allows you 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:46.140
 fall more slowly and throw boomerang and the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.650
 tank that is already known to be made 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.780
 very famous in super mariobros 2 and the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.600
 mushroom that makes us grow and tells us 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.790
 that we can receive extra content to 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.700
 through streetpass 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.800
 this game does not get anything for spotpass 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.130
 only by street pass and the contents of the 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.530
 game is also in Spanish 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.530
 another thing to add to this game is 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.489
 for all it is category region according to 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.489
 srb 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.060
 start to the games for what ages 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.990
 are each game and all that we're going to do 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.840
 the uncover quickly we will open it 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.860
 The first thing we find is 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.170
 this is the instruction manual 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.440
 it looks very nice the cover we are going to 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.709
 open I understand it 310 something that pleases me 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.080
 here we have the manual that are the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.019
 basic guides in what we look at this I'm going 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.180
 to flip the nintendo crook code and 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.730
 It also tells us how to jump like running 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.810
 basic game controls let's see 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.530
 what else has the back are the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.440
 credits I think and let's see here we 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.750
 says mario controls with the 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.900
 modes mario movements 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.410
 until we leave this manual we are going to 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.130
 leave here on one side 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.770
 here is fine and we recommend some 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.420
 games that are tetris axis that the truth 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.310
 I do not like it 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.550
 is the one that will give you a very 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.980
 recommended very good and starfox 64 3d 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.660

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.850
 and bring us the nintendo club code 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.330
 that you really can not teach us 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.810
 let's leave it there 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.290
 and the 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.269
 cartridge that is the most important 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.980
 and the presentation is very good we are going to 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.210
 remove it from there and we will insert it in 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.840
