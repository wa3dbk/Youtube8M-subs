00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.510 
stuff around
I<00:01:42.899> suppose<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.920> reboot<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.340> meter

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
I suppose we like to reboot the meter

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.300 
I suppose we like to reboot the meter
will<00:01:45.060> actually<00:01:45.299> say<00:01:45.420> yes<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.740> what<00:01:47.009> happens

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
will actually say yes so what happens

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.950 
will actually say yes so what happens
now<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.240> meter<00:01:48.420> simply<00:01:48.689> turns

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
now is that the meter simply turns

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.359 
now is that the meter simply turns
itself<00:01:49.170> off<00:01:49.409> runs<00:01:49.979> itself<00:01:50.340> back<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.979> now

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
itself off runs itself back on and now

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.980 
itself off runs itself back on and now
what<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:53.939> have<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.210> situation<00:01:54.420> where<00:01:54.869> it's

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
what we have this situation where it's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.929 
what we have this situation where it's
very<00:01:55.079> layers<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.530> software<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.729> box

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
very layers of software is on this box

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.819 
very layers of software is on this box
so<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.360> see<00:01:57.509> how<00:01:57.750> extremely<00:01:58.320> easy<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.680> is

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
so you can see how extremely easy it is

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.550 
so you can see how extremely easy it is
I'm<00:01:59.790> just<00:01:59.850> quickly<00:02:00.270> going<00:02:00.479> back<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.930> here<00:02:01.170> to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
I'm just quickly going back in here to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.770 
I'm just quickly going back in here to
show<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.829> some<00:02:01.920> other<00:02:02.210> information<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
show you some other information here and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.109 
show you some other information here and
if<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.290> get<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> USB<00:02:04.890> menu<00:02:05.340> here<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:05.939> could

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
if we get the USB menu here we could

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.160 
if we get the USB menu here we could
actually

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
actually

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.840 
actually
and<00:02:07.440> as<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.429> said<00:02:08.490> in<00:02:09.030> terms<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.360> pictures<00:02:09.690> and

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
and as I said in terms of pictures and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.220 
and as I said in terms of pictures and
this<00:02:11.850> is<00:02:12.030> how<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:12.209> would<00:02:12.450> access<00:02:12.810> pictures

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
this is how we would access pictures

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.809 
this is how we would access pictures
that<00:02:13.380> will<00:02:13.470> take<00:02:13.650> another<00:02:13.830> layer<00:02:14.190> there<00:02:14.520> in

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
that will take another layer there in

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.280 
that will take another layer there in
terms<00:02:15.060> we<00:02:15.209> can<00:02:15.330> take<00:02:15.480> screenshots<00:02:16.110> of

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
terms we can take screenshots of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.010 
terms we can take screenshots of
particular<00:02:16.530> films<00:02:16.950> our<00:02:17.850> channels<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.450> save

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
particular films our channels and save

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.620 
particular films our channels and save
them<00:02:19.230> either<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.000> be<00:02:21.000> never<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.330> forward

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
them either to be never the forward

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.960 
them either to be never the forward
amount<00:02:21.840> other<00:02:22.050> people<00:02:22.440> are<00:02:22.590> equally<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.610> if

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
amount other people are equally and if

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.280 
amount other people are equally and if
we<00:02:24.060> wanted<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.390> take<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.540> screen<00:02:24.870> shot<00:02:24.900> when

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
we wanted to take a screen shot when

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.600 
we wanted to take a screen shot when
we're<00:02:25.440> walking<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:25.800> particular<00:02:26.130> image<00:02:26.310> or<00:02:26.459> to

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
we're walking on particular image or to

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.640 
we're walking on particular image or to
a<00:02:26.670> customer<00:02:27.030> at<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.180> later<00:02:27.330> point<00:02:27.540> but<00:02:27.930> and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
a customer at a later point but and

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.320 
a customer at a later point but and
that's<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.100> there's<00:02:29.340> not<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.850> functionality

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
that's it there's not that functionality

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.260 
that's it there's not that functionality
out<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:32.340> know<00:02:32.430> it's<00:02:32.550> very<00:02:32.610> well<00:02:32.940> laid<00:02:32.970> out

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
out and you know it's very well laid out

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.810 
out and you know it's very well laid out
very<00:02:33.300> easy<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.989> use<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.800> that's<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.640> basically

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
very easy to use so that's it basically

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.710 
very easy to use so that's it basically
an<00:02:36.390> easy<00:02:37.290> update<00:02:37.620> functions<00:02:38.130> on<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.180> s10

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
an easy update functions on the s10

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.290 
an easy update functions on the s10
