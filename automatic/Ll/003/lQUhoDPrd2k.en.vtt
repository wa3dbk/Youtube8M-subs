car<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.520> mean<00:02:28.970> you're<00:02:29.660> probably<00:02:29.870> wondering<00:02:30.410> can

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
car I mean you're probably wondering can

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.610 
car I mean you're probably wondering can
this<00:02:30.920> thing<00:02:31.160> actually<00:02:31.730> move<00:02:31.970> well<00:02:32.630> let's<00:02:33.440> find

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
this thing actually move well let's find

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:51.589 
this thing actually move well let's find
out

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.699 

well<00:02:52.200> it's<00:02:52.769> moving<00:02:53.180> okay<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.239> in<00:02:54.749> EcoPro<00:02:55.680> mode

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
well it's moving okay so in EcoPro mode

this<00:02:56.519> car<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.939> not<00:02:57.239> exactly<00:02:57.780> brisk<00:02:58.230> but<00:02:58.499> when<00:02:58.950> I

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
this car is not exactly brisk but when I

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.349 
this car is not exactly brisk but when I
put<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.639> in<00:02:59.790> sports<00:03:00.120> mode<00:03:00.329> it's<00:03:01.200> faster<00:03:01.829> than

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
put it in sports mode it's faster than

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.349 
put it in sports mode it's faster than
most<00:03:03.359> of<00:03:03.569> us<00:03:03.629> can<00:03:03.810> handle<00:03:04.879> but<00:03:05.879> let's<00:03:06.060> face<00:03:06.329> it

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
most of us can handle but let's face it

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.809 
most of us can handle but let's face it
most<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.049> time<00:03:07.319> this<00:03:07.799> car<00:03:08.159> is<00:03:08.370> going<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:08.700> be

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
most of the time this car is going to be

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.209 
most of the time this car is going to be
stuck<00:03:09.150> in<00:03:09.180> traffic<00:03:09.299> or<00:03:09.750> rolling<00:03:10.469> around<00:03:10.680> roads

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:11.219 
stuck in traffic or rolling around roads

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.099 
stuck in traffic or rolling around roads
like<00:03:11.430> these<00:03:11.639> so<00:03:12.090> if<00:03:12.389> you<00:03:12.510> can<00:03:12.659> save<00:03:12.870> some<00:03:13.079> money

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
like these so if you can save some money

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.869 
like these so if you can save some money
at<00:03:13.439> the<00:03:13.560> fuel<00:03:13.769> pump<00:03:13.799> thanks<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:14.579> smaller

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
at the fuel pump thanks to a smaller

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.459 
at the fuel pump thanks to a smaller
engine<00:03:15.239> than<00:03:15.269> why<00:03:15.930> not<00:03:17.900> by<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.959> way<00:03:19.109> speaking

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:19.469 
engine than why not by the way speaking

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:23.089 
engine than why not by the way speaking
of<00:03:19.709> saving<00:03:20.129> money<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.609> think<00:03:20.730> BMW<00:03:21.569> is<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:22.230> little

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
of saving money I think BMW is a little

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.699 
of saving money I think BMW is a little
bit<00:03:23.219> optimistic<00:03:23.400> with<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.329> six<00:03:25.200> liters<00:03:25.530> per

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
bit optimistic with the six liters per

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.129 
bit optimistic with the six liters per
100<00:03:25.980> kilometers<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:27.000> combined<00:03:27.419> cycle<00:03:27.689> figure

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
100 kilometers in combined cycle figure

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.439 
100 kilometers in combined cycle figure
I<00:03:28.319> think<00:03:29.159> eight<00:03:29.340> liters<00:03:29.699> per<00:03:29.879> 100<00:03:30.060> kilometers

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
I think eight liters per 100 kilometers

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.470 
I think eight liters per 100 kilometers
is<00:03:31.129> more<00:03:32.129> realistic<00:03:32.489> in<00:03:32.790> combined<00:03:33.209> cycle

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
is more realistic in combined cycle

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.750 
is more realistic in combined cycle
which<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.109> still<00:03:34.439> not<00:03:34.739> bad<00:03:35.010> for<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.280> 2-ton

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
which is still not bad for a 2-ton

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.629 
which is still not bad for a 2-ton
Chelsea<00:03:36.480> tractor<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.079> in<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.919> city<00:03:38.159> you're

Chelsea tractor and in the city you're

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.270 
Chelsea tractor and in the city you're
looking<00:03:38.939> at<00:03:39.090> more<00:03:39.689> like<00:03:39.840> 10<00:03:40.139> years<00:03:40.349> instead<00:03:41.129> of

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
looking at more like 10 years instead of

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.530 
looking at more like 10 years instead of
seven<00:03:41.669> that<00:03:42.150> BMW<00:03:42.659> promises<00:03:44.090> otherwise<00:03:45.090> it's

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
seven that BMW promises otherwise it's

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.479 
seven that BMW promises otherwise it's
quite<00:03:45.870> uncomfortable<00:03:46.290> in<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.680> cabin<00:03:47.010> the

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
quite uncomfortable in the cabin the

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.420 
quite uncomfortable in the cabin the
visibility<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.569> great<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.230> for<00:03:49.919> a<00:03:49.949> car<00:03:50.189> of

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
visibility is great and for a car of

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.039 
visibility is great and for a car of
this<00:03:50.730> size<00:03:52.639> the<00:03:53.639> x5<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.299> really<00:03:54.629> great<00:03:54.900> to

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
this size the x5 is really great to

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.830 
this size the x5 is really great to
drive<00:03:55.579> this<00:03:56.579> is<00:03:56.729> the<00:03:56.849> place<00:03:57.060> where<00:03:57.659> I<00:03:57.689> should

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
drive this is the place where I should

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.259 
drive this is the place where I should
find<00:03:58.229> some<00:03:58.439> downsides<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.340> this<00:03:59.669> car<00:03:59.970> so<00:04:00.120> that

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
find some downsides to this car so that

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.179 
find some downsides to this car so that

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
you don't accuse me of being paid by BMW

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.330 
you don't accuse me of being paid by BMW
or<00:04:02.639> having<00:04:03.359> a<00:04:03.540> particular<00:04:03.930> attachment<00:04:04.500> to

Teutonic school of technical thought
which<00:04:07.979> is<00:04:08.129> manifested<00:04:08.790> every<00:04:08.939> time<00:04:09.509> I<00:04:09.780> dare<00:04:10.500> to

which is manifested every time I dare to

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.869 
which is manifested every time I dare to
criticize<00:04:10.949> a<00:04:11.280> Japanese<00:04:12.060> or<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.599> French<00:04:12.989> car

criticize a Japanese or a French car

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.149 
criticize a Japanese or a French car
okay<00:04:14.879> so<00:04:14.939> on<00:04:15.299> 19-inch<00:04:15.840> rims<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.530> suspension

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159 
okay so on 19-inch rims the suspension

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.879 
okay so on 19-inch rims the suspension
is<00:04:17.699> getting<00:04:18.120> tad<00:04:18.449> loud<00:04:18.780> when<00:04:19.320> going<00:04:19.680> over

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
is getting tad loud when going over

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.890 
is getting tad loud when going over
bigger<00:04:20.250> bumps<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:20.849> that's<00:04:21.060> even<00:04:21.359> in<00:04:21.479> comfort

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
bigger bumps and that's even in comfort

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.620 
bigger bumps and that's even in comfort
mode<00:04:22.079> and<00:04:22.349> this<00:04:22.919> car<00:04:23.159> has<00:04:23.340> done<00:04:23.550> only<00:04:23.759> 1,300

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
mode and this car has done only 1,300

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.540 
mode and this car has done only 1,300
kilometers<00:04:25.110> so<00:04:25.380> it's<00:04:25.770> not<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.009> matter<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.310> the

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
kilometers so it's not a matter of the

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.450 
kilometers so it's not a matter of the
suspension<00:04:27.000> being<00:04:27.240> broken<00:04:27.979> and<00:04:28.979> I<00:04:29.159> prefer

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
suspension being broken and I prefer

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.189 
suspension being broken and I prefer
outies<00:04:29.940> way<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.360> putting<00:04:30.659> the<00:04:30.780> car<00:04:30.960> into

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
outies way of putting the car into

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.800 
outies way of putting the car into
sports<00:04:31.470> mode<00:04:31.710> basically<00:04:31.979> I<00:04:32.250> pull<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.630> leaver

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
sports mode basically I pull the leaver

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.290

for example I understand the tailgate

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.879 
for example I understand the tailgate
has<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.360> be<00:05:36.449> split<00:05:36.720> because<00:05:37.440> of<00:05:37.590> the<00:05:37.680> height
