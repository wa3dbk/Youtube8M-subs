it<00:01:33.340> where<00:01:33.520> does<00:01:33.609> it<00:01:33.670> go<00:01:33.819> next<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.149> like<00:01:34.270> let's

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
it where does it go next to like let's

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.330 
it where does it go next to like let's
say<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.659> iphone<00:01:35.079> or<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.350> ipod<00:01:35.799> does<00:01:36.069> this<00:01:36.189> go

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
say the iphone or the ipod does this go

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.190 
say the iphone or the ipod does this go
right<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.609> the<00:01:36.700> top<00:01:36.880> potentially<00:01:37.479> right<00:01:38.109> to

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
right to the top potentially right to

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.270 
right to the top potentially right to
the<00:01:38.289> top<00:01:38.409> it<00:01:38.590> could<00:01:38.710> be<00:01:38.770> as<00:01:38.859> big<00:01:39.039> as<00:01:39.159> the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
the top it could be as big as the

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.010 
the top it could be as big as the
original<00:01:39.549> macintosh<00:01:40.030> where<00:01:40.299> we<00:01:40.659> sort<00:01:40.899> of

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
original macintosh where we sort of

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
all my tech nerd parts right now really

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.720 
all my tech nerd parts right now really
because<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.409> that<00:02:25.590> big<00:02:25.769> it's<00:02:26.129> that<00:02:26.489> big

it's like a new Star Wars movie right
the<00:02:29.489> original<00:02:30.000> good<00:02:30.299> stories<00:02:30.780> like<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.049> USS

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
the original good stories like the USS

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.729 
the original good stories like the USS
now<00:02:33.209> let's<00:02:33.480> talk<00:02:33.599> about<00:02:33.659> cost<00:02:34.110> here<00:02:34.409> because

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
now let's talk about cost here because

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.259 
now let's talk about cost here because
there<00:02:34.920> are<00:02:35.040> some<00:02:35.310> conflicting<00:02:35.579> reports<00:02:35.909> this

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
there are some conflicting reports this

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.460 
there are some conflicting reports this
could<00:02:36.420> be<00:02:36.510> anywhere<00:02:36.750> from<00:02:36.810> six<00:02:37.140> hundred<00:02:37.379> to<00:02:37.440> a

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
could be anywhere from six hundred to a

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.110 
could be anywhere from six hundred to a
thousand<00:02:37.920> dollars<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.519> not<00:02:38.640> be<00:02:38.909> cheap

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
thousand dollars so this is not be cheap

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.180 
thousand dollars so this is not be cheap
it's<00:02:39.629> not<00:02:39.750> gonna<00:02:39.900> be<00:02:40.019> cheap<00:02:40.079> apples<00:02:40.560> annoying

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
it's not gonna be cheap apples annoying

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.979 
it's not gonna be cheap apples annoying
tendency<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.940> they're<00:02:42.359> not<00:02:42.450> afraid<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.840> a

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
tendency is that they're not afraid of a

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.270 
tendency is that they're not afraid of a
high<00:02:43.109> price<00:02:43.409> point<00:02:43.709> if<00:02:43.799> they<00:02:43.890> think<00:02:43.950> it'll

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
high price point if they think it'll

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.460 
high price point if they think it'll
make<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.430> really<00:02:44.909> really<00:02:45.120> good<00:02:45.329> device<00:02:45.659> so<00:02:46.200> I've

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
make a really really good device so I've

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.110 
make a really really good device so I've
seen<00:02:46.620> estimates<00:02:46.920> as<00:02:47.220> high<00:02:47.250> as<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.489> thousand<00:02:47.970> i'm

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
seen estimates as high as a thousand i'm

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.490 
seen estimates as high as a thousand i'm
guessing<00:02:48.450> around<00:02:48.510> six<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.019> seven<00:02:49.260> hundred<00:02:49.290> and

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
guessing around six to seven hundred and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.630 
guessing around six to seven hundred and
you're<00:02:49.680> gonna<00:02:49.799> need<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.010> separate<00:02:50.310> contract

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
you're gonna need a separate contract

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.550 
you're gonna need a separate contract
for<00:02:50.940> some<00:02:51.120> internet<00:02:51.450> usage<00:02:51.750> correct<00:02:52.049> maybe

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
for some internet usage correct maybe

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.809 
for some internet usage correct maybe
