00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
eyes and today I'm using these fashioned

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.589 
eyes and today I'm using these fashioned
lashes<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:28.010> think<00:00:29.010> probably<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.789> best<00:00:30.179> kind

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
lashes I think probably the best kind

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.720 
lashes I think probably the best kind
are<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.289> ones<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.560> say<00:00:31.769> 100%<00:00:32.160> human<00:00:32.669> hair

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
are the ones that say 100% human hair

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.330 
are the ones that say 100% human hair
because<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> plastic<00:00:33.719> ones<00:00:33.960> hurt<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:35.219> eyes

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
because the plastic ones hurt your eyes

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.639 
because the plastic ones hurt your eyes
and<00:00:35.880> they<00:00:36.239> they<00:00:36.809> don't<00:00:36.960> hold<00:00:37.380> their<00:00:37.620> shape

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
and they they don't hold their shape

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.500 
and they they don't hold their shape
they<00:00:38.190> kind<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.610> go<00:00:38.760> straight<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.420> then

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
they kind of just go straight and then

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.780 
they kind of just go straight and then
they<00:00:39.719> fall<00:00:39.899> off<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
they fall off and it's just just not a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.479 
they fall off and it's just just not a
good<00:00:42.000> idea<00:00:42.989> where<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> eyelash<00:00:43.860> glue<00:00:44.070> I'm

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
good idea where the eyelash glue I'm

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.200 
good idea where the eyelash glue I'm
using<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.000> duo<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.770> clear<00:00:47.190> white<00:00:47.610> so

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
using the duo and it is clear white so

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.810 
using the duo and it is clear white so
it<00:00:48.360> goes<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.780> white<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.410> turns<00:00:49.649> clear<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.430> do

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
it goes on white but it turns clear I do

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.510 
it goes on white but it turns clear I do
my<00:00:51.239> mascara<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:52.140> makeup<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.160> normally

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
my mascara and makeup as I normally

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.720 
my mascara and makeup as I normally
would<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.050> at<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.469> very<00:00:55.739> end<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.520> fake

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
