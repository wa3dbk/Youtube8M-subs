00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
made some progress on this engine swap

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.640 
made some progress on this engine swap
no<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.489> engines<00:02:11.819> not<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.180> yet<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:12.690> it's

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
no the engines not in yet but it's

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.500 
no the engines not in yet but it's
getting<00:02:13.830> there

700r4<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.790> again<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.299> sent<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.720> engine<00:02:25.080> bay

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
700r4 and again I sent the engine bay

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.210 
700r4 and again I sent the engine bay
waiting<00:02:25.769> it's<00:02:25.920> new<00:02:26.129> engine<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:28.500> these

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
waiting it's new engine that the these

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.070 
waiting it's new engine that the these
are<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.879> new<00:02:30.060> fuel<00:02:30.390> setup<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:30.870> did<00:02:31.049> I

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
are this is a new fuel setup I did I

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.780 
are this is a new fuel setup I did I
just<00:02:31.349> took<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.590> original<00:02:31.709> lines<00:02:32.310> put<00:02:32.700> them

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
just took the original lines put them

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
just took the original lines put them
into<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.090> Corvette<00:02:33.569> filter<00:02:34.110> which<00:02:34.830> takes<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
into the Corvette filter which takes the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.780 
into the Corvette filter which takes the
inlet<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.840> returned<00:02:37.319> put<00:02:38.160> down<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:38.519> single

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
inlet and returned put down to a single

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.039 
inlet and returned put down to a single
line<00:02:39.380> which<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.560> its<00:02:40.739> steel<00:02:41.069> line<00:02:41.599> up<00:02:42.599> over<00:02:42.959> the

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
line which is its steel line up over the

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.170 
line which is its steel line up over the
firewall<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.489> comes<00:02:44.670> out<00:02:44.790> right<00:02:44.940> by<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
firewall and it comes out right by the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.319 
firewall and it comes out right by the
brake<00:02:45.480> booster<00:02:46.069> which<00:02:47.069> I'll<00:02:47.220> do<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.459> here<00:02:47.579> flex

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
brake booster which I'll do it here flex

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.759 
brake booster which I'll do it here flex
line<00:02:48.599> from<00:02:48.780> there<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.260> fuel<00:02:49.530> rail<00:02:51.769> it's

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
line from there to the fuel rail it's

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.229 
line from there to the fuel rail it's
really<00:02:52.980> only<00:02:53.099> modification<00:02:53.849> i<00:02:53.879> dealing<00:02:54.120> with

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
really only modification i dealing with

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.190 
really only modification i dealing with
the<00:02:54.390> hood<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:57.239> motor<00:02:57.480> mounts<00:02:57.810> don't<00:02:57.900> really

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
the hood the motor mounts don't really

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.789 
the hood the motor mounts don't really
need<00:02:58.349> any<00:02:58.590> modification<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.519> pit<00:03:00.590> this<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.709> the

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
need any modification of pit this is the

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.770 
need any modification of pit this is the
crossmember<00:03:02.610> out<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.769> 94<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:04.950> 96<00:03:05.599> wagon<00:03:06.599> with

crossmember out of a 94 to 96 wagon with
an<00:03:06.840> lt1

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
an lt1

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.030 
an lt1
ground<00:03:09.569> these<00:03:09.750> edges<00:03:10.139> off<00:03:10.319> which<00:03:10.620> doesn't

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
ground these edges off which doesn't

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.539 
ground these edges off which doesn't
appear<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.310> actually<00:03:11.639> have<00:03:11.730> been<00:03:11.819> necessary

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
appear to actually have been necessary

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.250 
appear to actually have been necessary
but<00:03:14.549> it<00:03:14.730> fits<00:03:14.970> up<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.329> there<00:03:15.450> now<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.930> just<00:03:16.109> got

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
but it fits up in there now you just got

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.460 
but it fits up in there now you just got
drill<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> couple<00:03:16.709> holes<00:03:16.889> in<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.340> frame<00:03:18.230> on<00:03:19.230> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
drill a couple holes in the frame on the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.819 
drill a couple holes in the frame on the
passenger<00:03:20.100> side<00:03:20.400> but<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:23.370> course<00:03:23.639> I<00:03:24.829> can't

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
passenger side but of course I can't

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.569 
passenger side but of course I can't
line<00:03:26.010> anything<00:03:26.459> up<00:03:26.579> to<00:03:26.700> save<00:03:26.880> my<00:03:27.030> life<00:03:28.489> so<00:03:29.489> of

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
line anything up to save my life so of

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.099 
line anything up to save my life so of
course<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:30.000> holes<00:03:30.209> aren't<00:03:30.660> where<00:03:30.840> they<00:03:30.959> need

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
course the holes aren't where they need

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.920 
course the holes aren't where they need
to<00:03:31.139> be<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.410> got<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.739> mess<00:03:32.069> with<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.459> yeah<00:03:32.930> but

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
to be I got a mess with that yeah but

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.539 
to be I got a mess with that yeah but
once<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.380> engines<00:03:34.799> in<00:03:35.099> here<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:35.489> could

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
once the engines in here and I could

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.490 
once the engines in here and I could
better<00:03:36.120> gauge<00:03:36.450> where<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.750> things<00:03:36.959> gonna<00:03:37.109> set

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
better gauge where the things gonna set

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.100 
better gauge where the things gonna set
a<00:03:38.419> fish<00:03:39.419> left

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.800
