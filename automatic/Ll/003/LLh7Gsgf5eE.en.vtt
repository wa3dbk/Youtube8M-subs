a different angle perhaps an angle that

they may not be expecting you to
approach<00:04:00.400> them<00:04:00.610> from<00:04:00.850> use<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.930> your

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
approach them from use that to your

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.630 
approach them from use that to your
advantage<00:04:02.080> because<00:04:02.650> as<00:04:03.070> you<00:04:03.220> saw<00:04:03.430> in<00:04:03.459> that

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
advantage because as you saw in that

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.240 
advantage because as you saw in that
last<00:04:03.880> clip<00:04:04.180> there<00:04:04.390> I<00:04:04.600> got<00:04:05.320> six<00:04:05.620> or<00:04:05.770> seven<00:04:06.010> kills
