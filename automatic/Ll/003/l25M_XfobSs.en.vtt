00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.160 

water<00:00:32.240> we're<00:00:33.240> going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.480> wash<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.810> biodiesel

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
water we're going to wash the biodiesel

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.080 
water we're going to wash the biodiesel
I<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:34.920> poured<00:00:35.160> off<00:00:35.310> the<00:00:35.430> glycerin<00:00:35.850> off<00:00:35.970> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
I just poured off the glycerin off the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.210 
I just poured off the glycerin off the
bottom<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.510> tank

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
bottom of the tank

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.410 
bottom of the tank
here<00:00:38.220> we<00:00:38.340> go<00:00:38.489> we're<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> pour<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> water

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
here we go we're going to pour the water

00:00:39.420 --> 00:01:04.250 
here we go we're going to pour the water
in

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.700 

it's<00:01:05.260> hard<00:01:05.440> to<00:01:05.500> see<00:01:05.770> but<00:01:06.040> there's<00:01:06.640> a<00:01:06.729> layer<00:01:06.970> of

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
it's hard to see but there's a layer of

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.710 
it's hard to see but there's a layer of
clear<00:01:08.710> on<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.070> bottom<00:01:09.990> goes<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.170> boat<00:01:11.410> there

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
clear on the bottom goes to boat there

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.090 
clear on the bottom goes to boat there
so<00:01:13.720> we're<00:01:13.869> going<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.080> add<00:01:14.530> some<00:01:14.770> more<00:01:14.920> water

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
so we're going to add some more water

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.780 
so we're going to add some more water
until<00:01:15.580> we<00:01:15.640> get<00:01:15.820> up<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.360> ten<00:01:16.900> gallon<00:01:17.320> mark

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
until we get up to the ten gallon mark

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.700 
until we get up to the ten gallon mark
now<00:01:18.790> that<00:01:18.970> I<00:01:19.030> got<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.390> light<00:01:19.990> near<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:20.380> bottom

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
now that I got the light near the bottom

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.760 
now that I got the light near the bottom
of<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.890> tank<00:01:21.100> on<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.820> other<00:01:21.909> side<00:01:22.270> here<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
of the tank on the other side here you

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.040 
of the tank on the other side here you
can<00:01:23.920> really<00:01:24.100> see<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:25.450> difference<00:01:25.630> between

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
can really see the difference between

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.650 
can really see the difference between
the<00:01:26.350> biodiesel<00:01:26.740> on<00:01:26.979> top<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:28.210> wash<00:01:28.420> water

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
the biodiesel on top and the wash water

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.840 
the biodiesel on top and the wash water
and<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.050> bottom<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.280> what<00:01:30.430> we're<00:01:30.520> going<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.670> do

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
and the bottom so what we're going to do

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.980 
and the bottom so what we're going to do
is<00:01:30.970> we're<00:01:31.060> going<00:01:31.149> to<00:01:31.210> add<00:01:31.360> some<00:01:31.600> more<00:01:31.750> wash

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
is we're going to add some more wash

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.510 
is we're going to add some more wash
water<00:01:32.259> I<00:01:32.380> just<00:01:32.649> got<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.890> first<00:01:33.070> one<00:01:33.250> in<00:01:33.399> there

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
water I just got the first one in there

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.950 
water I just got the first one in there
now<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:35.490> see<00:01:36.490> how<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:37.300> color<00:01:37.539> is<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.780> that

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
now and see how the color is of that

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.070 
now and see how the color is of that
wash<00:01:38.200> water<00:01:38.500> as<00:01:38.710> it's<00:01:38.860> coming<00:01:39.190> out<00:01:40.080> typically

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
wash water as it's coming out typically

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.550 
wash water as it's coming out typically
you<00:01:41.259> need<00:01:41.410> to<00:01:41.560> let<00:01:41.740> this<00:01:41.860> settle<00:01:42.190> for<00:01:43.410> they<00:01:44.410> say

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
you need to let this settle for they say

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.300 
you need to let this settle for they say
two<00:01:44.619> to<00:01:44.860> three<00:01:45.070> hours<00:01:45.429> and<00:01:46.410> the<00:01:47.410> cloudy<00:01:48.039> or<00:01:48.220> the

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
two to three hours and the cloudy or the

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.710 
two to three hours and the cloudy or the
wash<00:01:48.460> water<00:01:48.759> that<00:01:48.940> comes<00:01:49.090> out<00:01:49.270> then<00:01:49.539> you<00:01:49.600> have

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
wash water that comes out then you have

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.109 
wash water that comes out then you have
to<00:01:49.840> wash<00:01:50.050> it<00:01:50.259> again<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:51.399> you<00:01:51.490> may<00:01:51.640> have<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:51.970> wash

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
to wash it again so you may have to wash

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.700 
to wash it again so you may have to wash
it<00:01:52.300> four<00:01:52.509> or<00:01:52.539> five<00:01:52.600> times<00:01:52.720> but<00:01:53.229> because<00:01:53.560> this

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
it four or five times but because this

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.060 
it four or five times but because this
is<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:53.890> virgin<00:01:54.160> all<00:01:54.399> virgin<00:01:55.270> oil<00:01:55.650> you<00:01:56.650> generally

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
is a virgin all virgin oil you generally

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.289 
is a virgin all virgin oil you generally
don't<00:01:57.250> have<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.460> wash<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.700> all<00:01:57.939> that<00:01:58.090> much

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
don't have to wash it all that much

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.450 
don't have to wash it all that much
because<00:01:58.540> it's<00:01:59.079> not<00:01:59.409> a<00:01:59.439> lot<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.650> impurities<00:02:00.070> in

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
because it's not a lot of impurities in

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.980 
because it's not a lot of impurities in
this<00:02:00.610> oil<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.759> draining<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.270> wash<00:02:04.479> water<00:02:04.720> now

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
this oil so draining the wash water now

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.569 
this oil so draining the wash water now
you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:06.610> see<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:06.939> has<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:08.250> bit<00:02:09.250> of<00:02:09.280> a<00:02:09.399> yellow

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:09.579 
you can see it has a bit of a yellow

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.920 
you can see it has a bit of a yellow
tinge<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.540> it<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.440> that<00:02:12.570> shouldn't<00:02:13.570> really<00:02:13.780> be

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
tinge to it so that shouldn't really be

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.900 
tinge to it so that shouldn't really be
there<00:02:14.350> on<00:02:14.560> your<00:02:14.799> final<00:02:15.190> wash<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.640> should<00:02:15.820> be

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
there on your final wash it should be

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.259 
there on your final wash it should be
mainly<00:02:16.150> clear<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.620> then<00:02:17.799> you<00:02:17.920> know<00:02:18.040> the

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
mainly clear and then you know the

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.460 
mainly clear and then you know the
biodiesel<00:02:19.269> is<00:02:19.360> clean<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.610> second

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
biodiesel is clean this is the second

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.390 
biodiesel is clean this is the second
wash<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:25.840> quite<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> lot<00:02:26.470> less<00:02:26.829> color<00:02:27.190> in

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
wash it's quite a lot less color in

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.050 
wash it's quite a lot less color in
there<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:27.880> we're<00:02:28.090> on<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.480> right<00:02:28.600> track<00:02:28.930> here

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
there so we're on the right track here

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.890 
there so we're on the right track here
it<00:02:31.060> seems<00:02:31.329> pretty<00:02:31.630> clear<00:02:31.870> coming<00:02:32.410> out

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
it seems pretty clear coming out

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.670 
it seems pretty clear coming out
so<00:02:34.900> we're<00:02:35.080> washing<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.590> biodiesel<00:02:35.980> right<00:02:36.340> now

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
so we're washing the biodiesel right now

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.170 
so we're washing the biodiesel right now
you<00:02:38.680> can<00:02:38.860> see<00:02:39.040> it's<00:02:39.190> bubbling<00:02:39.430> away<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.060> it's

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
you can see it's bubbling away and it's

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.340 
you can see it's bubbling away and it's
slowly<00:02:40.870> getting<00:02:41.230> more<00:02:41.680> clear<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.750> what<00:02:44.170> we're

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
slowly getting more clear and what we're

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.790 
slowly getting more clear and what we're
using<00:02:44.560> are<00:02:45.280> these<00:02:45.460> stainless<00:02:46.800> actually

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
using are these stainless actually

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.790 
using are these stainless actually

we've<00:03:04.240> got<00:03:04.450> two<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.500> them<00:03:05.560> in<00:03:05.710> here<00:03:05.770> so<00:03:06.610> let's

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
we've got two of them in here so let's

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.030 
we've got two of them in here so let's
just<00:03:06.910> try<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.290> pull<00:03:08.290> up<00:03:08.470> here<00:03:08.710> see<00:03:08.890> if<00:03:08.950> they

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
just try and pull up here see if they

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.170 
just try and pull up here see if they
look<00:03:09.220> like<00:03:09.370> that's<00:03:09.610> what<00:03:09.670> they<00:03:09.820> look<00:03:09.970> like

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
look like that's what they look like

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.230 
look like that's what they look like
it's<00:03:10.360> just<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:11.250> stainless<00:03:12.250> rod<00:03:14.850> goes<00:03:15.850> in<00:03:16.030> there

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
it's just a stainless rod goes in there

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.920 
it's just a stainless rod goes in there
and<00:03:16.450> then<00:03:16.750> there's<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:17.190> temperature<00:03:18.190> sensor

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
and then there's a temperature sensor

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.620 
and then there's a temperature sensor
that's<00:03:19.930> part<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:21.580> then<00:03:22.030> on<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.330> actual

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
that's part of it and then on the actual

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.550 
that's part of it and then on the actual
heaters<00:03:23.020> you<00:03:23.860> got<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.930> dial<00:03:25.930> setting<00:03:26.380> here

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
heaters you got this dial setting here

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.640 
heaters you got this dial setting here
so<00:03:26.590> we've<00:03:26.830> just<00:03:26.860> got<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.310> on<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.550> max<00:03:27.790> setting

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
so we've just got it on the max setting

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.500 
so we've just got it on the max setting
we<00:03:29.650> got<00:03:29.770> two<00:03:30.010> of<00:03:30.130> these<00:03:30.220> in<00:03:30.460> here<00:03:30.700> just<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.360> heat

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
we got two of these in here just to heat

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.820 
we got two of these in here just to heat
it<00:03:31.630> up<00:03:31.660> a<00:03:31.720> little<00:03:31.840> quicker<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:32.290> it's<00:03:32.440> nice<00:03:32.620> and

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
it up a little quicker and it's nice and

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.960 
it up a little quicker and it's nice and
warm<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:34.170> then<00:03:35.170> we've<00:03:35.320> got<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:35.970> chlorine

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
warm and then we've got this chlorine

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.920 
warm and then we've got this chlorine
pump<00:03:37.330> here<00:03:37.630> it's<00:03:38.470> got<00:03:38.790> double<00:03:39.790> outputs<00:03:40.180> going

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
pump here it's got double outputs going

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:49.410 
pump here it's got double outputs going
to<00:03:42.840> Ali's<00:03:44.940> wood<00:03:45.940> air<00:03:46.270> stone<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:49.030> can't<00:03:49.240> use

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
to Ali's wood air stone you can't use

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.880 
to Ali's wood air stone you can't use
the<00:03:49.570> regular<00:03:49.900> air<00:03:50.050> stones<00:03:50.320> because<00:03:50.740> the

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
the regular air stones because the

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.140 
the regular air stones because the
regular<00:03:51.190> air<00:03:51.310> stones<00:03:53.490> don't<00:03:54.490> last<00:03:54.820> in<00:03:55.060> this

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
regular air stones don't last in this

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.050 
regular air stones don't last in this
stuff<00:03:55.450> they<00:03:55.660> basically<00:03:56.040> corrode<00:03:57.060> really

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
stuff they basically corrode really

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.460 
stuff they basically corrode really
quickly<00:03:58.480> so

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.260 

you<00:04:02.010> can<00:04:02.190> see<00:04:02.400> there's<00:04:02.610> looks<00:04:02.880> like<00:04:03.060> some

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
you can see there's looks like some

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.460 
you can see there's looks like some
water<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.380> bottom<00:04:04.530> here<00:04:05.010> as<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:06.470> clear

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
water in the bottom here as you clear

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.920 
water in the bottom here as you clear
the<00:04:07.620> diesel<00:04:07.980> with<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.190> air<00:04:08.310> stone<00:04:08.700> more<00:04:09.630> water

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
the diesel with the air stone more water

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.630 
the diesel with the air stone more water
will<00:04:10.170> come<00:04:10.410> out<00:04:10.560> in<00:04:10.740> the<00:04:10.800> bottom<00:04:11.220> here

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
will come out in the bottom here

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.940 
will come out in the bottom here
looks<00:04:12.630> like<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.900> separations<00:04:13.560> right<00:04:13.740> there

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
looks like the separations right there

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.920 
looks like the separations right there
it's<00:04:14.130> hard<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.400> see<00:04:14.580> though<00:04:14.730> but<00:04:15.540> that'll<00:04:15.900> be

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
it's hard to see though but that'll be

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.840 
it's hard to see though but that'll be
more<00:04:16.350> evident<00:04:16.799> in<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.070> next<00:04:17.310> few<00:04:17.459> days<00:04:17.579> as

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
more evident in the next few days as

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.990 
more evident in the next few days as
this<00:04:18.269> clears<00:04:18.630> up<00:04:19.340> so<00:04:20.340> that's<00:04:20.519> how<00:04:20.640> you<00:04:20.700> clear

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
this clears up so that's how you clear

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.650 
this clears up so that's how you clear
the<00:04:21.180> wash<00:04:21.810> water<00:04:22.109> out<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.560> diesel<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.250> the

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
the wash water out of the diesel and the

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.620 
the wash water out of the diesel and the
only<00:04:24.660> other<00:04:24.840> thing<00:04:24.960> that<00:04:25.140> I've<00:04:25.500> done<00:04:25.710> is<00:04:26.630> I've

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
only other thing that I've done is I've

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.390 
only other thing that I've done is I've
got<00:04:27.870> this<00:04:28.160> pH<00:04:29.160> probe<00:04:29.520> here<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:31.040> you<00:04:32.040> stick

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
got this pH probe here and you stick

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.070 
got this pH probe here and you stick
that<00:04:32.550> in<00:04:32.610> there<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.660> want<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.960> get

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
that in there and you want to get

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.170 
that in there and you want to get
probably<00:04:34.620> under<00:04:34.950> seven<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:35.700> a<00:04:35.730> half<00:04:35.910> or

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
probably under seven and a half or

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.900 
probably under seven and a half or
something<00:04:36.330> like<00:04:36.660> that<00:04:36.950> or<00:04:37.950> under<00:04:38.700> eight

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
something like that or under eight

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.680 
something like that or under eight
anyhow<00:04:39.390> for<00:04:40.290> your<00:04:40.380> final<00:04:40.770> diesel<00:04:41.690> biodiesel

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
anyhow for your final diesel biodiesel

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.750 
anyhow for your final diesel biodiesel
product<00:04:43.410> but<00:04:43.620> I<00:04:43.770> start<00:04:44.100> to<00:04:44.190> do<00:04:44.280> some<00:04:44.460> research

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
product but I start to do some research

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.270 
product but I start to do some research
to<00:04:44.940> see<00:04:45.090> what<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.330> ideal<00:04:45.630> pH<00:04:46.080> is<00:04:46.440> well<00:04:47.160> you're

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
to see what the ideal pH is well you're

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.830 
to see what the ideal pH is well you're
going<00:04:47.370> to<00:04:47.430> need<00:04:47.520> one<00:04:47.760> of<00:04:47.790> these<00:04:47.910> pH<00:04:48.240> meters<00:04:48.630> and

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
going to need one of these pH meters and

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.740 
going to need one of these pH meters and
if<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:49.530> pH<00:04:49.830> is<00:04:49.860> too<00:04:50.070> high<00:04:50.460> alkaline<00:04:51.390> from<00:04:51.660> the

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
if the pH is too high alkaline from the

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.120 
if the pH is too high alkaline from the
Koh<00:04:52.200> then<00:04:53.160> you<00:04:53.280> need<00:04:53.430> to<00:04:53.550> wash<00:04:53.760> some<00:04:54.150> more<00:04:54.390> and

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
Koh then you need to wash some more and

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.280 
Koh then you need to wash some more and
get<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.250> excess<00:04:56.840> Koh<00:04:57.840> out<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.860> your<00:04:59.010> fuel
