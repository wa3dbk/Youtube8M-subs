00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.870
 good afternoon today i want you 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.790
 tell about this knitting technique 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.200
 magic loop for like myself on 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.389
 English sounds magic club 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.490
 so this technique is used to 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.320
 knitting small circles like in 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.100
 wearing socks there sleeves 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.310
 if you knit long circular needles 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.590
 Knitting needles are best used with flexible fishing line. 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.660
 means how it happens will start its 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.710
 circle visually divide in half well 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.539
 this is how it turns out at this point 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.610
 pull out between the loops of our loop 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.320
 knitting needles 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.200
 hence the name is magical 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.840
 the loop of the front loop dress on the needle 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.820
 which we will knit 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.129
 the rear remain on the fishing line here we 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.750
 it turns out 2 loops of fishing line and us 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.590
 it will be comfortable to knit us nothing 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.079
 will interfere 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.449
 This method is much more convenient than 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.210
 knitting stocking use 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.190
 our row of pattern how do you use i 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.600
 Here is an example 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.600
 showing crown caps 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.510
 so we conclude until the end of this spoke where 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.100
 us loop tor stick out as well 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.670
 expanding work 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.520
 we already have a loop in the middle 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.780
 now we dress front loops 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.210
 knitting needle to the other end of the circular knitting needle 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.270
 protrude the back again forming the second 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.450
 loop you see two loops all 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.220
 continue to knit in a circle this method 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.130
 it is very convenient here if you are somewhere in 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.290
 the road you go to the subway for example circular 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.960
 knitting needles do not stick out different directions to me 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.460
 interfere don't lay out somehow it seems to me 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.460
 much more comfortable and convenient to knit 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.770
 well, then the principle you understand, thank you 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.770
 for your attention
