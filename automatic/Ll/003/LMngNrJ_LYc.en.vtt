collecting<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.190> traps<00:00:48.460> is<00:00:48.700> simply<00:00:49.180> a<00:00:49.210> matter

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
collecting the traps is simply a matter

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.780 
collecting the traps is simply a matter
of<00:00:49.750> walking<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.230> trap<00:00:50.440> line<00:00:50.680> if<00:00:51.010> a<00:00:51.340> trap<00:00:51.610> is

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
of walking the trap line if a trap is

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.880 
of walking the trap line if a trap is
sprung<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:52.630> trap<00:00:52.660> is<00:00:53.050> picked<00:00:53.290> up<00:00:53.470> for<00:00:53.710> later

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
sprung the trap is picked up for later

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.310 
sprung the trap is picked up for later
processing<00:00:56.610> if<00:00:57.610> the<00:00:57.820> trap<00:00:58.059> is<00:00:58.239> empty<00:00:58.630> it<00:00:59.140> is

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
processing if the trap is empty it is

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.530 
processing if the trap is empty it is
fun<00:00:59.620> so<00:00:59.890> no<00:00:59.920> animal<00:01:00.520> can<00:01:00.790> get<00:01:00.940> caught<00:01:01.210> in<00:01:01.420> the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
fun so no animal can get caught in the

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.350 
fun so no animal can get caught in the
heat<00:01:01.719> of<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.930> day<00:01:02.489> once<00:01:03.489> all<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:03.850> traps<00:01:04.119> have

first trick getting the mouse out of the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.370 
first trick getting the mouse out of the
trap<00:01:10.259> we<00:01:11.259> simply<00:01:11.829> put<00:01:12.310> a<00:01:12.340> large<00:01:12.990> ziplock<00:01:13.990> bag

and then we can close the bag and remove

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:31.469 
and then we can close the bag and remove
the<00:01:29.770> rodent<00:01:30.130> from<00:01:30.429> the<00:01:30.579> bag<00:01:30.759> in<00:01:31.029> order<00:01:31.149> to

process<00:01:31.959> it<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.679> then<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:34.299> process<00:01:34.569> these

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
process it and then we process these

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.069 
process it and then we process these

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
have been catching a three main species

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.600 
have been catching a three main species
in<00:02:37.360> these<00:02:37.540> parks<00:02:38.080> one<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.920> more<00:02:39.130> common

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
in these parks one of the more common

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.930 
in these parks one of the more common
ones<00:02:39.850> is<00:02:40.150> called<00:02:40.959> neo<00:02:41.440> toma<00:02:41.860> alba<00:02:42.430> Gila<00:02:42.730> which

ones is called neo toma alba Gila which

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.990 
ones is called neo toma alba Gila which
is<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.300> white<00:02:43.540> throated<00:02:43.959> woodrat<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.310> this

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
is the white throated woodrat and this

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.870 
is the white throated woodrat and this
woodrat<00:02:46.750> has<00:02:46.930> been<00:02:47.170> fairly<00:02:48.070> abundant<00:02:48.489> in

woodrat has been fairly abundant in
these<00:02:49.030> parks<00:02:49.800> this<00:02:50.800> woodrat<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.610> little<00:02:52.000> bit

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
these parks this woodrat is a little bit

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.030 
these parks this woodrat is a little bit
more<00:02:52.360> difficult<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.140> handle<00:02:53.350> than<00:02:53.739> some<00:02:53.920> of

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
more difficult to handle than some of

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.949 
more difficult to handle than some of
the<00:02:54.130> other<00:02:54.310> species<00:02:54.670> because<00:02:55.239> of<00:02:55.390> its<00:02:55.540> larger

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
the other species because of its larger

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.920 
the other species because of its larger
size<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.650> they<00:02:57.519> tend<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.970> bite<00:02:58.360> more

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
size and they tend to bite more

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.330 
size and they tend to bite more
frequently<00:03:00.000> my<00:03:01.000> favorite<00:03:01.480> one<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.680> handle<00:03:03.130> is

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
frequently my favorite one to handle is

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.570 
frequently my favorite one to handle is
the<00:03:04.330> smallest<00:03:05.019> species<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.860> we<00:03:06.010> catch<00:03:06.280> which

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
the smallest species that we catch which

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.530 
the smallest species that we catch which
is<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:07.000> rock<00:03:07.209> pocket<00:03:07.750> mouse<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.350> this<00:03:09.010> one<00:03:09.280> is

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
is the rock pocket mouse and this one is

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.290 
is the rock pocket mouse and this one is
extremely<00:03:10.540> passive<00:03:11.350> to<00:03:11.920> handle<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.730> we<00:03:13.030> never

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
extremely passive to handle and we never

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.910 
extremely passive to handle and we never
have<00:03:13.780> any<00:03:13.810> bites<00:03:14.410> from<00:03:14.739> this<00:03:15.010> rodent<00:03:16.709> once<00:03:17.709> the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
have any bites from this rodent once the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.710 
have any bites from this rodent once the
animals<00:03:18.250> have<00:03:18.430> been<00:03:18.579> processed<00:03:18.850> they<00:03:19.570> are

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
animals have been processed they are

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.870 
animals have been processed they are
taken<00:03:20.079> to<00:03:20.170> their<00:03:20.320> capture<00:03:20.590> site<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.519> release

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
taken to their capture site and release

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.670 
taken to their capture site and release
once<00:03:22.209> we<00:03:22.360> have<00:03:22.510> finished<00:03:22.690> processing<00:03:23.530> my

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
once we have finished processing my

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.920 
once we have finished processing my
animal<00:03:24.100> we<00:03:24.280> put<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.610> back<00:03:24.790> in<00:03:25.060> its<00:03:25.239> trap<00:03:25.600> and

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
animal we put it back in its trap and

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.020 
animal we put it back in its trap and
then<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.500> traps<00:03:26.799> are<00:03:27.010> individually<00:03:27.790> numbered

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
then the traps are individually numbered

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.110 
then the traps are individually numbered
so<00:03:28.870> we<00:03:29.049> can<00:03:29.290> take<00:03:29.739> that<00:03:29.980> animal<00:03:30.459> back<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:30.940> the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
so we can take that animal back to the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.150 
so we can take that animal back to the
exact<00:03:31.480> site<00:03:31.840> where<00:03:32.140> it<00:03:32.260> was<00:03:32.410> captured<00:03:32.950> from

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
exact site where it was captured from

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.060 
exact site where it was captured from
and<00:03:33.489> release<00:03:33.760> it<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.660> animal<00:03:35.110> is<00:03:35.410> generally

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
and release it the animal is generally

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.870 
and release it the animal is generally
not<00:03:36.280> harmed<00:03:36.730> in<00:03:36.850> any<00:03:37.060> way<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:38.280> then<00:03:39.280> on<00:03:39.640> the

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
not harmed in any way and then on the

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.539 
not harmed in any way and then on the
following<00:03:40.329> captures<00:03:40.959> we<00:03:41.200> can<00:03:41.410> look<00:03:41.590> for<00:03:42.010> the
