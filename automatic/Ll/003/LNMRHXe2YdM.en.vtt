00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
talking about talking about shifting

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.220 
talking about talking about shifting
somehow<00:00:11.820> we<00:00:11.880> got<00:00:12.150> into<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.450> we're<00:00:12.960> talking

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
somehow we got into that we're talking

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.350 
somehow we got into that we're talking
about<00:00:13.380> shifting<00:00:13.710> without<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.130> clutch<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:15.120> I

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
about shifting without a clutch and I

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.750 
about shifting without a clutch and I
had<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> lot<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.719> these<00:00:15.870> guys<00:00:16.400> swear<00:00:17.400> up<00:00:17.640> and

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
had a lot of these guys swear up and

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.070 
had a lot of these guys swear up and
down<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.119> shipping<00:00:18.270> on<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> clutch<00:00:18.720> would<00:00:18.930> just

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
down and shipping on a clutch would just

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.769 
down and shipping on a clutch would just
destroy<00:00:19.230> your<00:00:19.560> transmission<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.660> the<00:00:21.660> only

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
destroy your transmission and the only

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.870 
destroy your transmission and the only
reason<00:00:21.990> racers<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.859> because<00:00:23.279> they<00:00:23.789> don't

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
reason racers do is because they don't

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.429 
reason racers do is because they don't
give<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> damn<00:00:24.180> they're<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> race<00:00:24.869> bike<00:00:25.140> it's

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
give a damn they're on a race bike it's

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.200 
give a damn they're on a race bike it's
going<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.680> be<00:00:25.800> gone<00:00:26.430> anyway<00:00:26.789> they're<00:00:27.119> gonna

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
going to be gone anyway they're gonna

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.779 
going to be gone anyway they're gonna
rebuild<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.720> every<00:00:27.930> race<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.500> tried<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.609> tell

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
rebuild it every race I tried to tell

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.810 
rebuild it every race I tried to tell
them<00:00:30.260> that's<00:00:31.260> actually<00:00:31.650> how<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.890> works<00:00:32.070> but

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
them that's actually how it works but

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.850 
them that's actually how it works but
maybe<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.809> lot<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.110> don't<00:00:34.230> really<00:00:34.530> get<00:00:34.680> it

little<00:00:37.649> bit<00:00:37.829> why<00:00:38.760> well<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.390> can<00:00:39.540> upshift

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
little bit why well you can upshift

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.530 
little bit why well you can upshift
without<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> clutch<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> motorbike

it's literally the exact same thing I've
been<00:02:57.640> doing<00:02:57.790> on<00:02:58.150> this<00:02:58.330> bike<00:02:58.599> since<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:59.080> got<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.530> I

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
been doing on this bike since I got it I

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.000 
been doing on this bike since I got it I
got<00:02:59.709> this<00:02:59.980> blanket<00:03:00.220> had<00:03:00.550> I<00:03:00.910> think<00:03:02.010> 15,000

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
got this blanket had I think 15,000

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.650 
got this blanket had I think 15,000
miles<00:03:03.190> on<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.510> it's<00:03:04.510> not<00:03:04.830> 33,000<00:03:05.830> now<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:07.390> I<00:03:07.569> do

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
miles on it it's not 33,000 now and I do

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.790 
miles on it it's not 33,000 now and I do
that<00:03:07.959> all<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.110> time<00:03:10.080> inspired<00:03:11.080> whenever<00:03:11.620> you

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
that all the time inspired whenever you

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.259 
that all the time inspired whenever you
shift<00:03:12.130> on<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.310> wheelie<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.730> don't<00:03:13.000> use<00:03:13.150> the

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
shift on a wheelie you don't use the

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:20.570 
shift on a wheelie you don't use the
question<00:03:13.660> at<00:03:13.720> all<00:03:14.160> it's<00:03:15.160> kind<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.459> let<00:03:15.580> off

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.650 

it's<00:03:21.580> not<00:03:21.730> going<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:21.970> hurt<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.390> really

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
it's not going to hurt it it really

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.520 
it's not going to hurt it it really
won't<00:03:23.879> downshifting<00:03:24.879> I<00:03:25.290> think<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.410> only

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
won't downshifting I think the only

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.570 
won't downshifting I think the only
reason<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:26.950> don't<00:03:27.069> want<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.310> do<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.459> now

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
reason you don't want to do it now

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.610 
reason you don't want to do it now
shipping<00:03:27.819> is<00:03:28.090> way<00:03:28.330> too<00:03:28.390> hard<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:28.930> find<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.500> when

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
shipping is way too hard to find it when

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.229 
shipping is way too hard to find it when
you're<00:03:29.739> down<00:03:29.890> shifting<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:30.640> know<00:03:30.760> as<00:03:31.180> you

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
you're down shifting is you know as you

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.449 
you're down shifting is you know as you
let<00:03:31.510> off<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.750> throttle<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:33.160> put

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
let off the throttle and you put

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.890 
let off the throttle and you put
pressure<00:03:33.760> when<00:03:34.150> you're<00:03:34.239> hung<00:03:34.420> shifting<00:03:34.840> you

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
pressure when you're hung shifting you

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.509 
pressure when you're hung shifting you
know<00:03:35.019> that's<00:03:35.170> where<00:03:35.319> I<00:03:35.349> don't<00:03:35.410> like<00:03:36.069> pressures

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
know that's where I don't like pressures

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.190 
know that's where I don't like pressures
I<00:03:36.670> love<00:03:36.849> the<00:03:37.000> problem<00:03:37.390> it<00:03:37.510> just<00:03:37.540> like<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.900> shift

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
I love the problem it just like it shift

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.289 
I love the problem it just like it shift
until<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:38.620> get<00:03:38.769> more<00:03:38.890> reflection<00:03:39.430> like<00:03:39.610> go<00:03:40.090> down

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
until I get more reflection like go down

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.920 
until I get more reflection like go down
one<00:03:40.510> Bob<00:03:41.260> with<00:03:41.500> my<00:03:41.620> pressure<00:03:41.920> on<00:03:42.130> it<00:03:42.810> there's<00:03:43.810> I

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
one Bob with my pressure on it there's I

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.040 
one Bob with my pressure on it there's I
let<00:03:44.110> off<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.530> shift<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:44.890> on<00:03:45.010> its<00:03:45.130> own

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
let off and shift it on its own

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.320 
let off and shift it on its own
and<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.710> rpm<00:03:47.310> matching<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.910> know<00:03:48.030> really

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
and that rpm matching you know really

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.550 
and that rpm matching you know really
quick<00:03:49.310> some<00:03:50.310> part<00:03:50.580> of<00:03:50.610> what<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.850> is

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
quick some part of what it is

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.770 
quick some part of what it is
the<00:03:52.430> pressure<00:03:52.700> let's<00:03:53.120> listen<00:03:53.569> to<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.750> next

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
the pressure let's listen to the next

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.839 
the pressure let's listen to the next
one<00:03:54.230> in<00:03:54.349> the<00:03:54.410> RFA<00:03:54.739> look<00:03:54.920> at<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.160> exact<00:03:55.430> right

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
one in the RFA look at the exact right

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.089 
one in the RFA look at the exact right
spot<00:03:55.910> because<00:03:56.569> you<00:03:57.200> read<00:03:57.349> pressure<00:03:57.650> on<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:57.980> out

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
spot because you read pressure on it out

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.699 
spot because you read pressure on it out
that<00:03:58.280> was<00:03:58.370> falling<00:03:58.780> you<00:03:59.780> can<00:03:59.930> do<00:04:00.020> it<00:04:00.140> fast<00:04:00.440> like

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
that was falling you can do it fast like

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.250 
that was falling you can do it fast like
doing<00:04:01.370> your<00:04:01.489> door<00:04:01.610> hole<00:04:01.849> in<00:04:01.970> ass<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.510> you<00:04:03.140> know

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
doing your door hole in ass and you know

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.800 
doing your door hole in ass and you know
it<00:04:03.830> doesn't<00:04:04.040> your<00:04:04.489> pop<00:04:04.910> anything<00:04:05.239> you<00:04:05.569> know<00:04:05.660> it

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
it doesn't your pop anything you know it

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.270 
it doesn't your pop anything you know it
just<00:04:05.989> slips<00:04:06.319> right<00:04:06.410> in<00:04:06.680> just<00:04:06.800> like<00:04:06.980> as<00:04:07.069> if<00:04:07.099> you

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
just slips right in just like as if you

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.620 
just slips right in just like as if you
were<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.459> pull<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.790> clutch<00:04:07.970> sled<00:04:08.269> in<00:04:08.390> and<00:04:08.540> out

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
were to pull the clutch sled in and out

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.610 
were to pull the clutch sled in and out
sometimes<00:04:09.050> it's<00:04:09.200> actually<00:04:09.440> a<00:04:09.470> little

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
sometimes it's actually a little

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.170 
sometimes it's actually a little
