00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.730
 Well, as you just saw today 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.330
 we'll talk about parkour well we're here 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.919
 in Seoul with 0-0 very well tell me what is 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.840
 parkour good parkour is a 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.029
 discipline that originates does some 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.519
 years around 90 in 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.740
 neighborhood called li 6 in france this 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.240
 discipline arises based on the method 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.030
 natural that is a type of training 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.640
 that the French militia was given 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.339
 focused on creating strong bodies and 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.850
 useful is the set of 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.850
 psychology 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.399
 and last and be strong and be useful this was 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.530
 so that to build strong bodies for 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.359
 be able to move in rural environments to 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.309
 to be able to carry out daily tasks 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.219
 of the militia in these types of environments 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.750
 now not of these military 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.479
 reimond he teaches his son this guy 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.430
 of discipline David Bell and he decides 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.799
 adapt it to a more urban environment 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.810
 that's where discipline arises as 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.039
 as we know it as parkour this 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.619
 is a block loop a word that 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:12.259
 means travel 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.090
 trace route etcetera to practitioners 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.149
 we are called three euros those that 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.679
 we trace or make our own route 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.479
 this good basically this is a 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.550
 discipline that focuses on bringing the 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.619
 human body to the maximum expression like this 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.270
 how to overcome this physical problems and 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.030
 mental problems you may have from is very 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.440
 I'm scared and not just in this guy 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.690
 of aspects but also in the aspect 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.090
 school work is like ok if you can 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.030
 jump this a distance of three meters 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.340
 of a milestone because not if I start 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.929
 study as well as train to overcome my 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.569
 qualifications or get a scholarship 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.459
 even really this is something that you 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.470
 help in general with your life parkour 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.700
 is a way of life actively is a 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.759
 lifestyle that many of us carry 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.420
 because it's not just helping you 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.940
 be strong and be useful but to last better 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.290
 this as a physicist and be a better 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.540
 person because 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.420
 much this concept of fraternity that is 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.400
 help the one who is starting or ask him 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.929
 help the one who goes a little bit more 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.900
 advanced that I understand better the 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.160
 movements the knowledge this then 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.410
 this applies everywhere either 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.330
 call yourself family companions of school of 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.940
 work really is a way of life a 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.820
 Once you start it is very difficult to leave it 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.290
 it was what made you practice state not 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.180
 I lived a movie called llama 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.530
 almost the children of the creators of this 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.990
 good discipline the group of 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.850
 creators and in high school I met 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.670
 a friend who got me into all this roll 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.890
 I already practiced from before 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.040
 what would you recommend to young people who 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.440
 they want to start this discipline or not 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.260
 they know where to go 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.120
 Well, look, many people think it 's 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.670
 more than anything to watch videos and get oriented 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.790
 with this kind of thing but I think that 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.500
 The safe and effective way to practice 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.560
 this type of discipline is going to 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.220
 professional groups or groups that already 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.690
 have experience behind because then 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.550
 just the majority of the lessons 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.650
 they lend themselves by not knowing a movement or 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.440
 see it but not really understand which 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.660
 are the physical needs and 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.210
 physiological within it 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.870
 movement I understand that you have 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.580
 a group and the classes you could not give us 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.090
 reports on all this for the kids 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.830
 who want to start in this discipline 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.380
 That's right, look, I belong to a group 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.870
 called byrs is an acronym for group of 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.060
 high performance specialists 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.790
 we bring this the instructors 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.900
 around between 6 and 10 years of 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.909
 training each 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.709
 we are training Saturdays and 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.750
 Sundays at 10 o'clock in the morning 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.319
 tlalpan forest entrance and good the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.879
 only requirement that we have is this 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.310
 the class has a donation cost of 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.840
 60 pesos and that they wear comfortable clothes and 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.269
 tennis preference to run for 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.209
 avoid injuries like we can 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:01.390
 locate or locate the group then look 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:05.079
 we are on the dot page scripts net 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.450
 just like it's on my shirt to go to that 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.689
 dot net there are the leagues of the 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.280
 pages of facebook twitter google plus 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.980
 etcetera normally on google + is where 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.769
 where we publish everything related to 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.699
 schedule classes etc and doubts in Rome 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.259
 start and when you start like this in 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.419
 most of the social networks that 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.550
 we handle are the telephones or mailboxes 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.259
 of the instructors' contact 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.080
 parkour can be brought to a mode 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.759
 professional or there is a professional league 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.940
 good we have the afp efe that is the 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:40.360
 World Federation of Parkour and Ferney 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.480
 in this federation still a scope 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.660
 professional you can take but they are 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.790
 very select athletes now thomas local 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.440
 Mexico is practically quite possible 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.780
 this bring the discipline that 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.030
 we practice the professional field either 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.940
 as a double action for filming 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.950
 commercials etcetera because parkour 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.110
 includes good we try at least in the 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.610
 group of gears to include not only what 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.960
 it's the parkour and free running but all 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.870
 the disciplines that we can cover 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.600
 call yourself this kung fu in martial arts 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.370
 in general scenic arts etc and which 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.280
 are the dangers of practicing this 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.570
 discipline then look at the risk as in 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.120
 any physical activity that 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.410
 practice is dormant or even go 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.720
 walking down the street you can 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.580
 cause a serious injury being 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.040
 a beginner just starting with the 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.780
 discipline I'm not going to jump out of 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.910
 building building nothing else because if 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.970
 bad here the hormone or the idea is 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.250
 practice measuring distance and practice 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.190
 a thousand times ten thousand times the same jump 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.800
 until you have the strength and security of 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.180
 that I will receive well each one of 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.970
 these jumps 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.590
 very heavy training routine but 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.080
 that gives good fruits and the truth is worth 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.820
 very much worth some advice that you 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.870
 you would give to the parkour community 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:59.180
 and practice safe and well go be 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.710
 Attentive to our page if you want 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.010
 start with professional practices 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.600
 even good kids already know what to do 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.510
 to practice parkour here they 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.969
 we will leave the league and all the data for 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.039
 contact this group geers 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:15.699
 then all for this occasion and we 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.699
 we see until the next
