 teaching food a box of food I have 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.059
 thought that I'm going to make these videos more 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.970

 Japanese japan are that it is a store 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.520

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.820

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.890
 Japan has sent me a box with some 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.320

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.079

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.469
 The shipping of the store is always stress 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.780
 and they say that in 24 hours you have it in 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.539
 house but is that in my case they were less 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.510
 of 24 hours the incredible thing about this is that 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:01.390

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.490
 because in England they do not have them 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.120

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.069
