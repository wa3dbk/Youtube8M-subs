here<00:00:04.319> I'm<00:00:04.440> going<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.650> be<00:00:04.710> talking<00:00:05.009> about

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
here I'm going to be talking about

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.670 
here I'm going to be talking about
photoshop's<00:00:05.700> color<00:00:06.000> modes<00:00:06.270> listed<00:00:07.259> here

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
photoshop's color modes listed here

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.620 
photoshop's color modes listed here
under<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.189> mode<00:00:08.370> flyout<00:00:08.849> menu<00:00:09.150> under<00:00:09.510> the

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
under the mode flyout menu under the

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.690 
under the mode flyout menu under the
image<00:00:10.019> menu<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.559> we're<00:00:11.040> going<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.190> start<00:00:11.490> off

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
image menu and we're going to start off

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.910 
image menu and we're going to start off
with<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.150> discussion<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.900> additive<00:00:13.650> and

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
with a discussion of additive and

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.099 
with a discussion of additive and
subtractive<00:00:14.240> color<00:00:15.240> now<00:00:15.540> here's<00:00:15.839> an

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
subtractive color now here's an

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.859 
subtractive color now here's an
interesting<00:00:16.279> trick<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.789> can<00:00:18.000> use<00:00:18.480> to

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
interesting trick that we can use to

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.290 
interesting trick that we can use to
really<00:00:19.050> sort<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.410> understand<00:00:20.130> how<00:00:20.310> additive

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
really sort of understand how additive

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.240 
really sort of understand how additive
and<00:00:21.510> subtractive<00:00:21.710> color<00:00:22.710> work

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
and subtractive color work

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.589 
and subtractive color work
so<00:00:23.970> by<00:00:24.150> additive<00:00:24.689> I'm<00:00:24.990> talking<00:00:25.439> about<00:00:25.820> RGB<00:00:26.820> red

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
so by additive I'm talking about RGB red

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.370 
so by additive I'm talking about RGB red
green<00:00:27.660> blue<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.740> color<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.310> light<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.199> here<00:00:31.199> I

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
green blue the color of light and here I

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.120 
green blue the color of light and here I
have<00:00:32.309> three<00:00:33.090> shape<00:00:33.480> layers<00:00:33.750> one<00:00:34.440> red<00:00:34.680> circle

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
have three shape layers one red circle

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.330 
have three shape layers one red circle
one<00:00:35.280> green<00:00:35.579> circle<00:00:36.000> one<00:00:36.270> blue<00:00:36.600> circle<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:38.010> I

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
one green circle one blue circle if I

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.430 
one green circle one blue circle if I
change<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.120> blending<00:00:39.480> mode<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.899> these

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
change the blending mode of these

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.760 
change the blending mode of these
different<00:00:41.070> layers<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.960> lighten<00:00:42.960> which

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
different layers to lighten which

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.010 
different layers to lighten which
simulates<00:00:44.460> how<00:00:45.149> they<00:00:45.390> would<00:00:45.539> work<00:00:45.719> with

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
simulates how they would work with

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.790 
simulates how they would work with
lights<00:00:46.320> adding<00:00:47.309> one<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.660> next<00:00:51.649> I'll<00:00:52.649> do

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
lights adding one to the next I'll do

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.279 
lights adding one to the next I'll do
that<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.100> both<00:00:53.129> then<00:00:54.030> where<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.930> colors

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
that for both then where the colors

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.229 
that for both then where the colors
overlap<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> different<00:00:56.370> primaries<00:00:56.910> red

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
overlap with the different primaries red

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.470 
overlap with the different primaries red
green<00:00:57.480> blue<00:00:57.690> overlap<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.890> get<00:00:59.160> our

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
green blue overlap we get our

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.560 
green blue overlap we get our
subtractive<00:01:00.480> primaries<00:01:01.370> cyan<00:01:02.370> magenta<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
subtractive primaries cyan magenta and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.950 
subtractive primaries cyan magenta and
yellow<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> point<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.090> want<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.390> make<00:01:06.570> here

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
yellow so the point I want to make here

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.429 
yellow so the point I want to make here
is<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.700> as<00:01:08.720> subtractive<00:01:09.720> primaries<00:01:10.229> which

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
is that as subtractive primaries which

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.080 
is that as subtractive primaries which
are<00:01:10.650> used<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.990> CMYK<00:01:12.990> color<00:01:13.860> mode<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.430> in

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
are used in the CMYK color mode are in

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.679 
are used in the CMYK color mode are in
many<00:01:15.720> ways<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.320> converse<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.369> our<00:01:17.880> additive

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
many ways the converse of our additive

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.440 
many ways the converse of our additive
primaries<00:01:19.259> where<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.189> cyan<00:01:20.820> magenta<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
primaries where as cyan magenta and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.649 
primaries where as cyan magenta and
yellow<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:22.710> more<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.189> add<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:24.150> darker

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
yellow the more you add the darker

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.320 
yellow the more you add the darker
things<00:01:24.869> get<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.530> red<00:01:25.860> green<00:01:26.159> blue<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:27.030> more

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
things get with red green blue the more

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.450 
things get with red green blue the more
you<00:01:27.540> add<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.810> lighter<00:01:28.560> things<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.250> which<00:01:29.430> is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
you add the lighter things get which is

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.550 
you add the lighter things get which is
why<00:01:29.759> we're<00:01:30.150> all<00:01:30.360> three<00:01:30.750> primary<00:01:31.200> colors

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
why we're all three primary colors

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.700 
why we're all three primary colors
overlap<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.490> middle<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.240> white<00:01:33.710> now

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
overlap in the middle we have white now

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.620 
overlap in the middle we have white now
here's<00:01:34.920> something<00:01:35.130> interesting<00:01:35.420> look<00:01:36.420> what

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
here's something interesting look what

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.499 
here's something interesting look what
happens<00:01:37.049> when<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.740> invert<00:01:38.490> all<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.820> values<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
happens when I invert all the values and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.140 
happens when I invert all the values and
I'm<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.079> by<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.470> adding<00:01:40.619> an

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
I'm going to do that by just adding an

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.090 
I'm going to do that by just adding an
invert<00:01:42.150> adjustment<00:01:42.360> layer<00:01:43.020> above<00:01:43.500> all<00:01:43.829> of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
invert adjustment layer above all of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.660 
invert adjustment layer above all of
these<00:01:44.250> layers<00:01:45.439> look<00:01:46.439> at<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.740> we<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
these layers look at that we have the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.450 
these layers look at that we have the
complete<00:01:48.180> opposite<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.840> red<00:01:49.259> green<00:01:49.560> blue<00:01:49.799> we

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
complete opposite of red green blue we

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.450 
complete opposite of red green blue we
have<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.970> see<00:01:51.329> my<00:01:51.829> subtractive<00:01:52.829> color<00:01:53.100> model

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
have the see my subtractive color model

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.999 
have the see my subtractive color model
where<00:01:54.090> cyan<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.600> magenta<00:01:54.750> overlap<00:01:55.649> we<00:01:55.829> have

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
where cyan and magenta overlap we have

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.010 
where cyan and magenta overlap we have
blue<00:01:56.250> magenta<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.119> yellow<00:01:57.210> we<00:01:57.570> have<00:01:57.600> red

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
blue magenta and yellow we have red

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.249 
blue magenta and yellow we have red
yellow<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:58.890> cyan<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.939> green<00:02:00.270> because

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
yellow and cyan we have green because

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.490 
yellow and cyan we have green because
this<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> subtractive<00:02:02.520> color<00:02:02.850> model<00:02:03.240> as<00:02:03.500> we

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
this is a subtractive color model as we

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.370 
this is a subtractive color model as we
add<00:02:04.680> more<00:02:04.820> things<00:02:05.820> get<00:02:06.090> darker<00:02:06.600> which<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.170> why

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
add more things get darker which is why

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.080 
add more things get darker which is why
where<00:02:08.160> they<00:02:08.310> overlap

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
where they overlap

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.410 
where they overlap
we<00:02:09.270> have<00:02:09.479> black<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:10.470> practice<00:02:11.220> with<00:02:11.940> offset

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
we have black in practice with offset

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.730 
we have black in practice with offset
printing<00:02:12.870> because<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.319> ink

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
printing because of ink

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.530 
printing because of ink
pure<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.520> don't<00:02:14.700> get<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.910> black<00:02:15.210> but<00:02:15.450> you

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
pure it is you don't get a black but you

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.260 
pure it is you don't get a black but you
get<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> muddy<00:02:16.050> brown<00:02:16.290> which<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:16.950> why<00:02:17.190> we<00:02:17.790> have<00:02:18.030> a

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
get a muddy brown which is why we have a

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.110 
get a muddy brown which is why we have a
fourth<00:02:18.720> color<00:02:19.110> channel<00:02:19.560> which<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.490> black

fourth color channel which is the black
which<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.600> our<00:02:21.780> key<00:02:22.110> channel<00:02:22.470> some<00:02:23.220> people<00:02:23.550> say

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
which is our key channel some people say

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.090 
which is our key channel some people say
that<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.090> K<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.660> used<00:02:25.020> for<00:02:25.230> black<00:02:25.470> because<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
that the K is used for black because the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.850 
that the K is used for black because the
B<00:02:26.280> was<00:02:26.520> already<00:02:26.850> taken<00:02:27.240> for<00:02:28.080> blue<00:02:28.320> but<00:02:28.650> that's

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
B was already taken for blue but that's

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.180 
B was already taken for blue but that's
not<00:02:29.100> actually<00:02:29.340> true<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.540> K<00:02:30.840> stands<00:02:31.290> for<00:02:31.440> key

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
not actually true the K stands for key

not actually true the K stands for key
your<00:02:32.640> key<00:02:32.910> color<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.480> color<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.960> gives

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
your key color it's the color that gives

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.790 
your key color it's the color that gives
you<00:02:34.260> contrast<00:02:34.890> in<00:02:35.220> your<00:02:35.280> CMYK<00:02:36.090> images<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.680> in
