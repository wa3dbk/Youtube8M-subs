 the top 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.050
 This is very useful for example when we print cards or cards that 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.260
 complete the route can be bent and leaving this side not 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.180

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.519
 of 250 sheets 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.819
 and in these it is convenient to place the paper that we will use frequently as 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.719
 house size a4 when closing this tray we have on its left an indicator of 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.689
