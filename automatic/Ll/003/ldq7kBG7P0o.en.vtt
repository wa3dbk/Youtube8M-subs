over<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.030> driver<00:00:51.270> side<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:52.160> this<00:00:53.160> kind

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
over in the driver side here this kind

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.819 
over in the driver side here this kind
of<00:00:53.550> area<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.600> general<00:00:55.379> areas<00:00:55.710> I

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
of area here is in this general areas I

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.310 
of area here is in this general areas I
have<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.930> four<00:00:57.930> vent<00:00:58.230> lines<00:00:58.440> come<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.070> it

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
have a four vent lines come on in it

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.039 
have a four vent lines come on in it
yeah<00:01:01.370> so<00:01:02.370> most<00:01:02.910> people<00:01:03.149> don't<00:01:03.329> really<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
yeah so most people don't really like to

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
yeah so most people don't really like to
use<00:01:04.260> those<00:01:04.500> unless<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.189> restoration

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
use those unless it's a restoration

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.469 
use those unless it's a restoration
because<00:01:07.220> more<00:01:08.220> complicated<00:01:09.000> than<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.270> needs

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
because more complicated than it needs

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.070 
because more complicated than it needs
to<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.810> there's<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.710> sending<00:01:11.640> unit<00:01:12.080> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
to be there's the sending unit the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.770 
to be there's the sending unit the
output<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.820> output<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.000> tank<00:01:15.299> there<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
output to output the tank there and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.390 
output to output the tank there and
that's<00:01:15.930> course<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.619> go<00:01:16.799> directly<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
that's course can go directly in the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.149 
that's course can go directly in the
garbage<00:01:17.790> all<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.630> because<00:01:18.979> I've<00:01:19.979> never

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
garbage all this is because I've never

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.160 
garbage all this is because I've never
had<00:01:20.400> any<00:01:20.610> good<00:01:20.700> luck<00:01:20.880> getting<00:01:21.720> these<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.990> work

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
had any good luck getting these to work

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.920 
had any good luck getting these to work
again<00:01:22.650> once<00:01:23.610> they've<00:01:23.880> sat<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.390> rested<00:01:24.810> up

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
again once they've sat and rested up

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.929 
again once they've sat and rested up
like<00:01:25.170> that

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
like that

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.300 
like that
and<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.210> actually<00:01:27.420> managed<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> save<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.310> tarp

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
and I actually managed to save the tarp

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.740 
and I actually managed to save the tarp
board<00:01:29.549> insulation<00:01:29.850> off<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.450> top<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.720> that

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
board insulation off the top of that

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.359 
board insulation off the top of that
tank<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.200> was<00:01:31.439> amazing<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:31.920> leads<00:01:32.130> me<00:01:32.340> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
tank that was amazing that leads me to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.340 
tank that was amazing that leads me to
