athletes<00:00:29.640> application<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.420> force<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.230> know

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
athletes application of force and I know

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.020 
athletes application of force and I know
that<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> use<00:00:31.860> the<00:00:31.980> Olympic<00:00:32.250> lifting<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:32.880> this

that I use the Olympic lifting for this
in<00:00:33.240> my<00:00:33.390> workouts<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.020> trying<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:34.470> a<00:00:34.500> faster

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
in my workouts and trying to be a faster

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.920 
in my workouts and trying to be a faster
more<00:00:35.100> powerful<00:00:35.160> athlete<00:00:35.670> one<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> things

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
more powerful athlete one of the things

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.500 
more powerful athlete one of the things
I<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.620> know<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.310> that<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.760> everyone<00:00:39.180> can

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
I like is I know is that if everyone can

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.210 
I like is I know is that if everyone can
do<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.780> Olympic<00:00:40.080> lifts<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> some<00:00:40.650> extent<00:00:41.040> and

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
do the Olympic lifts to some extent and

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.650 
do the Olympic lifts to some extent and
what<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.370> mean<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.000> do<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> snatch<00:00:42.390> pull

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
what I mean is you can do a snatch pull

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.970 
what I mean is you can do a snatch pull
if<00:00:43.080> you<00:00:43.170> don't<00:00:43.320> have<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> shoulder<00:00:43.830> mobility

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
if you don't have the shoulder mobility

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.220 
if you don't have the shoulder mobility
or<00:00:44.430> anything<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.820> catch<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> weight<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
or anything to catch the weight as a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.080 
or anything to catch the weight as a
strength<00:00:46.680> athlete<00:00:47.100> not<00:00:47.309> competing<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
strength athlete not competing for a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
strength athlete not competing for a
total<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.629> weight<00:00:48.809> lifting<00:00:49.200> that's<00:00:49.860> going<00:00:50.070> to

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
total and weight lifting that's going to

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.920 
total and weight lifting that's going to
get<00:00:50.370> extension<00:00:51.180> through<00:00:51.330> the<00:00:51.390> body<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
get extension through the body and

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.840 
get extension through the body and
timing<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.620> being<00:00:52.890> able<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.160> pull<00:00:53.460> weight

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
timing and being able to pull weight

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.180 
timing and being able to pull weight
faster<00:00:54.450> and<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.140> Diane's<00:00:55.620> gonna<00:00:55.710> work<00:00:55.980> with<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
faster and so Diane's gonna work with a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.340 
faster and so Diane's gonna work with a
little<00:00:56.430> bit<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.790> and<00:00:56.970> how<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.629> can

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
little bit on that and how you can

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.350 
little bit on that and how you can
implement<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.920> into<00:00:59.250> your<00:00:59.400> training<00:00:59.699> safely

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
implement that into your training safely

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.899 
implement that into your training safely
and<00:01:00.540> do<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.839> right<00:01:00.960> way

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
and do it the right way

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.369

extension<00:01:09.870> that<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.140> were<00:01:10.260> talking<00:01:10.650> about

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
extension that we were talking about

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.320 
extension that we were talking about
with<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> weight<00:01:11.610> being<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.880> little<00:01:12.090> bit<00:01:12.210> more

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
with the weight being a little bit more

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.719 
with the weight being a little bit more
mid-foot<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:14.010> already<00:01:14.250> discussed<00:01:14.640> this

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
mid-foot and we already discussed this

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.340 
mid-foot and we already discussed this
platform's<00:01:15.210> angled<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.720> little<00:01:15.900> bit<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.200> you're

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
platform's angled a little bit so you're

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.020 
platform's angled a little bit so you're
gonna<00:01:16.470> feel<00:01:16.800> a<00:01:16.830> little<00:01:17.100> bit<00:01:17.280> more<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.790> than

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
gonna feel a little bit more for than

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.670 
gonna feel a little bit more for than
what's<00:01:18.180> actually<00:01:18.330> comfortable<00:01:18.690> but<00:01:19.470> all<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
think about driving straight up

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.020 
think about driving straight up
accelerating<00:01:34.770> once<00:01:35.220> you're<00:01:35.460> past<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.880> knees

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
accelerating once you're past the knees

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.300 
accelerating once you're past the knees
into<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> hips<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.990> then<00:01:37.590> continue<00:01:38.160> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
into the hips and then continue to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.040 
into the hips and then continue to
connect<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.180> push<00:01:39.390> through<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.660> fourth<00:01:39.900> of

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
connect and push through the fourth of

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.850 
connect and push through the fourth of
the<00:01:40.110> balls<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.410> your<00:01:40.530> feet

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.220

about reaching your chest towards the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.500 
about reaching your chest towards the
ceiling<00:01:51.860> instead<00:01:52.430> of<00:01:52.520> leaning<00:01:52.790> back<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.420> out

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
ceiling instead of leaning back and out
