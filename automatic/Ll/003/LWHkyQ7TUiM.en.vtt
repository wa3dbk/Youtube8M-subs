00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.679 
forever to put together but she can't
step<00:01:47.009> away<00:01:47.040> for<00:01:47.369> more<00:01:47.790> than<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> few<00:01:48.210> seconds

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
step away for more than a few seconds

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.410 
step away for more than a few seconds
it's<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.500> bit<00:01:49.590> more<00:01:49.710> work<00:01:49.979> than<00:01:50.399> me<00:01:50.850> just

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it's a little bit more work than me just

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.840 
it's a little bit more work than me just
taking<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.110> regular<00:01:52.439> bottle<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.250> holding<00:01:53.670> her

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
taking a regular bottle and holding her

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.810 
taking a regular bottle and holding her
and<00:01:54.119> feeding<00:01:54.360> her<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.310> I<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.640> probably

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and feeding her and I think I probably

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.200 
and feeding her and I think I probably
wouldn't<00:01:57.450> use<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.530> until<00:01:59.100> she<00:01:59.280> was<00:01:59.399> much

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
wouldn't use this until she was much

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.330 
wouldn't use this until she was much
older<00:02:00.390> when<00:02:00.960> Elena<00:02:01.259> gets<00:02:01.530> her<00:02:01.649> other<00:02:01.829> bottle

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
older when Elena gets her other bottle

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.240 
older when Elena gets her other bottle
back<00:02:02.520> she<00:02:02.820> sucks<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.360> down<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.869> seconds<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
back she sucks it down in seconds so the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.779 
back she sucks it down in seconds so the
