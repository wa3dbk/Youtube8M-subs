00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
that means is we're not going to use the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.870 
that means is we're not going to use the
plectrum<00:01:16.200> today<00:01:16.680> we're<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.520> use<00:01:17.549> some

okay<00:03:41.620> very<00:03:41.830> good<00:03:42.370> now<00:03:42.640> once<00:03:42.880> you've<00:03:43.060> done<00:03:43.300> that

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
okay very good now once you've done that

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.300 
okay very good now once you've done that
I<00:03:43.750> want<00:03:43.930> you<00:03:44.050> to<00:03:44.110> go<00:03:44.320> back<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.740> the<00:03:44.860> second

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
I want you to go back to the second

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.480 
I want you to go back to the second
string<00:03:45.580> with<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.000> middle<00:03:46.270> finger<00:03:46.770> and<00:03:47.770> then

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
string with the middle finger and then

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.750 
string with the middle finger and then
the<00:03:48.640> third<00:03:48.880> string<00:03:49.300> with<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.810> first<00:03:49.840> finger

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
the third string with the first finger

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.550 
the third string with the first finger
so<00:03:51.760> if<00:03:52.030> we<00:03:52.180> join<00:03:52.390> those<00:03:52.600> notes<00:03:52.900> on<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.230> end<00:03:53.350> it

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
so if we join those notes on the end it

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.440 
so if we join those notes on the end it
should<00:03:53.710> sound<00:03:53.920> like<00:03:54.100> this

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.300 

okay<00:03:59.450> now<00:03:59.870> what<00:04:00.049> happens<00:04:00.439> is<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:00.769> can<00:04:00.950> repeat

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
okay now what happens is you can repeat

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.160 
okay now what happens is you can repeat
that<00:04:01.489> over<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:02.030> over<00:04:02.180> again<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.810> it<00:04:02.930> joins

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
that over and over again and it joins

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:13.660 
that over and over again and it joins
together<00:04:03.469> perfectly<00:04:04.189> like<00:04:04.430> this

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.949 

okay<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.909> you<00:04:14.970> can<00:04:15.000> see<00:04:15.330> that<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.599> sounds

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
okay and you can see that that sounds

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.710 
okay and you can see that that sounds
really<00:04:16.320> nice<00:04:16.500> now<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.190> suggest<00:04:17.579> you<00:04:17.940> can<00:04:18.209> change

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
really nice now I suggest you can change

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.140 
really nice now I suggest you can change
their<00:04:18.989> different<00:04:19.320> cords<00:04:19.709> for<00:04:20.579> example<00:04:20.970> if<00:04:21.060> we

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
their different cords for example if we

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.820 
their different cords for example if we
went<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.449> the<00:04:21.570> G<00:04:21.750> chord<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.350> of<00:04:22.500> course<00:04:22.680> you

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
went to the G chord and of course you

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.320 
went to the G chord and of course you
already<00:04:23.070> know<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.400> G<00:04:23.550> chord<00:04:23.790> because<00:04:24.030> we

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
already know the G chord because we

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.370 
already know the G chord because we
learned<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:24.690> in<00:04:24.870> one<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.169> previous

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
learned that in one of the previous

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.879 
learned that in one of the previous
segments<00:04:26.100> but<00:04:26.850> just<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.240> refresh<00:04:27.570> your<00:04:27.810> memory

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
segments but just to refresh your memory

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.050 
segments but just to refresh your memory

on the second string at fret three
little<00:04:37.199> finger<00:04:37.560> on<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.830> first<00:04:38.040> string<00:04:38.130> of

little finger on the first string of
fret<00:04:38.669> 3<00:04:38.880> okay<00:04:39.510> you<00:04:39.870> can<00:04:40.050> pause<00:04:40.199> the<00:04:40.380> video<00:04:40.500> if

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
fret 3 okay you can pause the video if

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.680 
fret 3 okay you can pause the video if
you<00:04:40.860> just<00:04:41.070> need<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.400> check<00:04:41.610> that<00:04:41.850> now<00:04:42.389> what's

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
you just need to check that now what's

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.750 
you just need to check that now what's
going<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:42.930> happen<00:04:43.350> is<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:44.010> thumb<00:04:44.370> is<00:04:44.610> now

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
going to happen is the thumb is now

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.460 
going to happen is the thumb is now
going<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.030> put<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.360> sixth<00:04:45.690> string<00:04:45.930> because

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
going to put the sixth string because

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.650 
going to put the sixth string because
the<00:04:46.979> sum<00:04:47.220> always<00:04:47.520> plucks<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.970> root<00:04:48.150> no<00:04:48.360> of<00:04:48.510> the

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
the sum always plucks a root no of the

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.750 
the sum always plucks a root no of the
chord<00:04:48.900> when<00:04:49.320> we<00:04:49.500> were<00:04:49.620> on<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.919> D<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.370> root<00:04:50.550> no

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
chord when we were on the D the root no

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.580 
chord when we were on the D the root no
was<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.419> fourth<00:04:51.660> string<00:04:51.930> but<00:04:52.169> now<00:04:52.320> we're<00:04:52.500> on

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
was the fourth string but now we're on

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.830 
was the fourth string but now we're on
the<00:04:52.710> G<00:04:52.949> the<00:04:53.550> root<00:04:53.760> note<00:04:53.970> is<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.330> sixth<00:04:54.600> string

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
the G the root note is the sixth string

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.140 
the G the root note is the sixth string
okay<00:04:55.320> I<00:04:55.350> hope<00:04:55.590> that<00:04:55.770> makes<00:04:55.979> sense<00:04:56.280> but<00:04:56.940> these

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
okay I hope that makes sense but these

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.760 
okay I hope that makes sense but these
three<00:04:57.419> fingers<00:04:57.660> are<00:04:58.020> still<00:04:58.289> going<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.620> be<00:04:58.740> on

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
three fingers are still going to be on

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.500 
three fingers are still going to be on
the<00:04:58.949> same<00:04:59.160> strings<00:04:59.520> as<00:04:59.699> before<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.300> third

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
the same strings as before the third

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.320 
the same strings as before the third
string<00:05:00.870> second<00:05:01.680> string<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:02.100> first<00:05:02.460> string<00:05:02.760> so

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
string second string and first string so

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.360 
string second string and first string so
when<00:05:03.570> we<00:05:03.720> apply<00:05:03.840> this<00:05:04.320> picking<00:05:04.710> pattern<00:05:05.070> it'll

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
when we apply this picking pattern it'll

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:12.420 
when we apply this picking pattern it'll
sound<00:05:05.520> like<00:05:05.639> this

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.660 

right<00:05:13.210> so<00:05:13.840> what<00:05:13.990> I<00:05:14.020> suggest<00:05:14.170> you<00:05:14.500> do<00:05:14.710> is<00:05:14.950> to<00:05:15.220> do

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
right so what I suggest you do is to do

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.760 
right so what I suggest you do is to do
that<00:05:15.820> picking<00:05:16.270> pattern<00:05:16.630> twice<00:05:16.870> on<00:05:17.140> the<00:05:17.260> D<00:05:17.440> and

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
that picking pattern twice on the D and

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.950 
that picking pattern twice on the D and
then<00:05:18.310> twice<00:05:18.610> on<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:18.910> G<00:05:19.090> so<00:05:19.570> it<00:05:19.630> should<00:05:19.810> sound

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
then twice on the G so it should sound

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:29.800 
then twice on the G so it should sound
like<00:05:20.140> this

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.410 

and<00:05:30.230> then<00:05:30.380> you<00:05:30.530> can<00:05:30.710> do<00:05:30.830> it<00:05:30.950> again

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.279 

you

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.679 

you

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:40.689 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:42.380 

Oh

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
Oh

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.990 
Oh
okay<00:05:43.290> I<00:05:43.320> think<00:05:43.770> you<00:05:43.830> get<00:05:44.040> the<00:05:44.130> idea<00:05:44.160> now<00:05:44.760> I

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
okay I think you get the idea now I

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.390 
okay I think you get the idea now I
suggest<00:05:45.420> you<00:05:45.720> practice<00:05:46.590> that<00:05:46.830> with<00:05:47.160> the<00:05:47.280> other

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
suggest you practice that with the other

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.100 
suggest you practice that with the other
cords<00:05:47.730> you<00:05:47.790> know<00:05:47.910> as<00:05:48.060> well<00:05:48.210> like<00:05:48.390> the<00:05:48.510> E<00:05:48.720> and

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
cords you know as well like the E and

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.500 
cords you know as well like the E and
the<00:05:49.530> a<00:05:49.710> and<00:05:50.280> if<00:05:50.640> you<00:05:50.730> go<00:05:50.850> on<00:05:50.970> the<00:05:51.090> archive

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
the a and if you go on the archive
