00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
was not running while off Craigslist I

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.810 
was not running while off Craigslist I
had<00:00:26.580> broken<00:00:26.849> timing<00:00:27.300> belt<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.349> got<00:00:29.310> really

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
had broken timing belt so I got really

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.210 
had broken timing belt so I got really
cheap<00:00:30.179> by<00:00:30.359> $500<00:00:31.230> and

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
cheap by $500 and

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.600 
cheap by $500 and
so<00:00:33.700> I'm<00:00:33.760> flipped<00:00:33.940> over<00:00:34.120> bound<00:00:34.420> on<00:00:34.600> it<00:00:34.630> and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
so I'm flipped over bound on it and

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.640 
so I'm flipped over bound on it and
since<00:00:36.610> that<00:00:36.790> time<00:00:36.850> I've<00:00:37.329> just<00:00:37.650> basically

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
since that time I've just basically

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.160 
since that time I've just basically
driven<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.160> wheels<00:00:39.370> off<00:00:39.610> of<00:00:39.850> it<00:00:40.000> get<00:00:40.989> this

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
driven the wheels off of it get this

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.580 
driven the wheels off of it get this
I've<00:00:41.530> driven<00:00:41.820> 40,000<00:00:42.820> miles<00:00:43.000> since<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:44.559> year

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
I've driven 40,000 miles since one year

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.869 
I've driven 40,000 miles since one year
ago<00:00:45.040> had<00:00:45.760> 179<00:00:46.629> thousand<00:00:47.140> miles<00:00:47.290> on<00:00:47.530> it<00:00:47.710> then<00:00:47.980> it

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
ago had 179 thousand miles on it then it

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.189 
ago had 179 thousand miles on it then it
has<00:00:49.120> just<00:00:49.690> over<00:00:50.489> 220,000<00:00:51.489> now<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.930> I<00:00:52.960> thought

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
has just over 220,000 now so I thought

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.210 
has just over 220,000 now so I thought
I'd<00:00:53.379> do<00:00:53.470> that<00:00:53.500> date<00:00:53.920> on<00:00:53.949> this<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:55.140> actually

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
I'd do that date on this and actually

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.710 
I'd do that date on this and actually
sad<00:00:57.220> to<00:00:57.370> say<00:00:57.519> this<00:00:57.790> was<00:00:57.940> probably<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.360> final

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
sad to say this was probably the final

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.500 
sad to say this was probably the final
act<00:00:58.900> on<00:00:59.290> this<00:00:59.470> car<00:00:59.769> I've<00:01:00.100> actually<00:01:00.510> bought

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
act on this car I've actually bought

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.700 
act on this car I've actually bought
myself<00:01:01.720> a<00:01:02.500> little<00:01:03.129> bit<00:01:03.220> newer<00:01:03.460> daily<00:01:03.820> driver

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
myself a little bit newer daily driver

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.670 
myself a little bit newer daily driver
should<00:01:05.710> have<00:01:05.890> hit<00:01:06.070> this<00:01:06.250> week<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.869> I'm<00:01:08.470> going

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
should have hit this week so I'm going

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
to put this one up for sale so I thought

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.609 
to put this one up for sale so I thought
we'd<00:01:11.740> take<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:11.920> look<00:01:12.190> at<00:01:12.369> it<00:01:12.520> before<00:01:12.759> it<00:01:13.060> goes<00:01:13.619> is

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
we'd take a look at it before it goes is

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
go through here pretty good bit so

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.779 
go through here pretty good bit so
that's<00:02:07.619> going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> continue<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:08.610> say

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
that's going to continue you can say

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.339 
that's going to continue you can say
where<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.060> kind<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.300> peeling<00:02:09.509> even<00:02:09.929> more<00:02:10.080> out

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
where it's kind of peeling even more out

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.960 
where it's kind of peeling even more out
here<00:02:10.379> that's<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:11.039> going<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.190> keep<00:02:11.370> keep

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
here that's just going to keep keep

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.009 
here that's just going to keep keep
happening<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.450> think<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.810> hood<00:02:12.989> is

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
happening I think this hood is

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.770 
happening I think this hood is
