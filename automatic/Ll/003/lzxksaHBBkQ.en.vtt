00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
share with you some of the really cool

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.890 
share with you some of the really cool
things<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:10.380> can<00:00:10.590> do<00:00:10.769> with<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:12.059> hand<00:00:12.300> sonic<00:00:12.660> 10

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
things you can do with the hand sonic 10

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.250 
things you can do with the hand sonic 10
first<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:14.009> quick<00:00:14.460> overview<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.969> some<00:00:15.599> basic

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
first a quick overview of some basic

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.439 
first a quick overview of some basic
things<00:00:16.740> about<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.980> hand<00:00:17.190> sonic<00:00:17.490> 10<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:18.180> pads

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
things about the hand sonic 10 the pads

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.060 
things about the hand sonic 10 the pads
understand<00:00:19.020> position<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:21.500> lay<00:00:22.500> my<00:00:22.650> left<00:00:22.859> hand

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
understand position I lay my left hand

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.790 
understand position I lay my left hand
on<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.220> other<00:00:23.369> pad<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:24.050> get<00:00:25.050> another<00:00:25.260> sound

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
on the other pad I get another sound

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.040 
on the other pad I get another sound
so<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.099> allows<00:00:26.310> me<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.550> actually<00:00:27.000> play<00:00:27.240> normal

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
so it allows me to actually play normal

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.599 
so it allows me to actually play normal
conga<00:00:28.410> patterns<00:00:28.769> even<00:00:29.189> though<00:00:29.279> I'm<00:00:29.490> not

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
conga patterns even though I'm not

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:43.010 
conga patterns even though I'm not
really<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.000> conga<00:00:30.449> player<00:00:41.780> push<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:42.989> button

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
really a conga player push one button

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.430 
really a conga player push one button
and<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.710> advance<00:00:44.370> into<00:00:45.270> any<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> 64

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
and I can advance into any of the 64

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.190 
and I can advance into any of the 64

flamenco handclaps put stamps we can
play<00:01:19.920> drums<00:01:20.100> because<00:01:20.940> on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.330> floor<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
play drums because on the floor I have a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:22.820 
play drums because on the floor I have a

kick trigger and an F s5u pedal
allowing<00:01:26.580> me<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.700> close<00:01:26.909> my<00:01:26.970> hi-hat<00:01:35.810> push<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
allowing me to close my hi-hat push the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.600 
allowing me to close my hi-hat push the
button<00:01:37.229> now<00:01:37.500> we'll<00:01:37.679> go<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.190> middle<00:01:38.310> east

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
button now we'll go to the middle east

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:56.690 
button now we'll go to the middle east
the<00:01:53.630> roll<00:01:54.630> function<00:01:55.340> some<00:01:56.340> people<00:01:56.580> might

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the roll function some people might

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.450 
the roll function some people might
think<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.940> very<00:01:57.179> machine-like<00:01:58.340> because<00:01:59.340> if

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
think it's very machine-like because if

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.950 
think it's very machine-like because if
I<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.729> hold<00:01:59.850> my<00:01:59.970> hand<00:02:00.000> down<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.840> is

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
I just hold my hand down like that it is

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.960 
I just hold my hand down like that it is
machine-like<00:02:01.440> however<00:02:02.190> because<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.729> pads

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
machine-like however because the pads

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.230 
machine-like however because the pads
respond<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:05.070> pressure<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.579> your<00:02:05.700> dynamics

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
respond to the pressure of your dynamics

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.270 
respond to the pressure of your dynamics
or<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.630> dynamics<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.740> pressure<00:02:07.979> applied

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
or the dynamics of the pressure applied

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.940 
or the dynamics of the pressure applied
upon<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.790> I<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.450> become<00:02:09.720> very<00:02:10.049> expressive<00:02:10.619> by

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
upon it I can become very expressive by

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:24.670 
upon it I can become very expressive by
playing<00:02:11.190> pan<00:02:11.459> de<00:02:11.610> dough

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680

China<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:52.420> we<00:03:52.840> even<00:03:53.080> have<00:03:53.410> orchestral<00:03:54.190> sounds

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.619 

so<00:04:10.459> those<00:04:10.640> are<00:04:10.790> some<00:04:10.909> of<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.150> basic<00:04:11.599> things

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
so those are some of the basic things

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.330 
so those are some of the basic things
that<00:04:12.080> can<00:04:12.200> be<00:04:12.319> done<00:04:12.349> with<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.370> hand<00:04:13.610> sonic<00:04:14.030> 10
