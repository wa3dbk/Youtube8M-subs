00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:14.920
 hello here we are from cold garzhi 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.849
 moving to warmer me 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.750
 premises and now I will tell you about two 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:27.579
 hydraulic pump pumps 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:34.329
 n16 and nsh-10 which we removed from LTS 60 a 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:38.650
 you with the engine d 65 m 1 l we will 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:42.580
 set the pump from 16 to 10 instead 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:46.020
 pump ns-10 as for technical 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.510
 characteristics of both pumps then nsh-10 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.810
 as already clear from the name of his volume 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.510
 working 10 cubic centimeters when 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.310
 as before 1616 cubic centimeters 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.060
 it follows that 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.570
 insha 16 more efficient pump and 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.650
 it gives out about thirty three liters in 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.050
 minute nominally nsh-10 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.540
 gives out 10 liters a minute less 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.970
 roughly twenty two point six 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:24.970
 tenths of a liter is the pressure that creates 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:34.780
 these pumps are the same 16-20 megapascal 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:37.299
 and insha 16 is heavier than ns-10 by 1.2 kilograms 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.659
 and with the naked eye you can see that Insha 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:48.360
 16 we have longer that is here I take 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:57.210
 we have a bucket ninety-two millimeters 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:02:04.869
 if we see the end of 16, we have removed 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:09.209
 one hundred and nine millimeters that's 109 i am now 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:16.029
 I measure the diameter of the input of the outputs your 10 is 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:19.510
 14 millimeters vanshot 16 is 19 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:20.819
 half millimeters are external to us 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.150
 spline part 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.790
 same that is, 16 can be put 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.989
 instead and sit down and we'll do that 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:39.779
 there are six slots like one and 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:39.779
 at the other pump I measure height now 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:50.340
 spline shaft that's seen more than 10 and 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:59.650
 van shi 16 he is exactly the same that is 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:06.209
 confirms that you can absolutely not 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:10.090
 I worry to put the United States 16th place is 10 and 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:13.269
 on the fixings they are absolutely identical and 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.769
 what we will show you a little bit later 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.519
 on the tractor itself 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.260
 please note that on the engine 10 5 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:25.809
 molodin which stops this 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:30.120
 protects the pump ns-10 right rotation then 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:31.389
 there are 32 left there and a dozen right and 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.930
 also 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:43.059
 insha 16 need to buy the right rotation 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:47.980
 to make it work for you 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:54.219
 input arrow right rotation i.e. 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:57.809
 on the engine it stands like that from above 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:04:01.959
 input bottom output 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:05.319
 set Misha 16 we partially at least 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:10.510
 solve the problem of what we have for example 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:12.609
 the steering wheel is tight that is nsh-10 here 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.959
 either can not cope with their work 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:17.410
 he already 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:21.790
 worn out bad oil pumps well here 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.250
 for example, our pump will show now 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.960
 you can calmly crank 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.350
 cork and here are two fingers I'm literally 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.710
 here it rotates quietly 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:37.040
 This means that the sleeves are already rubbed. 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:41.449
 the gears are rubbed and here it is 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.030
 felt whether the birds need to hear 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:47.510
 will be 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:50.720
 two fingers calmly rise to 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.020
 and if we try to do even 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.500
 totally take what with force 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:01.130
 We try to crank out something we do not 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.940
 it comes out and just here is quite small 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.050
 tiny working people from a turn 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.930
 by his hand 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:14.560
 that is, it cannot be said that 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:17.449
 the pump is working and its time it still departs 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:21.440
 clear thing is that this pump 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:24.919
 freshly bought and on it I finish 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.620
 go to your video link which 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:31.630
 you now see on the screen to 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:36.770
 continue watching installation video 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:40.450
 This n16 on the tractor and there further you 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:44.000
 already see i will demonstrate the work 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:46.599
 volitional with this pump and I think you 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.599
 will like
