 hello girls how are you today I bring you a 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.259
 day waite how to make a necklace with 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.190
 I hope you like them and there 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.190
 is the video 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.180
 you are going to use buttons 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.750
 also a chain that already has the 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.760
 stroller preferably 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.860
 you can use one that is no longer 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.869
 using old to make you more 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.910
 easy to work too we are going to 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.100
 use a pliers this is to cut 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.070
 cuticles that I use it to make 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.380
 crafts and the other is to do 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.230
 would catch and with subjection we're also going to 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.370
 use a hot rubber gun to 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.370
 any measure you have 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.320
 and there is no needle 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.610
 and felt or any other fabric that 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.300
 have 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.830
 for the buttons this heading of not 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.440
 I know what it's called we're going to put the 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.860
 pliers between that and we're going to 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.980
 do 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.630
 repeats completely and that of plan to 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.630
 make it easier for us to paste 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.930
 to make this necklace there are two ways 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.229
 first is cutting the shape or style 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.780
 that you want from the necklace and then 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.360
 you answer the buttons according to the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.520
 way that she gave you this one I did not put 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.380
 little chain what I put was these two 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.140
 tapes that do not know his name not me 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.789
 agreement and things with thread and needle in 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.920
 this necklace I am using this 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.479
 type of buttons but you can use 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.399
 Any type that has also 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.159
 I added pebbles to the buttons 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.189
 In short, just let your flight fly 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.189
 imagination 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.830
 for the second way you put the felt 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.780
 on a flat surface and you start to 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.750
 place the buttons first I did was 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.930
 that I put two buttons to the corners and 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.390
 from there I was guided to give him the 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.270
 way that I wanted the way pretty much 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.600
 what I wanted to give him was in a way 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.760
 short does not look like much but more or 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.080
 except that was the way I wanted to give 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.390
 I was putting one by one 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.410
 giving it the form until it reaches 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.410
 the desired shape 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.200
 once you have formed your necklace 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.209
 then what are you going to do that you're going to 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.750
 begin to stick it with the glue that I have 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.720
 first I hit the two corners and 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.720
 there I went guiding you always have to go 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.550
 sticking it in order so that the way that 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.550
 you have already done, you will not be harmed 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.349
 as you can see here I'm staying this 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.840
 little hole and what I'm going to do is that I'm going 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:22.140
 to put these two stones for 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.260
 fill it and keep the necklace shape 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.020
 and it would stay like that when everything is already 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.140
 stuck the next step is let's 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.750
 cut it all around to fuck note 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:38.040
 that you have to cut it well for 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.230
 that the shape of the collar highlight short 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.060
 all around well is removed from the 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.060
 buttons as close as you can 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.330
 and if you take off a button you know 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.330
 you just have to paste 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.060
 and already cut that would be like this next 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.510
 step is going to do we are going to paste the 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.620
 chain you have to measure the chain 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.950
 depending on how long you want it 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.030
 Collapse that of the measure and then 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.030
 you start doing it 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.539
 I always when I sew I assure it well 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.240
 so you can tell him how many times 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:32.129
 you want and you can also make knots 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.500
 so you're pretty sure it's going to 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:37.939
 be tight and can not be 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.939
 hit or break 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.780
 and it would stay like that 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.170
 good girls I hope you liked it 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.060

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.520

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.950
