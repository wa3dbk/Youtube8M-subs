00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.089
 Hi everyone, you want to see how I look 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.850
 made these cute and 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.400
 delicious fruit jellies that 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.000
 can be useful to fill the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:37.290
 stocking of the witch for your children 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:42.570
 then I would be here after the acronym vi 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.789
 100 ml of fruit juice 100 is needed 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.230
 g of more granulated sugar at the end 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.550
 what it takes to cover the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:56.699
 candies and three sheets of isinglass 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.670
 then of gelatin in sheets then I 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.680
 meanwhile the isinglass has omitted it already 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.350
 for a few minutes, soaked in water 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.280
 cold to hold so for about 10 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.780
 minutes 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.360
 in the meantime we go to put a 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.360
 small saucepan with fruit juice 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.960
 and we carry everything on the fire pull e 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:37.310
 bring this color by choosing for 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:45.619
 well sugar then now wants 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:47.690
 so we take off pushing the fire 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:53.750
 we take the gelatin is now 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:02:00.979
 soaked the well squeeze removing 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:03.950
 excess water and put it inside a 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.390
 that place lido but digging for three years 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.390
 until it is completely dissolved 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:12.760
 acquitted all the isinglass 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.800
 now I'm going to pour this mixture 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.180
 in silicone molds for i 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.030
 recommend a silicone for what it was 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.100
 candy roads easier then e 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.299
 civilians to oppose inside are those 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.299
 for real chocolates 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.959
 then I filled the molds then not 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.670
 I had used these balances for more 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.319
 the major brands, however they are 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.050
 about 20 22 approximately now waits 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.820
 a moment you hear of some scanu 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.830
 minute and then put them in the fridge for 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.290
 a few hours later I tell you how much 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.810
 namely nuti broken inside 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.280
 until they solidify and therefore there 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:08.040
 see after then after a couple of hours 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.040
 the jellies are ready, here they are 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:16.989
 now we gently go to 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:20.280
 remove from the silicone mold 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.280
 I give it in granulated sugar 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:40.940
 and it is immediately back inside and we do 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.940
 these obviously for all the jellies 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.880
 here's our jellies all 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.490
 outdated they are very pretty and easy to 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.550
 to prepare, I hope, that in short, 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.890

 like squeezing lemons oranges because 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.370
