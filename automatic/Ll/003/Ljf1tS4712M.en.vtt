to remove the wood piece at some time
and<00:03:16.380> it's<00:03:16.500> not<00:03:16.739> so<00:03:16.950> distant<00:03:17.250> past<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.970> would<00:03:18.900> say

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
and it's not so distant past I would say

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.199 
and it's not so distant past I would say
that<00:03:19.290> over<00:03:19.500> 80%<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.370> wood<00:03:20.519> pieces<00:03:20.940> that<00:03:21.180> I

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
that over 80% of the wood pieces that I

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.449 
that over 80% of the wood pieces that I
removed<00:03:21.690> from<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.079> 126th<00:03:22.829> chassis<00:03:23.280> are

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.850 
removed from the 126th chassis are
broken<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:24.989> gives<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> pretty<00:03:25.620> good

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
broken so that gives you a pretty good
