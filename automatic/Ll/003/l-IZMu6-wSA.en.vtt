00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
the feria ones and those those seem to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.410 
the feria ones and those those seem to
last<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.360> really<00:01:33.869> long<00:01:34.049> time<00:01:34.259> um<00:01:35.060> it<00:01:36.060> takes

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
last a really long time um it takes

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.780 
last a really long time um it takes
quite<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.869> while<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.560> fade<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.189> use<00:01:38.430> a

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
quite a while for to fade like I use a

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.550 
quite a while for to fade like I use a
color<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.659> was<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:39.930> slightly<00:01:40.200> lighter

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
color that was like slightly lighter

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.010 
color that was like slightly lighter
than<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.729> took<00:01:42.000> about<00:01:42.119> four<00:01:42.509> months<00:01:42.689> for

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
than this it took about four months for

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.999 
than this it took about four months for
it<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.140> turn<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:44.030> orangie<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.329> key<00:01:45.689> again<00:01:46.020> so

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
it to turn like orangie a key again so

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.460 
it to turn like orangie a key again so
um<00:01:47.430> those<00:01:48.420> are<00:01:48.600> good<00:01:48.630> um

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.760
