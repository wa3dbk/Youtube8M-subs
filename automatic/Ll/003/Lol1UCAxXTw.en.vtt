00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.750
 the relatively cheap moto gee was follow 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.849
 your heart great successes motorola after one 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.320
 years are again time for the successor and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.390
 this new logis 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.309
 cost is 89 euros he has one 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.989
 larger screen but the rest remain the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.610
 fairly limited 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.559
 the design has remained virtually unchanged 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.580
 on the large speakers at the top and 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.960
 bottom 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.340
 after that put it for him on the back 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.320
 and now especially care for something and 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.970
 louder sound quality cousin not really 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.290
 for the rest it looks the same 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.180
 the back is also made of 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.860
 same fine non- slip material 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.790
 slightly curved for a nice hand 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.979
 lies 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.070
 the design is pretty boring and with 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:01.019
 11 mm the device is quite thick the screen 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.610
 has grown from four and half to 5 inches 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.720
 and that is quite unique in this 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.909
 price range 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.790
 and the revolution stays the same on hd that 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.690
 1280 by 720 pixels means that is spacious 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.939
 Enough 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.900
 certainly for this price from our measurements 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.340
 it appears that the brightness and the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.439
 color reproduction is remarkably 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.820
 that means it has deteriorated 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.369
 screen is slightly less clear in the color 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.409
 and just a little less accurate about us 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.700
 you do not immediately notice anything but 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.020
 You can use this phone in direct sunlight 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.920
 for example not really very well 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.210
 use 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.710
 compared to other devices 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.630
 the screen remains at this price 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.130
 incidentally, was enough last year 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.810
 I particularly like the performance 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.999
 of the engine that was previously the so 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.890
 cheaper devices often faltered or 

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:39.450
 really really slow because jeans 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.490
 equipped with a 400 snapdragon 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.259
 processor was also a case this year 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.969
 means the phone runs very smoothly 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.710
 a bit slower than the top 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.509
 devices but nothing stinks 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.310
 crashes because under the hood 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.409
 nothing has actually changed remains the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.240
 battery life also almost the same that is not 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.710
 very special but sufficient 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.119
 with average use straight into the tot 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.100
 the beginning of the evening and then you have the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.350
 commercial construction is what is mainly 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.850
 is the camera instead of 5 and 8 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.200
 megapixels available and that ensured 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.899
 for the ones that are actually better 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.069
 pictures makes the first mooji how often 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.990
 not focusing properly or very much 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.730
 suffered from movement and entered the dark 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.319
 very fast noise that is all 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.000
 slightly better in the new moto 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.310
 gee which means is to focus 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.510
 better color and less noise 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.640
 are still not spectacular 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.870
 photos 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.150
 a major disadvantage of the new generation 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.620
 is that there is no 4g support 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.850
 your mobile internet is slower and 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.860
 less stable 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.660
 last year came first not 4g version 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.770
 off and then a variant that it does 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.240
 supported 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.190
 or whatever is the case this year is still 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.050
 not clearly a big advantage is the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.850
 support micro sd through which you 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.930
 easy memory with a sd card 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.310
 can expand 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.800
 the new moto jean it's a what 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.709
 larger screen which is very welcome 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.930
 better camera and micro sd support 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.209
 4g is unfortunately not supported and it 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.870
 are all quite small steps 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.730
 the line 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.260
 the mataji remains in this price range 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.060
 still ahead of the competitors 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.060
 and so it's just a good purchase
