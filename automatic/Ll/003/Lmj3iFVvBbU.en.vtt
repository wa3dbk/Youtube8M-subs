00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.940
 Hollywood action movie came gloomy world 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.940
 of the future 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.309
 where the remnants of humanity barely reduce 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.350
 ends meet 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.329
 we are very attentive to our game we 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.100
 We know that some things people will 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.170

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.000
 because we are careful thinking we

 invite you to do so 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.759
 able to understand the upcoming trip but 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.540

 the air on the surface is clean and quite 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.540
 suitable for life 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.990
 the survivors did not have to go down to 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.509
 underground as a recent metro 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.650
 however behind concrete walls 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.110
 dilapidated city inhabited 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.930
 mutants on this side of the wall 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.690
 small quarantine zone where 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.580
 escaped infection may more or less 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.180
 comfortable to exist 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.440
 what infection alas we donâ€™t say yet 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.299
 can find out for yourself after release 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.170
 the story begins with your acquaintance with 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.399
 Joel who lives in the quarantine zone 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.590
 such zones are one way 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.320
 social device after pandemic 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.179
 there was an outbreak of the disease and 20 years 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.660
 later we see society cope 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.440
 with the consequences of armed groups 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.560
 military unit posts 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.120
 curfew at least they shoot 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.769
 without warning and thanks for that 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.760
 this is the place where the paths intersect 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.709
 Joel 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.350
 and or joel is an adult male who 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.730
 spent the last 20 years in daily 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.940
 struggle for survival 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.760
 he still remembers the calm life before 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.160
 infection but has completely adapted and 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.160
 to the new rules of the game if anything 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.030
 pull the trigger and do not hesitate another 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:51.049
 or she's only 14 and all her life she 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.180
 It held after a pandemic is 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.790
 imposes a certain imprint 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.579
 For example, the girl does not know how to swim and 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.910
 never been to the forest for her all these 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.770
 infected and military nothing but cool 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.300
 or tin 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.320
 actually this story is about them two nobody 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.180
 no one overshadows 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.310
 we hope that these characters are all 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.580
 like make you take a trip 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.020
 closer to the heart 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.150
 if you take to compare me personally 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.460
 glad that more and more games tend to 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.830
 deeper narrative to me by 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.300
 soul of such games, I think that games 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.160
 the industry today has just 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.260
 incredible opportunities to 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.840
 create just such a game what people 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.330
 I want to see more and more games 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.360
 character-oriented games take off 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.510
 the plot together they have to commit 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.180
 traveling across the United States or rather 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.260
 what is left of them to achieve 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.820
 some supreme goal of this such we are 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.820
 also can not say because it is quiet 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:58.000
 spoilers we want to show how different 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.220
 characters cause different feelings like 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.520
 these characters affect the player on joel 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:09.040
 on the world so in the course of the plot you a lot 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:11.740
 who is behind can we say that stealth 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.020
 the game is much smaller than we expected and 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.380
 if you prefer active 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.299
 actions rejoice it turned out that joel 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.460
 not bad wielding melee 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.850
 if you don't like hiding and 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.830
 distract enemies scattering bricks 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.310
 throw a brick right at the opponent 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.070
 then jump on it and finish off with a crowbar 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.910
 no one is against such a passage here 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.550
 objects to 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.330
 at least when there are fewer enemies 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.330
 ten 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.180
 design 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.180
 of money 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.430
 form it
