was definitely the toughest day um as

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.440 
was definitely the toughest day um as
for<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:02.100> results<00:01:03.090> after<00:01:03.570> day<00:01:04.049> two<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:05.010> at

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
for my results after day two I was at

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.960 
for my results after day two I was at
135<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.049> after<00:01:07.560> date<00:01:07.979> three<00:01:08.340> my<00:01:08.580> weight<00:01:08.790> was

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
135 and after date three my weight was

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.890 
135 and after date three my weight was
at<00:01:09.180> 130<00:01:09.630> 4.2<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.820> there's<00:01:12.270> obviously<00:01:12.420> no

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
at 130 4.2 so there's obviously no

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.140 
at 130 4.2 so there's obviously no
dramatic<00:01:13.409> changes<00:01:13.860> from<00:01:14.130> day<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.869> but<00:01:17.150> what

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
dramatic changes from day one but what

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.370 
dramatic changes from day one but what
matters<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.630> I'm<00:01:18.869> losing<00:01:19.200> weight<00:01:19.229> I
