00:00:01.554 --> 00:00:04.433
 Do you feel weak and tired? 

00:00:05.402 --> 00:00:07.637
 Do you feel light-headed? 

00:00:08.787 --> 00:00:10.948
 Do you have vertigo episodes? 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:14.733
 Do you lose your senses all the time? 

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:18.251
 If you are accusing all or one of these symptoms ... 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.954
 ... maybe it's because you're not ... 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.598
 BREATHING. 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.397
 Breathing is a safe and effective way 

00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:30.757
 To counter death and its symptoms. 

00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:34.420
 Many doctors agree that breathing 

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:36.335
 Be an excellent practice for staying alive. 

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:38.605
 And if you don't believe my words ... 

00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:40.324
 ... listen to these testimonies: 

00:00:41.247 --> 00:00:43.448
 "I've been breathing since I was born ... 

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:44.760
 ...and today... 

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:48.245
 ... I work in a grocery store ... DING DING! " 

00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:51.652
 "If it weren't for breathing ... 

00:00:51.663 --> 00:00:53.658
 ... probably I would have died by now. 

00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:55.671
 No, seriously: I would have died ... 

00:00:55.762 --> 00:00:57.349
 ... you can't live if you don't breathe. " 

00:00:57.763 --> 00:01:01.033
 "Today I bought a HUGE fire truck ... 

00:01:02.078 --> 00:01:03.054
 ...what's up?... 

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:04.511
 ...I bought it!" 

00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:07.653
 Did you know that organisms breathe 

00:01:07.694 --> 00:01:09.834
 To avoid dying of asphyxiation? 

00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:12.802
 And if it weren't for the breath ... 

00:01:12.804 --> 00:01:14.690
 ... not even the Beatles would have existed! 

00:01:16.696 --> 00:01:18.181
 ... and the ugly one. 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.438
 Even dogs breathe! 

00:01:22.104 --> 00:01:23.705
 So what are you waiting for? 

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:25.427
 What are you waiting for? 

00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:27.875
 It's safe, cheap ... 

00:01:27.912 --> 00:01:29.562
 ... and great for your sexual intercourse! 

00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:31.940
 What are you waiting for! 

00:01:35.173 --> 00:01:36.514
 Start breathing today 

00:01:36.543 --> 00:01:37.672
 Today! 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.745
 Otherwise... 

00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:40.057
 ... start dying. 

00:01:40.368 --> 00:01:42.906
 If you were shot, stabbed or diagnosed with a terminal illness ... 

00:01:43.023 --> 00:01:45.552
 ... breathing could not prolong your life. Results may vary. 

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:50.973
 uuuUUUUUUUuuuuHHhhh ... a huge fire truck !! 

00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:54.462
 Why are they all looking at me like this?
