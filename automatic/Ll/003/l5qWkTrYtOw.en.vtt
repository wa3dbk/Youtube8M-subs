to script this a little bit but

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.790 
to script this a little bit but
unfortunately<00:00:10.260> didn't<00:00:10.410> work<00:00:10.500> out<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:10.769> well

on a daily basis and hopefully you guys
will<00:00:17.490> pick<00:00:17.640> up<00:00:17.760> some<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.480> keyboard

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
will pick up some of that keyboard

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.779 
will pick up some of that keyboard
shortcuts<00:00:19.140> early<00:00:19.470> say<00:00:19.650> well<00:00:19.890> how<00:00:20.369> did<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.670> do

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
and we'll make a big list of keyboard

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.460 
and we'll make a big list of keyboard
circuits<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.160> anyway<00:00:26.430> without<00:00:26.670> further<00:00:26.820> ado

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
circuits so anyway without further ado

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.990 
circuits so anyway without further ado
okay<00:00:28.470> be<00:00:29.010> sure<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.250> look<00:00:29.340> down<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.670> right<00:00:29.789> here

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
okay be sure to look down the right here

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.450 
okay be sure to look down the right here
for<00:00:30.240> key<00:00:30.900> presses<00:00:31.109> fortunately<00:00:32.070> I've<00:00:32.189> noticed

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
for key presses fortunately I've noticed

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.770 
for key presses fortunately I've noticed
that<00:00:32.579> some<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.759> them<00:00:32.910> hit<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.270> fast<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.630> can't

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that some of them hit so fast you can't

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.350 
that some of them hit so fast you can't
actually<00:00:33.960> see<00:00:34.260> where<00:00:34.380> they<00:00:34.500> are<00:00:34.530> but

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
actually see where they are but

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.000 
actually see where they are but
hopefully<00:00:36.360> get<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.540> majority<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:37.020> them<00:00:37.200> okay

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
hopefully get the majority of them okay

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.569 
hopefully get the majority of them okay
so<00:00:39.469> keep<00:00:40.469> wickets<00:00:40.829> by<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> way<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.550> guys

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
so keep wickets by the way you guys

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.369 
so keep wickets by the way you guys
should<00:00:41.910> all<00:00:42.120> be<00:00:42.360> using<00:00:42.660> watching<00:00:43.020> it's

so be sure first of all to make a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.709 
so be sure first of all to make a
launchy<00:00:52.920> index<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.940> your<00:00:54.090> folders<00:00:54.600> on

it's really useful Lexi I want to pull
up<00:00:58.379> something<00:00:58.649> about<00:00:58.710> projects<00:00:59.280> i'm<00:00:59.370> working

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
up something about projects i'm working

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.500 
up something about projects i'm working
on<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.780> one<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.109> linear<00:01:01.559> induction<00:01:02.270> say<00:01:03.270> i

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
on this is one on linear induction say i

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.370 
on this is one on linear induction say i
want<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.489> remember<00:01:05.900> actually<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.960> don't<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.350> a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
want to remember actually I don't have a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.460 
want to remember actually I don't have a
XS<00:01:08.189> right<00:01:08.250> now<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.330> let's<00:01:09.570> say<00:01:09.720> let's

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
XS right now but so let's say let's

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.620 
XS right now but so let's say let's
pretend

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.050 

let's<00:01:14.630> pretend<00:01:14.929> i<00:01:15.020> had<00:01:15.170> a<00:01:15.200> folder<00:01:15.500> here<00:01:16.060> for

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
let's pretend i had a folder here for

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.480 
let's pretend i had a folder here for
stew<00:01:17.390> web<00:01:17.570> since<00:01:17.929> i<00:01:18.020> actually<00:01:18.350> don't<00:01:19.280> have<00:01:19.369> to

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
stew web since i actually don't have to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.779 
stew web since i actually don't have to
do<00:01:19.609> up<00:01:19.759> at<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:19.969> moment<00:01:20.060> cuz<00:01:20.359> i'm<00:01:20.450> not<00:01:20.630> at<00:01:20.869> all

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
do up at the moment cuz i'm not at all

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.950 
do up at the moment cuz i'm not at all
so<00:01:22.789> let's<00:01:23.060> say<00:01:23.119> I<00:01:23.210> decide<00:01:23.479> that<00:01:23.509> I<00:01:23.689> want<00:01:23.780> to

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
so let's say I decide that I want to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.209 
so let's say I decide that I want to
share<00:01:24.049> this<00:01:24.140> presentation<00:01:24.380> which<00:01:24.979> is<00:01:25.100> pretty

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
share this presentation which is pretty

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.600 
share this presentation which is pretty
large<00:01:25.429> with<00:01:25.700> someone<00:01:25.939> outside<00:01:25.969> of<00:01:26.240> all<00:01:27.610> makes

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
large with someone outside of all makes

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.270 
large with someone outside of all makes
it<00:01:28.759> super<00:01:29.119> easy<00:01:29.209> because<00:01:29.959> just<00:01:30.619> refer<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:30.920> your

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
it super easy because just refer to your

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.940 
it super easy because just refer to your
things<00:01:31.490> with<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:32.000> know<00:01:32.060> key<00:01:32.630> press

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.670 

what<00:01:37.549> are<00:01:37.700> some<00:01:37.729> other<00:01:37.969> cool<00:01:38.180> things<00:01:38.390> I<00:01:38.680> love

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
what are some other cool things I love

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.630 
what are some other cool things I love
them<00:01:41.259> so<00:01:42.259> I<00:01:42.590> actually<00:01:42.890> have<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.189> document<00:01:43.520> here

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
them so I actually have a document here

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.360 
them so I actually have a document here
that<00:01:43.820> I<00:01:44.090> was<00:01:44.210> making<00:01:44.329> it<00:01:44.570> for<00:01:44.960> life<00:01:45.560> x

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
that I was making it for life x

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.840 
that I was making it for life x
by<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.000> way<00:01:48.150> ah<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:49.530> shift<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.370> 10<00:01:50.580> which<00:01:50.820> is

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
by the way ah the shift of 10 which is

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.550 
by the way ah the shift of 10 which is
compared<00:01:51.480> with<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> context<00:01:51.900> menu<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.350> just

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
compared with the context menu it's just

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.880 
compared with the context menu it's just
fantastic<00:01:53.870> so<00:01:54.870> I<00:01:55.230> have<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.410> bunch<00:01:55.620> of<00:01:55.710> things

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
fantastic so I have a bunch of things
