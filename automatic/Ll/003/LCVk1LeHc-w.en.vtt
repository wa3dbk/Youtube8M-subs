00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
on my tomato garden so I took a shortcut

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.829 
on my tomato garden so I took a shortcut
on<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.519> one<00:00:14.730> went<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.240> nursery<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
other day and lo and behold look what I

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.660 
other day and lo and behold look what I
found<00:00:17.630> big<00:00:18.630> tomato<00:00:19.109> plants<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.070> decided

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
found big tomato plants so I decided

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.640 
found big tomato plants so I decided
that<00:00:20.820> I'm<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.420> stagger<00:00:21.810> my<00:00:22.109> plantings

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
that I'm going to stagger my plantings

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.830 
that I'm going to stagger my plantings
by<00:00:22.859> starting<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.310> some<00:00:23.580> big<00:00:23.789> ones<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.240> then

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
by starting with some big ones and then

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.810 
by starting with some big ones and then
putting<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.260> my<00:00:25.410> smaller<00:00:25.769> ones<00:00:26.070> as<00:00:26.279> time<00:00:26.550> goes

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
putting in my smaller ones as time goes

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.779 
putting in my smaller ones as time goes
by<00:00:26.869> so<00:00:27.869> what<00:00:28.260> do<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.410> need<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.619> do<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.920> plant

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
by so what do you need to do to plant

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.840 
by so what do you need to do to plant
tomatoes<00:00:29.970> well<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.050> really<00:00:31.439> very<00:00:31.590> easy<00:00:31.850> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
tomatoes well it's really very easy the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.100 
tomatoes well it's really very easy the
things<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.180> need<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.540> started<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:34.079> your

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
things you need to get started with your

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.690 
things you need to get started with your
garden<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.680> you're<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.100> need<00:00:35.280> potting

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
garden is you're going to need potting

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.510 
garden is you're going to need potting
soil<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.149> put<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.450> your<00:00:36.480> planter<00:00:37.340> organic<00:00:38.340> or

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
soil to put in your planter organic or

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.569 
soil to put in your planter organic or
some<00:00:39.180> type<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.420> fertilizer<00:00:40.070> your<00:00:41.070> plants

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
some type of fertilizer your plants

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.139 
some type of fertilizer your plants
obviously<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:43.260> shovel<00:00:43.879> tomatoes<00:00:44.879> grow

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
obviously and a shovel tomatoes grow

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.090 
obviously and a shovel tomatoes grow
really<00:00:45.450> easy<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.140> containers<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:46.920> you'll

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
really easy in containers but you'll

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.529 
really easy in containers but you'll
need<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.370> remember<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.090> you're<00:00:48.210> growing

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
need to remember that if you're growing

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.360 
need to remember that if you're growing
full-size<00:00:49.079> tomatoes<00:00:49.620> which<00:00:49.829> are<00:00:49.950> called<00:00:50.160> in

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
full-size tomatoes which are called in

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.180 
full-size tomatoes which are called in
determinants<00:00:51.059> they<00:00:51.629> get<00:00:51.930> very<00:00:52.260> very<00:00:52.500> large<00:00:52.920> so

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
determinants they get very very large so

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.520 
determinants they get very very large so
you'll<00:00:53.370> need<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> tomato<00:00:54.000> cage<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> really

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
you'll need a tomato cage what I really

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.020 
you'll need a tomato cage what I really
recommend<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:56.100> growing<00:00:56.370> determinant

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
recommend is growing determinant

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.580 
recommend is growing determinant
tomatoes<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.690> what<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.050> means<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.440> they<00:00:58.559> are

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
tomatoes and what that means is they are

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.709 
tomatoes and what that means is they are
determinants<00:00:59.370> eyes<00:00:59.609> sometimes<00:01:00.149> referred<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
determinants eyes sometimes referred to

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.200 
determinants eyes sometimes referred to
as<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.989> patio<00:01:01.469> tomato<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.489> they're<00:01:02.670> very<00:01:02.699> very

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
as a patio tomato so they're very very

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.840 
as a patio tomato so they're very very
easy<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.629> grow<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.199> container<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.280> these<00:01:05.580> two

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
easy to grow in a container so these two

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.240 
easy to grow in a container so these two
right<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.090> are<00:01:06.740> determinants<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:08.100> are

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
right here are determinants and they are

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.000 
right here are determinants and they are
patio<00:01:08.729> tomatoes<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.200> started<00:01:10.680> with<00:01:10.830> some

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
patio tomatoes so I started with some

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.560 
patio tomatoes so I started with some
large<00:01:11.250> plants<00:01:11.790> here<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.210> could<00:01:12.299> get

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
large plants here so I could get

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.870 
large plants here so I could get
underway<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.890> harvest<00:01:14.460> fairly

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
underway and have a a harvest fairly

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.630 
underway and have a a harvest fairly
early<00:01:15.119> my<00:01:15.930> dirt<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.470> I've<00:01:16.680> already<00:01:17.040> prepped

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
early my dirt here I've already prepped

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.990 
early my dirt here I've already prepped
it<00:01:17.880> by<00:01:18.090> adding<00:01:18.380> my<00:01:19.380> fertilizer<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.790> little

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it by adding my fertilizer and a little

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.700 
it by adding my fertilizer and a little
bit<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.150> worm<00:01:21.390> castings<00:01:21.960> because<00:01:22.200> i<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
bit of worm castings because i have a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.350 
bit of worm castings because i have a
small<00:01:22.979> worm<00:01:23.369> garden<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> side<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.210> my

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
small worm garden at the side of my

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
small worm garden at the side of my
house<00:01:24.689> ok<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.009> things<00:01:26.040> that

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
you're going to want to do when you dig

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.390 
you're going to want to do when you dig
this<00:01:27.720> hole<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.439> you're<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.890> want<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.159> dig

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
this hole is you're going to want to dig

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.240 
this hole is you're going to want to dig
it<00:01:29.549> all<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.420> way<00:01:30.570> down<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:31.229> far<00:01:31.439> as<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.860> can

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
it all the way down as far as you can

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.929 
it all the way down as far as you can
into<00:01:32.759> your<00:01:33.479> planter<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:35.250> your<00:01:35.400> plants<00:01:35.759> looks

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
into your planter so your plants looks

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
we're just going to do the easy part

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.160 
we're just going to do the easy part
which<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.009> we're<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.000> insert<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.930> plant

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
which is we're going to insert the plant

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.920 
which is we're going to insert the plant
in<00:01:46.470> there<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.890> put<00:01:47.430> two<00:01:47.670> into<00:01:48.060> my<00:01:48.180> perfect<00:01:48.600> patio

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.270 
in there I put two into my perfect patio
planter<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.470> you're<00:01:49.590> using<00:01:49.710> an<00:01:49.920> earth<00:01:50.009> box

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
planter if you're using an earth box

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.270 
planter if you're using an earth box
same<00:01:50.640> thing<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:52.130> you<00:01:53.130> know<00:01:53.220> if

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
same thing you can do to you know if

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.499 
same thing you can do to you know if
you're<00:01:53.399> using<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.670> round<00:01:53.880> container<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.390> might

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
you're using a round container you might

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.050 
you're using a round container you might
just<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.750> doing<00:01:55.049> one<00:01:55.280> here<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.399> go<00:01:56.579> we<00:01:56.790> set<00:01:57.030> it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
just be doing one here we go we set it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.030 
just be doing one here we go we set it
in<00:01:57.360> there<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.479> and<00:02:00.920> then<00:02:01.920> we're

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
in there just like so and then we're

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.950 
in there just like so and then we're
going<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.189> cover<00:02:02.340> up<00:02:02.549> with<00:02:02.729> soil<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.270> use<00:02:03.780> my

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
going to cover up with soil I use my

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.169 
going to cover up with soil I use my
hands<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.469> think<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.860> little<00:02:05.130> easier<00:02:08.179> you

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
hands I think it's a little easier you

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.690 
hands I think it's a little easier you
can<00:02:09.330> also<00:02:09.599> one<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.379> things<00:02:10.590> that

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
can also one of the things that

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.559 
can also one of the things that
gardeners<00:02:11.700> will<00:02:11.849> tell<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.330> do<00:02:12.450> i'll

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
gardeners will tell you to do i'll

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.820 
gardeners will tell you to do i'll
probably<00:02:12.810> add<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.080> little<00:02:13.290> bit<00:02:13.440> more

probably add a little bit more

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.500 
probably add a little bit more
oil<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.250> after<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.670> video<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.150> done<00:02:15.300> is

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
oil to this after the video is done is

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.470 
oil to this after the video is done is
to<00:02:16.230> go<00:02:16.560> ahead<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.950> put<00:02:17.610> your<00:02:17.640> soil<00:02:17.940> up<00:02:18.180> pretty

telling you what your growing there

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.600 
telling you what your growing there
because<00:02:28.800> there<00:02:28.920> are<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.070> many<00:02:29.310> different

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
because there are so many different

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.970 
because there are so many different
types<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.090> tomatoes<00:02:30.570> so<00:02:31.320> in<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:31.560> case<00:02:31.740> I've

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
types of tomatoes so in this case I've

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.530 
types of tomatoes so in this case I've
already<00:02:32.160> planted<00:02:32.580> one<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.150> can<00:02:33.210> see<00:02:33.420> it's

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
already planted one so you can see it's

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.570 
already planted one so you can see it's
ready<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.960> go<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.410> now<00:02:34.950> what<00:02:35.100> I'm<00:02:35.160> going<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.460> do

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
ready to go and now what I'm going to do

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.610 
ready to go and now what I'm going to do
on<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.760> other<00:02:35.940> side<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.540> I'm<00:02:37.350> going<00:02:37.560> to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
on the other side is I'm going to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.970 
on the other side is I'm going to
stagger<00:02:38.070> my<00:02:38.220> plantings<00:02:38.760> by<00:02:39.800> planting<00:02:40.800> a

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
stagger my plantings by planting a

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.760 
stagger my plantings by planting a
smaller<00:02:41.940> plan<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:42.990> will<00:02:43.200> give<00:02:43.320> us<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.560> chance

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
smaller plan this will give us a chance

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.640 
smaller plan this will give us a chance
to<00:02:44.210> enjoy<00:02:45.210> this<00:02:45.480> plant<00:02:45.840> when<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:46.230> one<00:02:46.470> has

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
to enjoy this plant when this one has

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.430 
to enjoy this plant when this one has
already<00:02:46.890> done<00:02:47.340> giving<00:02:48.030> up<00:02:48.180> its<00:02:48.330> tomatoes<00:02:48.870> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
already done giving up its tomatoes the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.750 
already done giving up its tomatoes the
one<00:02:49.560> thing<00:02:49.680> about<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.920> determinant<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.640> you

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
one thing about a determinant that you

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.760 
one thing about a determinant that you
may<00:02:50.910> want<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.240> remember<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:52.260> does<00:02:52.410> give<00:02:52.620> its

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
may want to remember is it does give its

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.650 
may want to remember is it does give its
fruit<00:02:53.010> pretty<00:02:53.400> much<00:02:53.610> almost<00:02:53.940> at<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.450> same

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
fruit pretty much almost at the same

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.250 
fruit pretty much almost at the same
time<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.610> you<00:02:56.610> will<00:02:56.820> get<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.300> lot<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.720> fruit<00:02:58.080> all

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
time so you will get a lot of fruit all

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.199 
time so you will get a lot of fruit all
at<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.620> same<00:02:58.800> time<00:02:59.070> so<00:02:59.400> by<00:02:59.550> staggering<00:02:59.820> your

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
at the same time so by staggering your

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.790 
at the same time so by staggering your
planner<00:03:00.480> you're<00:03:00.840> able<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.170> make<00:03:01.350> use<00:03:01.620> of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
planner you're able to make use of

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.760 
planner you're able to make use of
having<00:03:02.670> tomatoes<00:03:03.510> for<00:03:03.990> a<00:03:04.080> longer<00:03:04.260> period<00:03:04.530> of

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
having tomatoes for a longer period of

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.560 
having tomatoes for a longer period of
time<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.580> what<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.730> have<00:03:05.970> here<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.330> little

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
time so what I have here is a little

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.140 
time so what I have here is a little
celebrity<00:03:06.959> tomato<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:08.190> I'm<00:03:08.760> going<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.060> go

ahead<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.390> plant<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.990> over<00:03:10.530> here<00:03:11.209> sometimes

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
ahead and plant that over here sometimes

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.850 
ahead and plant that over here sometimes
if<00:03:12.420> they're<00:03:12.660> not<00:03:13.020> packed<00:03:13.320> too<00:03:13.470> tight<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.770> can

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
if they're not packed too tight you can

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.500 
if they're not packed too tight you can
do<00:03:14.010> something<00:03:14.370> they<00:03:14.459> call<00:03:14.640> teasing<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.300> roots

you can find out so if i was going to

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.320 
you can find out so if i was going to
stagger<00:04:01.620> my<00:04:01.860> planting<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.550> little<00:04:03.090> further

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
stagger my planting a little further

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.770

what<00:04:03.720> i<00:04:03.750> would<00:04:03.989> do<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.470> i<00:04:04.980> would<00:04:05.010> take<00:04:05.340> my<00:04:05.780> very

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
what i would do is i would take my very

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.229 
what i would do is i would take my very
small<00:04:07.230> plant<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:08.930> get<00:04:09.930> this<00:04:10.110> one<00:04:10.320> in<00:04:10.500> here<00:04:11.239> so

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
small plant and get this one in here so

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.620 
small plant and get this one in here so
this<00:04:12.780> one<00:04:12.989> will<00:04:13.110> give<00:04:13.230> tomatoes<00:04:13.620> first<00:04:13.860> our

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
this one will give tomatoes first our

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.509 
this one will give tomatoes first our
second<00:04:15.630> one<00:04:15.750> right<00:04:15.979> here<00:04:16.979> which<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.280> little

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
second one right here which is a little

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.240 
second one right here which is a little
bit<00:04:17.640> bigger<00:04:17.850> will<00:04:18.090> give<00:04:18.209> tomatoes<00:04:18.799> next<00:04:19.799> and

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
bit bigger will give tomatoes next and

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.039 
bit bigger will give tomatoes next and
then<00:04:20.760> extending<00:04:21.390> out<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.510> season<00:04:21.959> even
