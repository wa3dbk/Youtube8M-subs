everyone sitting here today is snapshot
day<00:00:12.870> yay<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.009> in<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.120> little<00:00:15.299> sub<00:00:15.540> shot

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
day yay and in this little sub shot

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.220 
day yay and in this little sub shot
mojo<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.100> released<00:00:17.490> something<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.150> makes<00:00:19.109> it

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
mojo I released something that makes it

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:28.640 
mojo I released something that makes it
possible<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.920> do<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:22.730> what<00:00:27.109> so<00:00:28.109> well<00:00:28.439> this

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
possible to do this what so well this

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.500 
possible to do this what so well this
has<00:00:28.769> already<00:00:28.920> been<00:00:29.220> done<00:00:29.429> but<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.390> you've

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
has already been done but it you've

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.479 
has already been done but it you've
Starbucks<00:00:31.080> but<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:32.099> assure<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.340> it

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
Starbucks but this I can assure you it

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.450 
Starbucks but this I can assure you it
does<00:00:32.610> not<00:00:32.730> use<00:00:32.910> any<00:00:33.030> tional<00:00:33.420> modes<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.460> this

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
does not use any tional modes so this

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.280 
does not use any tional modes so this
actually<00:00:35.820> uses<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.719> from<00:00:36.870> your<00:00:36.960> box<00:00:37.140> they

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
actually uses one from your box they

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.330 
actually uses one from your box they
added<00:00:37.559> which<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.800> called<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> directional

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
added which is called the directional

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.900 
added which is called the directional
block<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.790> redstone<00:00:39.170> so<00:00:40.170> as<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.489> this

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
block of redstone so as you can see this

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.350 
block of redstone so as you can see this
one<00:00:42.620> yes<00:00:43.879> basically<00:00:44.879> there<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.239> little

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
one yes basically there is a little

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.119 
one yes basically there is a little
arrow<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.899> points<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> direction<00:00:46.800> that

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
arrow that points in the direction that

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.450 
arrow that points in the direction that
you<00:00:47.280> placed<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:48.770> it's<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.829> lonely<00:00:50.010> part<00:00:50.309> of

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
you placed it it's a lonely part of

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.040 
you placed it it's a lonely part of
piston<00:00:50.760> that's<00:00:50.910> right<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.300> front<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.750> but

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
piston that's right in front of it but

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.990 
piston that's right in front of it but
none<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.280> other<00:00:53.370> ones<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> other

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
none of the other ones on the other

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.750 
none of the other ones on the other
sides<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.340> paste<00:00:56.520> place<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.969> upwards

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
sides so you can paste place it upwards

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.340 
sides so you can paste place it upwards
and<00:00:59.760> if<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.210> want<00:01:00.359> power<00:01:00.570> any<00:01:00.750> other<00:01:00.930> ones

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.100 

place<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.500> downwards<00:01:07.400> any<00:01:08.400> one<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:09.330> power<00:01:09.840> any

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
place it downwards any one one power any

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.960 
place it downwards any one one power any
other<00:01:10.229> ones<00:01:11.869> just<00:01:12.869> leaving<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.500> piston

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
other ones just leaving but this piston

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.399 
other ones just leaving but this piston
what's<00:01:14.970> interesting<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:16.140> this

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
what's interesting is that it's this

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.770 
what's interesting is that it's this
piston<00:01:16.920> which<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.000> pretty<00:01:18.210> cool<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.450> guess

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
piston which is pretty cool I guess

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.179 
piston which is pretty cool I guess
Kristen<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.470> actually<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:20.450> like<00:01:22.189> well

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
Kristen you can actually have like well

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.300 
Kristen you can actually have like well
yeah<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.720> doesn't<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.530> piston<00:01:25.890> which<00:01:26.130> is

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
yeah it doesn't but this piston which is

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.590 
yeah it doesn't but this piston which is
vertical<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:28.700> if<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.759> take<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.939> closer<00:01:30.240> look<00:01:30.360> at

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
vertical so if we take a closer look at

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.219 
vertical so if we take a closer look at
the<00:01:30.689> wiring<00:01:30.900> here<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.799> tear<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.549> alone

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
the wiring here so if I tear this alone

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:41.080 
the wiring here so if I tear this alone
down<00:01:34.229> here<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.360> little<00:01:40.200> bit<00:01:40.320> more<00:01:40.530> detail

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
down here this a little bit more detail

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.940 
down here this a little bit more detail
so<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.360> see<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.630> there<00:01:42.810> I've<00:01:43.170> used<00:01:43.680> one

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
so you can see that there I've used one

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.850 
so you can see that there I've used one
in<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> wiring<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:44.759> um<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:46.170> make<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.530> so

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
in the wiring here um to make it so

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.990 
in the wiring here um to make it so
that's<00:01:47.430> it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
that's it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.800 
that's it
only<00:01:48.930> parts<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.229> piston<00:01:49.500> over<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
only parts the piston over here and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.840 
only parts the piston over here and
doesn't<00:01:51.810> power<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> Redstone<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> side

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
doesn't power the Redstone on the side

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.840 
doesn't power the Redstone on the side
you<00:01:55.270> can<00:01:55.450> see<00:01:55.570> that<00:01:55.750> it<00:01:56.280> puts<00:01:57.280> one<00:01:57.490> in<00:01:57.610> here<00:01:57.820> and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
you can see that it puts one in here and

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.250 
you can see that it puts one in here and
push<00:01:58.180> it<00:01:58.330> upwards<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:04.479> started<00:02:04.810> working<00:02:05.140> there

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
push it upwards it started working there

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.219 
push it upwards it started working there
often<00:02:06.250> pushes<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.820> redstone<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.990> Russian

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
often pushes the redstone the Russian

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.050 
often pushes the redstone the Russian
book<00:02:08.380> that's<00:02:08.679> underneath<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.890> yeah

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
book that's underneath so yeah

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.570 
book that's underneath so yeah
in<00:02:13.240> order<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.540> craft<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.080> oh<00:02:14.440> oh<00:02:15.070> I<00:02:15.430> don't

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
in order to craft this oh oh I don't

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.130 
in order to craft this oh oh I don't
have<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.000> things<00:02:16.209> in<00:02:16.390> my<00:02:16.570> inventory

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
have the things in my inventory

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.840 
have the things in my inventory
you<00:02:17.530> need<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.830> quartz<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:19.500> read<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:20.680> much<00:02:20.860> so

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
you need to quartz and read so much so

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.770 
you need to quartz and read so much so
if<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.240> read<00:02:22.450> some<00:02:22.630> work<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:25.450> around

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
if you read some work and this around

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
if you read some work and this around
and<00:02:27.060> there<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.150> go

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
and there you go

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.040 
and there you go
you<00:02:29.800> got<00:02:29.950> one<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.130> those<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:33.630> okay<00:02:34.630> so<00:02:34.690> for

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
you got one of those and okay so for

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.300 
you got one of those and okay so for
some<00:02:35.260> more<00:02:35.410> things<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:35.890> can<00:02:36.040> do<00:02:36.160> with

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
some more things that you can do with

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.490 
some more things that you can do with
this<00:02:36.510> was<00:02:37.510> just<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.790> this<00:02:40.600> now<00:02:40.840> means<00:02:41.140> that<00:02:41.260> you

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
this was just so this now means that you

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:50.009 
this was just so this now means that you
can<00:02:41.739> actually<00:02:44.160> stack<00:02:46.440> right<00:02:48.660> do<00:02:49.660> something

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
can actually stack right do something

00:02:50.019 --> 00:03:01.560 
can actually stack right do something
like<00:02:53.430> marketplace<00:02:59.220> so<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:00.880> can<00:03:01.030> now<00:03:01.180> have

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
like marketplace so you can now have

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:12.740 
like marketplace so you can now have
something<00:03:01.900> like<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:10.320> where<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:11.560> will<00:03:11.920> power

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
something like this where it will power

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.090 
something like this where it will power
if<00:03:13.750> this<00:03:13.989> down<00:03:14.290> below<00:03:14.970> see<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.150> will<00:03:16.360> go

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
if this down below see this will go

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.130 
if this down below see this will go
around<00:03:18.100> in<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.310> circle<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:19.120> be<00:03:19.630> instant<00:03:19.989> fire

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
around in a circle and be instant fire

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.440 
around in a circle and be instant fire
as<00:03:20.290> well<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.810> we<00:03:23.769> do<00:03:24.670> something<00:03:25.060> like<00:03:25.150> this

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
as well so we do something like this

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.470 
as well so we do something like this
will<00:03:26.410> be<00:03:26.440> pretty<00:03:26.680> fun

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.650 

obviously<00:03:32.850> but<00:03:33.850> we<00:03:34.239> could<00:03:34.660> also<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.540> it

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
obviously but we could also so it

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.800 
obviously but we could also so it
doesn't<00:03:38.340> everything<00:03:39.340> just<00:03:42.390> so<00:03:43.390> if<00:03:43.570> you<00:03:43.690> get

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
doesn't everything just so if you get

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.310 
doesn't everything just so if you get
this<00:03:43.900> power

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
this power

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.060 
this power
oh<00:03:48.480> just<00:03:49.480> power<00:03:49.780> run<00:03:49.959> for<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.380> long<00:03:50.500> time<00:03:50.739> and

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
oh just power run for a long time and

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.460 
oh just power run for a long time and
ice<00:03:51.940> it's<00:03:52.120> just<00:03:52.540> really<00:03:52.690> cool<00:03:52.930> what<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.320> can

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
ice it's just really cool what you can

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.229 
ice it's just really cool what you can
do<00:03:53.590> with<00:03:53.739> this<00:03:53.860> because<00:03:54.040> you<00:03:54.220> can<00:03:54.370> have<00:03:54.579> wires

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
do with this because you can have wires

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.640 
do with this because you can have wires
going<00:03:55.739> straight<00:03:56.739> up<00:03:56.890> with<00:03:57.070> these<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.610> you<00:03:57.790> can

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
going straight up with these and you can

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.759 
going straight up with these and you can
attach<00:03:59.650> them<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.890> slam<00:04:00.100> rocks<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:01.769> wood

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
attach them to slam rocks and wood

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.260 
attach them to slam rocks and wood
around<00:04:02.919> arms<00:04:03.459> line<00:04:03.699> blocks<00:04:04.709> so

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.880 

this<00:04:09.270> means<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:10.430> you<00:04:11.430> could<00:04:12.050> put<00:04:13.050> a<00:04:13.080> tear<00:04:13.440> but

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
this means that you could put a tear but

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.260 
this means that you could put a tear but
right<00:04:14.850> thing<00:04:16.670> let's<00:04:17.670> say<00:04:17.760> you<00:04:17.910> had<00:04:18.060> something

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
right thing let's say you had something

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.520 
right thing let's say you had something
like<00:04:18.480> this<00:04:19.370> this<00:04:20.370> is<00:04:20.489> pretty<00:04:20.610> pointless<00:04:20.940> but

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
like this this is pretty pointless but

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.570 
like this this is pretty pointless but
it's<00:04:22.530> just<00:04:22.650> showing<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:22.890> it's<00:04:23.070> possible<00:04:23.430> so

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
it's just showing that it's possible so

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.630 
it's just showing that it's possible so
this<00:04:23.700> one<00:04:23.850> is<00:04:23.940> facing<00:04:24.270> downwards<00:04:24.690> now<00:04:24.840> and

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
this one is facing downwards now and

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.210 
this one is facing downwards now and
none<00:04:26.640> of<00:04:26.790> these<00:04:26.910> are<00:04:27.090> actually<00:04:27.120> powered

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
none of these are actually powered

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.600 
none of these are actually powered
however<00:04:29.540> the<00:04:30.540> piston<00:04:30.870> underneath<00:04:31.200> here<00:04:31.610> will

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
however the piston underneath here will

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:49.820 
however the piston underneath here will
be<00:04:32.760> part<00:04:33.000> so<00:04:33.450> you<00:04:33.870> can<00:04:34.170> technically<00:04:48.680> with<00:04:49.680> this

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
be part so you can technically with this

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.280 
be part so you can technically with this
one<00:04:50.240> never<00:04:51.240> bothered<00:04:51.600> this<00:04:51.720> only<00:04:51.900> bothered

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
one never bothered this only bothered

00:04:52.290 --> 00:05:04.700 
one never bothered this only bothered
