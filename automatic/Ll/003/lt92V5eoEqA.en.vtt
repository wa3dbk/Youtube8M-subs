 makeshift and in this today's video 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.450
 just tell a short story about 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.240
 as I am 2002, already 12 years ago 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.660
 first worked with great 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.539
 tool like a graphics tablet 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.359
 business was so I got involved in 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.730
 tender ie competition between other 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.720

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.560
 I needed to create 7 works then 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:35.650
 for me it was a lot of money it 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.940
 It was somewhere for 700 dollars and I was 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.520
