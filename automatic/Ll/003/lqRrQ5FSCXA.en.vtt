00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
not this thing is going to be able to

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.720 
not this thing is going to be able to
fly<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.920> with<00:02:24.640> our<00:02:25.360> analysis<00:02:25.989> we<00:02:26.140> saw<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:26.730> the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
fly so with our analysis we saw that the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.360 
fly so with our analysis we saw that the
wing<00:02:27.970> by<00:02:28.570> itself<00:02:28.930> is<00:02:29.230> not<00:02:29.260> going<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.680> be<00:02:29.830> stable

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
wing by itself is not going to be stable

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.220 
wing by itself is not going to be stable
it's<00:02:30.489> not<00:02:30.610> going<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.880> be<00:02:30.940> trimmed<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.630> that

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
it's not going to be trimmed so that

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
it's not going to be trimmed so that
suggests<00:02:32.470> adding<00:02:34.200> some<00:02:35.200> more<00:02:35.350> surfaces<00:02:35.950> and

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
suggests adding some more surfaces and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.600 
suggests adding some more surfaces and
here<00:02:37.000> we<00:02:37.180> are<00:02:37.209> looking<00:02:37.450> at<00:02:37.900> adding<00:02:38.610> horizontal

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
here we are looking at adding horizontal

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.979 
here we are looking at adding horizontal
tail<00:02:40.390> section<00:02:41.880> horizontal<00:02:42.880> stabilizers<00:02:43.750> and

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
tail section horizontal stabilizers and

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.979 
tail section horizontal stabilizers and
we<00:02:44.470> can<00:02:44.680> then<00:02:45.489> go<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:45.940> do<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.150> longitudinal

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
we can then go and do a longitudinal

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.160 
we can then go and do a longitudinal
stability<00:02:47.350> analysis<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:48.489> combination

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
stability analysis for that combination

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.380 
stability analysis for that combination
unlike<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.680> first<00:02:50.860> stability<00:02:51.670> analysis<00:02:52.209> we

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
unlike the first stability analysis we

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.009 
unlike the first stability analysis we
see<00:02:52.600> now<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:54.220> aircraft<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.300> now<00:02:55.630> indeed

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
see now that the aircraft is now indeed

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.190 
see now that the aircraft is now indeed
stable<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:58.120> flying<00:02:58.450> at<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.810> trend

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
stable and it is flying at the trend

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.710 
stable and it is flying at the trend
condition<00:02:59.739> so<00:03:00.280> once<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:00.910> finished<00:03:01.060> we

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
condition so once that is finished we

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.930 
condition so once that is finished we
can<00:03:01.930> then<00:03:02.170> go<00:03:02.470> ahead<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.920> do<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.100> lateral

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
can then go ahead and do a lateral

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.640 
can then go ahead and do a lateral
stability<00:03:04.930> analysis<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:06.100> tells<00:03:06.340> us<00:03:06.640> Oh<00:03:07.650> Paul

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
stability analysis that tells us Oh Paul

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.720 
stability analysis that tells us Oh Paul
craft<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.190> going<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.519> react<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:11.340> slight<00:03:12.340> slip

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
craft is going to react to a slight slip

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.080 
craft is going to react to a slight slip
and<00:03:13.030> we<00:03:13.060> see<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.989> yeah<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:15.280> it's<00:03:15.640> not<00:03:15.790> doing

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
and we see that yeah the it's not doing

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.330 
and we see that yeah the it's not doing
a<00:03:16.239> very<00:03:16.269> good<00:03:16.540> job<00:03:16.720> because<00:03:17.079> all<00:03:17.590> we<00:03:17.769> have<00:03:17.980> are

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
a very good job because all we have are

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.880 
a very good job because all we have are
horizontal<00:03:19.000> surfaces<00:03:19.570> then<00:03:20.350> we<00:03:20.470> can<00:03:20.620> remedy

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
horizontal surfaces then we can remedy

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.810 
horizontal surfaces then we can remedy
this<00:03:21.459> by<00:03:21.519> adding<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.720> he<00:03:22.930> 12<00:03:23.260> angles<00:03:24.190> is<00:03:24.549> to

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
this by adding the he 12 angles is to

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.750 
this by adding the he 12 angles is to
tell<00:03:25.180> but<00:03:25.900> here<00:03:26.170> in<00:03:26.440> this<00:03:26.860> example<00:03:27.400> we're

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
tell but here in this example we're

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.280 
tell but here in this example we're
going<00:03:27.910> to<00:03:27.970> add<00:03:28.239> a<00:03:28.269> vertical<00:03:29.370> stabilizer<00:03:31.290> to

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
going to add a vertical stabilizer to

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.890 
going to add a vertical stabilizer to
true<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:33.010> our<00:03:33.310> model<00:03:33.820> airplane<00:03:34.239> that<00:03:34.420> we<00:03:34.600> or

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
true the our model airplane that we or

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.039 
true the our model airplane that we or
that<00:03:35.620> we're<00:03:35.769> building<00:03:36.190> here<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.810> we're<00:03:37.810> going

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
that we're building here and we're going

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.970 
that we're building here and we're going
to<00:03:38.109> then<00:03:38.290> look<00:03:38.530> at<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.660> stability<00:03:40.660> again<00:03:41.530> to

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
to then look at the stability again to

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.370 
to then look at the stability again to
see<00:03:42.220> whether<00:03:43.000> we<00:03:43.269> are<00:03:43.359> or<00:03:43.510> not<00:03:43.780> we<00:03:43.900> have<00:03:44.079> sized

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
see whether we are or not we have sized

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.099 
see whether we are or not we have sized
the<00:03:45.370> surfaces<00:03:45.940> correctly<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.930> see

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
the surfaces correctly and to see

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.199 
the surfaces correctly and to see
whether<00:03:47.290> we<00:03:47.530> have<00:03:47.560> on<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.930> desirable

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
whether we have on the desirable

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.530 
whether we have on the desirable
performance<00:03:52.209> so<00:03:53.170> we<00:03:53.500> added<00:03:53.709> a<00:03:53.920> vertical

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
performance so we added a vertical

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.270 
performance so we added a vertical
stabilizer<00:03:55.540> we<00:03:56.140> take<00:03:56.320> a<00:03:56.350> three-dimensional

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
stabilizer we take a three-dimensional

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.490 
stabilizer we take a three-dimensional
look<00:03:57.579> at<00:03:58.239> it<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.630> see

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
look at it and see

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.130 
look at it and see
how<00:04:01.910> it<00:04:02.910> looks<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:04.080> we<00:04:05.030> could<00:04:06.030> see<00:04:06.240> that<00:04:06.270> for

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
how it looks and we could see that for

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.280 
how it looks and we could see that for
the<00:04:07.260> skeleton<00:04:07.800> aircraft<00:04:08.220> we<00:04:08.660> definitely<00:04:09.660> see

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
the skeleton aircraft we definitely see

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.440 
the skeleton aircraft we definitely see
it's<00:04:11.190> beginning<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.670> look<00:04:11.970> like<00:04:12.270> a

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
it's beginning to look like a

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.290 
it's beginning to look like a
conventional<00:04:13.230> aircraft<00:04:14.270> for<00:04:15.270> the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
conventional aircraft for the

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.360 
conventional aircraft for the
longitudinal<00:04:15.600> pod<00:04:16.530> lateral<00:04:17.220> stability

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
longitudinal pod lateral stability

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.440 
longitudinal pod lateral stability
analysis<00:04:18.270> we<00:04:18.989> can<00:04:19.200> see<00:04:19.470> now<00:04:20.120> that<00:04:21.120> we<00:04:21.300> have

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
analysis we can see now that we have

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.290 
analysis we can see now that we have
some<00:04:21.660> more<00:04:21.690> desirable<00:04:22.430> conditions<00:04:23.430> less<00:04:23.910> for

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
some more desirable conditions less for

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.050 
some more desirable conditions less for
the<00:04:24.390> side<00:04:24.630> slip<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.470> we<00:04:26.310> can<00:04:26.490> also<00:04:26.640> look<00:04:26.910> at

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
the side slip and we can also look at

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.090 
the side slip and we can also look at
the<00:04:27.240> rate<00:04:27.450> of<00:04:27.600> rotation<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.470> rates<00:04:28.710> of<00:04:28.920> your

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
the rate of rotation the rates of your

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.830 
the rate of rotation the rates of your
we<00:04:29.880> get<00:04:30.540> them<00:04:30.830> from
