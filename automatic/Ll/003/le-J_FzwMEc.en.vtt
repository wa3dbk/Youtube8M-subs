on the map and then come up to the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.150 
on the map and then come up to the
archway<00:00:09.240> bit<00:00:09.420> here<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:10.590> what<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:10.920> wanted<00:00:11.099> to

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
archway bit here and what you wanted to

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.580 
archway bit here and what you wanted to
do<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.490> wiggle<00:00:11.940> your<00:00:12.240> left<00:00:12.540> analog<00:00:13.170> stick<00:00:13.200> from

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
do is wiggle your left analog stick from

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.200 
do is wiggle your left analog stick from
left<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.860> right<00:00:13.950> like<00:00:14.219> really<00:00:14.370> quickly<00:00:14.820> they

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
left to right like really quickly they

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.460 
left to right like really quickly they
make<00:00:15.389> sure<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.660> get<00:00:15.780> into<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.109> right<00:00:16.230> hand

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
make sure you get into the right hand

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.019 
make sure you get into the right hand
side<00:00:16.529> but<00:00:16.949> if<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.310> go<00:00:17.400> into<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.670> left<00:00:17.820> hand

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
side but if you go into the left hand

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.510 
side but if you go into the left hand
side<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.359> would<00:00:18.449> work<00:00:19.189> what<00:00:20.189> I've<00:00:20.340> done<00:00:20.460> here

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
side it would work what I've done here

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.640 
side it would work what I've done here
wants<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.000> get<00:00:21.150> into<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.390> bit<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.630> if<00:00:22.470> you're

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
wants to get into this bit is if you're

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.609 
wants to get into this bit is if you're
right<00:00:22.800> handed<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.369> would<00:00:23.460> help<00:00:23.580> if<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:24.619> wiggle

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
right handed it would help if you wiggle

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.200 
right handed it would help if you wiggle
the<00:00:25.949> left<00:00:25.980> analog<00:00:26.460> stick<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:26.939> your<00:00:27.060> right

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the left analog stick for your right

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.750 
the left analog stick for your right
hand<00:00:27.420> just<00:00:27.900> make<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.080> go<00:00:28.170> quicker<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.800> then

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
hand just make it go quicker and then

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.260 
hand just make it go quicker and then
eventually<00:00:31.550> takes<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.640> bit<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.790> time<00:00:32.880> you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
eventually takes a bit of time you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.610 
eventually takes a bit of time you
brought<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.480> prior<00:00:33.780> taking<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.140> few<00:00:34.260> tries<00:00:34.469> to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
brought a prior taking a few tries to

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.280 
brought a prior taking a few tries to
dip<00:00:34.800> once<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.219> get<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.550> worth<00:00:35.700> it

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
dip once you get in it's worth it

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.900 
dip once you get in it's worth it
eventually<00:00:37.290> they'll<00:00:37.410> get<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.680> here<00:00:38.040> get

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
eventually they'll get in here get

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.840 
eventually they'll get in here get
underneath<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.540> map<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.680> then<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.640> follow

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
underneath the map and then a you follow

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.869 
underneath the map and then a you follow
what<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.149> do<00:00:44.120> walk<00:00:45.120> around<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:46.670> or<00:00:47.670> some

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
what I do walk around here or some

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.459 
what I do walk around here or some
invisible<00:00:48.329> barrier<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> echo

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
invisible barrier so you have to echo

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.119 
invisible barrier so you have to echo
like<00:00:49.620> exactly<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:51.420> way<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.570> I'm<00:00:51.750> going<00:00:52.129> then

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
like exactly the way that I'm going then

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.590 
like exactly the way that I'm going then
if<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.370> come<00:00:53.610> around<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.600> just

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
if you come around here you can just

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.270 
if you come around here you can just
easily<00:00:57.600> hop<00:00:58.050> up<00:00:58.230> save<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> map<00:00:58.739> look<00:00:58.920> I'm<00:00:59.070> work

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
easily hop up save the map look I'm work

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.049 
easily hop up save the map look I'm work
today<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:01.100> then<00:01:02.100> there<00:01:02.340> from<00:01:02.579> here<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.969> can

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
today and then there from here you can

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.630 
today and then there from here you can
go<00:01:03.270> many<00:01:03.809> places<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.589> gonna<00:01:05.369> fast<00:01:05.580> forward

a bit here show you how to get on top of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.890 
a bit here show you how to get on top of
one<00:01:08.220> moans<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.790> got<00:01:08.939> an<00:01:09.060> excellent<00:01:09.330> overview

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
one moans you got an excellent overview

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.500 
one moans you got an excellent overview
the<00:01:10.200> map<00:01:10.549> and<00:01:11.549> ass<00:01:11.909> collect<00:01:12.180> you'll<00:01:12.299> probably

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the map and ass collect you'll probably

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 
the map and ass collect you'll probably
get<00:01:12.720> patched<00:01:13.020> sooner<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.130> lawyer<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.850> that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
get patched sooner and lawyer know that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.179 
get patched sooner and lawyer know that
I<00:01:15.320> wouldn't<00:01:16.320> recommend<00:01:16.500> doing<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.920> online

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
online multiple things so it's not

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.069 
online multiple things so it's not
really<00:01:27.930> worth<00:01:28.259> it

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.190
