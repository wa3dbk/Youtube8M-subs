00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:28.509
 because they feel they are dancing they hear is one 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.449
 which is symptomatic when one hears 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:34.989
 listen to music maybe even 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:39.160
 classical and to feel the body that yes 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:42.750
 moves to the rhythm of music 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.750
 and this is a signal 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.790
 children must be passionate 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.059
 that is, they must not be led by 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.739
 parents must be the ones who love the 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.739
 dance because it is a great sacrifice 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.450
 all things can help bring 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.910
 bring children closer to the world of 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.730
 ballet that clearly to me is 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.760
 wonderful but I think all of them 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:45.750
 that come closer then they are captured 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.200
 it is difficult from this passion 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.630
 difficult then to take the lagoon out of the body 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.710
 in short, very difficult to be barbie 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.300
 that is something else but also if it is 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.460
 let's say the tool to approach 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.460
 of the classical dance carla well 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.360
 he was sick 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.840
 watch 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.790
 but it's row 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.410
 then 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.710
 and stuff 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.710
 here 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.760
 It was a dancer no no 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.180
 never forget my sight said until 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.390
 200 years you will be dancers and it is true 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.000
 you remain in the tool inserted circles of 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.910
 transmit all your emotions all 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.840
 your experiences to other children 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.700
 but in the end she lived and therefore the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.739
 come back to relive through these 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.890
 children and it is very exciting 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.870
 I tell all parents I followed 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.230
 your children look at what they want 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.989
 do is good to follow 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.299
 look carefully their utterances their 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.299
 gestures because they mean many things 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.400
 it's really an incredible thing
