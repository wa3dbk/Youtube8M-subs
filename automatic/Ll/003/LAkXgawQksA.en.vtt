00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.009
 i'm going to make a recipe that is soon sounds a bit sophisticated 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.089
 but that really is quite 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.339
 is with us 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:33.850
 juliana álvarez 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.900
 who will teach us this delicious dish 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.370
 now global with the partition 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.250
 good tell us what ingredients we are going to use today 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.290
 well the following thing we are going to use are onion leek cpi cambodians 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.720
 half a cup of vinegar brown sugar French bread this contingency or change the 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.650
 Camembert cheese but the builders of what will be the recipe what counts 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.060
 well because its people 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.120
 perfect now he attended 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.390
 we were not all these delicious ingredients, let's start with the preparation 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.550
 from our recent 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.460
 well we are using then for 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.740
 sauté the onion so olive we can use onion leek with red onion 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.110
 I'm going to launch any of the three goyas works very well 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.060
 state of parana that we get to do not only serves for this matter but 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.130
 also to accompany sanchez napoles 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.140
 jean sarkozy for salads and for salads to Argentine 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.310
 well then we have this hot age 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.070
 you have to make the onion finely if in julienne 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.500
 it does not have to be very fine to tell us that that famous for the cut 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.660
 because that after it caramelizes let's reduce the size 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.680
 the important thing is that the oil is hot 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.680
 so the onion went to pray well and did not release us jul 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.730
 if we put the security 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.280
 then it was born and the innocent stars attend to sanz the few and 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.280
 there was the one full of art 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.700
 then remember what you have to do 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.330
 Oil 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.300
 in Cali 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.219
 let's leave it and clear villa 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.339
 has chosen not which one to leave is a gem that does not have much liquidity 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.699
 but the same thing happens with the white onion 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.929
 if we leave it with the pan very hot two of the starry jewels 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:21.929
 hour 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:26.419
 the projections are similar or expensive jewels have been activated by the 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.009
 heat also from the art 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:30.769
 well here we have then our jewelry that has 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.420
 the doraditos that we needed we are going to add estrabón this charge do not walk in 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.259
 any supermarket in the bags of herbs 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.449
 without fear because this one is not less invasive that order highlighted 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.719
 It gives a lot of aroma but while central casino hacienda in the market 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.909
 hotels of about a quarter of these 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.929
 or three tablespoons a sachet is saying a lot then here we have the state 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.209
 let's add brown sugar 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.370
 can do can do it with brown sugar occupy and tenacity and scratched 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:06.009
 It is also a very good idea 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:07.609
 is to scare brown 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.609
 a cup of brown sugar 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.930
 the important thing is first that the burner is on a high heat 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:21.219
 to brown the onion 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:23.860
 already in this case we're going to karen elizabeth to 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.259
 they can do it on a low heat and they can not leave there for long 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:30.259
 he ensures that he has 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:32.799
 many here you hd 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.930
 if it is going to stay like the candy of the area the green color 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.299
 of the ceoe either of lack if the acting rebels swallow 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.119
 the theory with sugar loses its strong flavor true 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:47.709
 if it is not like before and now the onion 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.459
 It also has sugars and there are even people who are caramelizing the onion 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.229
 alone without sugar but it is a process that takes much longer the same 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.579
 is letting go process 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.739
 then here we have the top scorer special touches 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.949
 chili for channel 13 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.289
 very much in mind because he has his 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:10.419
 some small good conscience and 97 and 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.779
 we are going to put here a little slice complain 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:16.479
 those created 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.479
 the couple 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.509
 As I was saying right now you can change Camembert cheese because 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:25.620
 we suffer 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.650
 but this is a lot that despite being a strong subject 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:31.259
 with bronze it combines very well 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.479
 kings not only for example with caramelized onions can also 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.340
 test 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.550
 I answered that we dominate and therefore propose in the microwave 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.479
 with a little bit of honey and the minute more the spectacular equity 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.890
 this one can be replaced by the title 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.890
 the ts too 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.129
 this knife this series 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.340
 so the rope itself allow free enterprise 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.550
 well then 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.819
 let's put it out 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.819
 and we are putting the security 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.779
 Miss can put it cold 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:10.879
 they can only put the client like this so that it warms up a little and that enough 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.279
 that is to say 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:19.740
 and we are accommodating them in our profession 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.270
 if they want them patricia then meanwhile local bow 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.279
 in the cajasol tower we are putting ourselves in the tower 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:28.419
 it does not necessarily have to be that way 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.419
 so the actor has launched in Madrid 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.339
 they look so much like they have different levels 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.870
 the time has come for the presentation of the food to be 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.669
 novel and 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.360
 and apart from this 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.350
 surprise as I say 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.259
 to his friends 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.539
 puccini for questions to be accredited 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.569
 for all this serves that these take serve for all 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.770
 As far as things are done, things are very good. Julian, now you make us 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.659
 a brief account of how we got to this point 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:08.099
 well then we have the pan very hot with olive oil 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.639
 sauté the onion no matter how golden 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.580
 we are already the brown sugar the minagri who locked 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:18.499
 we add a little salt leaves room to increase safety 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.039
 and the terms of the boxes 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:22.309
 in this contest 

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:25.069
