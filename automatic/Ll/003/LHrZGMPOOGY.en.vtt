I<00:01:28.799> think<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.369> huge<00:01:29.610> point<00:01:29.909> when<00:01:30.030> you're

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
I think that's a huge point when you're

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.370 
I think that's a huge point when you're
talking<00:01:30.329> about<00:01:30.420> portability<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.229> you're

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
talking about portability so you're

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.380

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
talking about under four and a half

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.289 
talking about under four and a half
