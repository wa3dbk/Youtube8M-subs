look at all the factors now I think this

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.229 
look at all the factors now I think this
early<00:00:32.559> second<00:00:33.370> round<00:00:33.489> is<00:00:33.640> about<00:00:33.730> as<00:00:34.030> good<00:00:34.089> as

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239

surprises even see him slide to the
third<00:00:37.179> round<00:00:37.359> so<00:00:37.629> I<00:00:37.660> think<00:00:37.929> you're<00:00:38.019> talking

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:38.289 
third round so I think you're talking

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:40.439
