G in hopes that it would take all the
cancerous<00:03:04.870> cells<00:03:05.200> i<00:03:05.379> was<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:05.620> our<00:03:05.739> body<00:03:05.950> out<00:03:06.269> um

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
cancerous cells i was in our body out um

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.339 
cancerous cells i was in our body out um
about<00:03:09.069> two<00:03:09.129> months<00:03:09.519> ago<00:03:09.730> we<00:03:10.510> had<00:03:10.870> tests<00:03:11.170> done

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
about two months ago we had tests done

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.789 
about two months ago we had tests done
on<00:03:11.410> her<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:12.090> we<00:03:13.090> found<00:03:13.299> out<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.799> the

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
on her and we found out that the

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.559 
on her and we found out that the
treatment<00:03:15.190> didn't<00:03:15.400> work<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:16.120> way<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.329> we

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
treatment didn't work the way that we

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.490 
treatment didn't work the way that we
thought<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.930> would<00:03:17.549> so<00:03:18.660> we<00:03:19.660> went<00:03:19.840> back<00:03:19.959> in<00:03:20.290> with

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
thought it would so we went back in with

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.349 
thought it would so we went back in with
the<00:03:20.620> doctors<00:03:21.069> and<00:03:21.459> we<00:03:21.700> sat<00:03:21.940> down<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.180> we

talked with them and they gave us

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.610 
talked with them and they gave us
another<00:03:25.090> option<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.569> we<00:03:25.750> can<00:03:25.900> try<00:03:26.109> to<00:03:26.169> remove

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
another option that we can try to remove

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.289

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
hard they gave us two different options

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:47.640 
hard they gave us two different options
of<00:03:43.799> chemo<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:45.870> what<00:03:46.870> they<00:03:47.019> do<00:03:47.079> with<00:03:47.500> this

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
of chemo and what they do with this

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.890 
of chemo and what they do with this
chemo<00:03:48.069> is<00:03:48.220> they<00:03:48.400> put<00:03:48.579> anybody<00:03:49.180> on<00:03:49.299> top<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.810> the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
chemo is they put anybody on top of the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.909 
chemo is they put anybody on top of the
chemo<00:03:50.430> which<00:03:51.569> again<00:03:52.569> tries<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:53.109> attack<00:03:53.380> the

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
chemo which again tries to attack the

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.580 
chemo which again tries to attack the
cancer<00:03:54.130> cells<00:03:54.639> that<00:03:54.790> are<00:03:54.849> left<00:03:55.060> in<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.269> body

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
cancer cells that are left in the body

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.409 
cancer cells that are left in the body
but<00:03:56.590> this<00:03:56.739> time<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.160> was<00:03:57.250> different<00:03:57.280> from<00:03:58.239> the

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
but this time it was different from the

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.050 
but this time it was different from the
MIB<00:03:58.720> G<00:03:59.109> because<00:03:59.530> we<00:04:00.459> didn't<00:04:00.730> know<00:04:00.790> which

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
MIB G because we didn't know which

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.150 
MIB G because we didn't know which
medicine<00:04:01.569> they<00:04:01.690> was<00:04:01.840> going<00:04:01.989> to<00:04:02.049> give<00:04:02.230> her<00:04:02.410> with

medicine they was going to give her with

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.369 
medicine they was going to give her with
this<00:04:03.340> treatment<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:04.150> was<00:04:04.930> just<00:04:05.109> a<00:04:05.200> random

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
this treatment it was just a random

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.500 
this treatment it was just a random
selection<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:06.669> what<00:04:06.819> you<00:04:06.970> would<00:04:07.060> do<00:04:07.269> is<00:04:07.480> you

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
selection so what you would do is you

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.390 
selection so what you would do is you
would<00:04:08.440> tell<00:04:08.739> them<00:04:08.799> that<00:04:08.919> you<00:04:09.040> want<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.250> be<00:04:09.310> a

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.099 
would tell them that you want to be a
part<00:04:09.700> of<00:04:09.790> treatment<00:04:10.299> they<00:04:10.690> will<00:04:10.840> put<00:04:11.019> your

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
part of treatment they will put your

but the hardest thing with me picking

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.430 
but the hardest thing with me picking
this<00:05:23.570> past<00:05:23.840> treatment<00:05:24.290> was<00:05:24.410> I<00:05:25.840> honestly<00:05:26.840> felt

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
this past treatment was I honestly felt

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.520 
this past treatment was I honestly felt
as<00:05:28.060> though<00:05:29.060> my<00:05:29.680> daughter<00:05:31.419> was<00:05:32.419> some<00:05:33.200> sort<00:05:33.440> of

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
as though my daughter was some sort of

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.550 
as though my daughter was some sort of
scientific<00:05:34.220> tests<00:05:34.610> that<00:05:35.419> we<00:05:36.080> didn't<00:05:36.350> know

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
scientific tests that we didn't know

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.340 
scientific tests that we didn't know
whether<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:38.510> treatment<00:05:38.750> was<00:05:38.960> going<00:05:39.139> to<00:05:39.200> work

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
whether the treatment was going to work

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.500 
whether the treatment was going to work
but<00:05:40.040> we<00:05:40.220> was<00:05:40.340> going<00:05:40.490> to<00:05:40.520> try<00:05:40.760> and<00:05:40.850> hopes<00:05:41.300> that

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
but we was going to try and hopes that

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.659 
but we was going to try and hopes that
it<00:05:41.780> helps<00:05:42.320> people<00:05:42.680> find<00:05:42.830> a<00:05:43.010> cure<00:05:43.250> for<00:05:43.340> cancer

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
and it saved my daughter's life and that

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.270 
and it saved my daughter's life and that
really<00:05:47.360> hurt<00:05:47.600> me<00:05:47.810> hard<00:05:48.020> because<00:05:48.169> I<00:05:48.620> feel<00:05:48.980> like

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.340 
really hurt me hard because I feel like
no<00:05:49.610> child<00:05:49.970> should<00:05:50.300> be<00:05:50.780> treated<00:05:51.200> like<00:05:51.320> that

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
no child should be treated like that

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.350 
no child should be treated like that
they<00:05:51.830> shouldn't<00:05:52.160> be<00:05:52.250> an<00:05:52.490> experiment<00:05:52.970> to<00:05:53.210> find

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
they shouldn't be an experiment to find

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.890 
they shouldn't be an experiment to find
out<00:05:53.690> whether<00:05:53.930> any<00:05:54.590> medicines<00:05:55.160> work<00:05:55.900> from

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900
