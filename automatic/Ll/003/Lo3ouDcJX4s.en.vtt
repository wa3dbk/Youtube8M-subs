use no i mean you can you can see that
really<00:02:28.510> clearly<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.080> diamond<00:02:29.440> stuff<00:02:29.740> so<00:02:29.920> you

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
really clearly the diamond stuff so you

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.710 
really clearly the diamond stuff so you
know<00:02:30.040> you're<00:02:30.220> playing<00:02:30.340> some<00:02:30.700> type<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:30.910> game

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
mode you get to see them quickly and

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.740 
mode you get to see them quickly and
this<00:02:33.520> is<00:02:33.700> what<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.000> other<00:02:34.120> textures<00:02:34.630> look

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750

like water is this lava is this default
and<00:02:39.610> yeah<00:02:39.910> so<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.210> is<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.480> for<00:02:40.630> this<00:02:40.720> pack<00:02:40.990> um

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
and yeah so this is it for this pack um

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.110 
and yeah so this is it for this pack um
actually<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.340> forgot<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.670> show<00:02:42.850> you<00:02:42.880> one<00:02:43.090> other

the UM food looks like there's back you
can<00:03:01.960> see<00:03:01.990> the<00:03:02.200> heart<00:03:02.410> right<00:03:02.650> there<00:03:02.680> the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
can see the heart right there the

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.860 
can see the heart right there the
proximity<00:03:03.460> I<00:03:03.850> may<00:03:04.150> change<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.540> color<00:03:04.780> the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
proximity I may change the color the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.620 
proximity I may change the color the
hearts<00:03:05.350> between<00:03:05.770> now<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.520> download<00:03:06.970> but

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
hearts between now and the download but

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.780 
hearts between now and the download but
it's<00:03:07.810> probably<00:03:08.320> is<00:03:08.500> going<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.680> be<00:03:08.740> red<00:03:08.920> or<00:03:08.950> just
