safety standards and are legal for road

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.300 
safety standards and are legal for road

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
usage that means you can run them

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.620 
usage that means you can run them
without<00:01:10.580> a<00:01:10.640> problem<00:01:10.850> because<00:01:11.090> they<00:01:11.270> do<00:01:11.330> meet

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630

the<00:01:11.890> Department<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:12.950> Transportation<00:01:13.780> safety

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
the Department of Transportation safety

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.210 
the Department of Transportation safety
standards<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:15.320> these<00:01:15.470> are<00:01:15.590> absolutely<00:01:16.010> 100%

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
standards so these are absolutely 100%

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.240 
standards so these are absolutely 100%
safe<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.210> run<00:01:17.420> I<00:01:18.050> would<00:01:18.440> actually<00:01:18.560> say<00:01:18.830> safer

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
safe to run I would actually say safer

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.920 
safe to run I would actually say safer
than<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:19.490> stock<00:01:19.790> lines<00:01:20.060> just<00:01:20.420> because<00:01:20.720> of<00:01:20.840> the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
than the stock lines just because of the

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.350 
than the stock lines just because of the
extra<00:01:21.260> protection<00:01:21.380> of<00:01:21.860> them<00:01:21.980> and<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:23.030> course

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
extra protection of them and of course

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.690 
extra protection of them and of course
the<00:01:23.600> obvious<00:01:23.720> benefit<00:01:24.410> of<00:01:24.650> running<00:01:25.130> stainless

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
the obvious benefit of running stainless

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.690 
the obvious benefit of running stainless
steel<00:01:25.910> line<00:01:26.120> is<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:26.720> they<00:01:26.930> do<00:01:26.990> not<00:01:27.400> flex<00:01:28.400> or<00:01:28.670> I

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
steel line is that they do not flex or I

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.840 
steel line is that they do not flex or I
should<00:01:28.909> say<00:01:29.140> expand<00:01:30.140> your<00:01:31.010> stock<00:01:31.340> rubber

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
should say expand your stock rubber

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.870 
should say expand your stock rubber
lines<00:01:32.180> although<00:01:32.420> they<00:01:32.659> do<00:01:32.720> have

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
lines although they do have

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.860 
lines although they do have
reinforcements<00:01:34.880> in<00:01:34.970> them<00:01:35.090> under<00:01:35.690> hard

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
reinforcements in them under hard

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.450 
reinforcements in them under hard
braking<00:01:35.930> they'll<00:01:36.409> actually<00:01:36.590> beam<00:01:36.950> out<00:01:37.280> a

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
braking they'll actually beam out a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.450 
braking they'll actually beam out a
little<00:01:37.730> bit<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:39.070> you<00:01:40.070> know<00:01:40.190> why<00:01:40.310> you're<00:01:40.430> not

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
little bit and you know why you're not

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.250 
little bit and you know why you're not
gonna<00:01:40.670> lose<00:01:40.909> braking<00:01:41.360> performance<00:01:41.480> with<00:01:42.080> it

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
gonna lose braking performance with it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.230 
gonna lose braking performance with it
it<00:01:42.440> gets<00:01:42.830> rid<00:01:43.040> of<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.250> fuel<00:01:43.550> basically<00:01:44.060> makes

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
it gets rid of the fuel basically makes

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.750 
it gets rid of the fuel basically makes
the<00:01:44.330> brakes<00:01:44.570> feel<00:01:44.780> more<00:01:44.990> vague<00:01:45.340> vague<00:01:46.340> I

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
the brakes feel more vague vague I

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.090 
the brakes feel more vague vague I
should<00:01:47.240> say<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:47.750> so<00:01:48.320> any<00:01:48.620> time<00:01:48.800> you<00:01:48.890> install

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
should say and so any time you install

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.560 
should say and so any time you install
stainless<00:01:49.520> steel<00:01:49.700> brake<00:01:49.909> lines<00:01:50.150> and<00:01:50.360> stuff<00:01:50.450> it

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
stainless steel brake lines and stuff it

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.180 
stainless steel brake lines and stuff it
gonna<00:01:50.690> help<00:01:50.900> firm<00:01:51.140> up<00:01:51.170> that<00:01:51.500> pedal<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:52.130> just

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
gonna help firm up that pedal and just

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.610 
gonna help firm up that pedal and just
make<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.720> braking<00:01:53.720> feel<00:01:53.870> much<00:01:54.050> more<00:01:54.229> direct

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
make the braking feel much more direct

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.340 
make the braking feel much more direct
and<00:01:54.800> responsive<00:01:55.370> which<00:01:55.520> I<00:01:55.729> absolutely<00:01:55.970> love

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
and responsive which I absolutely love

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
alright so a couple things about these

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.420 
alright so a couple things about these
lines<00:01:59.690> of<00:01:59.900> course<00:02:00.110> full<00:02:00.710> stainless<00:02:01.040> steel

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
lines of course full stainless steel

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.450 
lines of course full stainless steel
they<00:02:02.000> come<00:02:02.150> with<00:02:02.299> all<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:03.159> stock<00:02:04.159> like

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
they come with all the stock like

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.219 
they come with all the stock like
mounting<00:02:05.150> hardware<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:05.570> these<00:02:05.659> will<00:02:05.840> bolt<00:02:06.049> up

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
mounting hardware so these will bolt up

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.990

just<00:02:30.480> fantastic<00:02:31.050> lines<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.709> like<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
just fantastic lines I like the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.150 
just fantastic lines I like the
Goodridge<00:02:33.750> label<00:02:34.530> there<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:34.890> little

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
Goodridge label there on that little

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.580 
Goodridge label there on that little
yellow<00:02:35.310> tag<00:02:35.990> that's<00:02:38.360> kind<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.540> beacon<00:02:39.989> for

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
yellow tag that's kind of the beacon for

yellow tag that's kind of the beacon for
these<00:02:40.739> Goodridge<00:02:41.130> lines<00:02:41.600> right<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.750> that

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
these Goodridge lines right is that

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.979 
these Goodridge lines right is that
little<00:02:43.140> yellow<00:02:43.260> tag<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.760> then<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.239> course<00:02:45.270> I

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
little yellow tag and then of course I

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.720 
little yellow tag and then of course I
just<00:02:46.680> wanted<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.980> show<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.370> other<00:02:47.489> line

just wanted to show you the other line

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.540 
just wanted to show you the other line
here<00:02:48.000> again<00:02:48.480> utilizing<00:02:49.440> all<00:02:50.010> factory

like<00:02:53.370> stock<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.780> I'm<00:02:55.080> guessing<00:02:55.470> these

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
like stock and I'm guessing these

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.080 
like stock and I'm guessing these

course especially if you're going out to
the<00:03:44.340> track<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.940> should<00:03:45.090> replace<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:45.480> stock

the track you should replace a stock
food<00:03:46.019> anyway<00:03:46.560> just<00:03:47.489> because<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.880> does<00:03:48.000> have<00:03:48.150> a

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
food anyway just because it does have a

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.390 
food anyway just because it does have a
higher<00:03:48.390> chance<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.810> boiling<00:03:49.230> over<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.860> so

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
higher chance of boiling over and so

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.100 
higher chance of boiling over and so
that<00:03:50.579> would<00:03:50.670> be<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.820> great<00:03:51.209> time<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.510> upgrade<00:03:51.870> to

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
that would be a great time to upgrade to

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.479 
that would be a great time to upgrade to
stainless<00:03:52.440> steel<00:03:52.709> lines<00:03:52.890> as<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.100> will<00:03:53.340> have

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
stainless steel lines as you will have

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.270 
stainless steel lines as you will have
