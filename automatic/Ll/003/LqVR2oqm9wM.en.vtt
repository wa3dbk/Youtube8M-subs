you got for $2000 but sometimes life is
more<00:00:15.240> about<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.630> realistic<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.500> simplistic

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
more about the realistic and simplistic

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.609 
more about the realistic and simplistic
things<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:18.060> instance<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:19.199> Jeep<00:00:19.439> Wrangler

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.560 

so<00:00:30.640> what<00:00:30.880> do<00:00:30.970> you<00:00:31.029> get<00:00:31.180> when<00:00:31.300> you<00:00:31.390> take

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
so what do you get when you take

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.160 
so what do you get when you take
off-road<00:00:32.230> capability<00:00:32.890> and<00:00:33.190> cheap<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.960> bring

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
off-road capability and cheap you bring

this<00:00:41.350> cars<00:00:41.590> that<00:00:41.710> really<00:00:41.890> changed<00:00:42.220> much<00:00:42.340> since

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
this cars that really changed much since

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.310 
this cars that really changed much since
the<00:00:42.730> 1940s<00:00:43.510> I<00:00:43.600> mean<00:00:43.780> that's<00:00:44.140> when<00:00:44.260> they

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
the 1940s I mean that's when they

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.569 
the 1940s I mean that's when they
started<00:00:44.620> building<00:00:44.739> them<00:00:44.980> for<00:00:45.129> the<00:00:45.250> army<00:00:45.550> and

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
started building them for the army and

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.610 
started building them for the army and
the<00:00:45.820> GIS<00:00:46.150> out<00:00:46.570> overseas<00:00:46.960> you<00:00:47.320> know<00:00:47.379> there's

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
the GIS out overseas you know there's

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.720 
the GIS out overseas you know there's
been<00:00:47.739> many<00:00:47.920> variants<00:00:48.340> over<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:48.580> years

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
been many variants over the years

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.130 
been many variants over the years
they've<00:00:48.879> used<00:00:49.059> it<00:00:49.210> for<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.360> postal<00:00:49.780> service

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
they've used it for the postal service

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.780 
they've used it for the postal service
and<00:00:50.320> stuff<00:00:50.500> like<00:00:50.680> that<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.250> although

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
and stuff like that and although

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.700 
and stuff like that and although
technology<00:00:52.150> has<00:00:52.480> evolved<00:00:52.989> in<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.170> Jeep<00:00:53.410> and

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
technology has evolved in the Jeep and

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.320 
technology has evolved in the Jeep and
it's<00:00:54.220> kind<00:00:54.370> of<00:00:54.400> taking<00:00:54.730> precedence<00:00:54.940> I<00:00:55.150> mean<00:00:55.269> we

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
it's kind of taking precedence I mean we

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.700 
it's kind of taking precedence I mean we
have<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.449> touchscreen<00:00:55.930> navigation<00:00:55.960> for

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
have a touchscreen navigation for

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.610 
have a touchscreen navigation for
instance<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:58.030> problem<00:00:58.390> is<00:00:58.510> it<00:00:59.050> still<00:00:59.350> kind<00:00:59.530> of

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
instance the problem is it still kind of

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.200 
instance the problem is it still kind of
feels<00:00:59.800> like<00:00:59.890> it's<00:01:00.010> back<00:01:00.430> in<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.640> 1940s

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
feels like it's back in the 1940s

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.700 
feels like it's back in the 1940s
because<00:01:01.629> I<00:01:01.659> mean<00:01:01.780> for<00:01:02.140> example<00:01:02.470> look<00:01:02.589> at<00:01:02.619> the

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
because I mean for example look at the

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.859 
because I mean for example look at the
transmission<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:04.180> looks<00:01:04.420> like<00:01:04.540> it's<00:01:04.659> from<00:01:04.750> a

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
transmission it looks like it's from a

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.620 
transmission it looks like it's from a
school<00:01:05.049> bus<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.409> you<00:01:05.500> shift<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:06.510> that's<00:01:07.510> as

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
school bus and you shift it that's as

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.420 
school bus and you shift it that's as
good<00:01:07.750> as<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:07.990> gets<00:01:08.110> you<00:01:08.409> can't<00:01:08.920> power<00:01:09.100> ship

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
good as it gets you can't power ship

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.990 
good as it gets you can't power ship
this<00:01:09.610> thing<00:01:09.880> I<00:01:10.260> mean<00:01:11.260> it<00:01:11.650> rattles<00:01:12.369> all<00:01:12.580> over

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
this thing I mean it rattles all over

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.460 
this thing I mean it rattles all over
the<00:01:13.090> place<00:01:13.270> is<00:01:13.390> just<00:01:13.540> jitter<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.140> all<00:01:14.260> over

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
the place is just jitter and all over

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.539 
the place is just jitter and all over
like<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.650> little<00:01:14.830> jitterbug<00:01:15.250> I<00:01:15.340> don't<00:01:15.490> know

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
like a little jitterbug I don't know

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.490 
like a little jitterbug I don't know
what<00:01:15.670> else<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.970> say<00:01:16.180> and<00:01:16.479> I<00:01:16.930> mean<00:01:17.229> it's<00:01:17.380> just
