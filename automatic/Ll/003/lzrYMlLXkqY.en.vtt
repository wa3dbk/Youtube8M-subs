00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 I want so much for all the kids 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.600
 risk today we are here with the analysis 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.960
 of the second dlc for call of duty ghost 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.750
 it's about devastation includes 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.080
 four new multiplayer maps of the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.029
 medium small size and chapter 2 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.820
 of extension treats of may day 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.600
 so let's go immediately to discover this 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.600
 leadership 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:46.040
 the first map we see is 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:48.860
 he in a very small map is made 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.920
 more or less in a triangle and is in the 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.000
 South America and is characterized by gods 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.710
 temples 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.650
 you remember slightly jean screaming 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.710
 anyway a very small map 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.890
 in which domain it will be a lot 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.710
 difficult and the peculiarity of this 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.500
 map is that if we can complete it 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.560
 rewards through the briefcase 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.780
 we will be able to completely detonate a 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.270
 volcano that is nearby and 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:22.100
 then rain billions of stones 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.600
 glowing on protection but doing so 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.640
 all enemies may even be given to us 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.649
 us but these calls of duty are fine 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.119
 and this is what we like 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:34.070
 then we go to Beijing a lot map 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.610
 in fact we play very particular 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.560
 above a huge digger than even 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.149
 this reminds me of something in the area 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.790
 in fact it reminds me of and excavators of 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.040
 moon but it's ok let's move on yes 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.060
 is a map precisely panic 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.940
 because it is long and very high from the ground 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.610
 so watch out for kids 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.470
 which is a moment and even here the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.810
 peculiarity there is in leaving of 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.479
 killings in particular if we complete 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.540
 the briefcase in fact we will have to 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.490
 available a helicopter from which 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.440
 we could shoot with a mini run I think 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.880
 which is a destructive thing and 100 per 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.769
 one hundred 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.890
 will make a series of impressive deaths 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.310
 but alright let's move on let's move on to 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.550
 collision 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.740
 another very small average map 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.700
 we say they are all very small these 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:32.090
 maps and in this map we find ourselves on 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.150
 a ship bars a bridge because the ship 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.730
 goods collided against the bridge e 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.550
 so we are in the middle of it 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:46.070
 choose whether to play on the ship or 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.320
 staying on bridges is a suitable map either 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.190
 for snipers for all the others 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.620
 here too we have a series of weapons 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.890
 destructive killings indeed if 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.260
 we complete as always in the briefcase 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.310
 we can use a very curved plane 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.640
 a raid like that 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.010
 and with this we will really kill everyone 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.800
 enemies because of places to hide 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.260
 I haven't seen so many last map 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:21.710
 multiplayer guys this is harnett 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.680
 it is an umpteenth seen remake 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.420
 that we have already discovered that don judges 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.160
 map of modern warfare 3 was already 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.800
 present in this call of duty ghost 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.430
 the developers want to propose us 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:38.420
 another slightly more imaginative remake 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:42.620
 in fact we are in an archaeological site e 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:46.490
 this map is if not particular one 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.640
 what is an extraordinary mixture they have 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.860
 wanted to do those of infinity ward 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.990
 in fact what we would have of details 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.190
 this map besides that goes well is a 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.730
 remake dawn 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.490
 but something particular with the completion 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.270
 of the briefcase we could call three 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:08.750
 come backstage that will kill ours 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.610
 enemies exploding and more 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.550
 through an easter egg and that developers 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:18.470
 they didn't want to regulate us we can 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:21.170
 unlocking is not killing ours 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.980
 friends then a mixed map with and 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.480
 station 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.800
 surely there will be a 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:30.100
 awesome casino but ok this one 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:39.880
 really like it especially now 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:44.120
 comes the second chapter may day 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.290
 we are in the ship where we saw the 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.540
 doctor in the last episode 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:54.680
 trapped by a now abandoned ship e 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.990
 our characters are here for and have 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.910
 answers rather than answers 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.490
 they will find two new aliens is one 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.410
 plant that is not understood if not 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.980
 the boxes will come highly 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.710
 the 22 new aliens are the siders of the 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.240
 types of scorpions will indeed launch the 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.610
 from their mouth they are a lot 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.180
 similar but probably faster 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:23.750
 because they are much smaller and second 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.630
 I show the kraken a monster of 100 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.690
 feet much taller than the 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.300
 previous that we find in chapter 1 e 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:36.320
 I have not yet figured out how we can 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.870
 kill him but it will be a big mess 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.670
 having said this and in this map we will find 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.310
 traps I saw traps 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.680
 electric I saw new keys 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.150
 that they will manage to reveal perhaps 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.890
 something more than this story 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:54.620
 and we also have dark alleys 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:57.230
 in which we can find some 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.030
 objects developers said with 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.630
 which we can help ours 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.390
 team 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.780
 so these are the various novelties 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:08.990
 also available from today guys 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:12.340
 and run everyone wanted to release 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:15.950
 the rapper is a special weapon 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:19.190
 it is a 2 in 1 weapon indeed yes 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.930
 it's a submachine gun with one 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.660
 snap of fingers turns into a 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:27.800
 assault rifle with a viewfinder that 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:30.590
 will appear holographically in front and yes 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.690
 it is a very destructive weapon and 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.850
 maximum said they are very powerful 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.770
 obviously it will be over power then for 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.880
 all those who have an xbox 360 or 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.700
 the xbox one 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.460
 I advise you to go immediately to try 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.190
 this weapon to let us know how then 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.630
 in the comments tell us how difficult this is 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.790
 because I want to talk about fishing 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.880
 this is the second dlc will be available 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.510
 on April 3rd exclusive of course 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.910
 xbox 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:59.540
 obviously a month later for those in 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:02.690
 playstation like or pc so not 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.860
 I add other Tantawi guys for everyone 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.860
 he is a serious friend
