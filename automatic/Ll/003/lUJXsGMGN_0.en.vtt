hi<00:00:06.210> Georgia<00:00:06.750> again<00:00:07.020> with<00:00:07.259> puking<00:00:07.589> pastilles

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
hi Georgia again with puking pastilles

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.400 
hi Georgia again with puking pastilles
this<00:00:08.580> segment<00:00:09.059> we<00:00:09.179> will<00:00:09.210> finally<00:00:09.840> be<00:00:09.870> cutting

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
this segment we will finally be cutting

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:36.819 
this segment we will finally be cutting
your<00:00:10.559> fabric<00:00:11.010> with<00:00:11.040> your<00:00:11.190> pattern<00:00:11.519> pieces

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.979 

once<00:00:37.829> you've<00:00:37.980> gotten<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.730> part<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
once you've gotten to this part of the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.799 
once you've gotten to this part of the
process<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> easy<00:00:41.250> part<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.360> we're

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
process this is the easy part so we're

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.860 
process this is the easy part so we're
on<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.170> downhill<00:00:43.320> here<00:00:44.239> most<00:00:45.239> sewing

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
on the downhill here most sewing

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.840 
on the downhill here most sewing
patterns<00:00:46.230> come<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> cutting<00:00:47.100> layout<00:00:47.489> that

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
patterns come with a cutting layout that

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.310 
patterns come with a cutting layout that
looks<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.600> will<00:00:48.690> show<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.989> how<00:00:49.260> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
looks like this it will show you how to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.779 
looks like this it will show you how to
lay<00:00:49.500> your<00:00:49.620> pattern<00:00:49.860> pieces<00:00:50.219> down<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.640> your

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
lay your pattern pieces down on your

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.439 
lay your pattern pieces down on your
fabric<00:00:52.219> my<00:00:53.219> ankle-biters<00:00:53.789> comes<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.239> one

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
fabric my ankle-biters comes with one

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.229 
fabric my ankle-biters comes with one
it's<00:00:54.629> very<00:00:54.690> simple<00:00:55.410> I'm<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.059> lay

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
it's very simple I'm just going to lay

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.849 
it's very simple I'm just going to lay
out<00:00:57.390> my<00:00:57.420> pattern<00:00:57.989> pieces<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.469> way<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.680> looks

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
out my pattern pieces the way it looks

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.160 
out my pattern pieces the way it looks
here<00:00:59.280> on<00:01:00.920> my<00:01:01.920> folded<00:01:02.399> fabric<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.660> here's<00:01:04.019> my

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
here on my folded fabric so here's my

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.670 
here on my folded fabric so here's my
fabric<00:01:04.619> these<00:01:05.400> are<00:01:05.640> my<00:01:05.760> salvages<00:01:06.510> that's<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
fabric these are my salvages that's the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.280 
fabric these are my salvages that's the
edges<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.520> words<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.119> them<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:10.170> are

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
edges with the words on them there are

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.620 
edges with the words on them there are
also<00:01:10.439> little<00:01:10.770> tiny<00:01:11.100> dots<00:01:11.400> along<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> edges<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
also little tiny dots along the edges of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.899 
also little tiny dots along the edges of
the<00:01:12.840> selvages<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:14.130> we've<00:01:14.340> got<00:01:14.460> our<00:01:14.610> fold

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
the selvages and then we've got our fold

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.149 
the selvages and then we've got our fold
over<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:15.540> where<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.020> fabric<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.650> folded<00:01:16.860> in

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
over here where the fabric is folded in

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.969 
over here where the fabric is folded in
half<00:01:17.360> now<00:01:18.360> generally<00:01:18.960> you'll<00:01:19.170> want<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.560> fold

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
half now generally you'll want to fold

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.649 
half now generally you'll want to fold
your<00:01:20.159> fabric<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> wrong<00:01:21.090> side<00:01:21.479> is

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
your fabric so that the wrong side is

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.140 
your fabric so that the wrong side is
out<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.830> because<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.430> fabric<00:01:23.700> has<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
out but because this fabric has a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.230 
out but because this fabric has a
direction<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.990> need<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.380> see<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.850> outside<00:01:27.030> of

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
direction I need to see the outside of

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.950 
direction I need to see the outside of
the<00:01:27.390> fabric<00:01:27.570> facing<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:29.509> and<00:01:30.509> when<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> say<00:01:30.869> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the fabric facing up and when I say it

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.240 
the fabric facing up and when I say it
has<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> direction<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.650> means<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.130> these

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
has a direction that means that these

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.780 
has a direction that means that these
skulls<00:01:33.170> have<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> right<00:01:34.740> side<00:01:34.950> up<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.340> if

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
skulls have a right side up and if

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.249 
skulls have a right side up and if
they're<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> other<00:01:36.450> way<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:37.140> it

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
they're going the other way I have it

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.569 
they're going the other way I have it
upside<00:01:37.680> down<00:01:38.509> that's<00:01:39.509> called<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.259> nap<00:01:40.799> fabric

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
upside down that's called a nap fabric

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.569 
upside down that's called a nap fabric
with<00:01:41.729> NAP<00:01:41.939> has<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> direction<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.280> I'm<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.520> to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
with NAP has a direction so I'm going to

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.330 
with NAP has a direction so I'm going to
make<00:01:44.700> sure<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.380> both<00:01:46.380> pant<00:01:46.710> legs<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
make sure that both pant legs have the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.679 
make sure that both pant legs have the
right<00:01:47.490> direction<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> fabric<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.540> don't

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
right direction of the fabric I don't

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.179 
right direction of the fabric I don't
want<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:48.960> upside<00:01:49.290> down<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:49.799> right<00:01:49.979> side

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
want one upside down and one right side

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.420 
want one upside down and one right side
up

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.300 

so<00:01:54.360> I'm<00:01:54.480> going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.840> lay<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:55.530> pants<00:01:56.310> down<00:01:56.460> here

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
so I'm going to lay my pants down here

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.030 
so I'm going to lay my pants down here
and<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.490> will<00:01:59.640> take<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> bit<00:02:00.060> more<00:02:00.090> fabric

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
and this will take a bit more fabric

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.680 
and this will take a bit more fabric
because<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.340> nap<00:02:02.550> these<00:02:03.240> aren't<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.570> to

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
because of the nap these aren't going to

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.219 
because of the nap these aren't going to
fit<00:02:03.840> next<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.230> each<00:02:04.350> other<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:04.860> think

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.240 

actually<00:02:10.229> they<00:02:10.320> will<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:10.770> we're<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.040> lay

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
actually they will so we're going to lay

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.750 
actually they will so we're going to lay
these<00:02:11.430> down<00:02:11.460> here<00:02:15.680> these<00:02:16.680> grain<00:02:17.520> line

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
these down here these grain line

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.020 
these down here these grain line
markings<00:02:18.230> need<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.380> go<00:02:19.700> directly<00:02:20.700> on<00:02:20.910> the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
markings need to go directly on the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
markings need to go directly on the
grain<00:02:21.300> which<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:22.790> parallel<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.390> edges<00:02:24.810> on

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
grain which is parallel to the edges on

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.860 
grain which is parallel to the edges on
the<00:02:25.290> salvages<00:02:25.910> so<00:02:26.910> we<00:02:27.030> want<00:02:27.209> this<00:02:27.360> line<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.630> be

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
the salvages so we want this line to be

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.710 
the salvages so we want this line to be
parallel<00:02:28.260> with<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.500> selvage<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.100> like<00:02:29.310> after

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
parallel with the selvage so like after

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.770 
parallel with the selvage so like after
directional<00:02:30.720> correctly<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:32.450> I've<00:02:33.450> got<00:02:33.630> them

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
directional correctly and I've got them

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.570 
directional correctly and I've got them
both<00:02:33.930> going<00:02:34.410> right<00:02:34.680> side<00:02:34.920> up<00:02:35.100> because<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.520> do

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
both going right side up because I do

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.060 
both going right side up because I do
have<00:02:35.700> nap<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.510> fabric<00:02:36.959> I'm<00:02:37.200> going<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.920> pin

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
have nap in this fabric I'm going to pin

will cut that piece out as well if
you're<00:05:28.470> not<00:05:28.500> using<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.919> contrast<00:05:29.340> you<00:05:29.430> don't

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:43.850 

so<00:05:35.520> fold<00:05:35.970> it<00:05:36.150> so<00:05:37.080> I<00:05:37.139> can<00:05:37.380> see<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.680> pattern<00:05:42.860> then

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
so fold it so I can see the pattern then

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.070 
so fold it so I can see the pattern then
we'll<00:05:44.190> be<00:05:44.370> pinning<00:05:45.210> it<00:05:45.389> and<00:05:45.570> cutting<00:05:45.870> it<00:05:46.050> just

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
we'll be pinning it and cutting it just

we'll be pinning it and cutting it just
like<00:05:46.410> I<00:05:46.530> did<00:05:46.590> the<00:05:46.830> other<00:05:46.949> pieces<00:05:47.250> and<00:05:47.669> then

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
like I did the other pieces and then

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:49.670 
like I did the other pieces and then
you're<00:05:48.720> done<00:05:48.870> cutting<00:05:49.110> and<00:05:49.349> you're<00:05:49.440> ready<00:05:49.590> to
