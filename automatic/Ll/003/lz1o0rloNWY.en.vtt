00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.410
 with three years is a good period here 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.080
 as for a large team you have seen 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.610
 America is seen in Colombia or not 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.280

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.060
 [Music] 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.360
 when the Mexican channels where 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.380
 strength in Mexican soccer 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.410
 the great and current of mexico 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.630
 that I liked a little more 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.360
 I do not always prefer, I liked it a lot 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.210
 america the truth I was always very 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.060
 present when low we always have 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.190
 I was very aware of that the 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.000
 also a little bit of strength when he was 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.530
 Callerón positive with Pachuca Pachuca 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.410
 clear but I always had my present 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.850
 americas big print hey andes here 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.730
 there are many Colombians you do not know that 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.090
 the last Theophilic gutierrez came to 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.360
 blue cross and it's a country that for the 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:24.200
 pekerman technical account if you think that 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.850
 this can really guarantee you to be 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.780
 in a world cup coming to mexico 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:33.170
 your projection will go up or are you there a little 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.090
 already assuming it's going to be difficult to have 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.500
 fit in a selection with many 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.800
 very good players 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.310
 it's not one of my goals I do not think 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.440
 is the main one you can feel the 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.780
 shirt of my selection that would be more 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.670
 a pride for me suddenly to the 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.610
 journalists give my name is like a 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.980
 substitute when the forum could act 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.830
 now that a big team has arrived 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.110
 Mexico and sometimes abroad I only think 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.090
 that steel master account 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.520
 an excellent to be able to america 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.790
 mexico so then keep in mind 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.460
 for the andrean selection of this type 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.280
 you get to the most hated team in this country 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.720
 He is the most beloved also you get to 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.489
 team plus soldiers and they're going to give you 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.489
 with sticks and if you do not play well 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.080
 the directive when they just spoke 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.990
 with me is a team that want it or what 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.259
 they hate this mind for the 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.289
 criticism that is very strong if 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:43.409
