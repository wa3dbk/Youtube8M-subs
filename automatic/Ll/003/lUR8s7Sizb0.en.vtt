you<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.079> width<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.469> height<00:01:58.680> at<00:01:59.450> 16<00:02:00.450> by

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you have the width and height at 16 by

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.120 
you have the width and height at 16 by
16<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> let's<00:02:02.280> change<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> 16<00:02:03.689> width<00:02:04.439> or

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
16 so let's change it to 16 width or

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.370 
16 so let's change it to 16 width or
keep<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.430> at<00:02:05.490> 16<00:02:05.850> with<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.240> change<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.659> 32

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
keep it at 16 with and change it to 32

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.999 
keep it at 16 with and change it to 32
height<00:02:07.560> that's<00:02:08.069> double<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.489> height<00:02:08.869> okay<00:02:10.009> and

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
height that's double the height okay and

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.550 
height that's double the height okay and
what<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.310> see<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.209> it's<00:02:12.959> doubled<00:02:13.290> hi

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.470 

here<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:18.180> basically<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:18.810> two<00:02:19.260> blocks<00:02:20.480> and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
here so basically it's two blocks and

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:30.130 
here so basically it's two blocks and
what<00:02:21.659> what<00:02:21.989> we<00:02:22.110> can<00:02:22.260> do<00:02:22.409> is<00:02:26.239> for<00:02:27.239> this<00:02:27.390> example

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:39.020 

let<00:02:31.140> me<00:02:31.260> see<00:02:31.470> here<00:02:33.319> if<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.410> do<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:37.099> so<00:02:38.099> this

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
let me see here if I do that so this

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.180 
let me see here if I do that so this
block<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.360> normal<00:02:39.959> this<00:02:40.200> block<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.500> changed

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
block is normal this block is changed

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.280 
block is normal this block is changed
let's<00:02:41.700> add<00:02:41.940> let's<00:02:42.360> add<00:02:42.510> another<00:02:42.540> block<00:02:43.049> so

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
let's add let's add another block so

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.670 
let's add let's add another block so
let's<00:02:43.680> see<00:02:43.829> here<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.190> 64<00:02:44.790> right<00:02:46.040> 64<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.590> it's

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
let's see here is 64 right 64 so it's

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.309 
let's see here is 64 right 64 so it's
actually<00:02:49.799> three<00:02:50.250> blocks<00:02:50.549> there<00:02:50.870> one<00:02:51.870> two

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
actually three blocks there one two

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.400 
actually three blocks there one two
three<00:02:52.799> okay<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.489> then<00:02:54.000> what<00:02:54.209> we<00:02:54.390> do<00:02:54.599> is<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:55.349> we

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
three okay and then what we do is is we

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.970 
three okay and then what we do is is we
save<00:02:56.099> as<00:02:56.569> I<00:02:57.569> want<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.319> save<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.500> back<00:02:58.739> up<00:02:58.890> my

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
save as I want to save it back up my

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.410 
save as I want to save it back up my
drop<00:02:59.640> box<00:03:00.000> here<00:03:00.450> under<00:03:00.720> PC<00:03:02.060> there<00:03:03.060> we<00:03:03.180> go<00:03:03.390> down

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
drop box here under PC there we go down

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:15.349 
drop box here under PC there we go down
block<00:03:05.810> P&amp;G<00:03:08.030> yes<00:03:09.030> say<00:03:09.540> yes<00:03:13.730> okay<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.150> then

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
block P&amp;G yes say yes okay and so then

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.530 
block P&amp;G yes say yes okay and so then
you<00:03:15.480> throw<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.810> back<00:03:15.959> into<00:03:16.200> your<00:03:17.540> textures

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
you throw it back into your textures

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.580 
you throw it back into your textures
that<00:03:18.569> you<00:03:19.049> texture<00:03:19.530> folder<00:03:20.989> okay<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.049> now<00:03:22.410> what

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
that you texture folder okay so now what

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.170 
that you texture folder okay so now what
we<00:03:22.680> do<00:03:22.799> is<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:23.190> we<00:03:23.220> have<00:03:23.489> our<00:03:23.609> textures<00:03:23.970> tools

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
we do is is we have our textures tools

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.420 
we do is is we have our textures tools
here<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.480> we<00:03:24.630> have<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.900> diamond<00:03:25.319> block<00:03:25.650> that

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
here and we have the diamond block that

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.220 
here and we have the diamond block that
we<00:03:26.609> want<00:03:26.849> animated<00:03:27.510> yes<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:29.730> we<00:03:30.090> just<00:03:30.269> go<00:03:31.019> into

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
we want animated yes so we just go into

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.420 
we want animated yes so we just go into
our<00:03:31.349> textures<00:03:31.889> and<00:03:32.400> we<00:03:32.940> do<00:03:33.150> blocks<00:03:34.310> then<00:03:35.310> we

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
our textures and we do blocks then we

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.460 
our textures and we do blocks then we
throw<00:03:35.609> our<00:03:35.790> new<00:03:36.030> down<00:03:36.720> block<00:03:37.019> in<00:03:37.200> there<00:03:37.349> and

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
throw our new down block in there and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.949 
throw our new down block in there and
move<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.739> replace<00:03:38.040> sure<00:03:38.690> then<00:03:39.690> we're<00:03:39.870> going

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
move and replace sure then we're going

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.629 
move and replace sure then we're going
to<00:03:40.049> right<00:03:40.200> click<00:03:40.230> our<00:03:40.590> textures<00:03:41.010> folder<00:03:41.220> add

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
to right click our textures folder add

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.870 
to right click our textures folder add
to<00:03:42.120> archive<00:03:42.299> make<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.079> zip<00:03:43.349> if<00:03:43.769> we're<00:03:44.190> working

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
to archive make it zip if we're working

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.170 
to archive make it zip if we're working
with<00:03:45.000> winrar<00:03:46.700> there<00:03:47.700> we<00:03:47.849> go<00:03:48.709> then<00:03:49.709> will<00:03:50.180> boot

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
with winrar there we go then will boot

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.569 
with winrar there we go then will boot
up<00:03:51.329> minecraft<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:54.769> then<00:03:55.769> we<00:03:55.950> go<00:03:56.069> to<00:03:56.099> texture

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
up minecraft a then we go to texture

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.199 
up minecraft a then we go to texture
packs<00:03:56.849> open<00:03:57.840> texture<00:03:58.200> pack<00:03:59.030> throw<00:04:00.030> that

packs open texture pack throw that

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.170 
packs open texture pack throw that
textures<00:04:00.629> in<00:04:00.780> there<00:04:01.430> now<00:04:02.430> we<00:04:02.489> see<00:04:02.790> textures

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
textures in there now we see textures

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.409 
textures in there now we see textures
here<00:04:03.329> yes<00:04:03.629> done<00:04:04.410> single-player<00:04:05.419> animated

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
here yes done single-player animated

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:13.890 
here yes done single-player animated
textures<00:04:08.599> okay

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.030 

and<00:04:14.900> we<00:04:15.020> navigate<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.770> the<00:04:15.950> diamond<00:04:16.310> block

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
and we navigate to the diamond block

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.470 
and we navigate to the diamond block
there<00:04:19.040> you<00:04:19.220> go<00:04:19.370> now<00:04:19.670> you<00:04:19.700> have<00:04:19.970> to<00:04:20.090> tweak<00:04:20.329> with

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
there you go now you have to tweak with

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.910 
there you go now you have to tweak with
it<00:04:20.660> to<00:04:20.750> figure<00:04:20.959> out<00:04:21.110> how<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.320> you<00:04:21.560> know<00:04:21.590> if<00:04:21.799> you

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
it to figure out how to you know if you

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.260 
it to figure out how to you know if you
want<00:04:22.130> more<00:04:22.310> complicated<00:04:22.850> if<00:04:22.970> you<00:04:23.000> want

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
want more complicated if you want

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.510 
want more complicated if you want
animated<00:04:24.110> sprites<00:04:24.320> or<00:04:24.680> whatever<00:04:26.740> um<00:04:27.740> you
