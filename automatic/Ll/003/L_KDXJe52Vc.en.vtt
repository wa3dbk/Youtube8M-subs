to see a operation on a nine month old
child<00:00:57.450> and<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:58.650> have<00:00:58.830> to<00:00:59.010> say<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.850> piqued

child and I have to say that that piqued
my<00:01:00.450> interest

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
my interest

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.080 
my interest
up<00:01:01.320> until<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.739> time<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.040> was<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.060> a

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
up until that time I was going to be a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.930 
up until that time I was going to be a
pediatrician<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:04.589> combination<00:01:05.550> of<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.760> fact

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
pediatrician the combination of the fact

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.060 
pediatrician the combination of the fact
that<00:01:06.120> I<00:01:06.660> didn't<00:01:06.990> want<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.290> well<00:01:07.470> baby<00:01:07.710> care

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that I didn't want to do well baby care

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.190 
that I didn't want to do well baby care
and<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> wanted<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.390> take<00:01:09.600> care<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.020> sick

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
and that I wanted to take care of sick

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.410 
and that I wanted to take care of sick
people<00:01:10.490> led<00:01:11.490> me<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.940> decision<00:01:11.970> about

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
people led me to the decision about

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.960 
people led me to the decision about
cardiac<00:01:12.960> surgery<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.590> think<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.490> patients<00:01:14.850> we

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
cardiac surgery I think the patients we

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.570 
cardiac surgery I think the patients we
take<00:01:15.210> care<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.630> really<00:01:16.130> challenge<00:01:17.130> your<00:01:17.280> mind

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
take care of really challenge your mind

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.570 
take care of really challenge your mind
as<00:01:17.850> far<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:18.119> respiratory<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.320> cardiac<00:01:19.979> care

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
as far as respiratory in cardiac care

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.850 
as far as respiratory in cardiac care
for<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.910> patient<00:01:21.300> and<00:01:21.420> search<00:01:22.050> and<00:01:22.320> certainly

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
for the patient and search and certainly

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.540 
for the patient and search and certainly
is<00:01:23.040> technically<00:01:23.820> challenging<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.410> that's<00:01:25.710> why

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
is technically challenging so that's why

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.800 
is technically challenging so that's why
I<00:01:26.610> ended<00:01:26.880> up<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.149> this<00:01:27.570> field

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.100 

I've<00:01:31.560> really<00:01:31.950> performed<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.550> large<00:01:33.480> variety<00:01:33.690> of

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
I've really performed a large variety of

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.640 
I've really performed a large variety of
cardiac<00:01:34.920> surgery<00:01:35.040> over<00:01:35.730> the<00:01:35.970> years<00:01:36.330> I<00:01:37.050> think

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
cardiac surgery over the years I think

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.570 
cardiac surgery over the years I think
that<00:01:37.950> starting<00:01:38.760> in<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.120> mid<00:01:40.080> late<00:01:40.400> 1990s

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
that starting in the mid late 1990s

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.440 
that starting in the mid late 1990s
my<00:01:42.150> interest<00:01:42.510> was<00:01:42.660> to<00:01:42.690> try<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.820> do<00:01:44.820> heart

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
my interest was to try to do heart

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.060 
my interest was to try to do heart
surgery<00:01:45.479> particularly<00:01:46.140> bypass<00:01:46.650> surgery

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
surgery particularly bypass surgery

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.370 
surgery particularly bypass surgery
without<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.729> heart-lung<00:01:48.090> machine<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.660> doing

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
without the heart-lung machine and doing

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.940 
without the heart-lung machine and doing
less<00:01:49.590> invasive<00:01:50.190> approaches<00:01:51.380> but<00:01:52.380> has<00:01:52.650> really

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
less invasive approaches but has really

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.640 
less invasive approaches but has really
been<00:01:53.160> a<00:01:53.520> broad-based<00:01:54.300> approach<00:01:54.900> I<00:01:55.440> would

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
been a broad-based approach I would

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.520 
been a broad-based approach I would
venture<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.910> guess<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.540> majority<00:01:58.380> of

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
venture to guess that the majority of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.950 
venture to guess that the majority of
the<00:01:59.250> patients<00:01:59.400> I<00:01:59.760> operate<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.210> our<00:02:00.450> patients

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the patients I operate on our patients

the patients I operate on our patients
with<00:02:01.080> coronary<00:02:01.410> artery<00:02:01.590> disease

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.080 

something<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.070> actually<00:02:06.280> try<00:02:06.700> out<00:02:06.759> of<00:02:06.969> the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
something I actually try out of the

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.880 
something I actually try out of the
philosophy<00:02:07.630> is<00:02:07.689> what<00:02:07.899> I<00:02:07.929> try<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.259> teach<00:02:08.470> show

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
philosophy is what I try to teach show

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.910 
philosophy is what I try to teach show
all<00:02:09.190> students<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.330> residents<00:02:10.539> that<00:02:11.440> this<00:02:11.769> is

next<00:02:21.370> day<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:22.299> do<00:02:22.450> better<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:25.110> that's<00:02:26.110> pretty

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
next day and do better and that's pretty

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.140 
next day and do better and that's pretty
much<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.769> motto<00:02:27.099> I<00:02:27.190> try<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.730> follow

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.030 

as<00:02:31.239> in<00:02:31.780> many<00:02:31.930> years<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.439> surgery<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:32.920> has

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
as in many years of surgery it has

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.309 
as in many years of surgery it has
really<00:02:33.370> evolved<00:02:34.180> if<00:02:34.659> I<00:02:34.780> look<00:02:34.989> at<00:02:35.140> general

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
really evolved if I look at general

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.259 
really evolved if I look at general
surgery<00:02:35.799> today<00:02:36.159> it's<00:02:36.459> nothing<00:02:36.790> like<00:02:36.909> it<00:02:37.120> was

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
surgery today it's nothing like it was

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.880 
surgery today it's nothing like it was
when<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.540> was<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> general<00:02:38.170> surgery<00:02:38.439> resident

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
when I was a general surgery resident

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.890 
when I was a general surgery resident
that<00:02:39.099> things<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.519> done<00:02:39.700> through<00:02:39.939> small

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
that things that done through small

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.920 
that things that done through small
incisions<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.970> through<00:02:42.970> scopes<00:02:43.299> and<00:02:43.629> it's<00:02:43.840> a

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
incisions and through scopes and it's a

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.890 
incisions and through scopes and it's a
whole<00:02:44.110> different<00:02:44.760> skill<00:02:45.760> set<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.299> you<00:02:46.569> need

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
whole different skill set that you need

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.720 
whole different skill set that you need
to<00:02:47.049> learn<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.500> that's<00:02:47.980> been<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.340> challenge

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
to learn and that's been the challenge

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.309 
to learn and that's been the challenge
for<00:02:48.849> cardiac<00:02:49.180> surgeons<00:02:49.629> as<00:02:49.780> well<00:02:49.810> as<00:02:49.989> we

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
for cardiac surgeons as well as we

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.339 
for cardiac surgeons as well as we
evolved<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.099> make<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.459> operation<00:02:52.420> not

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
evolved is to make the operation not

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.899 
evolved is to make the operation not
only<00:02:53.590> safer<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.129> it's<00:02:54.220> definitely<00:02:54.489> become<00:02:54.879> a

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
only safer and it's definitely become a

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.770 
only safer and it's definitely become a
lot<00:02:55.150> safer<00:02:55.420> but<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.500> challenge<00:02:57.040> us<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.370> make<00:02:57.549> it

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
lot safer but to challenge us to make it

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.670 
lot safer but to challenge us to make it
more<00:03:00.180> cosmetically<00:03:01.180> sound<00:03:01.989> for<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.290> patient

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
more cosmetically sound for the patient

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.830 
more cosmetically sound for the patient
of<00:03:02.859> less<00:03:03.459> traumatic<00:03:03.760> for<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.299> patient<00:03:04.690> and

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
of less traumatic for the patient and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.839 
of less traumatic for the patient and
that's<00:03:05.109> led<00:03:05.319> us<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.590> smaller<00:03:05.889> smaller<00:03:06.670> and

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
that's led us to smaller smaller and

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.430 
that's led us to smaller smaller and
smaller<00:03:07.090> incisions

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.800 

well<00:03:11.100> absolutely<00:03:11.310> there<00:03:11.940> was<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:12.390> actually

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
well absolutely there was it's actually

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.440 
well absolutely there was it's actually
a<00:03:12.870> marriage<00:03:13.650> between<00:03:13.830> industry<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:14.820> cardiac

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
a marriage between industry and cardiac

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.280 
a marriage between industry and cardiac
surgery<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.680> back<00:03:17.040> in<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.400> late<00:03:18.110> middle<00:03:19.110> to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
surgery so back in the late middle to

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.740 
surgery so back in the late middle to
late<00:03:19.470> 1990s<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:22.700> development<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.970> technology

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
late 1990s the development of technology

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.530 
late 1990s the development of technology
in<00:03:24.990> order<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.410> be<00:03:25.560> able<00:03:25.710> to<00:03:25.920> safely<00:03:26.400> do<00:03:26.880> beating

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
in order to be able to safely do beating

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.040 
in order to be able to safely do beating
heart<00:03:27.750> surgery<00:03:28.200> came<00:03:29.100> along<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.550> that

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
heart surgery came along and that

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.390 
heart surgery came along and that
shifted<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.170> paradigm<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.830> be<00:03:31.950> able<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.250> do

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
shifted the paradigm to be able to do

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.820 
shifted the paradigm to be able to do
these<00:03:32.580> operations<00:03:32.730> safely<00:03:33.600> which<00:03:34.500> up<00:03:34.740> until

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
these operations safely which up until

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.780 
these operations safely which up until
then<00:03:35.220> really<00:03:35.580> was<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.880> very<00:03:36.120> tedious<00:03:36.510> difficult

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
then really was a very tedious difficult

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.100 
then really was a very tedious difficult
challenging<00:03:38.790> problem<00:03:39.180> it's<00:03:39.630> not<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:39.990> it's

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
challenging problem it's not that it's

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.650 
challenging problem it's not that it's
easy<00:03:40.350> today<00:03:40.800> but<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.460> certainly<00:03:41.670> can<00:03:42.120> can<00:03:42.630> be

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
easy today but it certainly can can be

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.450 
easy today but it certainly can can be
done<00:03:43.020> and<00:03:43.230> these<00:03:43.320> tools<00:03:43.620> have<00:03:43.890> helped<00:03:44.160> us

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
done and these tools have helped us

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.460 
done and these tools have helped us
similarly<00:03:45.210> with<00:03:45.450> valve<00:03:45.720> surgery<00:03:46.490> again<00:03:47.490> about

similarly with valve surgery again about

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.010 
similarly with valve surgery again about
late<00:03:49.470> 1990s<00:03:50.400> technology<00:03:51.150> came<00:03:51.420> around<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.900> be

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
late 1990s technology came around to be

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.610 
late 1990s technology came around to be
able<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.290> use<00:03:53.690> alternate<00:03:54.690> ways<00:03:54.960> of<00:03:55.260> putting

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
able to use alternate ways of putting

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.200 
able to use alternate ways of putting
patients<00:03:55.950> on<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.400> heart-lung<00:03:56.610> machine<00:03:57.060> so

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
patients on the heart-lung machine so

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.490 
patients on the heart-lung machine so
that<00:03:57.330> you<00:03:57.450> could<00:03:57.570> do<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.810> operations<00:03:58.290> through

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
that you could do the operations through

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.010 
that you could do the operations through
small<00:03:58.800> incisions<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.520> then<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.510> last<00:04:00.750> which

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
small incisions and then the last which

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.210 
small incisions and then the last which
I'm<00:04:01.140> sure<00:04:01.320> a<00:04:01.350> lot<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.710> people<00:04:01.980> have<00:04:02.100> heard

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
I'm sure a lot of people have heard

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.760 
I'm sure a lot of people have heard
about<00:04:02.370> is<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:02.910> robotic<00:04:03.450> device<00:04:03.720> which<00:04:04.590> is

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
about is this robotic device which is

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.650 
about is this robotic device which is
used<00:04:05.010> in<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.190> lot<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.400> areas<00:04:05.760> of<00:04:05.790> surgery<00:04:06.330> the

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
used in a lot of areas of surgery the

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.990 
used in a lot of areas of surgery the
urologist<00:04:07.500> use<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.220> very<00:04:08.430> actively<00:04:08.820> in

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
urologist use it very actively in

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.240 
urologist use it very actively in
prostate<00:04:09.450> surgery<00:04:09.740> gynecologists<00:04:10.740> use<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:11.040> I

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
prostate surgery gynecologists use it I

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.100 
prostate surgery gynecologists use it I
think<00:04:11.730> it's<00:04:11.850> used<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.210> lesser<00:04:12.630> degree<00:04:12.660> in

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
think it's used to a lesser degree in

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.350 
think it's used to a lesser degree in
cardiac<00:04:13.440> surgery<00:04:13.560> but<00:04:14.520> it's<00:04:15.030> certainly

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
cardiac surgery but it's certainly

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.620 
cardiac surgery but it's certainly
something<00:04:15.600> that<00:04:16.700> we're<00:04:17.700> using<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.299> looking

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
something that we're using and looking

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.960 
something that we're using and looking
at<00:04:18.780> with<00:04:18.900> great<00:04:19.109> interest<00:04:19.520> we've<00:04:20.520> used<00:04:20.790> it

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
at with great interest we've used it

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.270 
at with great interest we've used it
here<00:04:21.299> at<00:04:21.510> this<00:04:21.930> institution<00:04:22.500> over<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.010> years
