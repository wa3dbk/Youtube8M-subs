00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.710
 new day new luck let's see what 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.710
 to find something new 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.010
 so wonderful here is the dream of each 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.540
 sondengÃ¤nger sole wonderful falls 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:25.380
 connected here and after the appell 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:27.489
 the chance is big is not silver 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.170
 wonderful also clean and shows you 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:35.930
 then first round 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.930
 so next and musket ball 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.600
 so must give ball number two 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:55.060
 first of all breakchance and him something 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:55.060
 to look the leaf 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.559
 I'm two now expired first 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.489
 that's the yield left scrap 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.500
 shot a lot at the leg 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.090
 because not always a good sign that 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.640
 the activities were there on the field 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.530
 I last last video the 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.979
 found both coins and the lead 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.479
 clumsy and I also asked if I 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.039
 try defensive and seen 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.460
 I ran it in two and here 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:29.000
 that already brought out and still had 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.509
 times clean and show you beautiful 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.509
 patch here 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.250
 I have a little pause 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.340
 and then of course it goes on until 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.340
 equal 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.210
 deep or 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.570
 Pieces of iron are pretty round reasons 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.910
 that is a little bit the sun 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.080
 a stainless ostring and why has become a 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.420
 bit clean may find 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.100
 that's okay 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.920
 Let's see what you still get up to 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.850
 equal 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:00.410
 beautiful fund came in thus conductance 40 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.870
 50 no our ceramics and clap on 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:09.340
 the surface super watch me out 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:13.450
 get how old this is look 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.450
 what I rind here 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:23.310
 I really like the runner 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.250
 first on and off a burner 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:35.150
 probably from something like that 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:41.290
 petroleum burner the setting that 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:45.800
 rather than girls 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.700
 let's see how long I still make and 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.860
 then it goes on 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.620
 at first, no idea about it 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.620
 massively groups are still in there 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:02.670
 the well and so randall recognizes 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:08.200
 Here at the edge here has your idea 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:18.280
 could be water and then get in touch 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:26.940
 and could see that yes that looks good 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:30.330
 but i can see what i can see 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.610
 not ultrathin which is 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.650
 I have to be very careful 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.430
 that the transport me already not 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:43.880
 it's a pity, but there's always something else 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.880
 Okay, let's continue 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.840
 as the found what stays 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:58.940
 but this time not a closed 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:05:01.500
 left ornament chic and look 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:06.130
 what ever closer 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.660
 so wonderful can a coin for 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.919
 on the last track 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:15.639
 great I think was worth it today 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:17.520
 a nice day and I'll show you how 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.620
 always at the end again the dogs 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.000
 that's good 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.000
 Well and until first
