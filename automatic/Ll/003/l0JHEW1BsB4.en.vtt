00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.740
 I'm peeling the preparation to perform 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.250
 an artistic brain takes a piece of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.310
 tubular cardboard of 50 x 30 centimeters 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.060
 now with the ruler measured from each 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:21.289
 side 5 centimeters inward trace 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.650
 the resulting rectangle with a scalpel 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:28.109
 review the lines as an incision 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.989
 cut one end and the opposite to this 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.290
 well once weakened the cardboard with 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.930
 the incisions fold and with tape we are going to 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.660
 put together a box then with col bon 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.300
 dissolved in water and a brush spread the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.060
 surface on top and covers the cord 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.170
 making use of paper technique 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.510
 machine 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.150
 until you get a sturdy box 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.460
 painted with red color makes a 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.400
 grid over the surface of 2 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.970
 centimeters per column and 4 centimeters 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.790
 by rows you will find the points of 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.400
 paint them with a marker now with 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.710
 Markers of different color binds the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.049
 points of the three columns of the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.170
 left with the points of the columns 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.250
 from the right pierces with a soldering iron the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.320
 surface of the box using this matrix 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.650
 now take the telephone cable and 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.610
 insert it into the rivet tighten what 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.200
 so that it does not come out using the pliers 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.560
 insert the rivets through the holes 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.130
 of the surface following the plane 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.899
 made with the colored markers 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.340
 Repeat this action the number of times 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:43.800
 required by the front face of the box 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.830
 Performs three holes with the soldering iron 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.110
 where the cables and the ceiling will pass with 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.630
 the bulb one of the cables what 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.690
 we will stick to one end of the ceiling and the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.330
 another end will go to the red wire of the 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.000
 battery holder 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.760
 the black cable of the battery holder 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.910
 we connect to the cable that in its 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.190
 end has the green alligator cut 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.399
 a cardboard for the back of the 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.070
 artistic brain that will serve as cover and 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.630
 we will make a door for the change 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.910
 of batteries and on a cardboard of 20 x 30 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.010
 centimeters performed to the left side 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.190
 questions and on the right side the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.310
 answers like for example painter's 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.860
 surrealism response salvador dali and 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.170
 with green and yellow alligators looking 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.170
 the questions with your correct answer
