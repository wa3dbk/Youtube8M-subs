little bit harder with the guns and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.880 
little bit harder with the guns and
message<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.199> actually<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.559> thing<00:00:55.590> should

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
message is actually one thing should

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
always know the next review is always

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.569 
always know the next review is always
dictated<00:00:58.320> by<00:00:58.469> what<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.920> think<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.250> humor

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579

for<00:00:59.820> what<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.210> think<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.449> bits<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
for what can I think of bits for and

refreshing<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.659> back<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.049> stuff<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
refreshing to go back to stuff like the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.679 
refreshing to go back to stuff like the
perks<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> proficient<00:01:11.430> ease<00:01:11.850> because

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
perks and the proficient ease because

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.840 
perks and the proficient ease because
these<00:01:13.320> lend<00:01:13.680> themselves<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.250> different<00:01:14.640> kind

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
these lend themselves to different kind

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
these lend themselves to different kind
of<00:01:14.939> bits<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.360> are<00:01:15.420> easier<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.170> instance

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
of bits that are easier for instance

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
sometimes I just enjoy doing something

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.420 
sometimes I just enjoy doing something
besides<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.189> gun<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:03.439> that's<00:02:04.439> that's<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.219> main

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
besides a gun and that's that's the main

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.760 
besides a gun and that's that's the main
reason<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.909> do<00:02:05.969> them<00:02:06.329> if<00:02:06.540> you're<00:02:06.960> if<00:02:07.590> you've

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
reason I do them if you're if you've

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.889 
reason I do them if you're if you've
been<00:02:07.890> wondering<00:02:08.069> why<00:02:08.789> sometimes<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.450> don't<00:02:09.509> do

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
been wondering why sometimes I don't do

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.630 
been wondering why sometimes I don't do
a<00:02:09.929> gun<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.890> know<00:02:10.950> seem<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.250> get

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
a gun and I you know seem to get

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.470 
a gun and I you know seem to get
distracted<00:02:11.940> for<00:02:12.629> lack<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.780> better<00:02:12.900> words

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
distracted for lack of better words

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.899 
distracted for lack of better words
that's<00:02:13.959> why<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.950> other<00:02:15.099> subject<00:02:15.580> tends<00:02:15.790> to

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
that's why the other subject tends to

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.350 
that's why the other subject tends to
lend<00:02:16.090> itself<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.599> I<00:02:17.610> don't<00:02:18.610> know<00:02:18.700> getting<00:02:19.090> done

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
lend itself to I don't know getting done

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.119 
lend itself to I don't know getting done
I<00:02:19.690> guess<00:02:19.870> that's<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.170> way<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.379> look<00:02:20.470> at<00:02:20.739> it<00:02:20.860> I

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
I guess that's the way to look at it I

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.770 
I guess that's the way to look at it I
look<00:02:21.459> at<00:02:21.580> something<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.909> can<00:02:22.060> get<00:02:22.209> done<00:02:22.510> and

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
look at something I can get done and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.890 
look at something I can get done and
finish<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.500> move<00:02:23.799> on<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.159> next<00:02:24.190> thing<00:02:24.900> I

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
finish it move on to the next thing I

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.199 
finish it move on to the next thing I
don't<00:02:26.409> really<00:02:26.709> think<00:02:26.980> with<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.730> way<00:02:27.879> I<00:02:27.909> go

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
don't really think with the way I go

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.820 
don't really think with the way I go
