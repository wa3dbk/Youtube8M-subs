is I guess our fault but it was
definitely<00:00:27.869> an<00:00:28.080> overabundance<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.740> what<00:00:28.980> we

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
definitely an overabundance of what we

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.189 
definitely an overabundance of what we
even<00:00:29.730> thought<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.029> was<00:00:30.179> gonna<00:00:30.269> come<00:00:30.539> okay<00:00:31.140> so
