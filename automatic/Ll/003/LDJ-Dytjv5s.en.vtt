00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:16.809
 And then sends the paddock of the Great Hanshin 11 race 61st Hanshin Award in Scripture g 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.809
 Commentary is easy 3 Tasaki in the meantime So let's have a look 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:25.210
 Most tokai trick-10 k 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:31.750
 Yes example Well, last time I I think that it was left plus 18 k margin 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:35.100
 I think that it is good that this body is a high spirited ride that does not make the original appearance feel at all age 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.280
 No. 2 Piena Fanta strike +2 k 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.820
 I feel a little high overall discard is poor 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.030
 I think it will be a big change 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:50.400
 No. 3 Fogettaburu +2 k 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.550
 Well, I'm still good as it is, so I can walk with it, so the state itself is 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.149
 I think not bad 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.870
 There is no increase or decrease in the 4th Cosmo Helenos 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.860
 It was a plus 12 kg after the break before the day before well though 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.870
 Well that's why I'm going to increase or decrease, but even in this body there is no manufacturer at all 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.470
 I do n't think it's good 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:13.730
 No. 5 Monte Chris es + 4 k 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:17.790
 But it's to look good I a horse body that there is still here, a sense of volume 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.420
 I don't think it looks bad but I wonder how it feels like 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.630
 It will be said that 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.560
 No. 6 Desperado -4 k 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:30.090
 It is a horse with a high head with a shadow roll but it is very good 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.859
 I think there is a cut in the movement and it is a good finish 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:40.289
 The seventh is the most popular gold ship three months after the holidays 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:41.039
 Not the type of issues still Koku' and concentration it is a -4 k is the paddock of the stage 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.330
 It is 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:49.170
 Also can exactly do you think I body and Well good in something like this 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:53.460
 8th bomb 8 baled impact minor c 4 k 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.820
 Well last time it was plus 12 km, but this was the feeling that the fruit came in 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.440
 so 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.460
 -4 k I think go with this body 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.700
 It is Bistty + 6 kg to sucker stupid at the end 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.840
 I think it's always when it's hard for a little reason to cross 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:13.530
 Mer brother tax is good something to physical condition would say 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.530
