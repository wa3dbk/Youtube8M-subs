00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.369 
the whole long lock in yeah we swapped
the<00:04:49.249> long<00:04:49.430> block<00:04:49.729> in<00:04:49.999> the<00:04:50.569> other<00:04:50.689> done<00:04:50.990> in<00:04:51.169> four

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:51.379 
the long block in the other done in four

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.320 
the long block in the other done in four
hours<00:04:51.589> the<00:04:52.009> hardest<00:04:52.399> thing<00:04:52.610> was<00:04:52.849> my<00:04:53.210> other

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
hours the hardest thing was my other

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.689 
hours the hardest thing was my other
intake<00:04:53.749> was<00:04:53.930> different<00:04:54.409> and<00:04:55.249> we<00:04:55.369> couldn't

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
intake was different and we couldn't

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.510 
intake was different and we couldn't
find<00:04:55.849> a<00:04:55.999> four<00:04:56.240> inch<00:04:56.419> intake<00:04:57.009> of<00:04:58.009> aluminum

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
find a four inch intake of aluminum

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.159 
find a four inch intake of aluminum
because<00:04:58.699> it<00:04:59.029> was<00:04:59.270> too<00:04:59.479> far<00:04:59.689> away<00:04:59.809> from<00:04:59.960> the

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
because it was too far away from the

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.639 
because it was too far away from the
throttle<00:05:00.409> body<00:05:00.619> so<00:05:01.580> we<00:05:01.789> took<00:05:02.449> us<00:05:02.599> two<00:05:02.869> hours<00:05:02.899> to

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:03.649 
throttle body so we took us two hours to

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:05.739 
throttle body so we took us two hours to
come<00:05:03.800> up<00:05:03.860> with<00:05:04.069> a<00:05:04.129> piece<00:05:04.339> of<00:05:04.580> exhaust<00:05:05.330> pipe

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:05.749 
come up with a piece of exhaust pipe

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:25.449 
come up with a piece of exhaust pipe
what<00:05:06.139> time<00:05:06.319> the<00:05:22.779> cherry<00:05:24.069> ended<00:05:25.069> in<00:05:25.189> there<00:05:25.370> and

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:25.459 
what time the cherry ended in there and

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:27.790 
what time the cherry ended in there and
it<00:05:25.550> rained<00:05:25.969> in<00:05:26.149> sideways<00:05:26.779> the<00:05:27.349> other<00:05:27.499> guys

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
it rained in sideways the other guys

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.230 
it rained in sideways the other guys
were<00:05:28.009> holding<00:05:28.159> on<00:05:28.399> to<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.610> camcorder

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.900 

so<00:05:32.169> it<00:05:32.319> was<00:05:32.500> just<00:05:32.770> I<00:05:33.160> was<00:05:33.370> wondering<00:05:33.729> that<00:05:33.759> the

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
so it was just I was wondering that the

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.360 
so it was just I was wondering that the
