getting a nice pump I also like to do a
lot<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.840> ice<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.899> lateral<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:49.530> unilateral

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
lot of ice a lateral like unilateral

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.610 
lot of ice a lateral like unilateral
types<00:00:50.399> movements<00:00:50.969> as<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.180> find<00:00:51.360> one<00:00:51.660> part<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.530> my

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
types movements as I find one part of my

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.560 
types movements as I find one part of my
chest<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.579> side<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.879> my<00:00:53.969> chest<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> little

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
chest one side of my chest is a little

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.880 
chest one side of my chest is a little
bit<00:00:54.660> strong<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.500> then<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> other

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
bit strong and then and then the other

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.849 
bit strong and then and then the other
so<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.879> tend<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.510> dumbbells<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.260> machines

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
so I tend to do dumbbells or machines

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.130 
so I tend to do dumbbells or machines
and<00:00:59.129> I'll<00:00:59.190> do<00:00:59.309> them<00:00:59.430> single<00:00:59.940> single<00:01:00.750> arm<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.079> I

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
and I'll do them single single arm so I

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.110 
and I'll do them single single arm so I
can<00:01:01.199> really<00:01:01.530> focus<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.219> each<00:01:02.430> part<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
can really focus on each part of the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.690 
can really focus on each part of the
chest<00:01:03.390> each<00:01:04.110> side<00:01:04.439> as<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.430> go<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.770> this<00:01:07.770> would<00:01:08.580> be

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
chest each side as I go so this would be

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.300 
chest each side as I go so this would be
about<00:01:09.090> ten<00:01:09.510> weeks<00:01:09.540> into<00:01:10.080> my<00:01:10.170> offseason<00:01:10.650> now<00:01:10.920> so

I competed about ten weeks ago I am now

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.030 
I competed about ten weeks ago I am now
heavily<00:01:14.939> into<00:01:15.240> my<00:01:15.330> offseason<00:01:15.890> cardio<00:01:16.890> is

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
heavily into my offseason cardio is

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.590 
heavily into my offseason cardio is
pretty<00:01:17.250> much<00:01:17.400> non-existent<00:01:17.640> at<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.360> point

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
pretty much non-existent at this point

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.660 
pretty much non-existent at this point
as<00:01:19.049> I've<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.530> been<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.070> busy<00:01:20.100> with

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
as I've just been so busy with

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.100 
as I've just been so busy with
everything<00:01:21.060> else<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.570> I've<00:01:21.750> kind<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:21.990> been

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
everything else so I've kind of been

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.109 
everything else so I've kind of been
listening<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> my<00:01:22.710> body<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.159> stealing<00:01:24.000> her<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
listening to my body and stealing her a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.700 
listening to my body and stealing her a
little<00:01:24.299> bit<00:01:24.450> run<00:01:24.630> down<00:01:24.659> there<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> while<00:01:25.409> so

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
little bit run down there for a while so

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.499 
little bit run down there for a while so
I<00:01:25.740> didn't<00:01:25.979> want<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> overdo<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.119> tons<00:01:27.420> of

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
I didn't want to overdo it with tons of

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.560 
I didn't want to overdo it with tons of
cardio<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.110> I'm<00:01:28.560> kind<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.119> half<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> cardio

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
cardio so I I'm kind of half the cardio

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.200 
cardio so I I'm kind of half the cardio
on<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> down<00:01:31.320> low<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.710> definitely<00:01:32.520> need<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.640> get

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
on the down low I definitely need to get

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.550 
on the down low I definitely need to get
back<00:01:33.390> into<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.020> I'll<00:01:34.110> probably<00:01:34.290> start

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
back into that so I'll probably start

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.350 
back into that so I'll probably start
