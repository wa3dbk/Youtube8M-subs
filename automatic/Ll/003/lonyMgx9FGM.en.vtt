00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.720
 the common woodbuck something completely 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.310
 difficult 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.610
 this plan is happy here is the mini 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.210
 6 nano or just six that in 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.279
 The whole 8 cm is not really 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.220
 a lot you should put your bag 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.510
 but watch out if you're a market because 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.790
 but if that means the bag 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.050
 has broken off over 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.309
 theoretically, that could do the thing 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.160
 is not only for humans 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.129
 the flies are included in the scope of delivery 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.019
 normally the charger for usb the 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.850
 is still four counter hand or halls 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.670
 about such a car plug or about one 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.949
 normal home charger can you 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.409
 the fire is subsequently control 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.449
 over infrared that means he has to 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.460
 view fly when you turn around and 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.519
 he would not have contact anymore 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.320
 including that which is the infrared is falling 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.880
 as you know from the TV you also keep 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.580
 you have the tv on there 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.560
 no connection so the thing has two 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.680
 speed levels that looks like 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.840
 to do that at the same time is here and 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.680
 he makes a small switch here 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.480
 he starts to put in here 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.600
 stand simply control 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.460
 turn on but full throttle once 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.720
 back and now he should 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.450
 start again on a connection 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.550
 always on the model half then you have 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.530
 no problems 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.140
 he controls can be left or right 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.940
 if he does not walk here 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.470
 Two little keys could do that 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.470
 practically adjust or trim 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.930
 so small is so cool he flies 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.310
 right now, if he would not see now 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:01.579
 I would use it practically 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:06.500
 opposite 3 channel little came 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:08.060
 but forward and drink and he 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.630
 It can be practically around your own axis 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.269
 Turn left and right around 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.700
 So now we have the second level 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.670
 just hectic really hectic just share 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:26.690
 a bit faster from flying here 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:27.350
 is really very simple was the total 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:35.540
 Has 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:37.400
 so stand in the yard that is too 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.040
 nothing that stops somewhere 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.450
 the trick of many alone think so 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.090
 thing depends on a banker of 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.910
 really wants to be able to fly alone 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.739
 can rotate around its own axis in 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.630
 lie left and right forward 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.610
 circular place and of course back 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.709
 operated 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.890
 Of course, too small spaces are ideal 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.720
 In the office as an in between meal say 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.609
 I once let's say just as a 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.090
 a little idle you can the 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:13.069
 pick up the short round three is good too 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.519
 Of course you can also know that 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.109
 Colleagues he just learns about 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.579
 fly over leaves or over the 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.079
 ashtray that makes the ashtray 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.880
 free and the leaves of course in the 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.670
 ground because he already agrees 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:32.570
 wind 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:35.960
 the kapo question the function 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.400
 I say this is synonymous function for the 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.830
 rotor blades if still enough 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.100
 Battery capacity again he would be 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.680
 set up when gasing equal 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.720
 a little more gas then immediately 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.280
 of course, he also has height 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.200
 not the problem that even a boot 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.090
 wants to drive 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.540
 I am funny everyday and for her 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.370
 size pull yourself in 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.320
 Now we even have blue in blue is 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.680
 that's not really much going on and 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.830
 daily flies great for the biggest 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.410
 party flight time about four to six 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.150
 eight minutes depending on the cold of the 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.310
 battery is the colder the battery is all the more 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.410
 he has less performance we know that 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.650
 of course also from our car battery 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:29.480
 if that is really cold comes the animals 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:30.890
 Charging time about 15 minutes self-adhering 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.550
 then we would have to be practical now 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.860
 reload 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.430
 but grabbing the nose made that out 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.950
 forest project of its capacity in the year 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.590
 make out the first model then open the 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.960
 he has a control down here practically like this 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.180
 small plug there would be these 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.000
 wise plug in just makes on the 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.490
 eighth right direction poke the 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.040
 usb 3 I just see here how can I 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.600
 such a replacement propeller in case he was gone 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.270
 could fly on the one hand 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.220
 draufpacken 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.320
 for the hunger in between super part 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.230
 I have to say test of course passed 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.820
 one can not do more with us 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.210
 of course there are no replacement batteries 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.650
 for that the third one is soldered and that 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.390
 would too much effort is the whole 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.250
 open week and then in acute 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.140
 exchange makes no sense 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.900
 that's why there is no substitute for it 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:24.830
 Everything else is in the scope of delivery 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.810
 at all here I come think 4 x 3 watt 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.740
 arena 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.320
 I would not be the cheapest 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.550
 take euro are more of you a 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.710
 further distance with it and the office 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.190
 great for at home in between 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.320
 part 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.940
 i just say test passed and yours 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.940
 Geizen divisible model hockey
