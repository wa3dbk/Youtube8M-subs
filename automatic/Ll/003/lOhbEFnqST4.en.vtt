00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
problem I was grappling with in film

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.560 
problem I was grappling with in film
number<00:01:50.520> two<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> fact<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
number two is the fact that it's the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.200 
number two is the fact that it's the
middle<00:01:51.810> act<00:01:52.020> let's<00:01:52.500> react<00:01:52.799> play<00:01:53.070> some<00:01:53.970> people

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
middle act let's react play some people

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.440 
middle act let's react play some people
find<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.720> darker<00:01:55.460> film<00:01:56.460> than<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> first<00:01:57.299> it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
find it a darker film than the first it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.770 
find it a darker film than the first it
is<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> darker<00:01:58.140> film<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:59.299> in<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.509> first

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
is a darker film because in the first

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.929 
is a darker film because in the first
act<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.200> introduced<00:02:01.619> everybody<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.610> second

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
act you introduced everybody the second

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:03.980 
act you introduced everybody the second
act<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.119> put<00:02:03.329> them<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.570> worst<00:02:03.750> possible

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
act you put them in the worst possible

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.510 
act you put them in the worst possible
position<00:02:04.290> they<00:02:04.619> can<00:02:04.770> ever<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:05.070> into<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.399> their

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
position they can ever get into in their

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.709 
position they can ever get into in their
lives<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.149> everything<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.630> know

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
lives and it's everything you know

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.169 
lives and it's everything you know
they're<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> black<00:02:07.770> hole<00:02:08.039> never<00:02:08.849> able<00:02:09.119> to

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
they're in a black hole never able to

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.550 
they're in a black hole never able to
get<00:02:09.300> out<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.750> then<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> third<00:02:10.110> act<00:02:10.319> they<00:02:10.410> get

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
get out and then the third act they get

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.740 
get out and then the third act they get
out<00:02:10.709> that's<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.760> again<00:02:12.209> that's<00:02:12.450> drama

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
out that's just again that's drama

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.150 
out that's just again that's drama
that's<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.440> way<00:02:13.530> it

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
that's the way it

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.880 
that's the way it
you<00:02:14.790> don't<00:02:14.970> have<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.270> exuberant<00:02:16.260> happy<00:02:16.530> second

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
you don't have a exuberant happy second

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.830 
you don't have a exuberant happy second
act<00:02:17.070> what<00:02:17.940> was<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.180> biggest<00:02:18.360> technological

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
act what was the biggest technological

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.810 
act what was the biggest technological
advance<00:02:19.590> between<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:20.160> making<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.520> one<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
advance between the making of one in the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.240 
advance between the making of one in the
making<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.150> two<00:02:21.500> well<00:02:22.500> there<00:02:22.620> wasn't<00:02:22.800> really

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
making of two well there wasn't really

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.240 
making of two well there wasn't really
too<00:02:23.460> much<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.850> technology<00:02:24.470> had<00:02:25.470> primarily

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
too much of a technology had primarily

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.160 
too much of a technology had primarily
but<00:02:26.490> there<00:02:26.610> wasn't<00:02:26.730> any<00:02:26.940> giant<00:02:27.330> Tecna<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
but there wasn't any giant Tecna the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.020 
but there wasn't any giant Tecna the
major<00:02:28.410> technological<00:02:28.800> break<00:02:29.310> was<00:02:29.460> in<00:02:29.580> one<00:02:29.790> and

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
major technological break was in one and

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.620 
major technological break was in one and
that<00:02:30.540> was<00:02:30.720> using<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:32.430> know<00:02:32.550> motion<00:02:33.420> control

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
that was using you know motion control

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.850 
that was using you know motion control
cameras<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.230> sort<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.500> thing<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.770> allow

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
cameras and that sort of thing to allow

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.220 
cameras and that sort of thing to allow
the<00:02:35.120> ships<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.270> be<00:02:36.390> able<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.570> move<00:02:36.660> freely<00:02:36.990> and

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
the ships to be able to move freely and

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.180 
the ships to be able to move freely and
that<00:02:37.350> sort<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.560> thing<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.710> was<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.070> big

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
that sort of thing that was the big

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.930 
that sort of thing that was the big
advance<00:02:38.720> everything<00:02:39.720> after<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.020> was<00:02:40.940> we

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
advance everything after that was we

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.550 
advance everything after that was we
were<00:02:42.000> able<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.450> do<00:02:42.630> more<00:02:42.780> stop-motion<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.440> was

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
were able to do more stop-motion I was

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.080 
were able to do more stop-motion I was
able<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.800> do<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> lot<00:02:44.220> more<00:02:44.250> things<00:02:44.430> they

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
able to do a lot more things they

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.490 
able to do a lot more things they
weren't<00:02:45.210> really<00:02:45.360> technological<00:02:46.050> advances

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
weren't really technological advances

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.350 
weren't really technological advances
but<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.890> was<00:02:47.310> able<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.550> give<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> lot<00:02:48.000> more<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.270> the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
but I was able to give a lot more in the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.550 
but I was able to give a lot more in the
stop-motion<00:02:48.570> which<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.170> couldn't<00:02:49.410> do<00:02:49.530> before

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
stop-motion which I couldn't do before

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.220 
stop-motion which I couldn't do before
and<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:53.010> know<00:02:53.070> generally<00:02:53.460> have<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:54.750> bigger

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
and you know generally have a bigger

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.380 
and you know generally have a bigger
scope<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.830> things<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.520> can<00:02:56.820> do<00:02:56.940> before<00:02:57.150> so

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
scope to things and I can do before so

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.310 
scope to things and I can do before so
if<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.140> first<00:02:58.320> film<00:02:58.590> was<00:02:58.710> a<00:02:58.940> technological

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
if the first film was a technological

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.020 
if the first film was a technological
challenge<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.680> get<00:03:02.160> ships<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:02.670> fly<00:03:02.850> in<00:03:03.000> space

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
challenge to get ships to fly in space

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.080 
challenge to get ships to fly in space
with<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:04.140> lot<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.560> movement<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.760> second

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
with a lot of that movement the second

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.740 
with a lot of that movement the second
one<00:03:06.210> was<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.570> do<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:07.110> stop-motion<00:03:07.920> movie<00:03:08.750> how

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
one was to do a stop-motion movie how

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.260 
one was to do a stop-motion movie how
did<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.110> choose<00:03:10.980> or<00:03:11.310> or<00:03:11.580> get<00:03:11.820> together<00:03:11.970> with
