00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello with us doctor julian molina 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.309
 Mayo Clinic Oncologist 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.830
 specialized in lung cancer and 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.000
 head and neck cancer doctor molina 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.260
 thank you very much for being with us 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.490
 doctor doctor molina obviously that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.400
 when people get chemotherapy 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.280
 often has side effects and 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.160
 especially in our community we are 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.960
 culturally accustomed to things 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.809
 natural 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.989
 and often prefer things 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.890
 natural 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.079
 obviously 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.600
 one of the questions that frequently 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.059
 they make us vidaysalud.com is 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.039
 if they can use natural things instead of 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.100
 chemotherapy or if you can combine 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.350
 natural things with chemotherapy we 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.899
 would like to know your opinion but liza is 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.550
 a very good question because it happens very 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.680
 frequently and not only for 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.809
 our patients from Latin America but 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.549
 also for the patients who come 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.830
 here in the usa 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.350
 the recommendation that we give them 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.619
 to patients is not to take any 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.479
 natural product because we do not know what 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.860
 interaction can have that product 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.080
 natural with chemotherapy 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.030
 and this is important because that 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.280
 interaction can result in more 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.680
 side effects of chemotherapy 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.869
 to less beneficial effect of the 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.000
 chemotherapy if a patient is 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.830
 receiving chemotherapy that normally 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.230
 is associated with side effects 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.310
 and the best one to discuss what is the 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.010
 treatment for those effects 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.990
 collateral with your oncologist because today 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.780
 in day we have very good medicines for 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.430
 treat those effects in the main 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.950
 effects that we see as a result the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.710
 Chemotherapy is for example nausea and 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.070
 vomit there are very good medicines for 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.360
 prevent and treat nausea and vomiting 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.210
 some patients have fall of 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.940
 hair this is an effect that we 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.550
 we consider it not very important because the 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.220
 Hair comes back normally after 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.020
 that the chemotherapy is finished there is a 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.270
 effect on the blood cells that 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.490
 sometimes you can prevent giving 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.190
 special treatments to maintain 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.590
 the levels of blood cells 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.840
 appropriate and the other effects can 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.620
 treat with other medicines but the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.450
 recommendation is not to take medicines 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.890
 natural and if you are going to do it enjoy it 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.020
 with your oncologist 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.900
 after all the chemotherapy is going to 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.800
 be for a limited time and once 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.620
 that cancer is treated and treated 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.720
 ok then you can go ahead with 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.700
 his life is right most of the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.560
 side effects are seen in the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.560
 patients when they are receiving the 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.450
 chemotherapy these effects usually 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.370
 disappear completely once the 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.830
 chemotherapy ends and the patient 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.440
 can remake his life again in that 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.440
 so do not put at risk the 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.660
 chemotherapy treatment that is 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.680
 the most important message do not put in 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.850
 risk the treatment of 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.459
 chemotherapy 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.810
 using natural medicines and if 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.510
