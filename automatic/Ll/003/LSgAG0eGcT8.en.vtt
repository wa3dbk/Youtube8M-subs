 so if you are familiar with social media 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.180

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.250
 which are your classmates in 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.949
 right now there are no companions of 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.420
 class written again and finally laden 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:13.280
 ticket to work well 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.860
 an online ride is necessary to follow 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.760
 rules to be educated do the 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:23.600
 must therefore perform the tasks 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:26.630
 required to participate if you do not participate 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.060
 your companions will have no feedback from

 you don't bother stay in 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.980
 topic don't digress or you can 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.410
 exchange of chats with i 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.390
 your companions but this is better to do it 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:41.030
 with facebook rather than with the site 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:44.390
 soceur of the class when you support 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:47.960
 ideas refer to credible sources 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:50.450
 for example, you have accredited websites 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.370
 taken from the ministry website 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:56.180
 or you took it from the forum of the 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:59.360
 motorcyclists do not copy if you post 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.630
 documents that are not your fist 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.180
 they are not processed in inside fist outing 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.380
 always the source uses emoticons each 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.940
 time you write 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.280
 the sentence can be interpreted so 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:14.660
 different depending on whether you put a 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:16.700
 smiley or sad emoticon or 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.190
 angry and so on 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.740
 remember that what you publish even if 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.410
 in a closed community like that of 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:28.960
 a virtual class with lots of code 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:32.510
 access with password and in any case 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.730
 preserved in the fashion archives but 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:38.330
 this applies to all publications 

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:41.990
 on the internet also on facebook on youtube 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.370
 everything you write is public even if 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.530
 you think it isn't 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.140
 share your knowledge do not hold for 

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.660
 yourself what you know like that 

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.090
 you will help the community to grow both 

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.280
 open the differences if someone has 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:58.310
 an opinion other than you seeks to 

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.560
 listen before attacking and maybe 

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:03.490
 will discover that the other has things to be 

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.490
 teach you too
