00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.940
 My girlfriend is getting in status 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.290
 room call of duty commentary and 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.760
 Today a very fast the video easy 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.559
 Run a little trick in the background 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.370
 that you reached me quite fast 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.770
 on strikes with the spd and yes it works 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.080
 So basically just the content and 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.699
 that is quite important because I am looking for 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.100
 or we are still looking for 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.449
 our clear member i will be you 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.859
 today just the video quite 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.980
 quickly call a few dates to the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.590
 clear so that you could orient yourself 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.450
 and a few assumptions set 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.890
 In any case, I have to say in advance 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.329
 Clan is only on the Playstation 3 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.790
 currently active and that's why the whole thing is 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.110
 actually only a playstation 3 player 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.700
 I could actually do it now too 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.789
 again from the call of duty known 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.770
 a few dates just to the plan 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.390
 submit so you know like ours 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.399
 clear looks with the statistics and 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.440
 so we are level nine and a half 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.550
 approximately 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.079
 for those who do not know it from level 10 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.300
 there's the golden clear day so 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.579
 which we soon reach 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.640
 Completion death relationship from ours 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.409
 small on average 19 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.689
 but from our eight members 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.970
 I think even a 5 a 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.580
 2 kg so we are pretty good 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.500
 I actually honestly admit the victory 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.540
 share of free it's about 60 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.119
 percent that means 60 percent 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.170
 all players who play in the clear 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.930
 we win the whole thing is too 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.869
 still expandable since we are only now 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.220
 Yesterday started the clear right 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.079
 Since we have only five before 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.579
 members were and were from 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.640
 actually only team and I the active ones 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.170
 and the other three just casually and 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.790
 Just have a look once a week 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.390
 gambled with us twice a week 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.310
 since yesterday we just about that 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.920
 improve video as well as kg 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.710
 just get three together ours 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.509
 clear or inquire and we 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.829
 have all adopted three do 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.540
 not so critical with the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.920
 conditions and therefore since 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.060
 Yesterday actually only gamble 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.520
 right so in five sixs team call of 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.520
 Duty cost as I said eight 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.200
 Members are also active 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.629
 small wars are once the second place 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.400
 nagold division and once place 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.460
 two a platinum division 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.740
 You have to say the whole thing 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.290
 so had a case like and one 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.640
 This is why treadmill 2 only 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.440
 he 'll think if we're five or five 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.010
 could be tackled to 63 that 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.510
 have been loose on one space 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.650
 We have many active bonuses in the game 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.750
 So, for example, search and destroy 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.350
 or save son or something 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.770
 we have 30 or 50 percent more apps 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:43.460
 by the clear war now yes he 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:46.270
 plays and yes as I said to the squad 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.530
 simply we are currently eight members 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.950
 if you are interested in the clear 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.600
 then it would just have me in the psn 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.430
 id is below in the video description 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.860
 the lfv but it just the unis 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.110
 is written and so or a case 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.360
 how do I write everything in the video 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.410
 description a small requirement 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.640
 of course I should have one here 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.620
 own headset resp 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.890
 you should own a headset and 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:14.960
 your kg should be at least 17 so 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:17.240
 we just plain pretty good 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.640
 have quotas and that's why now 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.940
 Just times the requirement 117 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.140
 it would have to be but still that 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.350
 whole is actually only one 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.350
 requirement which means register 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.510
 Just with me and or the team 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.010
 and of course all on i'll be and then 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.130
 Just clear that in game 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.480
 I do not know if I already said that 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.510
 but you should own my headset 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.770
 Otherwise, the whole is unfortunately nothing since we 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.130
 on many in the team play together and 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.930
 two and three are just a must 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.000
 and yes I hope I have everything now 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.580
 called and forget nothing so if 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.340
 you if you want to have the clear 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.770
 call of duty ps3 then I'll just call you 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.970
 times with me or the team is all about 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.850
 a video description like the whole 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.720
 Art and then I hope we have a lot 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.430
 fun together 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.430
 So Mr. 1000 euro
