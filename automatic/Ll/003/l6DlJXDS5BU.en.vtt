00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
should rarely allow the other team to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.000 
should rarely allow the other team to
really<00:00:18.930> hate<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.230> more<00:00:19.350> than<00:00:19.410> two<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.800> three

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
times if they're getting extending

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.759 
times if they're getting extending
combos<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.289> there's<00:00:22.529> something

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
combos and there's something

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:23.900 
combos and there's something
fundamentally<00:00:22.949> wrong<00:00:23.220> with<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> way<00:00:23.789> you

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
putting it a lot of work right now Wow

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.830 
putting it a lot of work right now Wow
double<00:00:30.150> floored<00:00:30.779> smash<00:00:31.080> from<00:00:31.260> Falco<00:00:32.840> all

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
double floored smash from Falco all

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.670 
double floored smash from Falco all
right<00:00:34.010> okay<00:00:35.010> good<00:00:35.250> shine<00:00:35.520> spiked<00:00:36.050> by<00:00:37.050> ribs<00:00:37.380> and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
right okay good shine spiked by ribs and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.930 
right okay good shine spiked by ribs and
so<00:00:37.920> they're<00:00:38.070> putting<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.430> lot<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.579> work<00:00:38.730> this

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
so they're putting in a lot of work this

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.190 
so they're putting in a lot of work this
is<00:00:39.090> quite<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> leap<00:00:39.510> from<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> beginning

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
is quite a leap from the beginning

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.420 
is quite a leap from the beginning
although<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.860> quickly<00:00:40.950> turn<00:00:43.820> all<00:00:44.820> right

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.250 

and<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.240> it<00:00:48.330> seems<00:00:48.540> like<00:00:48.720> that<00:00:48.900> the<00:00:48.930> blue<00:00:49.230> team

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
and so it seems like that the blue team

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.740 
and so it seems like that the blue team
is<00:00:49.530> winning<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.800> lot<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.040> these<00:00:50.130> exchanges<00:00:50.750> but

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
really up-and-coming space teammates

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.160 
really up-and-coming space teammates
from<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> kissimmee<00:01:38.850> area<00:01:39.090> they<00:01:39.930> start

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
from the kissimmee area they start

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.950 
from the kissimmee area they start
playing<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.500> think<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:41.399> year<00:01:41.759> maybe<00:01:42.570> earlier

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
playing I think this year maybe earlier

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.010 
playing I think this year maybe earlier
than<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.729> they<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.910> basically<00:01:45.360> like

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
than that and they just basically like

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.510 
than that and they just basically like
to<00:01:46.200> emulate<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.740> lot<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.130> space<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.399> you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
to emulate a lot of the space that you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.340 
to emulate a lot of the space that you
see<00:01:47.550> on<00:01:47.789> videos<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.390> most<00:01:48.420> guys<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.200> yeah

recovery as well there is a lot of stuff
you<00:02:32.400> can<00:02:32.520> do<00:02:32.700> but<00:02:32.970> at<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.330> same<00:02:33.540> time<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.750> don't

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
you can do but at the same time I don't

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.570 
you can do but at the same time I don't
see<00:02:34.140> why<00:02:34.290> Fox<00:02:34.650> Fox<00:02:34.860> would<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.160> in<00:02:35.220> any<00:02:35.370> worse

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
see why Fox Fox would be in any worse

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.940 
see why Fox Fox would be in any worse
it's<00:02:36.120> all<00:02:36.240> squawk<00:02:36.480> oh<00:02:36.630> yeah<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.260> think<00:02:37.620> with<00:02:37.920> a

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
it's all squawk oh yeah I think with a

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.310 
it's all squawk oh yeah I think with a
Falco<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:38.520> get<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.790> reliable<00:02:39.330> like<00:02:39.600> 0<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.020> 50

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
Falco you get that reliable like 0 to 50

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.840 
Falco you get that reliable like 0 to 50
damage<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:40.770> if<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:40.950> land<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.190> shiner<00:02:41.430> up<00:02:41.640> till

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
damage so if you land a shiner up till

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.940 
damage so if you land a shiner up till
it's<00:02:42.090> pretty<00:02:42.390> much<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.570> quick<00:02:42.780> 40<00:02:43.170> yeah<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.770> I

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
it's pretty much a quick 40 yeah and I

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.440 
it's pretty much a quick 40 yeah and I
think<00:02:44.040> that's<00:02:44.220> one<00:02:44.550> thing<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.730> Fox<00:02:45.150> all

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
think that's one thing that Fox all

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.840 
think that's one thing that Fox all
those<00:02:45.660> strong<00:02:46.140> like<00:02:46.380> all<00:02:46.590> all<00:02:47.070> throughout<00:02:47.490> all

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
those strong like all all throughout all

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.190 
those strong like all all throughout all
percentages<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.600> think<00:02:48.780> that's<00:02:48.900> what<00:02:49.170> we

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
percentages I think that's what we

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.720 
percentages I think that's what we
thought<00:02:49.470> where<00:02:49.650> does<00:02:49.770> better<00:02:50.010> exactly<00:02:50.580> very

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
thought where does better exactly very

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.750 
thought where does better exactly very
true<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.210> as<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.020> can<00:02:52.140> see<00:02:52.170> here<00:02:52.710> it's<00:02:53.430> a

true and as you can see here it's a

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.000 
true and as you can see here it's a
looking<00:02:54.360> like<00:02:54.540> blue<00:02:54.810> team<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.350> gonna<00:02:55.620> take<00:02:55.890> it

recovering and the other team or like
make<00:04:41.350> them<00:04:41.530> stationary<00:04:42.160> so<00:04:42.430> that<00:04:42.580> they<00:04:42.700> don't

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
make them stationary so that they don't

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.520

so<00:04:50.340> it's<00:04:50.490> a<00:04:50.520> little<00:04:50.639> bit<00:04:50.729> of<00:04:51.000> chaos<00:04:51.300> right<00:04:51.599> now

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
so it's a little bit of chaos right now

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.529 
so it's a little bit of chaos right now
no<00:04:53.910> clear<00:04:54.539> decisive<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.849> combo<00:04:56.849> or<00:04:57.000> blow<00:04:57.240> or

no clear decisive a combo or blow or

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.050 
no clear decisive a combo or blow or
momentum<00:04:58.199> right<00:04:58.319> now<00:04:58.500> it<00:04:58.680> seems<00:04:58.860> like<00:04:59.099> blue

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
momentum right now it seems like blue

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.820 
momentum right now it seems like blue
gets<00:05:00.300> one<00:05:00.449> hit<00:05:00.659> and<00:05:00.900> in<00:05:01.020> red<00:05:01.199> gets<00:05:01.379> another<00:05:01.620> hit

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
gets one hit and in red gets another hit

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.430 
gets one hit and in red gets another hit
and<00:05:01.889> there's<00:05:02.280> not<00:05:02.430> really<00:05:02.699> any

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
and there's not really any

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.240 
and there's not really any
differentiation<00:05:04.440> that's<00:05:04.860> happening<00:05:05.220> right

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
differentiation that's happening right

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.809 
differentiation that's happening right
now<00:05:05.840> but<00:05:06.840> really<00:05:07.770> like<00:05:07.919> how<00:05:08.099> r<00:05:08.129> its<00:05:08.340> is<00:05:08.490> picking

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
now but really like how r its is picking

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.249 
now but really like how r its is picking
up<00:05:08.940> on<00:05:09.090> straight<00:05:09.389> hits<00:05:09.569> in<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.750> BALCO<00:05:10.139> and

up on straight hits in the BALCO and
that's<00:05:10.379> one<00:05:10.590> thing<00:05:10.680> that<00:05:10.740> felt<00:05:11.069> was<00:05:11.220> really

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
that's one thing that felt was really

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.939 
that's one thing that felt was really
good<00:05:11.580> at<00:05:11.729> because<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.569> the<00:05:13.169> shine<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:13.530> up

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
good at because the the shine and up
