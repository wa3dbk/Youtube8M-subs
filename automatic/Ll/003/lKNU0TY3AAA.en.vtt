00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
necklace which i think is so so pretty

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.200 
necklace which i think is so so pretty
this<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.040> one<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.189> those<00:01:35.369> statement<00:01:35.850> necklaces

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
this is one of those statement necklaces

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.609 
this is one of those statement necklaces
that<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.540> going<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.810> match<00:01:36.930> with<00:01:37.140> everything

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
that is going to match with everything

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.080 
that is going to match with everything
but<00:01:37.860> still<00:01:38.070> definitely<00:01:38.369> makes<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.909> statement

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
but still definitely makes a statement

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.940 
but still definitely makes a statement
which<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.570> why<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.720> really<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.500> I
