00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
figures legs are a wide stance so it can

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.180 
figures legs are a wide stance so it can
fit<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:44.399> nicely<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.920> figure

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
swivel or a ball here's one of the two

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.859 
swivel or a ball here's one of the two
so<00:01:25.250> pre<00:01:26.250> pretty<00:01:26.729> awesome<00:01:28.640> that<00:01:29.640> has<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.869> vehicle

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
so pre pretty awesome that has a vehicle

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.249 
so pre pretty awesome that has a vehicle
so<00:01:31.079> fast<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:32.840> blaster<00:01:33.840> down<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:34.140> they

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
so fast like a blaster down here they

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.420 
so fast like a blaster down here they
can<00:01:34.439> swivel<00:01:35.150> 360°<00:01:36.150> all<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.780> way<00:01:36.869> around<00:01:37.430> very

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
can swivel 360° all the way around very

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.330 
can swivel 360° all the way around very
cool<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.869> foot<00:01:40.110> pedals<00:01:40.470> are<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.680> our<00:01:40.890> on

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
cool and the foot pedals are on our on

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.460 
cool and the foot pedals are on our on
springs<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:43.530> i<00:01:44.750> guess<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.899> give<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> figure<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
springs so i guess to give the figure a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.230 
springs so i guess to give the figure a
little<00:01:46.680> bit<00:01:46.770> more<00:01:46.950> balance<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.939> sitting

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
little bit more balance and sitting

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.429 
little bit more balance and sitting
there<00:01:48.439> makes<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.770> look<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.130> its<00:01:51.200> speed<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.320> i

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
there makes it look like its speed and i

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.889 
there makes it look like its speed and i
guess<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:54.090> i<00:01:54.180> wish<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.509> was<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> little<00:01:54.689> bit

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
guess and i wish it was a little bit

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.359 
guess and i wish it was a little bit
more<00:01:55.020> balanced<00:01:55.530> where<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> didn't<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.189> to

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
more balanced where it didn't have to

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.090 
more balanced where it didn't have to
you<00:01:57.149> know<00:01:57.380> didn't<00:01:58.380> fall<00:01:58.590> down<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.040> was

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
you know didn't fall down like that was

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.560 
you know didn't fall down like that was
actually<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.640> kind<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.030> balanced<00:02:00.479> up

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
actually just kind of like balanced up

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.660 
actually just kind of like balanced up
like<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.930> i'm<00:02:01.799> not<00:02:01.920> sure<00:02:02.009> if<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> pedal<00:02:02.610> is

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
like that i'm not sure if the pedal is

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.730 
like that i'm not sure if the pedal is
actually<00:02:02.909> lock<00:02:03.060> into<00:02:03.240> place<00:02:03.439> back<00:02:04.439> here

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
actually lock into place back here

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.990 
actually lock into place back here
because<00:02:05.009> I've<00:02:05.130> seen<00:02:05.159> reviews<00:02:05.729> where<00:02:05.909> they

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
because I've seen reviews where they

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.580
