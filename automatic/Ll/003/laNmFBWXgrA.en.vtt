00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
liking this new method I did not make

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.420 
liking this new method I did not make
this<00:00:29.789> method<00:00:30.029> up<00:00:30.330> I've<00:00:30.570> seen<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.019> before<00:00:31.380> but<00:00:32.160> I

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
this method up I've seen it before but I

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.030 
this method up I've seen it before but I
wanted<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.180> make<00:00:33.329> one<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.809> wanted<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.410> show

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
wanted to make one so I wanted to show

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.510 
wanted to make one so I wanted to show
you<00:00:35.070> guys<00:00:35.460> how<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.149> did<00:00:36.480> mine<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:37.110> did<00:00:37.620> kind<00:00:38.460> of

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
you guys how I did mine I did kind of

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.940 
you guys how I did mine I did kind of
try<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:38.850> replicate<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.719> patterns<00:00:40.140> from<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
try and replicate the patterns from the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.720 
try and replicate the patterns from the
Sigma<00:00:42.200> cleaning<00:00:43.610> glove<00:00:44.610> whatever<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.629> um

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
Sigma cleaning glove whatever it is um

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.160 
Sigma cleaning glove whatever it is um
but<00:00:47.730> that's<00:00:48.090> pretty<00:00:48.390> much<00:00:48.510> where<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.780> got<00:00:48.989> my

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
but that's pretty much where I got my

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.930 
but that's pretty much where I got my
patterns<00:00:49.710> from<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> think<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> would<00:00:50.910> work

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
patterns from but I think it would work

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.350 
patterns from but I think it would work
with<00:00:51.210> any<00:00:51.329> patterns<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.160> it<00:00:53.160> was<00:00:53.579> super

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
with any patterns and it was super

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.560 
with any patterns and it was super
awesome<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:55.559> use<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.219> super<00:00:56.670> easy<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.329> hope

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
awesome to use and super easy so I hope

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.130 
awesome to use and super easy so I hope

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.140 
get it hot duh and at first I started I
was<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.890> gonna<00:01:17.040> do<00:01:17.250> section<00:01:17.580> before<00:01:17.759> but

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
was just gonna do section before but

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.940 
was just gonna do section before but
then<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.330> decided<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.900> into<00:01:19.049> 6<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.590> they're<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
then I decided to go into 6 so they're a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.980 
then I decided to go into 6 so they're a
little<00:01:20.250> off<00:01:20.640> balance<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.570> okay<00:01:21.810> it

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
little off balance but that's okay it

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.570 
little off balance but that's okay it
doesn't<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.350> make<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> difference<00:01:22.650> I

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
doesn't really make a difference I

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.969 
doesn't really make a difference I
decided<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.390> 6<00:01:24.659> patterns<00:01:25.080> because<00:01:25.619> I

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
decided to do 6 patterns because I

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.740 
decided to do 6 patterns because I
wanted<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.340> do<00:01:26.520> aside<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.150> my<00:01:27.270> eye<00:01:27.420> brushes

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
wanted to do aside for my eye brushes

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.499 
wanted to do aside for my eye brushes
and<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.259> side<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:28.920> my<00:01:29.009> face<00:01:29.250> brushes<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.299> right

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and a side for my face brushes so right

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.819 
and a side for my face brushes so right
here<00:01:30.780> I'm<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:30.990> getting<00:01:31.320> started<00:01:31.500> by<00:01:31.770> doing

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
here I'm just getting started by doing

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.740 
here I'm just getting started by doing
some<00:01:32.189> diagonal<00:01:32.490> lines<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.180> first<00:01:33.450> I'm<00:01:33.600> going

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
some diagonal lines so first I'm going

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.080 
some diagonal lines so first I'm going
to<00:01:33.990> left<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.770> right<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.250> all<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
to left and then the right and all the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.149 
to left and then the right and all the
way<00:01:36.210> down<00:01:36.240> until<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.930> first<00:01:37.170> section<00:01:38.009> is

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
way down until the first section is

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:48.400 
way down until the first section is
filled

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.960 

so<00:01:49.410> for<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> second<00:01:50.010> section<00:01:50.220> I'm<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.700> going

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
so for the second section I'm just going

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.630 
so for the second section I'm just going
to<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:51.120> doing<00:01:51.210> large<00:01:51.600> dots<00:01:52.130> using<00:01:53.130> large<00:01:53.310> dots

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
to be doing large dots using large dots

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.890 
to be doing large dots using large dots
because<00:01:53.850> I'm<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.120> to<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.270> using<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.660> side

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
because I'm going to be using this side

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.560 
because I'm going to be using this side
for<00:01:55.110> my<00:01:55.200> face<00:01:55.380> brushes<00:01:55.650> so<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.370> want<00:01:56.820> them<00:01:57.120> to<00:01:57.150> be

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
for my face brushes so I want them to be

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.990 
for my face brushes so I want them to be

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
really high up off the surface of the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:16.660 
really high up off the surface of the
board

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.010 

for<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.760> section<00:02:18.000> I'm<00:02:18.300> doing<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.630> exact

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
for this section I'm doing the exact

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.930 
for this section I'm doing the exact
lines<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.680> those<00:02:19.950> are<00:02:20.099> super<00:02:20.489> quick<00:02:20.700> and

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
lines and those are super quick and

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.900 
lines and those are super quick and
super<00:02:21.360> easy<00:02:21.750> on<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.830> next<00:02:23.010> section<00:02:23.310> are<00:02:23.489> thick

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
super easy on the next section are thick

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.870 
super easy on the next section are thick
straight<00:02:24.420> lines<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.989> I<00:02:25.080> kind<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.670> had<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.760> go

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
straight lines and I kind of had to go

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.100 
straight lines and I kind of had to go
over<00:02:26.910> them<00:02:27.120> twice<00:02:27.360> just<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.720> make<00:02:27.780> sure<00:02:27.900> that

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
over them twice just to make sure that

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.500 
over them twice just to make sure that
they<00:02:28.170> were<00:02:28.260> super<00:02:28.650> thick<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:30.120> bottom

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
they were super thick this bottom

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.780 
they were super thick this bottom
section<00:02:30.690> here<00:02:30.959> is<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.530> smaller<00:02:31.830> dot<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:32.400> it's

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
section here is the smaller dot and it's

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.509 
section here is the smaller dot and it's
smaller<00:02:33.120> then<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:34.349> larger<00:02:34.769> dot<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.160> section

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
smaller then the larger dot this section

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.420 
smaller then the larger dot this section
because<00:02:35.819> I'm<00:02:35.970> using<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.390> for<00:02:36.510> my<00:02:36.690> eye<00:02:36.930> brushes

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.270 

and<00:02:41.930> don't<00:02:42.930> worry<00:02:43.170> about<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.590> access<00:02:43.980> glue

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
and don't worry about the access glue

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.100 
and don't worry about the access glue
because<00:02:44.610> all<00:02:44.819> that<00:02:45.090> comes<00:02:45.330> off<00:02:45.510> once<00:02:45.870> you

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
because all that comes off once you

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.199 
because all that comes off once you
rinse<00:02:46.290> your<00:02:46.530> clipboard<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.310> all<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.940> left

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
rinse your clipboard and all that left

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.160 
rinse your clipboard and all that left
is<00:02:48.390> going<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.720> be<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.310> larger<00:02:50.310> unglue<00:02:51.049> designs

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.410 

and<00:02:55.170> for<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.950> last<00:02:56.160> section<00:02:56.610> I'm<00:02:56.819> just<00:02:57.060> doing

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
and for the last section I'm just doing

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.620 
and for the last section I'm just doing
this<00:02:57.630> like<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.230> guess<00:02:58.380> plaid<00:02:58.799> cross<00:02:59.459> hatch<00:03:00.120> kind

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
this like I guess plaid cross hatch kind

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.229 
this like I guess plaid cross hatch kind
of<00:03:00.750> design<00:03:01.049> so<00:03:01.319> I<00:03:02.250> just<00:03:02.670> started<00:03:02.940> with<00:03:03.060> going

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
of design so I just started with going

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.570 
of design so I just started with going
diagonal<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.080> then<00:03:04.170> made<00:03:04.380> parole<00:03:04.590> crosses

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
diagonal and then made parole crosses

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.550 
diagonal and then made parole crosses
going<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.090> opposite<00:03:06.569> direction<00:03:06.630> on<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.470> way

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
going the opposite direction on the way

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.650 
going the opposite direction on the way
back<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.099> this<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.430> perfect<00:03:09.000> for<00:03:09.060> rinsing

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660

back and this is perfect for rinsing
your<00:03:09.810> brushes<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.610> really<00:03:12.030> does<00:03:12.239> get<00:03:12.569> them

any olive oil it doesn't only make a
difference<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.920> just<00:03:41.100> use<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> little<00:03:41.549> bit<00:03:41.670> to

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
difference I just use a little bit to

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.270 
difference I just use a little bit to
add<00:03:42.299> to<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.690> um<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.290> just<00:03:43.440> makes<00:03:43.739> my<00:03:43.950> brush<00:03:44.130> is

as<00:04:30.200> you<00:04:31.200> can<00:04:31.320> see<00:04:31.530> this<00:04:31.920> is<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.310> first<00:04:32.640> I<00:04:32.820> brush

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
as you can see this is the first I brush

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.090 
as you can see this is the first I brush
that<00:04:33.510> I'm<00:04:33.660> washing<00:04:34.170> and<00:04:34.590> I'm<00:04:34.680> using<00:04:34.860> the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
that I'm washing and I'm using the

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.130 
that I'm washing and I'm using the
opposite<00:04:35.580> side<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:36.060> believe<00:04:36.600> that<00:04:37.050> the

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
opposite side I believe that the

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.810 
opposite side I believe that the
patterns<00:04:37.470> on<00:04:37.620> this<00:04:37.800> I<00:04:37.920> just<00:04:37.980> work<00:04:38.310> better<00:04:38.490> with

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
patterns on this I just work better with

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.970 
patterns on this I just work better with
the<00:04:39.000> smaller<00:04:39.330> brushes<00:04:39.660> and<00:04:40.590> getting<00:04:40.860> in

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
the smaller brushes and getting in

00:04:40.980 --> 00:05:39.629 
the smaller brushes and getting in
between<00:04:41.310> their<00:04:41.520> bristles

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.369 

the<00:05:40.639> support<00:05:41.210> isn't<00:05:41.509> just<00:05:41.689> for<00:05:41.840> brushes<00:05:42.169> it

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:42.379 
the support isn't just for brushes it

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.320 
the support isn't just for brushes it
works<00:05:42.590> great<00:05:42.979> for<00:05:43.280> cleaning<00:05:43.520> any<00:05:44.000> of<00:05:44.210> your

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
works great for cleaning any of your

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.140 
works great for cleaning any of your
makeup<00:05:44.689> sponges<00:05:45.110> I'm<00:05:45.439> cleaning<00:05:46.099> my<00:05:46.520> beauty

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
makeup sponges I'm cleaning my beauty

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.790 
makeup sponges I'm cleaning my beauty
blender<00:05:47.300> here<00:05:47.719> and<00:05:47.960> I<00:05:48.020> also<00:05:48.199> cleaned<00:05:48.620> my

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
blender here and I also cleaned my

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.730 
blender here and I also cleaned my
glamour<00:05:49.069> sponge<00:05:49.400> and<00:05:49.719> they<00:05:50.719> look<00:05:51.050> cleaner

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
glamour sponge and they look cleaner

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.170 
glamour sponge and they look cleaner
than<00:05:51.979> they<00:05:52.099> ever<00:05:52.310> have<00:05:52.669> before

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
than they ever have before

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.119 
than they ever have before
so<00:05:53.449> I<00:05:53.479> think<00:05:53.810> it<00:05:53.900> works<00:05:54.050> great<00:05:54.379> for<00:05:54.439> that<00:05:54.620> it

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:55.129 
so I think it works great for that it

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:56.890 
so I think it works great for that it
did<00:05:55.430> take<00:05:55.580> a<00:05:55.610> little<00:05:55.879> longer<00:05:56.120> to<00:05:56.419> clean<00:05:56.689> them

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
did take a little longer to clean them

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.230 
did take a little longer to clean them
than<00:05:57.530> the<00:05:57.919> brushes<00:05:58.310> but<00:05:58.610> that's<00:05:58.879> because<00:05:59.120> I

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
than the brushes but that's because I

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.700 
than the brushes but that's because I
had<00:05:59.360> to<00:05:59.479> go<00:05:59.599> all<00:05:59.780> around<00:05:59.930> them<00:06:00.229> and<00:06:00.379> I<00:06:00.439> really

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
had to go all around them and I really

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.770 
had to go all around them and I really
wanted<00:06:00.919> to<00:06:01.009> make<00:06:01.189> sure<00:06:01.219> that<00:06:01.699> I<00:06:02.389> got<00:06:02.539> some

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
wanted to make sure that I got some

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.409 
wanted to make sure that I got some
makeup<00:06:02.960> out<00:06:03.169> of<00:06:03.199> them<00:06:03.439> um<00:06:03.860> so<00:06:04.849> this<00:06:05.180> works

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
makeup out of them um so this works

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:28.720 
makeup out of them um so this works
perfect<00:06:05.900> for<00:06:05.960> them<00:06:06.289> for<00:06:06.620> cleaning<00:06:06.740> those

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.450 

in<00:06:29.540> here<00:06:30.290> is<00:06:30.410> this<00:06:30.530> before-and-after<00:06:31.220> look

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
in here is this before-and-after look

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.210 
in here is this before-and-after look
how<00:06:31.670> clean<00:06:32.060> they<00:06:32.270> are<00:06:32.300> people<00:06:33.110> how<00:06:33.860> I<00:06:33.890> Drive

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220 
how clean they are people how I Drive

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.700 
how clean they are people how I Drive
them<00:06:34.370> is<00:06:34.520> I<00:06:34.610> just<00:06:34.820> fold<00:06:35.030> up<00:06:35.180> a<00:06:35.300> towel<00:06:35.510> in<00:06:36.500> thick

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
them is I just fold up a towel in thick

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.130 
them is I just fold up a towel in thick
sections<00:06:37.100> and<00:06:37.310> then<00:06:37.850> I<00:06:38.030> put<00:06:38.420> my<00:06:38.450> brushes<00:06:38.810> um

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.140 
sections and then I put my brushes um

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.100 
sections and then I put my brushes um
with<00:06:39.890> the<00:06:40.070> purses<00:06:40.430> facing<00:06:40.760> down<00:06:40.970> so<00:06:41.600> that<00:06:41.750> none

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
with the purses facing down so that none

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.540 
with the purses facing down so that none
of<00:06:42.140> the<00:06:42.350> water<00:06:42.530> can<00:06:42.860> get<00:06:42.980> back<00:06:43.130> into<00:06:43.460> the

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
of the water can get back into the

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.340 
of the water can get back into the
handle<00:06:43.850> which<00:06:44.030> will<00:06:44.060> destroy<00:06:44.540> your<00:06:44.870> brush<00:06:45.110> and

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
handle which will destroy your brush and

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.630 
handle which will destroy your brush and
you<00:06:45.470> never<00:06:45.650> want<00:06:45.950> to<00:06:46.010> dry<00:06:46.130> your<00:06:46.160> brushes<00:06:46.550> that

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
you never want to dry your brushes that

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.310 
you never want to dry your brushes that
way<00:06:46.820> I<00:06:47.090> find<00:06:47.540> that<00:06:47.630> they<00:06:47.750> dry<00:06:47.930> a<00:06:47.960> lot<00:06:48.140> quicker

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.320 
way I find that they dry a lot quicker

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.080 
way I find that they dry a lot quicker
the<00:06:48.710> towel<00:06:48.890> is<00:06:49.100> a<00:06:49.190> lot<00:06:49.340> more<00:06:49.490> absorbent<00:06:49.880> than<00:06:49.940> a

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
the towel is a lot more absorbent than a

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.020 
the towel is a lot more absorbent than a
paper<00:06:50.240> towel<00:06:50.510> and<00:06:50.630> lying<00:06:51.080> them<00:06:51.350> flat<00:06:51.680> and<00:06:52.070> it's

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
paper towel and lying them flat and it's

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.860 
paper towel and lying them flat and it's
also<00:06:53.210> a<00:06:53.330> lot<00:06:53.450> easier<00:06:53.510> to<00:06:54.020> reshape<00:06:54.530> them<00:06:54.860> so

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
also a lot easier to reshape them so

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.050 
also a lot easier to reshape them so
this<00:06:56.870> works<00:06:57.110> the<00:06:57.290> best<00:06:57.440> for<00:06:57.710> me<00:06:58.040> and<00:06:58.520> they

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
this works the best for me and they

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.500 
this works the best for me and they
usually<00:06:59.300> are<00:06:59.540> dry<00:06:59.870> overnight<00:07:00.410> so<00:07:01.390> except<00:07:02.390> for

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
usually are dry overnight so except for

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.700 
usually are dry overnight so except for
some<00:07:02.630> of<00:07:02.720> my<00:07:02.810> heavier<00:07:03.080> brushes<00:07:03.410> that<00:07:03.500> might

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:03.710 
some of my heavier brushes that might

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.010 
some of my heavier brushes that might
have<00:07:03.920> to<00:07:04.160> let<00:07:05.090> them<00:07:05.240> sit<00:07:05.480> for<00:07:05.540> a<00:07:05.720> little<00:07:05.810> longer

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
have to let them sit for a little longer

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.260 
have to let them sit for a little longer
but<00:07:06.290> usually<00:07:06.710> overnight<00:07:07.160> and<00:07:07.400> this<00:07:07.910> is<00:07:08.090> what

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
but usually overnight and this is what

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.250 
but usually overnight and this is what
they<00:07:08.420> all<00:07:08.600> look<00:07:08.870> like<00:07:10.690> so<00:07:11.690> I<00:07:11.720> hope<00:07:11.870> this<00:07:12.080> was

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:12.260 
they all look like so I hope this was

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.930
