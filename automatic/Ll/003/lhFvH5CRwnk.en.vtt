could be pretty cool if it's done right
I<00:03:05.450> know<00:03:05.630> some<00:03:05.840> people<00:03:05.870> have<00:03:06.170> tried<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.500> done

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
I know some people have tried to done

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.350 
I know some people have tried to done
anything<00:03:06.830> pass<00:03:07.130> but<00:03:07.520> and<00:03:07.970> they<00:03:08.090> can<00:03:08.240> really

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
anything pass but and they can really

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.940 
anything pass but and they can really
integrate<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:08.960> with<00:03:09.020> Xbox<00:03:09.500> Live<00:03:09.710> that's

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
integrate that with Xbox Live that's

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.200 
integrate that with Xbox Live that's
going<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.130> be<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.250> cool<00:03:10.400> little<00:03:10.580> feature<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:11.090> it

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
going to be a cool little feature to it

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.210 
going to be a cool little feature to it
but<00:03:12.140> basically<00:03:12.410> just<00:03:12.620> ask<00:03:12.860> from<00:03:13.070> these

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
but basically just ask from these

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.980 
but basically just ask from these
pictures<00:03:13.550> you<00:03:13.640> can<00:03:13.730> see<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.270> bottom<00:03:14.300> line<00:03:14.720> is

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
pictures you can see the bottom line is

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.050 
pictures you can see the bottom line is
it<00:03:15.140> Microsoft<00:03:16.070> took<00:03:16.250> his<00:03:16.370> time<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.850> really

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
it Microsoft took his time and really

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.600 
it Microsoft took his time and really
just<00:03:17.180> just<00:03:17.810> got<00:03:18.320> done<00:03:18.680> with<00:03:18.830> everything<00:03:19.340> from

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
just just got done with everything from

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.070 
just just got done with everything from
the<00:03:19.700> beginning<00:03:19.790> just<00:03:20.270> start<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.600> brand<00:03:20.930> new

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
the beginning just start a brand new

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.900 
the beginning just start a brand new
fresh<00:03:21.320> with<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:21.710> it<00:03:22.010> looks<00:03:22.310> like<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.850> looks

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
fresh with this it looks like it looks

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.310 
fresh with this it looks like it looks
like<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.120> great<00:03:23.450> platform<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:24.020> actually

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
like a great platform to actually

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.490 
like a great platform to actually
develop<00:03:24.440> apps<00:03:24.860> for<00:03:25.660> its<00:03:26.660> come<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.020> devices

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
develop apps for its come to the devices

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.780 
develop apps for its come to the devices
when<00:03:27.650> we<00:03:27.770> can<00:03:27.890> actually<00:03:28.010> see<00:03:28.340> this<00:03:28.490> thing<00:03:28.670> on

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
when we can actually see this thing on

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.060 
when we can actually see this thing on
some<00:03:28.940> devices<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:30.140> don't<00:03:30.620> know<00:03:30.710> if<00:03:30.770> they<00:03:30.830> said<00:03:31.040> a

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
some devices I don't know if they said a

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.620 
some devices I don't know if they said a
set<00:03:31.490> date<00:03:31.760> yet<00:03:31.790> but<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.180> would<00:03:32.300> think<00:03:32.330> by<00:03:32.570> the

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
set date yet but I would think by the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.600 
set date yet but I would think by the
end<00:03:32.750> of<00:03:32.990> 2010<00:03:33.710> at<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:33.920> latest<00:03:34.130> we<00:03:34.280> should<00:03:34.490> see

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
end of 2010 at the latest we should see

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.040 
end of 2010 at the latest we should see
our<00:03:34.640> first<00:03:34.940> phones<00:03:35.240> coming<00:03:35.540> with<00:03:35.750> minute

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
our first phones coming with minute

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.480 
our first phones coming with minute
windows<00:03:36.320> mobile<00:03:36.500> seven<00:03:36.770> it's<00:03:37.250> gonna<00:03:37.370> be

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
windows mobile seven it's gonna be

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.160 
windows mobile seven it's gonna be
available<00:03:37.790> for<00:03:37.940> all<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.270> major<00:03:38.390> carriers<00:03:38.600> out

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
available for all the major carriers out

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.500 
available for all the major carriers out
there<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:39.950> said<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.190> first<00:03:40.430> range<00:03:41.209> of

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
there and it said the first range of

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.150 
there and it said the first range of
phones<00:03:42.110> that<00:03:42.350> come<00:03:42.500> out<00:03:42.620> with<00:03:42.770> windows<00:03:43.010> mobile

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
phones that come out with windows mobile

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.100 
phones that come out with windows mobile
seven<00:03:43.400> actually<00:03:43.760> look<00:03:44.090> pretty<00:03:44.120> similar<00:03:44.780> or

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
seven actually look pretty similar or

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.960 
seven actually look pretty similar or
may<00:03:45.410> even<00:03:45.440> be<00:03:45.800> the<00:03:45.920> same<00:03:46.160> type<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.430> phone<00:03:46.760> so

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
may even be the same type of phone so

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
may even be the same type of phone so
it's<00:03:47.090> not<00:03:47.209> going<00:03:47.300> to<00:03:47.390> be<00:03:47.480> just<00:03:47.570> thrown<00:03:47.780> out

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
it's not going to be just thrown out

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.140 
it's not going to be just thrown out
there<00:03:48.140> like<00:03:48.290> Android<00:03:48.770> so<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.640> first<00:03:49.820> phones

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
there like Android so the first phones

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.070 
there like Android so the first phones
that<00:03:50.300> come<00:03:50.450> out<00:03:50.570> are<00:03:50.600> going<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:50.930> look<00:03:51.020> pretty

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
that come out are going to look pretty

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.380 
that come out are going to look pretty
similar<00:03:51.560> but<00:03:51.740> i'm<00:03:52.160> pretty<00:03:52.820> sure<00:03:53.030> shortly

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
similar but i'm pretty sure shortly

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.730 
similar but i'm pretty sure shortly
thereafter<00:03:53.540> we'll<00:03:54.230> see<00:03:54.380> some<00:03:54.560> more

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
thereafter we'll see some more

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.560 
thereafter we'll see some more
integrated<00:03:55.490> phones<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:55.940> some<00:03:56.120> better<00:03:56.300> phones

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
integrated phones to some better phones

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.060 
integrated phones to some better phones
out<00:03:56.780> there<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:57.140> don't<00:03:57.290> don't<00:03:57.680> kind<00:03:57.980> of

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
out there that don't don't kind of

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.770 
out there that don't don't kind of
straight<00:03:58.430> away<00:03:58.550> from<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.820> norm<00:03:59.060> as<00:03:59.420> far<00:03:59.720> as

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
straight away from the norm as far as

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.510 
straight away from the norm as far as
when<00:03:59.900> the<00:03:59.990> mobile<00:04:00.260> seven<00:04:00.440> phones<00:04:00.740> but<00:04:01.220> anyway

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
when the mobile seven phones but anyway

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.920 
when the mobile seven phones but anyway
i'm<00:04:01.700> very<00:04:01.910> excited<00:04:02.150> about<00:04:02.300> this<00:04:02.420> operation

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
i'm very excited about this operation

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.750 
i'm very excited about this operation
system<00:04:03.170> because<00:04:03.470> i<00:04:03.650> have<00:04:04.040> used<00:04:04.310> windows

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
system because i have used windows

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.180 
system because i have used windows
mobile<00:04:04.880> devices<00:04:05.390> before<00:04:05.570> my<00:04:05.870> iphone<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.500> i

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
mobile devices before my iphone and i

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.760 
mobile devices before my iphone and i
kinda<00:04:07.670> like<00:04:08.240> them<00:04:08.510> back<00:04:08.720> in<00:04:08.900> those<00:04:09.110> days<00:04:09.140> but

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
kinda like them back in those days but

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:10.990 
kinda like them back in those days but
when<00:04:09.890> I<00:04:09.920> look<00:04:10.130> back<00:04:10.160> on<00:04:10.430> it<00:04:10.490> now<00:04:10.580> that<00:04:10.880> we're

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
when I look back on it now that we're

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.520 
when I look back on it now that we're
pretty<00:04:11.150> clunky<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.720> what<00:04:11.870> was<00:04:12.020> out<00:04:12.170> there<00:04:12.200> now

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
pretty clunky to what was out there now

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.140 
pretty clunky to what was out there now
so<00:04:13.070> this<00:04:13.220> would<00:04:13.370> be<00:04:13.430> pretty<00:04:13.700> cool<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.910> see<00:04:14.030> how

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
so this would be pretty cool to see how
