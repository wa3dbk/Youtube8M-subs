accelerating<00:01:57.979> pretty<00:01:58.460> cool<00:01:58.670> feature<00:01:58.850> also

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
accelerating pretty cool feature also

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.150 
accelerating pretty cool feature also
the<00:01:59.660> other<00:01:59.780> big<00:02:00.080> advantage<00:02:00.590> that<00:02:01.009> you're

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
going to get on the automated driving is

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.900 
going to get on the automated driving is
the<00:02:02.810> lane<00:02:03.020> assist<00:02:03.290> feature<00:02:03.649> is<00:02:04.040> very<00:02:04.520> useful

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
the lane assist feature is very useful
