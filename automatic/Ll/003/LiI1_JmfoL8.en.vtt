now<00:00:14.620> for<00:00:15.220> the<00:00:15.400> giant<00:00:15.970> Trinity<00:00:17.070> what's<00:00:18.070> new<00:00:18.310> for

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
now for the giant Trinity what's new for

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.710 
now for the giant Trinity what's new for
2011<00:00:19.120> the<00:00:20.460> Trinity<00:00:21.460> used<00:00:21.820> to<00:00:22.000> have<00:00:22.180> two<00:00:22.480> models

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
2011 the Trinity used to have two models

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.029 
2011 the Trinity used to have two models
the<00:00:23.680> Trinity<00:00:24.130> one<00:00:24.430> and<00:00:24.699> the<00:00:25.330> Trinity<00:00:25.600> zero<00:00:26.080> but

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
the Trinity one and the Trinity zero but

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.029 
the Trinity one and the Trinity zero but
shine<00:00:27.310> eliminated<00:00:28.029> the<00:00:28.330> lower<00:00:28.600> version<00:00:29.140> they

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
shine eliminated the lower version they

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.200 
shine eliminated the lower version they
kept<00:00:30.400> the<00:00:30.550> upper<00:00:30.730> version<00:00:31.300> and<00:00:31.739> renamed<00:00:32.739> it

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
kept the upper version and renamed it

many of those changes into their new
speed<00:03:10.579> concept

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
speed concept

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.930 
speed concept
we<00:03:12.660> like<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.080> ability<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.830> use<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.640> speech

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
we like the ability to use the speech

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.800 
we like the ability to use the speech
storage<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:16.770> speech<00:03:17.040> storage<00:03:17.640> not<00:03:18.360> just

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
storage the speech storage not just

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.949 
storage the speech storage not just
gives<00:03:19.319> you<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.680> ability<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.099> carry<00:03:20.959> flat

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
gives you the ability to carry flat

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.070 
gives you the ability to carry flat
repair<00:03:22.349> stuff<00:03:22.739> or<00:03:23.459> small<00:03:23.700> items<00:03:24.150> but<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.870> also

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
repair stuff or small items but it also

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.660 
repair stuff or small items but it also
increases<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.980> aerodynamics<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.090> bike

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
increases the aerodynamics of the bike

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.030 
increases the aerodynamics of the bike
we<00:03:29.670> also<00:03:29.849> like<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.209> speed<00:03:30.690> trap<00:03:31.200> integrated

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
we also like the speed trap integrated

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.240 
we also like the speed trap integrated
speed<00:03:32.310> sensor<00:03:33.019> this<00:03:34.019> gives<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.620> very<00:03:34.830> nice

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
speed sensor this gives a very nice

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.960

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
clean look to the bike without having to

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.790 
clean look to the bike without having to

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
flight computers what we did not like

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.770

Shrek did use speech trap technology
that<00:04:22.550> integrates<00:04:23.260> into<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.380> fork<00:04:24.680> but<00:04:25.400> you

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
that integrates into the fork but you

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.710 
that integrates into the fork but you
can<00:04:25.670> only<00:04:25.850> get<00:04:26.120> speed<00:04:27.670> we<00:04:28.670> also<00:04:28.850> did<00:04:29.270> not<00:04:29.300> like

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
can only get speed we also did not like

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.400 
can only get speed we also did not like
that<00:04:30.140> for<00:04:30.380> only<00:04:30.700> 500<00:04:31.700> more<00:04:31.910> dollars<00:04:32.390> you<00:04:32.660> can

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410
