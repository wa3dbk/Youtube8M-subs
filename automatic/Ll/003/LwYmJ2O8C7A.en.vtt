00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
feeling and I don't know where that

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.090 
feeling and I don't know where that
comes<00:01:42.540> from<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.860> gut<00:01:44.070> feeling

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100

says Krista I aspire to be a head buyer
for<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.319> clothing<00:03:00.040> store<00:03:00.310> at<00:03:00.519> some<00:03:00.730> point<00:03:00.970> what

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
for a clothing store at some point what

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:02.670 
for a clothing store at some point what
do<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.810> tell<00:03:01.959> them<00:03:02.079> is<00:03:02.230> there<00:03:02.349> anything<00:03:02.500> they

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
do you tell them is there anything they

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.110 
do you tell them is there anything they
can<00:03:02.709> do<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.010> prepare<00:03:03.459> themselves<00:03:03.639> to<00:03:03.970> get

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
can do to prepare themselves to get

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.530 
can do to prepare themselves to get
there<00:03:04.359> I<00:03:04.540> think<00:03:05.319> so<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.709> think<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.909> the<00:03:07.329> thing

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
there I think so I think the the thing

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.420 
there I think so I think the the thing
is<00:03:07.569> is<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.019> there's<00:03:08.230> all<00:03:08.650> these<00:03:08.829> majors<00:03:09.250> when

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
is is that there's all these majors when

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.099 
is is that there's all these majors when
you<00:03:09.519> go<00:03:09.609> to<00:03:09.700> college<00:03:09.879> and<00:03:10.269> I<00:03:10.359> don't<00:03:10.419> think

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
you go to college and I don't think

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.899 
you go to college and I don't think
necessarily<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:12.129> should<00:03:12.340> be<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.459> fashion

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
necessarily you should be a fashion

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.179 
necessarily you should be a fashion
major<00:03:13.450> because<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.530> need<00:03:14.709> all<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:15.040> other
