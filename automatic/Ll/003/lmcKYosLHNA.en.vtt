00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.519
 hello today's tutorial is about 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.160
 the application of the black pencil 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.740
 recreating a very thin money line e 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.919
 a very popular tutorial especially 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.720
 from those who are just starting to wear makeup 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.849
 so I won't get you with this tutorial 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.300
 I will ask neither to be precise nor to 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.489
 absolutely have a firm hand 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.370
 we will be able to recreate a line 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.850
 very thin without taking too much 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:44.050
 commitment or lose too much time 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:47.020
 it is absolutely a small technique that 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.160
 you can also really use both 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.890
 I started to wear makeup so yesterday 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.160
 very simple I have already realized how 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.859
 see in this hatred applied 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.000
 simply a very small one 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.619
 very thin black pencil line and yes 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.020
 can notice the difference between 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.170
 this eye and the eye instead 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.729
 where the pencil is not present from 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.289
 note that I didn't even put the 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:19.149
 mascara so just to show you 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:21.759
 the difference from eye to eye is fine 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.759
 ok I total leave not see myself more 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.490
 chatter so I use a pencil 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.209
 black like this well tempered me 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.780
 I recommend is the use of the pencil not of 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:37.569
 tip but lying down by going right to 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.439
 create traits almost to scribble 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:46.380
 if we mean just between the eyelashes 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.380
 but starting from below in this way 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.570
 as I said before is not important 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.570
 be precise 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.180
 ok it's important to have colored well 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:26.170
 all 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.420
 then the whole area between the lashes 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.690
 not me as you can well see 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.700
 I'm definitely not putting some 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.400
 attention I'm making mistakes that 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.010
 everyone could also do who he is 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.470
 I started repeating that I did my makeup yesterday 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:48.580
 so I 'm just not putting the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:51.130
 minimum attention in putting on makeup so ok 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.709
 once done this talk now 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.900
 pra and the eyelashes then point the pencil 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.690
 in this way I try to recreate a 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.019
 row as thin as possible but I also repeat 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.019
 in this case it is not necessary to be 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.019
 precise 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.500
 ok now i'll ask you how it's done 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.730
 how you will ever do it and get out of this 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.209
 disaster 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.060
 then all you need is a stick of 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.810
 as simple as this cotton I have it 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.939
 simply dampened but can with 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.909
 of water with simple water but 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:53.340
 it can also be moistened with one 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:56.010
 make -up remover as long as it is not one 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.560
 oily makeup remover because later we have to 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.019
 so touch us we don't want any oil 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.629
 on the eyelid 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.799
 then let's start from the inside 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:16.320
 as if we had to remove make-up like that 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:19.009
 let's start from the inside and pull ok 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.009
 repeat 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.020
 now let's repeat it from the outside towards 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.020
 the interior 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.219
 here is the very thin line now I 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.979
 I became very red because with the 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:06.289
 it takes very delicate so even if I have 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.979
 gently pulled the skin has 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.240
 reddened 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:13.520
 so we have now created ours 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.990
 row of very thin pencil without being 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.629
 precise without having to have a steady hand 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.710
 now you simply need to apply 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:27.379
 above the eye shadow or the concealer 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.860
 or even the foundation if not 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:33.770
 it is not a fat transfer skin and then 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.599
 wear makeup normally 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.969
 here's how you can see this result 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.849
 simply completed with a little 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.469
 eye shadow on the eyelid I put 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.460
 the mascara 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:49.159
 and this is the result a trick indeed 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.870
 very easy to do because fast 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:54.139
 you do n't have to be careful and that's it 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.779
 simply pass the cotton swab 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.909
 above and complete the trick then 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:01.909
 nothing difficult is a result 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:05.270
 really a make up artist without though 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:08.979
 being practically okay this is 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.979
 see you all next time
