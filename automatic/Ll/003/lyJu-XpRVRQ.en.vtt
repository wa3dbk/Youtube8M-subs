00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.599
 today will talk about what is the 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.429
 streiff and how to use it in your favor 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.280

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.259
 faster making your doll walk 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.839
 for faster sides 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.029
 what advantage you will be able to use to 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.589
 you get the information for example you 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.570

 Are you going to walk sideways like this? 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.890
 using streiff to get the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.810
 information you can use 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.290
 to surprise the enemy for example 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.960

 kill him dare to prescribe bullets that is 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.700
 more or less the same thing as a mix of 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.850

 persson flash will let you show 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.470
 How do you always show yourself here in the game? 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.820
 of the last command is the brain in 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.970
 taekwondo faces online teams keio one is 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.380
 the default if I use for example half I 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.659
 I'm going to slow down the game for 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.280
 media and use 03 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.620
 I'm slowing down the game. 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.300
 by 0 3 the first thing is your nephew 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.300
 a party this size 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.080
 if I'm here I hope you 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.000
 I agree with a guy from the car 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.770
 if I have looked straight that of a 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.520
 turn on the camera to demonstrate 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.560
 you 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.090
 He'll be able to see my shoulder then. 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.950
 If you have a guy, he'll get me. 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.220
 to see 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.180
 now at the same time if I only have here 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.130
 so I'm not seeing anything 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.459
 a guy where that boat is going 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.200
 I can see my shoulder well 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.989
 handjob of my shoulder 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.370
 any idea if I'm opening here 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.159
 I'm exposing myself a lot 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.110
 I 'm just getting more information, I'm 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.060
 opening a little bit as soon as 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.370
 to show already come back I'm just 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.090
 showing my shoulder causing the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.629
 enemy will probably shoot the same thing 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.849
 on here 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.099
 if you are a tr you want to know if you have the 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.560
 wp fixed you will not open everything and 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.870
 come back if you 're going to die you 're going almost 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.790
 Brito and will come back and understand how 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.700
 You do this technique, you walk. 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.200
 to the side and you drop your doll 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.360
 have a speed so now let's 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.769
 leave with command here I'm going to start 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.629
 walking with a doll on the left and 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.069
 come back to see you 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.930
 he got 250 speed and back 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:59.440
 I passed the carriage, I look at how much 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.900
 the doll slipped any ideas now 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.269
 I'll use the streiff how do you 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.010
 use streiff when you want to stop 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.870
 Your doll you press the button 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.840
 opposite movement then for example 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.150
 making a home to the left and I 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.159
 I want to stop, I'll push the one at once. 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.780
 and I'll let go and the doll will slow down 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.169
 more quickly 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.739
 Come on, I'll pass the cart. 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:25.840
 the squeeze saw him as he stopped a lot 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.190
 The faster I 'm going to have it today I will not 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.250
 I know if you could not see right 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.379
 showing me quickly I want to walk 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.239
 I want to stop here 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.849
 I dropped it now, I just want to get the 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.620
 information 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.139
 my doll he will come back more 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.690
 fast as well and his speed is going 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.849
 always being close to zero where the 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.010
 what 's this is good you say it's stopped 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.720
 for you have your good record then 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.840
 If you want to get shot in the 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.760
 narrow 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.769
 the accuracy of your children will be good 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.629
 logical will not be perfect as you 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.540
 been stopped the car appeared in your 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.099
 family but has a precision 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.959
 pretty good that you will 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.389
 get some good kicks and 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.750
 I managed to kill the guy if you were 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:15.000
 walking aside and shoot 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.840
 Felipe is all shit if you have 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.700
 estrepando year if making that wall 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.340
 no fame 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.860
 the six prisoners will decently need 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.140
 So you can win 11 a 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.510
 accuracy and an opportunity to kill a 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.220
 face before you even appear 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.890
 understood something that is interesting 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.960
 comment also that when you are 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.270
 narrowing with knife in hand 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.520
 It's your doll the same way he is. 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.080
 walk faster he too accelerate 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.420
 slows down faster then for you 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.010
 pick up the information you better always 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.870
 I can speak with the knife in my hand. 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.810
 now if you want to try to get some 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.850
 Such an advantage with a rifle will 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.710
 be a little lighter than with the knife 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.930
 because iphan is heavier 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.970
 another thing that gets interesting you 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.970
 see how you're demonstrating 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.130
 then his opponent herein e.g. 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.050
 I 'm not showing anything here I 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.410
 I'm showing my shoulder very easy. 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.600
 knife pull is gets my shoulder got a 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.370
 little more displaced my doll then 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.290
 doll it does not look the same as 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.150
 if you had held a steak or how 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.370
 was holding a gun 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.500
 I then this is another differentiation that 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.600
 You have to know that there is when 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.350
 You have your doll somehow. 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.020
 position 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.180
 so even making an additional 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.640
 and when you have a position by 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.190
 example this one is not worth you 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.050
 stick with a rifle in the hand is with the knife 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.610
 on the hand because otherwise it will stay on the back 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:43.290
 The idea is you stay with reflect in the hand 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:46.680
 and hold just the most 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.760
 possible things outside of your body 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.130
 understood 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.570
 well I hope I explained it is me 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.980
 I was trying to record this video. 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.900
 several times I was being very 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.880
 redundant so I'll end the video for 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.680
 here if you liked this video by clicking 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.360

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.710
 have any questions do not explain it right 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.950
