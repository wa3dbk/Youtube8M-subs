in<00:00:00.299> this<00:00:00.450> video<00:00:00.690> I'm<00:00:00.840> going<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:00.989> teach<00:00:01.110> you<00:00:01.260> two

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
in this video I'm going to teach you two

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.190 
in this video I'm going to teach you two
tricks<00:00:01.740> milk<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.760> cow<00:00:02.909> and<00:00:03.240> cattle<00:00:03.750> crossing

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
tricks milk the cow and cattle crossing

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.289 
tricks milk the cow and cattle crossing
and<00:00:04.319> are<00:00:04.410> very<00:00:04.500> similar<00:00:04.830> with<00:00:05.759> both<00:00:05.970> tricks

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
and are very similar with both tricks

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.629 
and are very similar with both tricks
all<00:00:06.540> you're<00:00:06.750> really<00:00:06.870> doing<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.440> hop<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.460> fence

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
all you're really doing is hop the fence

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.419 
all you're really doing is hop the fence
with<00:00:08.880> two<00:00:09.090> hands<00:00:09.559> this<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.620> milk<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.040> cow<00:00:11.219> and

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
with two hands this is milk the cow and

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.640 
with two hands this is milk the cow and
four<00:00:12.330> cattle<00:00:12.570> crossing<00:00:12.750> all<00:00:13.170> you're<00:00:13.320> gonna<00:00:13.410> do

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
four cattle crossing all you're gonna do

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.860 
four cattle crossing all you're gonna do
is<00:00:13.799> take<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.160> yo-yos<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.790> cross<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.540> strings

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
is take the yo-yos and cross the strings

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.580 
is take the yo-yos and cross the strings
just<00:00:16.020> like<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:18.050> really<00:00:19.050> if<00:00:19.260> you've<00:00:19.380> seen

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
just like this and really if you've seen

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.599 
just like this and really if you've seen
the<00:00:19.740> tricks<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.100> kind<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.340> already

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the tricks you kind of already

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.370 
the tricks you kind of already
understand<00:00:21.029> what<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.390> do<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:21.720> I'll<00:00:22.080> give<00:00:22.289> you

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
understand what to do but I'll give you

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.470 
understand what to do but I'll give you
a<00:00:22.439> couple<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.800> tips<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.580> will<00:00:23.699> make<00:00:24.090> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
a couple of tips that will make the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.939 
a couple of tips that will make the
trick<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> little<00:00:24.990> bit<00:00:25.170> easier<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.500> learn<00:00:25.710> if

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
trick a little bit easier to learn if

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.950 
trick a little bit easier to learn if
you<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.970> already<00:00:27.240> been<00:00:27.599> learning<00:00:27.930> your

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
you have already been learning your

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.540 
you have already been learning your
two-handed<00:00:28.529> looping<00:00:28.830> tricks<00:00:29.099> then<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
two-handed looping tricks then the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.250 
two-handed looping tricks then the
lessons<00:00:29.880> you've<00:00:30.029> learned<00:00:30.060> from<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.480> apply

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
lessons you've learned from that apply

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.170 
lessons you've learned from that apply
here<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.130> just<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.700> two-handed

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
here so just like with two-handed

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.400 
here so just like with two-handed
looping<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.600> might<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> little<00:00:34.230> bit<00:00:34.380> easier

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
looping it might be a little bit easier

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.160 
looping it might be a little bit easier
to<00:00:34.680> start<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:35.390> two<00:00:36.390> yo-yos<00:00:36.570> at<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> same

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
to start with two yo-yos at the same

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.360 
to start with two yo-yos at the same
time<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:37.649> eventually<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.160> want<00:00:38.309> to

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
time but eventually you want to

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.639 
time but eventually you want to
alternate<00:00:38.760> them<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.870> same<00:00:40.079> thing<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.440> true

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
alternate them the same thing is true

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.819 
alternate them the same thing is true
when<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.250> milk<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> cow<00:00:42.260> so<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.500> might<00:00:43.770> be

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
when you do milk the cow so it might be

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.560 
when you do milk the cow so it might be
easier<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.879> start<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.239> two<00:00:45.390> at<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
easier for you to start with two at a

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.810 
easier for you to start with two at a
time<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:45.960> eventually<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:47.219> really<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.670> want

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
time but eventually you really just want

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.279 
time but eventually you really just want
to<00:00:47.850> get<00:00:47.969> into<00:00:48.149> alternating<00:00:48.780> them<00:00:49.020> because

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
to get into alternating them because

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.520 
to get into alternating them because
this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.620> how<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> trick<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.340> properly<00:00:50.760> done

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
this is how the trick is properly done

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.260 
this is how the trick is properly done
now<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.800> into<00:00:52.920> cattle<00:00:53.250> crossing<00:00:53.430> what

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
now to get into cattle crossing what

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.610 
now to get into cattle crossing what
you're<00:00:54.420> actually<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.379> you're

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
you're actually going to do is you're

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.470 
you're actually going to do is you're
going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> angle<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.309> yo-yos<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.329> like

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
going to angle the yo-yos in just like

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.860 
going to angle the yo-yos in just like
this

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
this

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.349 
this
and<00:00:58.469> what<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.190> will<00:00:59.309> allow<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.120> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
and what that will allow you to do is to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.630 
and what that will allow you to do is to
cross<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.930> strings<00:01:01.559> just<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.070> saw<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
cross the strings just like you saw and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.009 
cross the strings just like you saw and
so<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.090> want<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.300> make<00:01:03.420> sure<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.719> you've<00:01:03.870> got

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
so you want to make sure that you've got

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.020 
so you want to make sure that you've got
the<00:01:04.199> alternating<00:01:04.680> loops<00:01:05.369> down<00:01:05.549> really<00:01:05.880> well

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the alternating loops down really well

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.179 
the alternating loops down really well
before<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.450> start<00:01:06.510> trying<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:08.040> you

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
before you start trying this and you

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.380 
before you start trying this and you
also<00:01:08.369> want<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.700> make<00:01:08.850> sure<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.240> you've<00:01:09.360> got

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
also want to make sure that you've got

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.810 
also want to make sure that you've got
the<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.439> angled<00:01:10.799> loop<00:01:10.979> down<00:01:11.189> pretty<00:01:11.430> well<00:01:11.520> too

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the the angled loop down pretty well too

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.160 
the the angled loop down pretty well too
because<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.360> be<00:01:12.479> actually<00:01:12.900> pretty

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
because that can be actually pretty

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.109 
because that can be actually pretty
challenging<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.920> learn<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.909> really

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
challenging to learn and to do really

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.210 
challenging to learn and to do really
well<00:01:15.409> but<00:01:16.409> once<00:01:16.590> you've<00:01:16.710> got<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.009> you're

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
well but once you've got that you're

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.999 
well but once you've got that you're
ready<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.610> cattle<00:01:17.970> crossing<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:19.009> actually

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
ready to do cattle crossing and actually

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.140 
ready to do cattle crossing and actually
what<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.729> instead<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.060> just

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
what I like to do is instead of just

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.700 
what I like to do is instead of just
going<00:01:21.390> right<00:01:21.659> into<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> even<00:01:22.170> though<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.409> can

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
going right into it even though you can

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.520 
going right into it even though you can
I<00:01:22.950> usually<00:01:23.580> start<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.180> milk<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> cow<00:01:25.290> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
I usually start with milk the cow and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.260 
I usually start with milk the cow and
that<00:01:26.009> allows<00:01:26.220> me<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.490> get<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> yo-yos<00:01:27.030> under

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
that allows me to get the yo-yos under

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.149 
that allows me to get the yo-yos under
control<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> little<00:01:27.840> bit<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> can

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
control a little bit and then I can

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.670 
control a little bit and then I can
start<00:01:29.310> slowly<00:01:29.880> easing<00:01:30.450> them<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.650> I

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
start slowly easing them in so that I

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.190 
start slowly easing them in so that I
can<00:01:31.860> cross<00:01:32.070> them<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:33.079> you<00:01:34.079> want

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
can cross them just like this you want

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.499 
can cross them just like this you want
to<00:01:34.229> make<00:01:34.290> sure<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.680> your<00:01:34.799> hands<00:01:35.220> are

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
to make sure that your hands are

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.760 
to make sure that your hands are
actually<00:01:36.509> close<00:01:36.750> enough<00:01:37.049> together<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.619> that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
actually close enough together so that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.080 
actually close enough together so that
when<00:01:37.890> you're<00:01:38.009> doing<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.310> trick<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.790> strings

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
when you're doing the trick the strings

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.969 
when you're doing the trick the strings
actually<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.869> cross<00:01:40.170> otherwise<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:40.860> they're

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
actually do cross otherwise if they're

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.830 
actually do cross otherwise if they're
too<00:01:41.100> far<00:01:41.280> apart<00:01:41.430> then<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.540> won't<00:01:42.600> look<00:01:42.780> like

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
too far apart then it won't look like

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
too far apart then it won't look like
the<00:01:43.200> strings<00:01:43.470> are<00:01:43.619> crossing<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.159> it'll<00:01:44.340> just

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the strings are crossing and it'll just

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.550 
the strings are crossing and it'll just
look<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.729> milk<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> cow<00:01:45.329> but<00:01:45.869> anyway<00:01:46.350> once

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
look like milk the cow but anyway once

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.770 
look like milk the cow but anyway once
you<00:01:46.649> get<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.399> keep<00:01:47.579> working<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.149> again

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you get it just keep working on it again

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.240 
you get it just keep working on it again
like<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.110> said<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.500> angled<00:01:49.860> loop<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.220> be

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
like I said that angled loop can be

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.770 
like I said that angled loop can be
pretty<00:01:50.520> challenging<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:51.030> learn<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:51.540> after

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
pretty challenging to learn but after

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.450 
pretty challenging to learn but after
you<00:01:51.869> get<00:01:51.960> over<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.229> wow<00:01:53.070> they're<00:01:53.280> pretty

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
you get over that wow they're pretty

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.880 
you get over that wow they're pretty
great<00:01:53.610> tricks<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.750> good<00:01:55.140> addition<00:01:55.530> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
great tricks and it's a good addition to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.200 
great tricks and it's a good addition to
your<00:01:56.070> two-handed<00:01:56.610> yo-yoing

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
your two-handed yo-yoing

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.890 
your two-handed yo-yoing
let's<00:01:57.479> milk<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> cow<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.350> cattle<00:01:58.740> crossing
