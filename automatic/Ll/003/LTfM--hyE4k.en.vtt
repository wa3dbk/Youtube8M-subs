00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.849
 sl all respond that they small video 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.710
 really really simple video for everything 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:22.210
 just explain how to do it 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.070
 ban a team of boots 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.290
 So there are two teams of boots 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.980
 there they are and that their multiman a 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:34.850
 so let's talk about it is very simple 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:39.430
 you go on this site en emmerde 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.430
 I closed the page shit as much of europe 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.590
 you write in moderator google 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.180
 dofus you take the first one actually 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.510
 you will arrive on this page in fact 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.730
 you have the list of all the servers 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.149
 as well as the moderator's name so me 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.310
 whisper me comfortable the referent moderator 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.939
 it's awesome just great 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:10.670
 so you copy his nickname have 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:12.950
 started with that then you what is it 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.759
 practice I find it's to open your 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.819
 scratch pad 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:20.990
 here you put the name of the moderator 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.429
 and then you go hunting 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.749
 to the boots so you spot them yourself 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:29.450
 simply do information 

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:31.369
 detail information detail detail and 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.310
 details so here you have your 5 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.639
 boots with four boots makes you a 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.119
 copy you make a pass and now 

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:44.029
 you make a slash times up 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:48.529
 here you copy yourself too 

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:49.579
 so much and that's it for those who do not 

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:51.079
 do not want to copy and paste 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.789
 you can simply screen 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.020
 and send the screen as it should 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.939
 not modify it by cons must 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.679
 leave as is 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.700
 and so here you have your thing so 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.049
 there you have everything you need for 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.700
 banish the boots no need to 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.539
 more so now we go to the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.999
 procedure contacted to moderator so 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.580
 you will open you hop you go 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.170
 in the new message to whom you 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.750
 click there look for a member who 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.890
 is not in the list 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.750
 this back 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.460
 so you write the world your 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.050
 moderator that you copied so in 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:26.209
 the occurrence me this jl search 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.670
 more if these pseudo so j al between 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.069
 parentheses so there you send 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.020
 a message 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.020
 object you are not you put boots 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.000
 boots like these is between between 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.319
 caresche parentheses and more their good 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.230
 it does not matter you put your 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.739
 server you are not necessarily obliged 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.870
 dmp a moderator who is a forgiveness who 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.370
 is necessarily on your on your 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.640
 server but it's still better 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:07.670
 so here you proceed like this then 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:16.580
 say hello I spotted a team of 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:18.800

 that it is a dream that his faith makes you 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:58.160
 thin I poked at the pin up 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:04:02.120

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.640
 boars from the plains hop you do 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.900
 quickly made a copy control these voices 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.370
 there and there you simply 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:13.100

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.239
 blow is perfect there suddenly 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.579
 moderator when they will answer you 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.769
 thank you it's set or something like that 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.630
 saying that he banished the boots she 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.799
 could proceed like this for all 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.960
 the peeps so here I'm sure this 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.729
 team in less than 24 hours 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.830
 pretty much it's the objective mode she 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.009
 will be banned 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.360
 so here they are going to be banished 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:35.550
 his pals do not worry the 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.849
 moderator is not going to banish like that in 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.129
 believing your word and check via 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.199
 all the tools that are in place for 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.089
 him if it's a bot so no need 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.550
 from someone you do not like about the 

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:49.110
 server do it information about him 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.509
 for example guild 2 no need to do 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.800
 retail information and make a 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.330
 copy and paste saying that it's a 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.399
 buddy the moderator will check 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.919
 and if you are not credible and that 

00:04:56.399 --> 00:05:00.029
 you lie about things like that he 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.509
 will no longer take you seriously and 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:04.770
 maybe even completely ignore you 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.870
 so we play it strongly advises against 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.249
 do it and if in the worst case you 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.309
 you fool that I 've already happened 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:15.360
 once I got it wrong 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:16.039
 the moderator tells us everything 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.149
 simply 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.879
 in fact I was not sure that 

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:22.649
 it was a bot and suddenly I told him 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:24.120
 spoken then where he's struggling he was trying 

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:25.199
 to actually fish and I was talking to him and 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.759
 after ten minutes you will not 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.559
 answered I saw him sin so I believed 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.749
 that it was a bot and after ten minutes 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:31.979
 he said that he was my brother who 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:33.270
 4 years who fished he does not have the right 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.009
 to speak all that what are you 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.680
 suddenly wanted to tell me at this point 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:39.240
 I sent a moderator excuse me 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.219
 I was wrong it was not a bot me 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.499
 do not worry anyway we 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:46.339
 check if before banning or m 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:48.629
 any penalty if it's a bot 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.949
 So here you are, if you have 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:52.319
 boots that make you shit when you 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.819
 fish or when you close or whatever 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.409
 something like that it's really 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:58.919
 extremely fast a small notepad 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:00.330
 copy paste is finished so here I 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.659
 think I went around 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.669
 at that level to find the boots 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:07.979
 to register the dofus moderators if 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:12.419
 you take yourself take the first one in 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:14.580
 google it is effective volunteers dofus 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.199
 dot com etc which you will find a if 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.789
 easily so I go around for 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.269
 this video so I have soon to 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.269
 new video
