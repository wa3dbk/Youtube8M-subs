 Hello dear friends with you Alex 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.679
 and today i would like to do a review on 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.380
 my friend's build he made her server 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:16.260
 this server will immediately go in this 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.949
 assembly so you can go right away 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.220
 to play 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.890
 he is on hosting so now i am 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.350
 I will create a new world in survival 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.070
 shoot on super flat because so 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.690
 Easier example will tell about new fashions 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.559
 and tell you just the mods that you already 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.600
 knew so goes the transformation of the world on 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.200
 it will be pretty long sorry 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.200
 for that I did not immediately prepare me 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.870
 come on 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.870
 and I have been preparing for so long 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.640
 later 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.170

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:14.930
 Come on come on come on baby immerse 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.930
 Well, in the assembly 90 madof as you have already seen 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.800
 so 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:24.980
 load on pretty not fast well 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:30.870
 in general, the assembly itself 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:33.630
 so fog you have everything you need now 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.900

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.280
 and so would like to say it 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.350
 build 152 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.680
 in the pages added sword white tile 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.220
 and the sand tiles are just beautiful 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.190
 the blocks are not even simple but very beautiful 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:57.490
 blocks i really like their texture 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.270
 this here is very similar to the tile that in 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.759

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.460

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.810
