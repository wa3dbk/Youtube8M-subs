00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
things out of a lake it's really hard to

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.170 
things out of a lake it's really hard to
do<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:41.009> stick<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.460> into<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> hole<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
you're using and use it as a funnel and

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.450 
you're using and use it as a funnel and
you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.130> fill<00:01:47.369> up<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.520> bag<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.090> no<00:01:48.240> time<00:01:48.479> flat

you can fill up that bag in no time flat

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.069 
you can fill up that bag in no time flat
so<00:01:50.460> that's<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.670> trick<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.450> use<00:01:51.479> with

case scenario I could always just use

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.259 
case scenario I could always just use
hexamine<00:03:21.780> tablets<00:03:22.319> but<00:03:23.010> basically<00:03:23.610> these
