making<00:00:01.380> rounded<00:00:01.890> edges<00:00:02.250> can<00:00:02.490> be<00:00:02.550> difficult<00:00:03.030> in

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
making rounded edges can be difficult in

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.249 
making rounded edges can be difficult in
lightwave<00:00:03.899> because<00:00:04.259> it's<00:00:04.440> buggy<00:00:04.710> but<00:00:05.899> also<00:00:06.899> in

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
lightwave because it's buggy but also in

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.400 
lightwave because it's buggy but also in
other<00:00:07.350> 3d<00:00:08.040> programs<00:00:08.580> now<00:00:08.880> let's<00:00:09.179> try<00:00:09.660> rounder

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
other 3d programs now let's try rounder

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.740 
other 3d programs now let's try rounder
first<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.690> well<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:13.019> get<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:14.210> and<00:00:15.210> that's

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
first and well you get this and that's

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.730 
first and well you get this and that's
not<00:00:15.929> very<00:00:16.109> nice<00:00:18.529> so<00:00:19.529> let's<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:21.320> try<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.350> fix

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
not very nice so let's just try to fix

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.450 
not very nice so let's just try to fix
that<00:00:23.100> now<00:00:23.390> I'm<00:00:24.390> just<00:00:24.859> bleeding<00:00:28.310> points<00:00:29.310> in

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
that now I'm just bleeding points in

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.970 
that now I'm just bleeding points in
this<00:00:29.789> face<00:00:30.529> so<00:00:32.480> and<00:00:34.070> that<00:00:35.070> created<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.980> so

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
this face so and that created this so

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.590 
this face so and that created this so
now<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.309> will<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.700> clean<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
now you will have to clean this up and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.880 
now you will have to clean this up and
that<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.860> take<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.399> lot<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.640> time<00:00:42.200> also<00:00:43.200> this

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
that can take a lot of time also this

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.819 
that can take a lot of time also this
area<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:45.180> area<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:47.719> large<00:00:48.719> wave<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.079> very

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
area and this area so large wave is very

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.660 
area and this area so large wave is very
bad<00:00:50.100> at<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.750> other<00:00:51.750> programs<00:00:51.989> are<00:00:52.670> well

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
bad at it and other programs are well

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.880 
bad at it and other programs are well
have<00:00:53.969> their<00:00:54.180> problems<00:00:54.809> as<00:00:55.230> well<00:00:58.670> so<00:01:00.890> sometimes

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
have their problems as well so sometimes

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.770 
have their problems as well so sometimes
you<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.250> want<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.550> go<00:01:02.730> another<00:01:03.030> way<00:01:03.270> about<00:01:03.539> it

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you just want to go another way about it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.609 
you just want to go another way about it
and<00:01:05.030> at<00:01:06.030> times<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.350> solution

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and at times that can be the solution

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.100 
and at times that can be the solution
can<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.369> nurse<00:01:08.670> program<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:10.130> I<00:01:11.299> was<00:01:12.299> looking

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
can be a nurse program so I was looking

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.820 
can be a nurse program so I was looking
at<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.680> program<00:01:14.340> called<00:01:14.549> via<00:01:15.299> cut<00:01:15.600> via<00:01:16.380> cut<00:01:16.590> pro

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
at a program called via cut via cut pro

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.560 
at a program called via cut via cut pro
version<00:01:17.340> 7<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:21.049> can<00:01:22.049> pretty<00:01:22.259> much<00:01:22.320> see<00:01:23.299> how<00:01:24.299> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
version 7 and can pretty much see how it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.179 
version 7 and can pretty much see how it
makes<00:01:24.900> these<00:01:25.759> areas<00:01:27.770> very<00:01:28.770> smooth

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
makes these areas very smooth

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.690 
makes these areas very smooth
automatically<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.950> does<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.189> by<00:01:32.369> using

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
automatically and it does that by using

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.780 
automatically and it does that by using
a<00:01:33.090> chamfer<00:01:33.750> or<00:01:33.990> fill<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.280> case<00:01:35.520> its

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
a chamfer or fill it in this case its

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.249 
a chamfer or fill it in this case its
fill<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.240> guess<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:40.130> this<00:01:41.130> would<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:42.259> very

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
fill it I guess so this would be very

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.480 
fill it I guess so this would be very
hard<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:46.310> intersecting<00:01:47.310> with

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
hard because it's intersecting with

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.710 
hard because it's intersecting with
another<00:01:48.770> round<00:01:49.770> edge<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.240> would<00:01:51.450> be<00:01:51.479> very

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
another round edge so this would be very

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.880 
another round edge so this would be very
hard<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.530> enlightening<00:01:54.500> also<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> same

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
hard to do it enlightening also the same

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.550 
hard to do it enlightening also the same
here<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:58.649> here<00:02:01.340> maybe<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.880> much<00:02:03.060> here<00:02:03.329> but

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
here and here maybe not so much here but

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.609 
here and here maybe not so much here but
there<00:02:04.560> are<00:02:04.920> places<00:02:05.729> where<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:06.619> much

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
there are places where it's just much

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.650 
there are places where it's just much
much<00:02:07.860> better<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.369> use<00:02:08.580> nerves<00:02:08.970> because<00:02:09.450> it's

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
much better to use nerves because it's

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.350 
much better to use nerves because it's
faster<00:02:10.200> and

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
faster and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.870 
faster and
well<00:02:12.020> doesn't<00:02:12.440> create<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:14.200> bad<00:02:15.200> poly<00:02:15.530> flow<00:02:15.880> and

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
well doesn't create a bad poly flow and

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.490 
well doesn't create a bad poly flow and
also<00:02:17.830> this<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:19.340> drawing<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.410> kind<00:02:21.410> of

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
also this is drawing is kind of

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
also this is drawing is kind of
difficult<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.860> see<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.370> but<00:02:24.130> if<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.250> look<00:02:25.370> at

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
difficult to see it but if you look at

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.490 
difficult to see it but if you look at
the<00:02:25.550> poly<00:02:25.820> flow<00:02:26.090> here<00:02:26.390> it's<00:02:27.260> very<00:02:27.590> very<00:02:27.830> nice

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
the poly flow here it's very very nice

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.970 
the poly flow here it's very very nice
so<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:32.050> think<00:02:33.050> that's<00:02:33.320> something<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.740> consider

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
so I think that's something to consider

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.050 
so I think that's something to consider
if<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:34.670> want<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.660> good<00:02:35.840> do<00:02:36.800> more<00:02:37.060> technical

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
if you want a good do more technical

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.410 
if you want a good do more technical
mechanical<00:02:38.780> models<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:40.030> might<00:02:41.030> want<00:02:41.270> to

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
mechanical models that might want to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.530 
mechanical models that might want to
consider<00:02:42.200> /<00:02:42.530> in<00:02:42.740> like<00:02:42.920> this<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:44.270> price<00:02:44.510> is

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
consider / in like this and the price is

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.229 
consider / in like this and the price is
very<00:02:44.870> good<00:02:45.310> it's<00:02:46.310> 250<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:47.540> mean<00:02:47.860> that's

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
very good it's 250 and I mean that's

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.390 
very good it's 250 and I mean that's
nothing<00:02:50.239> really<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.989> checked<00:02:51.470> most<00:02:52.130> of<00:02:52.310> the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
nothing really and I checked most of the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.350 
nothing really and I checked most of the
programs<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:54.940> i<00:02:55.940> found<00:02:56.630> this<00:02:57.070> via<00:02:58.070> cut<00:02:58.340> pro<00:02:58.640> to

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
programs and i found this via cut pro to

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.449 
programs and i found this via cut pro to
be<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.690> best<00:02:59.900> when<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.320> comes<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:03.130> fill<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.280> and

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
be the best when it comes to fill it and

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.760 
be the best when it comes to fill it and
chambers<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.209> stuff<00:03:05.720> like<00:03:05.900> that<00:03:05.959> so<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:08.209> at

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
chambers and stuff like that so and at

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.830 
chambers and stuff like that so and at
258<00:03:09.790> well<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:11.180> might<00:03:11.840> be<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:12.020> bargain<00:03:13.840> because

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
258 well it might be a bargain because

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.680 
258 well it might be a bargain because
you<00:03:15.050> want<00:03:15.260> be<00:03:15.950> able<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.250> find<00:03:16.519> another<00:03:17.239> program

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
you want be able to find another program
