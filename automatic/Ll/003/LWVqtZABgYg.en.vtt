00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.340
 that's how real beginners sound 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.980
 Actually, practicing for years 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.570
 the best for a good game 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.570
 with a real music teacher 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.220
 until you can really play confused 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.960
 it simply takes a lot of videos in it 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.840
 Internet promise a guide to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.310
 to learn an instrument independently 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.250
 everything even claims that you're after only 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.520
 ten minutes to play the piano 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.520
 Not 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.440
 Hi nice that you stop by stop 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:44.590
 you're stuck in ten minutes 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:46.510
 you will learn to play the piano 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.489
 blog shows each one in turn 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.489
 finger positions and their order 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.230
 quite often repeat the fabric in two 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.160
 minutes over now all this time 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:06.240
 three tones at the same time that should not be so 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.710
 should be 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.380
 being struck at the same time that is 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.770
 the challenge and that we take 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.259
 on 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.130
 in a munich shopping center 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.130
 we the block 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.780
 is a musician and composer 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.780
 she will rate the block for us 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.540
 So, on the one hand , the curiosity of 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.580
 The probanden what happened with this project 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.200
 I can do more right now 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.940
 do not say when they were testing 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.020
 it can be an exciting one to get involved with 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.820
 be an experiment 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.470
 but you will see if they have that 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.770
 really manages the ten minutes of this 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.390
 piece to learn we get started on the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.490
 looking for volunteers who neither 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.770
 can still read piano notes 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:13.190
 the opinions go over the block 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:15.700
 apart half an hour or something 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.440
 it is clear that everybody can do that 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:24.680
 I think the instrument is difficult 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.000
 robs a bit of finger feeling should 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.260
 So you have my girlfriend, I said 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.860
 have a good finger feeling I think 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:45.860
 so that will be good too 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:47.920
 ten minutes for so long four 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.090
 aspiring musicians are ready 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.130
 At first the candidates see this 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.140
 video completely on 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.110
 only then do the ten begin for them 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.790
 minutes of exercise 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.790
 Unfortunately it is not that easy 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.440
 the so-called keyboard consists of 88 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.690
 black and white buttons left 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.060
 the low notes start to the right 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.220
 you will get higher and higher the distance of 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.170
 Eight white buttons form an octave 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.360
 the black keys are the semitones 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.750
 but they do not play for beginners 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.730
 role 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.730
 it gets really hard when you go with it 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.250
 Both hands must play simultaneously 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.599
 from now on the time is running they are now 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.000
 completely on your own 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:31.319
 it takes ten minutes to complete the apprenticeship 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.319
 help if necessary 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.080
 another challenge is the 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.360
 pedals there 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.600
 the video is only on the right 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.790
 with the pedals the sound of the 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.810
 piano affects the number of 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.550
 pedals varies between two and three 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.620
 time is up 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:55.180
 so it should be remembered at the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.180
 Candidates actually sound now 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.110
 our volunteers lie down 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.110
 tidy 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.709
 Kubicki it sounds different 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.709
 but the melody is recognizable 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.450
 they always have me very much on the thing 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.860
 have to focus and that was easy 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.020
 hate understood the harmonies 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.400
 You could be independent with both hands 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.100
 So play both in the left 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.210
 right super is so I do 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.070
 I do not think so either 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.900
 Clever employed at the beginning had to 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.790
 I found the door more like that 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.480
 well explained she succeeded ten 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.790
 minutes 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.200
 this quite complex composition too 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.510
 learn it passed 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.770
 So it is good to create 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.880
 the sea â€‹â€‹is apparently only 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.920
 front so I can head it 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.440
 I can not handle the 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.400
 fingers but my head does not come 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.830
 look that you pedal 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.420
 really push it down if you can 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.590
 not completely suppressed then you hear 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.590
 not that full sound 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.569
 Really fun and it can be done 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:30.990
 learn in 10 minutes marc beyer and the 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:45.909
 Joy at play is the most important thing 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:48.250
 Liane is positively surprised both hands 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.780
 So that meant that they both were hands 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.180
 different things should have done 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.680
 in the rhythm that's what I think one 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.569
 task can only a bit 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.330
 more advanced and always I would 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:59.740
 say it worked 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.110
 So it is actually possible in 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.050
 to learn a melody in no time 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.039
 even as a layman keeps this internet blog 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.349
 what he promises 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.819
 the success of the video lies in the 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.280
 continuous repetition and the 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:14.110
 step by step instruction but one 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.139
 It takes time to master the instrument 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:20.580
 and a lot of patience and maybe off 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.580
 and a real teacher
