00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.799
 hello investments we are today for you 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.150
 show the exercise how to pump the legs in 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.150
 home conditions 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.700
 Ivan did not apply the dawn of man did not live 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.730
 load joints lower back knee 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.790
 the joint is all about 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.509
 musculoskeletal article you 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.509
 will show everything 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.610
 nothing further with the first exercise on 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.230
 warm-up by itself we have already done you 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.370
 we will also do before 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.010
 start the exercise about three sets in 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.670
 approach 11 times three approaches on each 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:55.480
 you cannot keep up more than a week 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:58.260
 walking will not be possible to alternate on 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.270
 one leg about 12 times made the knee 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.760
 angle heel pull closer to the head 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:11.590
 that muscle pumping went with my head i didn't 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.580
 look still on each leg can do 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.729
 dota 1 30 times for one new topics 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.530
 rest 20 seconds until well before 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.570
 change and on the other so alternately 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.940
 you can do well no more than three approaches 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.979
 enough also 3 approaches on change 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.979
 on each leg up to 30 times 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.150
 preferably done on speed on 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.150
 burning 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.830
 nice yes 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.720
 on one foot the approach did changed on 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.770
 2 30 and for each leg 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.210
 three sets of up to 30 times at least 15 for 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.210
 the beginning of this is quite enough 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.380
 and the third exercise with gum is quite 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.800
 enough because the load is very 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:16.210
 big and for beginners do not advise 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.330
 a lot to do also three sets up to 30 times 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.870
 more is not needed yet and the minimum is 1215 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.240
 We try to do on the speed we pull up 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:34.590
 closer to the chest is pumping the press and muscles 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.590
 forms of tanaka which holds more samples 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.560
 things 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.580
 and one more exercise we are no longer 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.560
 the middle is the work with the chair which 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.810
 have every home you can hold on to 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.310
 support you can just stand straight 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.100
 so you will be the size well 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:06.220
 a little bit here also three approaches 30 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.910
 a lot to start 15 times for each 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.069
 new approach 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.530
 15 times did changed for every three 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.620
 suited back smoothly exhale on maha 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.620
 backwards 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.900
 this exercise is high doing 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.880
 not necessarily to start just 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.600
 throw it over the thing you need 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.600
 ran smoothly 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.780
 final fifth exercise best 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.769
 complex does not take much time gives 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:43.129
 big result 3 approaches will be many 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.129
 You can start 2 approaches in general 23 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.629
 exhale norm back however exactly 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.629
 passes 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:05.760
 here is a small room you can do 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.990
 three times a week at least you can 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.990
 dependence what recipe do you want 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.730
 achieve three times in the morning if not 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.810
 the recipient can do it 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.640
 do in the evening but preferably to 2 3-4 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.640
 hours to sleep 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.640
 load
