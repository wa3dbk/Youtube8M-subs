okay hey guys i'm going to video today
on<00:00:07.269> what<00:00:07.779> the<00:00:07.990> inversion<00:00:08.590> method<00:00:08.740> is<00:00:10.139> one<00:00:11.139> day

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
on what the inversion method is one day

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.419 
on what the inversion method is one day
I<00:00:11.320> was<00:00:11.469> willing<00:00:11.620> you<00:00:11.889> too<00:00:12.099> but<00:00:12.309> I<00:00:12.400> just

you and I came across this titleist egg
roll<00:00:18.490> one<00:00:19.269> inch<00:00:19.539> and<00:00:19.840> seven<00:00:20.320> days<00:00:20.470> using<00:00:21.010> the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
roll one inch and seven days using the

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.650 
roll one inch and seven days using the
inversion<00:00:21.730> method<00:00:21.849> so<00:00:22.570> I'm<00:00:23.230> like<00:00:23.470> um<00:00:24.210> okay<00:00:25.210> I'm

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
inversion method so I'm like um okay I'm

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.950 
inversion method so I'm like um okay I'm
trying<00:00:25.900> to<00:00:26.080> this<00:00:26.310> because<00:00:27.310> I<00:00:27.460> know<00:00:27.519> that<00:00:28.119> your

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
it's there to race at half an inch a

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.160 
it's there to race at half an inch a
month<00:00:34.720> which<00:00:35.380> means<00:00:35.680> you<00:00:35.800> get<00:00:36.010> one<00:00:36.490> inch

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
month which means you get one inch

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.840 
month which means you get one inch
instruments<00:00:38.170> so<00:00:38.710> when<00:00:38.920> they<00:00:39.040> say<00:00:39.250> in<00:00:39.550> getting

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
instruments so when they say in getting

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.960 
instruments so when they say in getting
one<00:00:39.940> inch<00:00:40.360> and<00:00:40.690> 70s<00:00:41.560> I<00:00:41.800> was<00:00:41.860> okay<00:00:42.400> clearly

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.620 
spin and such as holes you can lie on
the<00:01:10.929> bed<00:01:11.109> and<00:01:11.170> put<00:01:11.740> your<00:01:11.859> head<00:01:12.009> back<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:13.479> can

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
the bed and put your head back you can

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.599 
the bed and put your head back you can
sit<00:01:13.899> on<00:01:13.929> the<00:01:14.079> couch<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.770> just<00:01:14.859> from<00:01:15.520> your

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
sit on the couch and just from your

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.300 
sit on the couch and just from your
knees<00:01:16.500> anything<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:17.590> can<00:01:17.770> do<00:01:17.890> is<00:01:18.009> just<00:01:18.039> to

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
knees anything you can do is just to

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.950 
knees anything you can do is just to
invert<00:01:18.609> the<00:01:18.759> position<00:01:19.179> of<00:01:19.210> your<00:01:19.329> head<00:01:19.570> so<00:01:19.840> as

the<00:01:20.079> blood<00:01:20.320> flows<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.700> your<00:01:21.820> head<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
the blood flows to your head the

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.910 
the blood flows to your head the
increased<00:01:23.530> circulation<00:01:23.950> in<00:01:24.249> blood<00:01:24.490> flow<00:01:24.640> will

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
increased circulation in blood flow will

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.639 
increased circulation in blood flow will
cause<00:01:26.920> your<00:01:27.130> hair<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.310> grow<00:01:27.520> faster<00:01:28.649> so

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
cause your hair to grow faster so

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.139 
cause your hair to grow faster so
basically<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:30.070> massage<00:01:30.399> your<00:01:30.429> scalp<00:01:30.670> with

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
basically you massage your scalp with

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.190 
basically you massage your scalp with
soil<00:01:31.960> for<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.380> few<00:01:32.829> minutes<00:01:33.810> invert<00:01:34.810> your<00:01:34.840> head

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
soil for a few minutes invert your head

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.160 
soil for a few minutes invert your head
for<00:01:35.590> four<00:01:35.920> minutes<00:01:36.189> consistently<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:38.140> then

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
for four minutes consistently and then

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.020 
for four minutes consistently and then
