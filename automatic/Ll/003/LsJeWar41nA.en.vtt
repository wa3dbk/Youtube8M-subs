the ABS stop and of course we have an

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.850 
the ABS stop and of course we have an
evasive<00:00:08.750> emergency<00:00:09.750> lane<00:00:10.050> change<00:00:10.410> with<00:00:10.830> that

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
evasive emergency lane change with that

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.810 
evasive emergency lane change with that
one<00:00:11.309> with<00:00:11.880> ABS<00:00:12.719> one<00:00:13.290> without<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.889> yes<00:00:14.340> okay<00:00:14.460> and

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
one with ABS one without a yes okay and

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.760 
one with ABS one without a yes okay and
so<00:00:15.059> you're<00:00:15.179> going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.360> go<00:00:15.540> around<00:00:15.630> well<00:00:16.260> in

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770

you just described for me so what the
difference<00:03:35.450> was<00:03:35.600> like<00:03:36.020> specially<00:03:36.380> over<00:03:36.590> there

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
difference was like specially over there

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.980 
difference was like specially over there
the<00:03:36.950> lane<00:03:37.100> at<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.280> dynamic<00:03:37.760> are<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.420> lane

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
the lane at the dynamic are the the lane

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.860 
the lane at the dynamic are the the lane
change<00:03:39.940> yeah<00:03:40.940> okay<00:03:43.600> like<00:03:44.600> with<00:03:44.780> the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
change yeah okay like with the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.090 
change yeah okay like with the
difference<00:03:45.140> between<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.440> two<00:03:45.560> vehicles<00:03:45.920> and

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
difference between the two vehicles and

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.940 
difference between the two vehicles and
how<00:03:46.280> they<00:03:46.400> performed<00:03:46.790> over<00:03:46.970> there<00:03:47.200> okay<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:48.380> I

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
how they performed over there okay and I

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.190 
how they performed over there okay and I
can<00:03:49.310> actually<00:03:49.640> describe<00:03:50.000> for<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:50.750> kind<00:03:51.050> of

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
can actually describe for you kind of

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.870 
can actually describe for you kind of
from<00:03:51.380> a<00:03:51.470> racing<00:03:51.770> perspective<00:03:52.250> locking<00:03:52.640> up<00:03:52.730> the

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
from a racing perspective locking up the

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.150 
from a racing perspective locking up the
wheels<00:03:53.120> yeah<00:03:53.600> is<00:03:53.990> like<00:03:54.320> the<00:03:54.470> rudder<00:03:54.680> coming

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
wheels yeah is like the rudder coming

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.840 
wheels yeah is like the rudder coming
out<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.459> water

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
out of the water

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.000 
out of the water
okay<00:03:56.330> and<00:03:56.600> over<00:03:56.780> time<00:03:57.080> we<00:03:57.230> have<00:03:57.410> that

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
okay and over time we have that

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.310 
okay and over time we have that
intermittent<00:03:58.580> braking<00:03:59.090> that<00:03:59.390> rotation<00:04:00.140> is

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
intermittent braking that rotation is

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.440 
intermittent braking that rotation is
like<00:04:00.530> putting<00:04:00.830> the<00:04:01.040> rudder<00:04:01.370> thread<00:04:01.850> back<00:04:02.209> in

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
like putting the rudder thread back in

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.360 
like putting the rudder thread back in
the<00:04:02.540> water<00:04:02.780> but<00:04:03.170> that's<00:04:03.260> what's<00:04:03.560> happening<00:04:03.950> so

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
the water but that's what's happening so

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.000 
the water but that's what's happening so
for<00:04:04.640> this<00:04:04.760> vehicle<00:04:05.030> under<00:04:05.810> complete<00:04:06.260> lock<00:04:06.560> we

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
for this vehicle under complete lock we

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.890 
for this vehicle under complete lock we
lose<00:04:07.280> complete<00:04:07.820> rudder<00:04:08.120> but<00:04:08.420> we<00:04:08.540> lose<00:04:08.750> the

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
lose complete rudder but we lose the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.030 
lose complete rudder but we lose the
stability<00:04:09.440> in<00:04:09.560> our<00:04:10.540> we<00:04:11.540> lose<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:12.080> you<00:04:12.920> know

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
stability in our we lose the you know

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.420 
stability in our we lose the you know
complete<00:04:13.640> control<00:04:14.150> in<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:15.200> ability<00:04:15.769> to<00:04:15.800> make

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
complete control in the ability to make

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.060 
complete control in the ability to make
that<00:04:16.579> evasive<00:04:16.940> change<00:04:17.359> of<00:04:18.049> length<00:04:18.290> right<00:04:18.709> when

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
that evasive change of length right when

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.210 
that evasive change of length right when
we<00:04:19.280> have<00:04:19.519> abs<00:04:19.940> we<00:04:20.900> have<00:04:21.109> that<00:04:21.350> light<00:04:21.560> rotation

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
we have abs we have that light rotation

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.850 
we have abs we have that light rotation
which<00:04:22.790> keeps<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.510> rudder<00:04:23.750> in<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.080> water<00:04:24.320> and

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
which keeps the rudder in the water and

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.970 
which keeps the rudder in the water and
allows<00:04:25.070> us<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:25.490> come<00:04:25.700> to<00:04:26.210> a<00:04:26.240> stable<00:04:26.600> and

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
allows us to come to a stable and

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.040 
allows us to come to a stable and
