series tents we're going to give you an
idea<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:15.800> what's<00:00:16.800> involved<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.000> setup<00:00:18.359> of

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
idea of what's involved in the setup of

idea of what's involved in the setup of
the<00:00:18.750> Mira<00:00:19.080> tents<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.210> watch<00:00:21.210> your<00:00:21.750> timer

the Mira tents and watch your timer
because<00:00:22.590> as<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.760> all<00:00:23.939> ex<00:00:24.150> bed<00:00:24.359> tents<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.810> is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
because as with all ex bed tents this is

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.529 
because as with all ex bed tents this is
going<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> happen<00:00:25.320> pretty<00:00:25.710> quickly<00:00:26.539> very

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
going to happen pretty quickly very

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.380 
going to happen pretty quickly very
quick<00:00:27.779> setup<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.410> these<00:00:28.590> guys

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
quick setup on these guys

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.360 
quick setup on these guys
Mira<00:00:30.900> tents<00:00:31.619> are<00:00:31.830> designed<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:33.540> our

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
Mira tents are designed to be our

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.150 
Mira tents are designed to be our
lightweight<00:00:35.370> three<00:00:36.300> season<00:00:36.870> tents<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.530> good

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
lightweight three season tents so good

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.549 
lightweight three season tents so good
ventilation<00:00:39.290> lightweight

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
ventilation lightweight

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.889 
ventilation lightweight
however<00:00:41.370> they<00:00:41.969> are<00:00:42.230> balanced<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:44.899> materials

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
however they are balanced with materials

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.279 
however they are balanced with materials
that<00:00:46.820> don't<00:00:47.820> sacrifice<00:00:48.149> durability<00:00:49.140> so

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
that don't sacrifice durability so

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.990 
that don't sacrifice durability so
there's<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.530> very<00:00:49.710> good<00:00:49.800> balance<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
there's a very good balance in the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.500 
there's a very good balance in the
mirror<00:00:51.270> tents<00:00:51.980> between<00:00:52.980> being<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.940> lightweight

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
mirror tents between being a lightweight

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.160 
mirror tents between being a lightweight
and<00:00:55.250> still<00:00:56.250> having<00:00:56.640> some<00:00:56.789> durability<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.989> one

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
and still having some durability now one

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.470 
and still having some durability now one
thing<00:00:58.350> you'll<00:00:58.559> see<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.180> mirror

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
thing you'll see is that the mirror

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.149 
thing you'll see is that the mirror
tents<00:01:00.930> all<00:01:01.219> share<00:01:02.570> pulse<00:01:03.570> leaves<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.320> pulse

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
tents all share pulse leaves and pulse

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.740 
tents all share pulse leaves and pulse
leaves<00:01:06.140> maximize<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.439> interior<00:01:08.010> volume<00:01:08.750> so

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
leaves maximize the interior volume so

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.020 
leaves maximize the interior volume so
there<00:01:09.869> aren't<00:01:10.049> any<00:01:10.200> low<00:01:10.500> points<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.729> in

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
there aren't any low points in the in

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.200 
there aren't any low points in the in
the<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> roof<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.650> inner<00:01:13.799> tent

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
the in the roof of the of the inner tent

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.560 
the in the roof of the of the inner tent
and<00:01:15.210> they<00:01:15.390> make<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.750> very<00:01:15.900> easy<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:17.310> all<00:01:17.970> cases

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
and they make it very easy in all cases

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.520 
and they make it very easy in all cases
of<00:01:18.960> all<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.070> Mira<00:01:20.250> tents<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.630> person<00:01:22.229> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
of all the Mira tents for one person to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.700 
of all the Mira tents for one person to
very<00:01:23.009> easily<00:01:23.580> set<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.509> up<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:24.840> one<00:01:25.350> thing<00:01:25.590> I

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
very easily set it up now one thing I

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.770 
very easily set it up now one thing I
want<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.950> show<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.880> will<00:01:27.060> go<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.420> you'll

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
want to show you here will go in you'll

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.819 
want to show you here will go in you'll
see<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.229> Ted<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.650> pulling<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:30.030> sleeve<00:01:30.829> up

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
see that Ted is pulling the sleeve up

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.980 
see that Ted is pulling the sleeve up
the<00:01:32.189> pole<00:01:32.430> rather<00:01:32.850> than<00:01:33.180> pushing<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.930> pole

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
the pole rather than pushing the pole

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.440 
the pole rather than pushing the pole
all<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.229> way<00:01:37.320> into<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.189> sleeve<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:39.299> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
all the way into the sleeve it's a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.840 
all the way into the sleeve it's a
subtle<00:01:39.720> difference<00:01:39.869> there<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.659> it<00:01:42.659> helps

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
subtle difference there but it helps

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.760 
subtle difference there but it helps
with<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> durability<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.960> sleeves<00:01:46.470> over

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
with the durability of the sleeves over

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.679 
with the durability of the sleeves over
time<00:01:47.220> there's<00:01:47.640> no<00:01:47.759> way<00:01:47.939> you're<00:01:48.119> going<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.270> poke

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
time there's no way you're going to poke

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.260 
time there's no way you're going to poke
them<00:01:48.869> through<00:01:49.200> or<00:01:49.470> something<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.970> much

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
them through or something and it's much

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.590 
them through or something and it's much
easier<00:01:51.740> when<00:01:52.740> you're<00:01:53.090> pulling<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.270> sleeve

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
easier when you're pulling the sleeve

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.800 
easier when you're pulling the sleeve
along<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.860> length<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> pole<00:01:56.700> rather<00:01:57.540> than

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
along the length of the pole rather than

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.499 
along the length of the pole rather than
pushing<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.530> pole<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> end<00:02:00.090> with

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
pushing the pole out to the end with

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.190 
pushing the pole out to the end with
force<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.159> see<00:02:03.030> there<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.780> tent<00:02:04.049> is

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
force so you see there the tent is

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.770 
force so you see there the tent is
essentially<00:02:04.799> set<00:02:05.549> up<00:02:05.670> that's<00:02:05.909> three<00:02:06.509> pulls

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
essentially set up that's three pulls

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.219 
essentially set up that's three pulls
there's<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.200> pull<00:02:08.099> at<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.580> head<00:02:08.910> end<00:02:09.080> there's<00:02:10.080> a

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
there's a pull at the head end there's a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.550 
there's a pull at the head end there's a
pull<00:02:11.510> going<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.599> length

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
pull going the length

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.760 
pull going the length
overhead<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.460> then<00:02:15.210> there<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:15.990> spreader

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
overhead and then there is a spreader

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.870 
overhead and then there is a spreader
pole<00:02:17.660> from<00:02:18.660> side<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.930> side<00:02:19.050> by<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.580> goes

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
pole from side to side by that that goes

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.020 
pole from side to side by that that goes
partially<00:02:21.660> across<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.230> tent<00:02:22.500> makes<00:02:23.460> for<00:02:23.670> very
