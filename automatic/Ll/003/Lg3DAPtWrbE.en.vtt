electronica<00:00:39.860> beats<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.129> stuff<00:00:41.250> I'm<00:00:41.579> not

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
electronica beats and stuff I'm not

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.119 
electronica beats and stuff I'm not
exactly<00:00:42.059> sure<00:00:42.270> who<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.960> god<00:00:43.170> figure<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:44.570> um<00:00:46.129> it

exactly sure who the god figure is um it

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.100 
exactly sure who the god figure is um it
seems<00:00:47.370> too<00:00:47.670> convenient<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.750> would<00:00:48.899> be

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
seems too convenient that that would be

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.709 
seems too convenient that that would be
our<00:00:49.140> actual<00:00:49.950> person<00:00:50.430> who<00:00:50.460> sent<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.360> people

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
our actual person who sent the people

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.930 
our actual person who sent the people
here<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.320> don't<00:00:52.770> know<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.489> could<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.910> a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
here so I don't know it could be a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.170 
here so I don't know it could be a
number<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.510> different<00:00:54.840> people<00:00:55.910> that's<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
number of different people that's the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.310 
number of different people that's the
one<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.570> I'm<00:00:57.660> not<00:00:58.020> exactly<00:00:58.440> sure<00:00:58.649> about<00:00:59.090> now

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
one but I'm not exactly sure about now

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.900 
one but I'm not exactly sure about now
most<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.469> these<00:01:01.559> are<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.039> know<00:01:02.190> funny

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
most of these are just you know funny

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.820 
most of these are just you know funny
like<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.420> don't<00:01:03.539> know<00:01:04.519> boat<00:01:05.519> biceps<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
therapies here obviously also we do know

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.920 
therapies here obviously also we do know
that<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.369> think<00:01:11.760> snips<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.240> snails<00:01:12.330> do

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
that I think snips and snails do

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.859 
that I think snips and snails do
actually<00:01:13.380> saying<00:01:13.680> which<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.119> not<00:01:15.119> included<00:01:15.150> on

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
actually saying which is not included on

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.870 
actually saying which is not included on
the<00:01:16.290> soundtrack<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.490> purposely

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the soundtrack because it's purposely

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.030 
the soundtrack because it's purposely
made<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.390> bad<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.900> not<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
made to be bad or not this is just a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.410 
made to be bad or not this is just a
scene<00:01:20.310> from<00:01:20.580> when<00:01:21.020> I<00:01:22.020> guess<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.979> there<00:01:23.360> but<00:01:24.360> I
