00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
it would be appropriate to start off for

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.210 
it would be appropriate to start off for
this<00:00:23.279> one<00:00:23.960> anyways<00:00:24.960> there<00:00:25.289> will<00:00:25.439> be<00:00:25.470> more<00:00:25.859> buff

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220

tags clean up the town stuff like that

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.780 
tags clean up the town stuff like that
so<00:01:20.729> yeah<00:01:21.560> two<00:01:22.560> common<00:01:22.890> methods<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.369> they<00:01:23.520> use

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
so yeah two common methods that they use

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.600 
so yeah two common methods that they use
when<00:01:24.479> they<00:01:24.689> try<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.290> are<00:01:25.610> using

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
when they try to do this are using

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.289 
when they try to do this are using
chemical<00:01:27.060> solvents<00:01:28.340> two<00:01:29.340> most<00:01:29.700> common<00:01:30.119> one<00:01:30.270> is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
chemical solvents two most common one is

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.450 
chemical solvents two most common one is
paint<00:01:30.960> thinner<00:01:31.170> which<00:01:31.829> we're<00:01:32.100> gonna<00:01:32.189> be<00:01:32.340> using

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
paint thinner which we're gonna be using

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.010 
paint thinner which we're gonna be using
today<00:01:34.040> this<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.220> really<00:01:35.460> cheap<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.930> know

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
today this is really cheap so you know

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.359 
today this is really cheap so you know
in<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> buff<00:01:37.380> they'll<00:01:37.680> tend<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.009> use<00:01:38.130> this

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
in the buff they'll tend to use this

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.510 
in the buff they'll tend to use this
because<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> buffs<00:01:39.450> really<00:01:39.720> cheap<00:01:40.340> but<00:01:41.340> yeah

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
because the buffs really cheap but yeah

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.190 
because the buffs really cheap but yeah
pretty<00:01:41.759> much<00:01:41.970> what<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> does<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.899> just

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
pretty much what it does is it just

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.620 
pretty much what it does is it just
deteriorates<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.310> paint<00:01:44.610> or<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> ink<00:01:45.119> that

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
deteriorates the paint or the ink that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.920 
deteriorates the paint or the ink that
is<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.770> your<00:01:46.860> tag<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.430> then<00:01:47.549> usually<00:01:48.420> gets<00:01:48.750> rid

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
is in your tag and then usually gets rid

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.770 
is in your tag and then usually gets rid
of<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:50.100> then<00:01:50.220> also<00:01:50.430> today<00:01:50.939> I'm<00:01:51.329> gonna<00:01:51.600> be

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
of it and then also today I'm gonna be

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.429 
of it and then also today I'm gonna be
trying<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:53.630> spray<00:01:54.630> paint<00:01:54.899> over<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:56.670> marker

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the on the run point zero six zero holds

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.830 
the on the run point zero six zero holds
up<00:02:11.160> against<00:02:11.989> two<00:02:12.989> common

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.630 
not withstand at all to paint there so
let's<00:03:21.019> try<00:03:21.319> our<00:03:21.530> next<00:03:23.680> buff<00:03:24.680> which<00:03:25.310> is<00:03:25.489> going

to be painting over it and let's see if

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.569 
to be painting over it and let's see if
it<00:03:30.560> can<00:03:30.799> penetrate<00:03:31.430> through<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.910> paint<00:03:33.579> again

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
it can penetrate through the paint again

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.670 
it can penetrate through the paint again

through by one more coat of paint and it
will<00:04:10.230> be<00:04:10.320> totally<00:04:10.680> gone<00:04:11.270> you<00:04:12.270> might<00:04:12.360> be

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
surprised at this buff test I know I am

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.699 
surprised at this buff test I know I am
but<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.570> results<00:04:15.990> might<00:04:16.170> have<00:04:16.320> been<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.500> bit

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
but the results might have been a bit

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.479 
but the results might have been a bit
different<00:04:16.950> if<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:18.420> marker<00:04:18.810> didn't<00:04:19.250> wasn't<00:04:20.250> so

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
different if the marker didn't wasn't so

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.770 
different if the marker didn't wasn't so
streaky<00:04:20.910> when<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:22.170> was<00:04:22.650> writing<00:04:22.860> with<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.780> and

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
streaky when I was writing with it and

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.200 
streaky when I was writing with it and
that's<00:04:24.930> why<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.170> say<00:04:25.620> you<00:04:25.680> know<00:04:26.010> if<00:04:26.730> you<00:04:26.790> get<00:04:27.030> one

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
that's why I say you know if you get one

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.670 
that's why I say you know if you get one
of<00:04:27.240> these<00:04:27.360> markers<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:28.050> you're<00:04:28.410> dissatisfied

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
of these markers and you're dissatisfied

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.330 
of these markers and you're dissatisfied
like<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.550> am<00:04:30.260> take<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.470> paint<00:04:31.710> out<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.070> run<00:04:32.250> it

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
like I am take the paint out and run it

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.580 
like I am take the paint out and run it
through<00:04:32.370> a<00:04:32.550> mop<00:04:32.790> because<00:04:33.360> that'll<00:04:34.320> make<00:04:34.350> the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
through a mop because that'll make the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.850 
through a mop because that'll make the
paint<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:35.360> lot<00:04:36.360> more<00:04:36.540> opaque<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.170> it<00:04:37.680> might

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
paint a lot more opaque and it might

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.880 
paint a lot more opaque and it might
stand<00:04:38.220> up<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:38.550> bit<00:04:38.700> better<00:04:38.910> towards<00:04:39.870> buffs

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.110 

anyways<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:44.850> OTR<00:04:45.210> point<00:04:45.660> zero<00:04:46.080> six<00:04:46.350> zero

anyways the OTR point zero six zero
permanent<00:04:48.120> paint<00:04:48.360> marker<00:04:48.750> is<00:04:48.930> pretty<00:04:49.620> much<00:04:49.770> a

permanent paint marker is pretty much a

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.840 
permanent paint marker is pretty much a
marker<00:04:50.370> full<00:04:50.640> of<00:04:50.790> lies<00:04:51.920> that's<00:04:52.920> true<00:04:53.220> so

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
marker full of lies that's true so

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.110 
marker full of lies that's true so
that's<00:04:54.480> all<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.780> time<00:04:54.960> I<00:04:54.990> got<00:04:55.230> today<00:04:56.120> stay
