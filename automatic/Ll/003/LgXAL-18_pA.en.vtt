out we had to be patient and it just so

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.920 
out we had to be patient and it just so
happened<00:00:53.400> so<00:00:53.579> he<00:00:53.790> probably<00:00:54.210> stepped<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:54.780> and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930

even though we had a goal I think we did
a<00:00:59.850> good<00:00:59.970> job<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.239> not<00:01:00.330> letting<00:01:00.600> him<00:01:00.780> down<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199

a good job of not letting him down and
even<00:01:01.379> though<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.530> let<00:01:01.620> him<00:01:01.739> score<00:01:01.949> when<00:01:02.190> we

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
even though we let him score when we

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:03.799 
even though we let him score when we
like<00:01:02.519> kept<00:01:02.730> pushing<00:01:02.940> at<00:01:03.180> them<00:01:03.390> even<00:01:03.600> though<00:01:03.690> we

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
like kept pushing at them even though we
