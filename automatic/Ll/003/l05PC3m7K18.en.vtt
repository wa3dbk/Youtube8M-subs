00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hi everyone then I should review 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.529
 the last two books I've read and that 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.070
 I had put aside in the hope of 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.320
 read others but I see that I had of 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.379
 new a descending peak 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.930
 my problem and this i do more 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.080
 ahead with constant age 25 plus years me 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.610
 then forget things 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.529
 what I naturally read about camilleri 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:35.030
 the den of vipers that the last investigation 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.309
 I 'm the commissioner of the Montalbano 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.379
 I have to call I have to call analyst 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.629
 superstar and I have to tell her, me 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.629
 must do once montabano are also 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.580
 if it is not the same dialect he explained to me 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.460
 and then I read this book that was me 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.519
 been sent by the calling author 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.309
 laura di gianfrancesco the swallows do not 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:59.659
 I have never encountered a lot of things 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:02.059
 long ago and I do not apologize to the author 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.729
 especially because I wanted to 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.080
 read before there was no way but 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.549
 I have too much to call an analyst 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.510
 superstar 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.510
 then he calls her then camilleri 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.130
 I liked it yes finally it is me 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.290
 liked it was a bit in free descent 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.640
 according to me lately camilleri but not 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.680
 because I believe he is in the 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.040
 moment when you close but not 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.670
 knows how to do it because I don't believe that 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.670
 is a 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.240
 that is how to close it there is montalbano thing 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.670
 what to make him happen to montalbano is 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.190
 this which I do not know he does not know 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.439
 how to do 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.439
 it is a strong book because it deals with topics 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.880
 heavy that I have to do spoilers not 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.130
 spoiler 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.990
 I don't know, however, a man is found 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.990
 died in his house 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:17.269
 from the autopsy it is clear that it was yes 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.760
 fired that poisoned so you have to 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:27.170
 understanding what happened is a then 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.150
 there isn't at least one for me 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.299
 surprise in the sense that I from the beginning 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.390
 I understood how things had not gone 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:38.120
 I wish I was too good 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.170
 no this is not a book 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:50.510
 that speaks of violence and an ugly one 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:52.340
 violence, however , was the first time that 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:59.450
 camilleri treats such a subject 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:02.329
 and he does it with all the pain he can 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.880
 to write 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.829
 yes, I like a book review 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.670
 as reviews stadiums books are worth 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.280
 own zero 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.470
 I liked it very much I don't know 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.120
 if everyone likes it, it's me 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:20.060
 really liked it I think I ended up in 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:23.420
 223 days the other book I read there 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:28.780
 I was saying this is it 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:31.760
 I am happy because this is the autograph 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:38.829
 of the writer and I really like the 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:46.010
 paper on this the publishing house this 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:51.489
 and you can also follow on facebook 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:55.310
 then I liked it yes it is a very book 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:59.010
 young but not young 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.409
 a writing is mature but it is clear that it is 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.310
 written by a young person and this 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:08.609
 it made me glad I was one 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.890
 a very smooth fresh reading is one 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.180
 story that has an ending that I wouldn't have 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.390
 waiting 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.870
 I was totally convinced to go in 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.609
 I had another twist 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.570
 the ending seemed predictable but not 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.010
 was 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.250
 is the story of 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:36.230
 of this very pretty girl very much 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:39.200
 I don't know I like it right away 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.690
 sympathy and you get very fond of it 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.260
 often I recommend reading 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.540
 I really like it I like that there are gods 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.410
 new boys who write books 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:55.330
 so for romance I like I will follow laura 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.860
 to see his upcoming works fatigues 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:05.480
 unfortunately I haven't read anything else maybe I haven't 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:07.780
 read i read something yes on kindle but 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.840
 some short story but I don't remember and 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.610
 maybe if I talk about it later 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.399
 I'll talk in a future book I'm sorry 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.080
 what a video i'm sorry about 

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:20.219
 to have little time I'm sorry to have 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.439
 really little time because me 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:25.169
 would love to read light to read 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:29.610
 I would always be life, life 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:31.889
 perfect pizza coca light elected a 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.430
 read but also a comfortable armchair 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:37.319
 would be good or a hamburger 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.860
 in short, there is some focaccia bread e 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:41.249
 salami 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:44.099
 in short, something salty, water or coke 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:45.659
 light but not for a dietary occasion 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.699
 but why the normal coke me not 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:50.729
 instead like the fanta which is not good but 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.990
 it is so much and has done it and likes it very much 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.800
 but I buy it little because it really is 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.809
 so sweet I never really buy it 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:02.389
 a lot is not however this is a 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:02.389
 video of books that resulted in this way 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:11.180
 strength I greet you and see you at 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.180
