to hold the spool you can use a simple

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.430 
to hold the spool you can use a simple
solution<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.170> cardboard<00:00:40.469> box<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
solution in just a cardboard box and a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.440 
solution in just a cardboard box and a
screwdriver<00:00:43.820> what<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:45.090> here<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
screwdriver what I have here is a

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.119

screwdriver<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:46.230> from<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.530> corner<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
screwdriver going from one corner to the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.860 
screwdriver going from one corner to the
other<00:00:47.250> corner<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.180> holding<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.629> spool

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
other corner and it's holding the spool

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.380 
other corner and it's holding the spool
in<00:00:49.079> place<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.460> tape<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:50.969> that

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
in place so I have the tape here that

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.069 
in place so I have the tape here that
prevents<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> line<00:00:52.800> from<00:00:53.070> unraveling<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.629> I

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
prevents the line from unraveling so I

something<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.530> looks<00:02:07.649> like<00:02:07.770> that

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
something that looks like that

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.220 
something that looks like that
all<00:02:10.640> right<00:02:10.820> and<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.150> want<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.420> slowly<00:02:11.810> make<00:02:12.170> a

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
all right and you want to slowly make a

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.370 
all right and you want to slowly make a
couple<00:02:12.590> wraps<00:02:13.010> till<00:02:13.880> this<00:02:14.060> starts<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:15.490> evenly

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
couple wraps till this starts to evenly

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.120 
couple wraps till this starts to evenly
spoil<00:02:18.380> on<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.890> room<00:02:19.540> now<00:02:20.770> one<00:02:21.770> thing<00:02:21.980> that

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
spoil on to the room now one thing that

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.070 
spoil on to the room now one thing that
people<00:02:22.250> do<00:02:22.580> or<00:02:22.910> have<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.120> tendency<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.720> do<00:02:23.870> is

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
people do or have a tendency to do is

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.630 
people do or have a tendency to do is
they<00:02:24.200> have<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.410> tendency<00:02:24.710> to<00:02:24.980> hold<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:25.400> line

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
they have a tendency to hold this line

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.520 
they have a tendency to hold this line
real<00:02:25.940> tight<00:02:26.210> to<00:02:26.660> either<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.050> left<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
real tight to either the left to the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.290 
real tight to either the left to the
right<00:02:27.560> side<00:02:27.880> thinking<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.060> just<00:02:29.210> because

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
right side thinking that just because

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.240 
right side thinking that just because
it's<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.720> level<00:02:30.050> line<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.620> will<00:02:30.710> spool<00:02:31.040> up

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
it's a level line that it will spool up

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.030 
it's a level line that it will spool up
evenly<00:02:32.210> but<00:02:32.930> if<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.140> do<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.470> you'll<00:02:33.740> find

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
evenly but if you do that you'll find

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.680 
evenly but if you do that you'll find
you'll<00:02:34.340> quickly<00:02:34.580> find<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:35.090> that's<00:02:35.300> not<00:02:35.510> the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
you'll quickly find that that's not the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.199 
you'll quickly find that that's not the
case<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.709> do<00:02:36.830> want<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.070> hold<00:02:37.250> tension<00:02:37.550> but

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
case so you do want to hold tension but

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.990 
case so you do want to hold tension but
you<00:02:38.330> also<00:02:38.540> want<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.930> go<00:02:39.050> back<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.470> forth<00:02:40.000> so

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
you also want to go back and forth so

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.390 
you also want to go back and forth so
you<00:02:41.030> don't<00:02:41.480> want<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.840> prevent<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:42.620> from<00:02:42.770> from

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
you don't want to prevent it from from

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:52.440 
you don't want to prevent it from from
going<00:02:43.700> one<00:02:43.910> way<00:02:43.940> or<00:02:44.360> another<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:50.180> now<00:02:50.360> I'm<00:02:50.540> just

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450

going one way or another so now I'm just
putting<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.570> line<00:02:53.780> on<00:02:55.540> making<00:02:56.540> sure<00:02:56.750> that

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
putting the line on making sure that

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:19.050 
putting the line on making sure that
it's<00:02:57.080> evenly<00:02:57.380> school

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
so you want to put as much line as you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.390 
so you want to put as much line as you
feel<00:03:21.950> comfortable<00:03:22.570> with<00:03:23.570> guys<00:03:24.220> obviously<00:03:25.220> you

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
indicator on most of these spools that

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.640 
indicator on most of these spools that
will<00:03:41.900> tell<00:03:42.110> you<00:03:42.200> when<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.470> stop<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.780> but<00:03:45.500> that's

it's not rocket science you can use a

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.700 
it's not rocket science you can use a
box<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:50.030> can<00:03:50.210> use<00:03:50.240> a<00:03:50.360> friend<00:03:50.720> just<00:03:51.350> make<00:03:51.530> sure

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
box you can use a friend just make sure

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.770 
box you can use a friend just make sure
that<00:03:51.740> you<00:03:51.950> pull<00:03:52.190> it<00:03:52.310> on<00:03:52.430> nice<00:03:52.940> and<00:03:52.970> tight<00:03:53.360> get<00:03:53.750> a

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
that you pull it on nice and tight get a

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.090 
that you pull it on nice and tight get a
good<00:03:54.160> quality<00:03:55.160> line<00:03:55.670> that<00:03:56.210> has<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:56.840> know<00:03:57.100> you

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
good quality line that has you know you

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.840 
good quality line that has you know you
know<00:03:58.190> a<00:03:58.220> low<00:03:58.490> memory<00:03:59.740> something<00:04:00.740> that<00:04:00.920> that's

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
know a low memory something that that's

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.760 
know a low memory something that that's
been<00:04:02.090> proven<00:04:02.360> as<00:04:02.990> long<00:04:03.200> as<00:04:03.350> you<00:04:03.440> spend<00:04:03.650> the

been proven as long as you spend the
money<00:04:03.860> on<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:04.190> line<00:04:04.370> you'll<00:04:04.730> you'll

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
money on the line you'll you'll

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.770 
money on the line you'll you'll
definitely<00:04:06.050> be<00:04:06.950> happy<00:04:07.250> that<00:04:07.370> you<00:04:07.520> did<00:04:07.780> but

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
other than that this is the dial with

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.880 
other than that this is the dial with
tutuila<00:04:11.230> I'm<00:04:12.230> going<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.440> put<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.740> the<00:04:12.860> test

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
tutuila I'm going to put it to the test

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.380 
tutuila I'm going to put it to the test
see<00:04:13.670> how<00:04:13.820> it<00:04:13.940> works
