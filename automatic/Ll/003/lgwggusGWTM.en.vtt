00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:06.759
 hello hello hello good today I'm going to 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.430
 bring a video where I want to tell you 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.960
 a series of tricks to save when 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:18.820
 we cut gasoline or diesel we're going 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.130
 good fuel first of all there's 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.370
 to try to refuel early 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.370
 the morning 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.160
 as early as possible because 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.710
 because the fuel tanks are 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.449
 underground and then when it's hot 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.520
 that causes the gases to expand and 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.880
 refuel 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.210
 One liter of gasoline or diesel is not a 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.580
 real liter because half are gases by 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.550
 the heat that have expanded are more 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.020
 swollen and such and such 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.230
 then when the temperature is more 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.230
 low 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.750
 gasoline is denser more 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.840
 concentrated and a liter of gasoline is a 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.090
 real liter with your answers so 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.670
 first trick refuel first thing in the 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.510
 the morning as early as possible 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.950
 especially in summer second trick 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.160
 when we go to refuel especially if 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:21.290
 we subtract we do not tighten the hose 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:25.040
 butt because the speed of the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.920
 fuel is regulated by squeezing more the 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.900
 hose or leaving the looser then 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.330
 we must try to speed it 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.330
 slow 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:40.790
 the exit of gasoline has a speed 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:43.340
 slow / slow because because when entering 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.100
 very quickly this also makes the same 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:51.280
 effect that when the temperature rises 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.280
 vale expands and creates a 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.100
 a false vision a false false reading 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.230
 in quotes to say so in the 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.260
 supplier because of course it enters more quickly 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:06.570
 there is more friction in the gases 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.220
 expand and then as a consequence 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.830
 we get less amount of gas 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.200
 Real is worth one liter, because it would not be 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.960
 a liter so try to refuel 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.300
 slowly and without putting the pump on top 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.310
 has been mine between slowly 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.430
 manny and another trick 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.010
 you have to fill the deposit before 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.280
 the level of the deposit will go down to 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.840
 half are worth lower than half 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.480
 what the marker tells us 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.910
 because because how much more 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.200
 fuel is in the tank 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:49.739
 less air then there is clear if you 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:54.370
 answers when gasoline is 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:56.610
 practically finished when entering 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.010
 clear and fuels are evaporating 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.019
 general of molecules do not 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.409
 all the compact gas enters 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.120
 I should enter therefore 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.430
 consequence you will have less gas in 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.909
 the deposit of which should enter from 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.440
 real way then, although the 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.319
 reading the meter then I will give you 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.030
 that the deposit is really full 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.239
 a lot that amount is someone 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.239
 it just is not the real solidad so 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.599
 So much you have to try to refuel before 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:32.030
 that the gas meter goes down 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:35.630
 below half the deposit 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.190
 trying to keep all this in mind 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.160
 let's save a lot of fuel already 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.580
 you will see another trick is not to refuel if 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.550
 we see that the gas tanks are 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.840
 at that moment filling the pumps 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.210
 It's worth the same thing that I told you before 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.370
 the filling spout is removed the 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.460
 gasoline also removes what they have 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.050
 down that are grounds is dirt and such and 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.180
 apart from that we will enter higher 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.860
 amount of air for having filled in 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.280
 that moment the pump and the reading goes 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.740
 to be more fictional and above we will 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.540
 enter a lot of dirty gas there's a lot 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.680
 crap and many wells and many 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.510
 waste 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.310
 then if you see that it is resting in 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.920
 that moment in the pumps that there is a 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.140
 tank truck avoid refueling in that 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.150
 mari gas station possible leaving for the 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.919
 next day if you can 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.130
 and if you do it also in the first 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.130
 the morning 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.920
 and 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.699
 Given all this and tell 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.850
 you will see how you are going to notice that the 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.139
 deposit lasts much longer when you 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.240
 I say because gas is going to be a lot 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.400
 more compacted 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.990
 I hope you liked this video 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.470
 this has been everything for today has been more 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.470
 cortito 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.270
 today what difficult 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:15.950
 good the eggs 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:18.110
 at this speed of 226 euros in a 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.900
 bazar of my neighborhood to see what cool is 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.360
 it has super-bright colors so very 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.060
 cheerful I use it both in winter and in 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.470
 summer and I say because I work 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.540
 an office in the office with the 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.220
 completion very high in winter and me 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.740
 I do not care so I even take a 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.570
 point ethics and I wear the aesthetic 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:41.610
 point with this music low and 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.620
 has the neck to tie you see 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.330
 then you go through your head and then 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.300
 It has both ends and you are here 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:51.389
 a bow and unit that chulada 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.909
 in golden orange tones as well as with 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:56.409
 a chain has a rubber band down here 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:58.569
 to adjust to the hip 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:00.219
 that I like very much because in addition 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:02.349
 this kind of blouses like that a little 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:05.080
 puffs that disguise perfectly 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:07.539
 if you have a little bit of tummy 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.699
 of michelle english and I do not know what if not 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:13.029
 I know what the trouser trousers are not 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:15.879
 you buy with this you do not notice it so it's 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:18.969
 great I loved today I am 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:22.269
 carrying with this pirate have you have 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:25.300
 seen also have here have here 

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:28.089
 down a fold several in shades 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.699
 satin chocolate and wear these 

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:34.300
 sandals that I also like a 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:36.849
 because they are elastic I'm not going to 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.880
 teach and hold the foot well 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:42.050
 this here is elastic 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.030
 liz 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.449
 so what happens that you put on the 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.449
 sandal 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.479
 yes no if I do not kill myself and adjust 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.060
 perfectly at the foot 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:55.830
 you do not have to do anything else and something else 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.659
 I wanted to comment and hell when 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.800
 came this music I usually carry this guy 

00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:00.800
 back under 

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:07.960
 then I put on the little skirt that imitates 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:12.179
 skin and under a fat lethargy and a 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.179
 shoe of these loafers today pacora 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:26.610
 then if for your july patita 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.919
 late with chocolate and with a shoe 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:33.210
 closed agglutinated with a cord 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:34.740
 little jacket and then also chocolate 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:38.430
 and today they have been totally 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:40.500
 different is good, well, if it's nothing 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.970
 more this has been the video today I hope 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.810
 that you liked it and see you in the 

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.810
 next to then
