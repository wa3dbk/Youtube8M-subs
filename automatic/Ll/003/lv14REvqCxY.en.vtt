butters in their Vitamix and then they

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.629 
butters in their Vitamix and then they
get<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.649> hang<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.010> peanut<00:00:08.280> butter<00:00:08.400> but

for some reason and that butter almond
butter<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.070> always<00:00:11.370> one<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.550> those<00:00:11.670> things

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030

too pasty it's too runny it stops the
machine<00:00:18.000> overheat<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.840> motor<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.980> they

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
machine overheat the motor and they

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.380 
machine overheat the motor and they
bring<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.760> they're<00:00:20.850> always<00:00:21.000> having

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
bring it in and they're always having

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.640 
bring it in and they're always having
issues<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:21.960> really<00:00:22.170> like<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.350> highlight

this<00:00:22.949> recipe<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.519> our<00:00:23.580> advanced<00:00:23.910> class<00:00:24.180> what

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
this recipe in our advanced class what

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.200 
this recipe in our advanced class what
I've<00:00:25.140> done<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.650> my<00:00:25.800> almonds<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.460> like<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.060> buy

I've done to my almonds I like to buy
raw<00:00:27.420> almonds<00:00:27.920> we<00:00:28.920> tell<00:00:29.130> people<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.670> want

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
raw almonds we tell people if you want

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.070 
raw almonds we tell people if you want
to<00:00:29.910> make<00:00:30.029> raw<00:00:30.179> nut<00:00:30.449> butters<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.900> can

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
to make raw nut butters you can

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.880 
to make raw nut butters you can
certainly<00:00:31.230> do<00:00:31.529> that

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
certainly do that

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.380 
certainly do that
but<00:00:32.250> you're<00:00:32.369> going<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.820> add<00:00:32.910> some<00:00:32.940> oil

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
but you're going to have to add some oil

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.990 
but you're going to have to add some oil
to<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.809> as<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.800> know<00:00:34.950> everybody<00:00:35.460> mixes<00:00:35.820> that

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
to it as you know everybody mixes that

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.520 
to it as you know everybody mixes that
built-in<00:00:36.390> thermal<00:00:36.719> heating<00:00:36.899> mechanism<00:00:37.079> we

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
built-in thermal heating mechanism we

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.619 
built-in thermal heating mechanism we
talked<00:00:37.739> about<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.340> our<00:00:38.489> classes<00:00:38.730> now<00:00:39.450> if

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
talked about that in our classes now if

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.880 
talked about that in our classes now if
you<00:00:39.750> were<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.110> put<00:00:40.170> raw<00:00:40.410> almonds<00:00:40.770> in

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
you were to just put raw almonds in

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.440 
you were to just put raw almonds in
there<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.129> no<00:00:41.280> oil<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:42.000> would<00:00:42.120> essentially

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
there with no oil it would essentially

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.420 
there with no oil it would essentially
make<00:00:42.690> an<00:00:42.809> almond<00:00:43.110> flour<00:00:43.350> eventually<00:00:44.100> starting

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
make an almond flour eventually starting

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.400 
make an almond flour eventually starting
to<00:00:44.520> kick<00:00:44.730> up<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> sides<00:00:45.360> beginning<00:00:46.170> to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
to kick up on the sides beginning to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.279 
to kick up on the sides beginning to
make<00:00:46.530> an<00:00:46.739> almond<00:00:47.489> butter<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:48.660> they<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.870> using

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
make an almond butter that they be using

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.049 
make an almond butter that they be using
that<00:00:49.379> tamper<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:49.980> long<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.550> far<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.969> it

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
that tamper so long and so far that it

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.729 
that tamper so long and so far that it
would<00:00:51.149> overheat<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.379> recommend

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
would overheat so we do recommend

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.740 
would overheat so we do recommend
putting<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.190> little<00:00:53.430> bit<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.640> oil<00:00:53.820> when<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.629> do

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
putting a little bit of oil when we do

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.970 
putting a little bit of oil when we do
our<00:00:54.780> cashew<00:00:55.320> butter<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:55.800> they're

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
our cashew butter because they're

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.709 
our cashew butter because they're
starchy<00:00:56.520> or<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.120> put<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> little<00:00:57.449> bit<00:00:57.570> of

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
starchy or not so we put a little bit of

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.229 
starchy or not so we put a little bit of
oil<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.020> there<00:00:58.109> too<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.250> by<00:00:59.399> dry

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
oil in there too if you just by dry

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.029 
oil in there too if you just by dry
roasted<00:01:00.629> peanuts<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.500> don't<00:01:01.680> really<00:01:01.829> need

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
roasted peanuts you don't really need

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:10.280 
roasted peanuts you don't really need
that<00:01:02.219> oil<00:01:03.470> so<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.799> don't<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.610> any<00:01:05.880> bars<00:01:08.180> I<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.900> we

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
that oil so I don't do any bars I do we

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.810 
that oil so I don't do any bars I do we
do<00:01:10.380> not<00:01:10.530> do<00:01:10.710> them<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> class<00:01:11.250> though<00:01:11.520> but

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
do not do them in the class though but

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.690 
do not do them in the class though but
we<00:01:11.970> tell<00:01:12.270> people<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:12.960> want<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.380> that

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
we tell people if they want to do that

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.219 
we tell people if they want to do that
use<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.729> fourths<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.330> cup<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.659> oil<00:01:15.840> I

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
use that fourths of a cup of oil I

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.560 
use that fourths of a cup of oil I
always<00:01:17.040> talk<00:01:17.250> about<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.670> make<00:01:17.790> these<00:01:18.000> raw

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
always talk about and make these raw

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.840 
always talk about and make these raw
almond<00:01:18.930> energy<00:01:19.290> bars<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.430> put<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> cup

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
almond energy bars and I just put a cup

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.310 
almond energy bars and I just put a cup
of<00:01:21.000> raw<00:01:21.150> almonds<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.600> there<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.780> little<00:01:22.049> bit<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
of raw almonds in there a little bit of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.429 
of raw almonds in there a little bit of
coconut<00:01:22.680> oil<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.060> some<00:01:24.240> raw<00:01:24.390> cacao<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.229> we

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
coconut oil and some raw cacao and we

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.399 
coconut oil and some raw cacao and we
run<00:01:25.650> through<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.220> also<00:01:26.400> teach<00:01:26.790> or<00:01:27.299> have

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
run through that we also teach or have

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.749 
run through that we also teach or have
available<00:01:28.409> private<00:01:28.799> sessions<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.549> there's

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
available private sessions so if there's

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.819 
available private sessions so if there's
a<00:01:30.000> question<00:01:30.689> where<00:01:30.869> somebody<00:01:31.229> really<00:01:31.799> needs

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
a question where somebody really needs

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.649 
a question where somebody really needs

why did you put the oil on top and not
first<00:02:10.110> because<00:02:10.380> they<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.619> back<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.950> that

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
first because they go back to that

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.220 
first because they go back to that
liquid<00:02:11.430> first<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.300> what<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.450> tell<00:02:12.720> them<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:13.020> I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
liquid first and what I tell them is I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.780 
liquid first and what I tell them is I
like<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.500> put<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.710> oil<00:02:13.860> on<00:02:14.040> top<00:02:14.250> because<00:02:14.640> it

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
like to put the oil on top because it

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.070 
like to put the oil on top because it
trickles<00:02:15.120> down<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.480> runs<00:02:15.660> through<00:02:15.780> all<00:02:15.990> the

a<00:02:18.540> little<00:02:18.720> bit<00:02:18.870> easier<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.640> um<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.330> other

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
a little bit easier so um the other

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.090 
a little bit easier so um the other
thing<00:02:21.660> we<00:02:21.750> do<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:21.960> our<00:02:21.990> class<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.620> go<00:02:22.770> beyond

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
thing we do in our class is we go beyond

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.010 
thing we do in our class is we go beyond
the<00:02:23.280> recipe<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:23.910> we<00:02:24.030> try<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.300> show<00:02:24.540> them<00:02:24.780> how

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
the recipe so we try to show them how

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.020 
the recipe so we try to show them how
they<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.230> customize<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.430> their<00:02:26.550> own<00:02:26.790> life

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
they can customize it to their own life

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.180 
they can customize it to their own life

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
the tamper is designed to drive

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.490 
the tamper is designed to drive
ingredients<00:03:36.000> towards<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:36.390> blade<00:03:36.600> it's<00:03:36.870> there

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
ingredients towards the blade it's there

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.530 
ingredients towards the blade it's there
so<00:03:38.459> as<00:03:38.640> long<00:03:38.760> as<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.030> have<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.270> lid<00:03:39.450> on

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
secure it's never going to hit the blade

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.010 
secure it's never going to hit the blade
it<00:03:41.760> lets<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:42.090> get<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.330> your<00:03:42.450> end<00:03:42.570> result<00:03:42.720> with

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
it lets you get to your end result with

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
a little bit more finesse and efficiency

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.330 
a little bit more finesse and efficiency
versus<00:03:46.140> other<00:03:46.290> blenders<00:03:46.709> where<00:03:47.220> you're

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
versus other blenders where you're

much faster to block the nut butter I'll

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.949 
much faster to block the nut butter I'll
turn<00:03:56.190> my<00:03:56.340> Vitamix<00:03:56.790> on<00:03:57.000> ramped<00:03:57.570> it<00:03:57.660> up<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.810> a

how much about a minute and I've noticed
with<00:05:07.409> the<00:05:07.650> next-gen<00:05:08.130> container<00:05:08.520> you're<00:05:08.789> going

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
with the next-gen container you're going

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.399 
with the next-gen container you're going
to<00:05:08.970> get<00:05:09.120> it<00:05:09.240> it<00:05:09.479> takes<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:09.930> little<00:05:10.050> bit<00:05:10.229> longer

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
to get it it takes a little bit longer

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.740 
to get it it takes a little bit longer
than<00:05:10.710> a<00:05:10.770> minute<00:05:11.099> you<00:05:11.520> get<00:05:11.909> a<00:05:11.970> chunkier<00:05:12.479> nut

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
than a minute you get a chunkier nut

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.050 
than a minute you get a chunkier nut
butter<00:05:12.949> so<00:05:13.949> I've<00:05:14.280> had<00:05:14.520> to<00:05:14.610> scrape<00:05:14.820> down<00:05:15.000> the

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
butter so I've had to scrape down the

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.820 
butter so I've had to scrape down the
sides<00:05:15.419> a<00:05:15.570> little<00:05:15.599> bit<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.139> then<00:05:16.260> rewind<00:05:16.620> on

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
sides a little bit and then rewind on

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.790 
sides a little bit and then rewind on
that<00:05:17.010> one<00:05:17.190> this<00:05:17.669> one<00:05:17.729> 30<00:05:18.599> to<00:05:18.780> 45<00:05:19.229> seconds<00:05:19.650> I'm

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
that one this one 30 to 45 seconds I'm

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.980 
that one this one 30 to 45 seconds I'm
in<00:05:19.919> a<00:05:19.949> good<00:05:20.159> chunky<00:05:20.580> quality<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:21.570> then<00:05:21.810> in<00:05:21.930> a

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
in a good chunky quality and then in a

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.140 
in a good chunky quality and then in a
minute<00:05:22.139> it's<00:05:22.740> like<00:05:22.860> I<00:05:22.949> can<00:05:23.520> get<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.760> smooth<00:05:24.000> on

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
minute it's like I can get to smooth on

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.580 
minute it's like I can get to smooth on
the<00:05:24.270> next-gen<00:05:24.780> about<00:05:25.020> a<00:05:25.050> minute<00:05:25.320> and<00:05:25.409> a<00:05:25.560> half

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
the next-gen about a minute and a half

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.020 
the next-gen about a minute and a half
it<00:05:25.889> definitely<00:05:26.250> takes<00:05:26.460> a<00:05:26.580> little<00:05:26.760> bit<00:05:26.849> over

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
it definitely takes a little bit over

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.460 
it definitely takes a little bit over
but<00:05:27.180> you're<00:05:27.330> also<00:05:27.449> combined<00:05:27.840> also<00:05:28.020> got<00:05:28.289> more

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
but you're also combined also got more

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.779 
but you're also combined also got more
nuts<00:05:28.680> in<00:05:28.830> there<00:05:28.979> so<00:05:29.099> it's<00:05:29.220> going<00:05:29.370> to<00:05:29.430> take<00:05:29.610> more

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
nuts in there so it's going to take more

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.320 
nuts in there so it's going to take more
sure<00:05:30.380> any<00:05:31.380> more<00:05:31.500> surface<00:05:31.889> area<00:05:32.130> so<00:05:32.729> three<00:05:33.090> cups

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
sure any more surface area so three cups

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.939 
sure any more surface area so three cups
that's<00:05:33.599> a<00:05:33.720> big<00:05:33.900> question<00:05:34.260> how<00:05:34.380> much<00:05:34.530> you<00:05:34.800> need

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
that's a big question how much you need

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.370 
that's a big question how much you need
three<00:05:35.610> cups<00:05:35.880> for<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.389> tall<00:05:36.659> 64<00:05:37.110> ounce

heard it flatline on its own it's very
important<00:07:15.940> I<00:07:16.030> always<00:07:16.060> say<00:07:16.960> take<00:07:17.680> it<00:07:17.860> down<00:07:18.040> to

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:18.220 
important I always say take it down to

off<00:07:20.500> we<00:07:20.770> reiterate<00:07:21.010> that<00:07:21.550> on<00:07:21.850> pretty<00:07:22.120> much

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300 
off we reiterate that on pretty much

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.470 
off we reiterate that on pretty much
every<00:07:22.720> recipe<00:07:23.130> because<00:07:24.130> there's<00:07:25.120> a<00:07:25.210> few
