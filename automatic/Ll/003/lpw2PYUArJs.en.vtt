00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
three seconds but then it's back to

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.589 
three seconds but then it's back to
normal<00:04:09.370> that's<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.549> only<00:04:10.730> thing<00:04:10.910> I<00:04:11.090> noticed

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
I wouldn't consider that glitch not

let<00:04:28.729> me<00:04:28.849> see<00:04:29.030> if<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.240> glitch<00:04:29.479> does<00:04:29.719> one<00:04:30.169> you

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
let me see if the glitch does one you

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.000 
let me see if the glitch does one you
know<00:04:31.669> I<00:04:32.060> don't<00:04:32.840> know<00:04:32.930> maybe<00:04:33.169> they<00:04:33.380> looked<00:04:33.800> at

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
know I don't know maybe they looked at

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.770 
know I don't know maybe they looked at
that<00:04:34.640> a<00:04:34.940> glitch<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:36.820> happens<00:04:37.820> often<00:04:38.120> but

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
that a glitch that happens often but

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.100 
that a glitch that happens often but
it's<00:04:39.110> avoidable<00:04:40.030> you<00:04:41.030> just<00:04:41.150> have<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.330> exit<00:04:41.960> the

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
it's avoidable you just have to exit the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.149 
it's avoidable you just have to exit the
app<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:42.500> then<00:04:42.620> open<00:04:43.070> it<00:04:43.159> again<00:04:43.870> pretty<00:04:44.870> simple

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:45.159 
app and then open it again pretty simple

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.680 
app and then open it again pretty simple
so<00:04:46.159> that's<00:04:46.430> been<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.789> it's<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.419> first

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
so that's been it it's the first

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:54.279 
so that's been it it's the first
hands-on<00:04:48.260> look<00:04:48.590> at<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:52.300> 4.3<00:04:53.300> rom<00:04:53.599> cyanogenmod

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289
