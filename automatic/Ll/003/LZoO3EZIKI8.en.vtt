00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.889
 good we are in these moments with 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.440
 victory we talked a little bit with 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.660
 she and victory are looking forward to 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.000
 make ripples but not ripple 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.070
 that was used a long time ago 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.680
 but with a very loose duration very 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.820
 natural to do this work we are going to 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.619
 use the typical plate cp 808 which is the 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.379
 rounder iron the one that is 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.660
 authentically half-finished and with high 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.449
 temperature on the outside has a 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.370
 very heavy hair and the secret to 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:44.079
 to be able to work on very heavy hair 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:47.079
 is to take very but very finite wicks in 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.239
 europe is called the work mix of 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.360
 extremely hair textures 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.879
 spaces with 10 or 12 wicks with one 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.680
 very, very natural duration 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.680
 let's see how the thing is 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.360
 let's apply 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.180
 and repeat them again 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.340
 more than the professional to the housewife or 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.130
 whoever needs the secret of 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.770
 a good duration is to take very very little 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.720
 hair like I want ripples of almost 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.240
 half to ends and you already have a hair 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:25.110
 heavy I will work directly to the root 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.600
 he turned around 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.600
 and I'm going slowly out 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.420
 always taking very little hair 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.620
 once I get to the tip 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.430
 my machine my iron is going to bend and 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.090
 I could do this job 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.880
 because the iron has a rotating cable 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.270
 once we gave it temperature from 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.850
 the root slowly we will go spinning 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.640
 until you have a supernatural ripple 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.850
 having heat rooted in tip we have 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.670
 a very natural fall six or seven 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.709
 wicks and we will do as they say in 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.720
 europe a mix of texture to hair is 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.850
 Extremely straight with hair 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.209
 extremely with movement we are going to 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.209
 to work 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.810
 little hair 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.650
 we turn 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.570
 this is a proposal 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.090
 ideal for very very young people like 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.500
 in this case victory 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.110
 we turn we turn we turn we arrive at the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.720
 root and we do not doubt we do not open but that 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.840
 we get up slowly corkscrew 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.569
 have a natural ripple 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.720
 important detail if I intend that the 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.269
 work I stay firm I'm going to the ar 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.780
 with very soft lacquer before doing the 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:04.590
 wick and we go to the ar with the bed is 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.510
 heavy thicker so that work I 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.319
 last at least a whole night in the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.319
 case of an event 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.640
 we take the wick we repeat the work 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.470
 we repeat the most important secret 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.890
 from work is to take very little hair 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.920
 is the thickness of the curler is the size 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.930
 of the iron 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.959
 even taking little hair I will have 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:41.900
 many doubts because the item that is going to 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.900
 to form is of the dimension of my plate 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.180
 we come to the root and slowly we go 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.180
 outside 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.329
 and so we continue 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.329
 let's go to the other sector 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.519
 to do a more dynamic job and 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.290
 We are going to work first on the 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.810
 left and then to the right 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.879
 we will continually go doing both 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.069
 laterals I'm going to work now in the 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.229
 left and the next wick for 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.120
 work on the right to have in 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.130
 both sides the same distance from 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.220
 wavy hair like hair 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.820
 lacios we repeat the technique we are going to 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.340
 root we take very little hair is 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.010
 important that the professional hairdresser 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.710
 or the housewife realizes that what 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.750
 gives the thickeness of the curler is the diameter 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.290
 of the iron and not the amount of 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.840
 hair that we take we turn around 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.570
 we rotate and how the range irons have 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:50.040
 internal and external temperature make us 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:52.200
 some wonderful loops 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.690
 we work on the left we go 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.150
 directly to the right and we continue 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.520
 is the only way to really have 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.710
 certainty that on the left we have 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.130
 the same number of loops we have 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.130
 on the right 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.680
 you are beautiful 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.420
 these were two proposals of the 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.330
 many that we are going to present from here to 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.720
 future we'll see you in a little while I still 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.720
 I'm not leaving
