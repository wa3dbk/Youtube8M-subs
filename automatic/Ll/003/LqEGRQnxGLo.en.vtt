don't look for either one of them

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.510 
don't look for either one of them
because<00:05:10.850> he<00:05:11.850> almost<00:05:12.000> cannot<00:05:12.450> find<00:05:12.780> them<00:05:13.520> I've

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
because he almost cannot find them I've

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.340 
because he almost cannot find them I've
looked<00:05:14.820> everywhere<00:05:14.910> for<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.510> lime<00:05:15.690> twist<00:05:15.930> it

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
looked everywhere for the lime twist it

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.890 
looked everywhere for the lime twist it
was<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.530> special<00:05:17.420> one<00:05:18.420> of<00:05:18.510> those<00:05:18.630> special

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
was a special one of those special

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.430 
was a special one of those special
editions<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:20.630> there's<00:05:21.630> just<00:05:21.900> nothing<00:05:22.290> that

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
editions and there's just nothing that

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.600 
editions and there's just nothing that
compares<00:05:22.590> to<00:05:23.190> it<00:05:23.400> i<00:05:23.930> bought<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.920> key<00:05:26.160> lime<00:05:26.340> pie

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
compares to it i bought the key lime pie

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.370 
compares to it i bought the key lime pie
i<00:05:26.640> think<00:05:27.060> it's<00:05:27.180> called<00:05:27.240> and<00:05:27.750> it's<00:05:27.810> not<00:05:28.230> the

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
i think it's called and it's not the

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.180 
i think it's called and it's not the
same<00:05:28.590> color<00:05:28.890> at<00:05:29.190> all<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:29.700> so<00:05:30.630> i<00:05:31.230> have<00:05:31.680> seen

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
same color at all and so i have seen

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.730 
same color at all and so i have seen
these<00:05:32.820> in<00:05:35.330> on<00:05:36.330> a<00:05:36.390> site<00:05:36.750> in<00:05:36.960> england<00:05:37.350> and<00:05:37.410> a<00:05:37.530> site

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
these in on a site in england and a site

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.680 
these in on a site in england and a site
in<00:05:37.860> Australia<00:05:38.340> but<00:05:38.460> it's<00:05:38.610> very<00:05:38.790> expensive<00:05:39.120> i'm

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
in Australia but it's very expensive i'm

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.740 
in Australia but it's very expensive i'm
probably<00:05:40.470> going<00:05:40.830> to<00:05:40.919> have<00:05:41.070> to<00:05:41.390> go<00:05:42.390> that<00:05:42.570> route

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
probably going to have to go that route

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.150 
probably going to have to go that route
there<00:05:43.020> because<00:05:43.260> i<00:05:43.290> can't<00:05:43.560> find<00:05:43.800> it<00:05:43.919> anywhere

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
there because i can't find it anywhere

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.960 
there because i can't find it anywhere
in<00:05:44.490> the<00:05:44.730> states<00:05:45.090> and<00:05:45.360> i<00:05:45.740> love<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.919> color<00:05:47.130> now

so anyway I did take the little catch
off<00:06:44.950> and<00:06:45.520> replace<00:06:46.300> it<00:06:46.330> with<00:06:46.540> this<00:06:46.870> tim<00:06:47.800> holtz

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
off and replace it with this tim holtz

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.100 
off and replace it with this tim holtz
keyhole<00:06:48.550> so<00:06:49.620> and<00:06:50.670> when<00:06:51.670> you<00:06:51.960> you<00:06:52.960> know<00:06:53.050> you

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
keyhole so and when you you know you

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.280 
keyhole so and when you you know you
can't<00:06:53.380> lift<00:06:54.100> it<00:06:54.250> by<00:06:54.460> that<00:06:54.670> so<00:06:54.940> you<00:06:55.720> just<00:06:55.960> lift

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.290 
can't lift it by that so you just lift

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.910 
can't lift it by that so you just lift
it<00:06:56.440> on<00:06:56.860> the<00:06:57.010> edges<00:06:57.460> and<00:06:58.590> and<00:06:59.590> then<00:06:59.740> when<00:06:59.830> you

00:06:59.910 --> 00:06:59.920 
it on the edges and and then when you

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.720 
it on the edges and and then when you
open<00:07:00.310> it<00:07:00.400> up<00:07:02.100> I've<00:07:03.100> got<00:07:03.310> another<00:07:03.610> little

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.730 
open it up I've got another little

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.880
