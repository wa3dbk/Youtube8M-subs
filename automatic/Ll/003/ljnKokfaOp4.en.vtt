00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:35.879 
that over this next year we can lay down

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.420 
that over this next year we can lay down
the<00:04:36.659> relationship<00:04:37.289> into<00:04:37.620> infrastructure<00:04:37.860> in

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
the relationship into infrastructure in

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.670 
the relationship into infrastructure in
the<00:04:38.580> city<00:04:38.849> and<00:04:39.090> around<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.659> nation<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:40.560> as

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
the city and around the nation that as

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.019 
the city and around the nation that as
we<00:04:40.800> would<00:04:40.979> do<00:04:41.099> this<00:04:41.279> next<00:04:41.460> fall<00:04:41.789> that<00:04:41.969> way

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:42.029 
we would do this next fall that way

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:45.140 
we would do this next fall that way
possibly<00:04:42.779> we<00:04:43.710> can<00:04:43.830> shift<00:04:44.039> inside<00:04:44.610> into<00:04:45.120> a

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
possibly we can shift inside into a

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.689 
possibly we can shift inside into a
building<00:04:45.569> somewhere<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.229> be<00:04:46.560> able<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.770> go<00:04:46.889> 365

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
building somewhere and be able to go 365

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.010 
building somewhere and be able to go 365
from<00:04:48.029> that<00:04:48.210> point<00:04:48.479> into<00:04:49.139> 2013<00:04:49.909> 2014<00:04:50.909> and<00:04:51.509> just

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
from that point into 2013 2014 and just

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.779 
from that point into 2013 2014 and just
to<00:04:52.110> keep<00:04:52.259> it<00:04:52.439> going<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:52.949> we<00:04:53.310> believe<00:04:53.610> that

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
to keep it going and we believe that

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.119 
to keep it going and we believe that
this<00:04:53.879> would<00:04:54.090> be<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.210> signpost<00:04:54.689> of<00:04:55.319> reformation

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
this would be a signpost of reformation

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.730 
this would be a signpost of reformation
in<00:04:56.669> America<00:04:57.210> that<00:04:57.779> the<00:04:57.900> capital<00:04:58.409> cities

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
in America that the capital cities

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.339 
in America that the capital cities
primary<00:04:59.279> destiny<00:04:59.909> would<00:05:00.300> be<00:05:00.449> free<00:05:00.750> formed

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
primary destiny would be free formed

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.350 
primary destiny would be free formed
that<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.009> first<00:05:02.310> destiny<00:05:02.849> would<00:05:03.000> be<00:05:03.120> on<00:05:03.240> the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
that the first destiny would be on the

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.879 
that the first destiny would be on the
city<00:05:03.629> that<00:05:03.840> we<00:05:03.930> would<00:05:04.050> gather<00:05:04.199> together<00:05:04.560> as

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
city that we would gather together as

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.860 
city that we would gather together as

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
tribes to praise the name of the Lord
