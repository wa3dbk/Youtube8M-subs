00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
together there's a certain neatness

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.650 
together there's a certain neatness
about<00:00:44.309> Sony<00:00:44.579> phones<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.270> other<00:00:45.420> companies

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
about Sony phones that other companies

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.600 
about Sony phones that other companies
are<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.260> able<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.829> bring<00:00:47.010> into<00:00:47.219> their<00:00:47.340> phones

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
are not able to bring into their phones

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.779 
are not able to bring into their phones
even<00:00:48.329> now<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.200> would<00:00:49.559> say<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.890> SL<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> good

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
even now so I would say the SL is a good

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.580 
even now so I would say the SL is a good
start<00:00:51.180> again<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.899> slightly<00:00:52.110> expensive

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
start again it's a slightly expensive

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.110 
start again it's a slightly expensive
phone<00:00:53.039> could<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.370> been<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> little<00:00:53.789> cheaper

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
phone could have been a little cheaper

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.569 
phone could have been a little cheaper
but<00:00:54.480> even<00:00:54.719> then<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.899> believe<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.160> better

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
but even then I believe it is a better

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.400 
but even then I believe it is a better
offering<00:00:57.030> than<00:00:57.210> others<00:00:57.480> then<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.050> course<00:00:58.079> an

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
offering than others then of course an

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.439 
offering than others then of course an
