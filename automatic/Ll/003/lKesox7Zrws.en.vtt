00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:06.410
 well dear friends we start with you 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.470
 new topic 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.160
 this topic are 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:16.090
 such a skirt that is in front of us 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.370
 pay attention we'll be with you 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.100
 build shuttlecocks as you see skirt she 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.100
 coming from the top right I'm a bit narrowed 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.820
 and at the bottom and here you are such 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.820
 very wide here is such a wide element 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.510
 which is called shuttlecocks and here 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.489
 note that the front half 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.370
 she's crazy about a little bit like that 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.610
 corner and the back half we will have 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.640
 absolutely robs like that 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.180
 goes on the front half and on the back 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.469
 but what are you doing? 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:58.450
 let's take at once a pattern-basis and 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:02.980
 front and back halves 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:06.760
 for what we take so that we 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:11.880
 it was immediately possible at the same time and there 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:18.100
 there to do some basting some 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:22.090
 from sediment but the assembly 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.630
 skirts look like it goes we should have 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.450
 on the sideline 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.590
 black with black must match 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:37.380
 fabric so I take a needle and stick it 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.380
 where my black cloth starts 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.490
 here you are driving in this place 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.759
 and I try to stick it with a needle 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.899
 another part where I also have black 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.240
 begins then I combine slices to 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.030
 they were the same and the needle 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.950
 already coming out on the other side completely 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.149
 you see 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.670
 of course so from this side too 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:10.210
 coincided and then when the needle will 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.540
 pass and sew god we will match 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.090
 absolutely everything if that's my unfolded and 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.569
 check see see the side seams 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.140
 here in this place they turn out smooth 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.750
 that is, it is done exactly the same way. 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:31.270
 the other side of the skirt that is the tank 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:34.690
 completely sewn on the bottom and in 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:39.760
 side god and let's sew one 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:43.959
 side and the other side and so here 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.050
 skirt sewn completely means I want you 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.590

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.410

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.180
