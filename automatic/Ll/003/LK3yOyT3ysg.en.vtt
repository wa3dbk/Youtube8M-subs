00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:38.700

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.140
 completely cuts off with help and livestock 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.629

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.440
 walked in here and completely open you all 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.590
 it will be easy to remove the enemy too well 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.789
 You can make a pass on this thus 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.590
 cut off help with connect or and and 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.850
 the enemy is leaving from the balcony and super 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.640
 how do you get up here 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.680
 this beam 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.520
 are turned on here here here 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.540
 there is such a white volochkova 2 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.540
 we will aim at her now 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.210
 so here it is our wand we lift up the sight 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.180
 a little higher and no step without it just 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.450
 when i'm moscow we calmly throw ours 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.240
 the balance is landing here sock is melted down 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.040
 I closed it myself 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.049
 review of these players reflected that 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.100
 shop down and what can climb here 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:41.250
 here but now we will fix this too 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.200
 so going here in this beam already 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.920
 further sit down now I will be the goal 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.380
 chain of our grenades hour forward 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.179
 this leaf 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.840
 closes it so look at it 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.100
 aim 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.009
 so he was small this beam so here 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.619
 sitting position and throw 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.110
 so an hour and a 4-core card further threw out 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.270
 no okay okay kin and here he is 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.700

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.710
 well and let me show a couple of throws the sunset 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.630
 from the most ordinary most simple 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:22.920
 let's say that's a throw that closes 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:26.520
 yamada and here that closes exit with 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.840
 box principle on it all was with you 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.070
