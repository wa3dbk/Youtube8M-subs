00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.700
 Hello 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.100
 Jokester, I'm going to do it today, I'm dying. 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.839
 before you start, stop telling 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.119
 here at the bottom of the video description you 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:22.300
 and all ingredients 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.789
 or to start making a drink. 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.499
 rite you will need a glass that 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.230
 He calls it a long drink, but the truth is. 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:31.480
 a glass fulfilled any there you 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.640
 need to put a few sheets of 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.470
 mint on the bottom of the cup 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.460
 so they are about six sheets 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.710
 of mint 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.170
 after that you need to put sugar 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.660
 are about two tablespoons of 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.180
 sugar you will need to put is 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.790
 I put half past two because I'm half 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.160
 ant some very sweet things but 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.660
 if you only put two if you do not 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.050
 You like very sweet thing, only two is the 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.050
 enough 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.730
 with the exception of lemon juice 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.250
 lemon squeezed fresh natural beauty 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.909
 will need three quarters of a 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.860
 measure lemon juice 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.800
 good rita type a caipirinha you have 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.450
 to love is so let the meantime 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.590
 I'll tell you where I learned to do it. 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.210
 beautiful, right? 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.270
 It's a Cuban drink but I've never been to 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.700
 cuba is still so I learned to do 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.790
 beautiful in spain algarve 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.740
 I went to live in Algarve because I was a 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.090
 The only place that was summer like me 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.500
 They said that they had enough jobs soon. 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.100
 I got there, I got a job in a 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.530
 Pub 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.659
 he recognizes a guy who worked in the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.740
 down to good people and now look for a 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.780
 place to live because at that time 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.460
 I was living in a monster. 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.350
 Then he came and told me that I was 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.150
 renting a room in his apartment 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.229
 which were totally fremil beach front 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.450
 sensational 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.119
 everything I ever wanted to live in front of 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.409
 to the sea and in the algarve is only to know the 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.090
 his apartment 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.450
 when I arrived it was really flat 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.310
 super cool a gun a huge window there 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.670
 suddenly the oil on the living room table here 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.530
 a strange thing a ham a piece 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.990
 ham of this size in the company a 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.920
 person dies a ham and does not 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.810
 bizarre, right? 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.310
 and of course everything in the house asked for ham 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.959
 Anyway, how many is not a good idea? 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.390
 leave a ham out of the refrigerator in the 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.250
 Heat is fine 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.860
 Anyway, I did not stay more than two days in the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.060
 apartment but the good part is that he 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.940
 taught to do the rite 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.620
 so everything has its good side with beauty 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.380
 then call know what's good 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.120
 important because this blend of mint 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.880
 like sugar and lemon 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.830
 if you put ice on the mosquito ice 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.569
 They talk to put crushed ice. 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.660
 You had a crushed ice machine . 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.150
 by super cool or more practical way and 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.100
 is to pick up a blender and 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.870
 to press 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.160
 Then you 'll do it until you get some 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.630
 of crushed ice will 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.480
 pebbles or keep problems at least 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.010
 externally 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.470
 You're using crushed ice, which is the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.630
 right 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.590
 then you take place more or less 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.450
 measured from a glass of a cup fulfilled 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.790
 ice and a few more pebbles 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.090
 You'll put it on and on if you 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.390
 Locking the blender has no problem 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.880
 to be continued 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.160
 you pull or access the big rocks 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.709
 shot that has already lasted was natural 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.959
 is doing this internally until the 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.200
 you get the right amount to 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.609
 fill this glass of crushed ice with 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.430
 pebbles without being 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.890
 good crushed / good crushed ice has 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.989
 a lemon the lemon juice sugar and 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.500
 high spearmint 1 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:36.170
 You have to put a measure of rum 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.440
 good to finish if you need tonic 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.299
 you can put some people make soda 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.660
 but I think it does not have to be too long 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.730
 Sweet is cool so you can put a 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.920
 measure and half of tonic if fit in the 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.540
 coconut you put fill in the truth 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.060
 but there's been a year and a half of 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.150
 tonic beauty the boy 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.590
 you take a spoon you have to 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:05.030
 mix some fucking 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.530
 finally it's getting underneath me it will be 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.269
 conquer on top then you get a 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.200
 Spoon stirs if you have those 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:14.780
 spoons fulfilled know best if you 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.320
 do not have a normal woman like me 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.560
 doing and that's what you have for today 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:26.960
 You need to taste your drink. 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:29.840
 I'm going to get a little ping pong for 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.190
 try to see if he's a 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.449
 just to know if he is 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.449
 Sugar is good , sugar. Good . 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.199
 fine 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:49.699
 Abandoned for bbb now let's go to 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.340
 to decorate 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.990
 You can decorate some people who decorate the 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.889
 body had already cut two slices of 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.050
 lemon 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.659
 because to make the lemon juice I already 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:07.520
 I enjoyed cutting some sad slices 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:10.490
 which places type of decoration of 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.930
 drink in resort that puts me so 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.419
 I think it's kind of tacky 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.129
 so I'd rather play inside the train 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.770
 that there is yes and then you put some 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:22.669
 nice little sheets like this from here 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:25.909
 I bought that I took the mint dodo 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:29.900
 you can put here in the middle or 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:32.719
 So beautiful and delicate little corner 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.909
 Ready your drink, let me take two. 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:37.939
 markets does not go away people talk 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:39.830
 two things first you want to ask 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:41.060
 Some brink has someone you want 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.860
