is

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
is

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.150 
is
ESV<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.330> English<00:00:21.750> standard<00:00:22.109> version<00:00:22.140> which<00:00:23.010> is

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
ESV is English standard version which is

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.560 
ESV is English standard version which is
a<00:00:23.189> little<00:00:23.460> bit<00:00:23.580> more<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.150> literal

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
a little bit more of a literal

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.450 
a little bit more of a literal
translation<00:00:24.600> than<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> King<00:00:25.740> James<00:00:25.980> Version

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
translation than the King James Version

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.160 
translation than the King James Version
but<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.210> little<00:00:27.420> bit<00:00:27.510> easier<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.779> read<00:00:28.050> as

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
but it's a little bit easier to read as

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.620 
but it's a little bit easier to read as
well<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.550> thought<00:00:29.880> it'd<00:00:30.000> be<00:00:30.029> nice<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.480> go<00:00:30.599> and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
well so I thought it'd be nice to go and

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.420 
well so I thought it'd be nice to go and
happen<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.199> unboxing<00:00:31.859> video

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
happen and the unboxing video

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.420 
happen and the unboxing video
so<00:00:33.000> without<00:00:33.600> further<00:00:33.750> ado<00:00:34.260> let's<00:00:34.950> get<00:00:35.070> started

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
so without further ado let's get started

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.869 
so without further ado let's get started
shall<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:37.670> pop<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.030> pocket<00:00:39.570> knife<00:00:39.690> here

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
standard Brown Bible which apparently is

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.690 
standard Brown Bible which apparently is
way<00:00:49.260> too<00:00:49.320> much<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.829> ask<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.219> unless<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.460> get

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
way too much to ask for unless you get

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.060 
way too much to ask for unless you get
lamb<00:00:50.940> skin<00:00:51.300> or<00:00:51.570> caps<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.469> all<00:00:52.559> extremely

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
expensive so I went ahead and I went

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.150

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
duotone which I don't think there's much

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.249 
duotone which I don't think there's much
of<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.710> difference<00:01:22.420> but<00:01:23.420> I<00:01:23.479> had<00:01:23.690> this<00:01:23.840> one<00:01:24.020> back

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
of a difference but I had this one back

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.770 
of a difference but I had this one back
in<00:01:24.470> seventh<00:01:24.950> grade<00:01:25.009> and<00:01:25.399> as<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:25.729> can<00:01:25.850> see<00:01:26.090> it

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
in seventh grade and as you can see it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.100 
in seventh grade and as you can see it
got<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.080> little<00:01:27.290> abuse<00:01:27.940> going<00:01:28.940> put<00:01:29.869> that<00:01:29.990> in

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
got a little abuse going put that in

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.600 
got a little abuse going put that in
there<00:01:30.290> so<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.470> guys<00:01:30.619> can<00:01:30.830> see<00:01:31.040> there's<00:01:31.490> really

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
there so you guys can see there's really

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.030 
there so you guys can see there's really
not<00:01:31.909> much<00:01:32.180> in<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.540> way<00:01:32.570> of<00:01:33.040> indentions

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
not much in the way of indentions

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.490 
not much in the way of indentions
there's<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:35.000> few<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.659> a<00:01:35.899> little<00:01:36.259> bit<00:01:36.380> of

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
there's a few and a little bit of

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.340 
there's a few and a little bit of
creasing<00:01:36.979> stuff<00:01:37.299> but<00:01:38.299> I<00:01:38.509> carried<00:01:38.899> around<00:01:38.960> my

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
creasing stuff but I carried around my

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.499 
creasing stuff but I carried around my
locker<00:01:39.800> on<00:01:40.160> my<00:01:40.340> back<00:01:40.580> is<00:01:40.789> a<00:01:40.820> junior<00:01:41.119> high<00:01:41.240> kid

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
locker on my back is a junior high kid

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.630 
locker on my back is a junior high kid
so<00:01:41.869> I<00:01:42.229> think<00:01:42.740> this<00:01:42.950> thing<00:01:43.130> held<00:01:43.369> up<00:01:43.490> pretty

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
so I think this thing held up pretty

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.580 
so I think this thing held up pretty
well<00:01:43.789> so<00:01:44.179> I'm<00:01:44.780> hoping<00:01:45.050> to<00:01:45.170> get<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.380> same

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590

remember<00:02:34.160> what<00:02:34.370> they're<00:02:34.519> about<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.090> think<00:02:35.390> it's

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
remember what they're about I think it's

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.090 
remember what they're about I think it's
about<00:02:35.630> like<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.930> ethics<00:02:36.320> of<00:02:36.410> Christianity

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
about like the ethics of Christianity

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.130 
about like the ethics of Christianity
and<00:02:37.250> stuff<00:02:37.489> but<00:02:38.180> they're<00:02:38.329> all<00:02:38.450> articles<00:02:38.840> I'm

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
and stuff but they're all articles I'm

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.259 
and stuff but they're all articles I'm
sure<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.410> could<00:02:39.560> find<00:02:39.709> online<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:40.910> figured

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
sure you could find online so I figured

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.420 
sure you could find online so I figured
that<00:02:41.299> it'd<00:02:41.510> be<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.660> lot<00:02:41.810> easier<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.260> better<00:02:42.859> to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
that it'd be a lot easier and better to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.930 
that it'd be a lot easier and better to
get<00:02:43.609> the<00:02:43.790> personal<00:02:44.239> size<00:02:44.450> which<00:02:45.440> is

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
get the personal size which is

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.420 
get the personal size which is
significantly<00:02:46.940> smaller<00:02:47.329> I<00:02:47.870> might<00:02:48.019> add<00:02:48.430> well

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
significantly smaller I might add well

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.759 
significantly smaller I might add well

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
you can see it's covered in a lot of

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.009 
you can see it's covered in a lot of

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
I'll have to do another jump cut to get

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.220 
I'll have to do another jump cut to get

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.060 
green which kind of looks like it may be
olive<00:03:03.049> but<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.320> looks<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.530> little<00:03:03.620> darker<00:03:04.040> in
