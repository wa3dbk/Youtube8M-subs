 seventeen years on the run 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.109
 nicolas cori jean-marie baudic mavounzy introduces us 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.189
 yes it's years of existence 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.279
 the age of reason for the waka chired band of seven roses 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.279
 and it's already time for remembrance 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.850
 thanks to three 6 3% gardens 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.100
 the actress did a lot of years 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.100
 that's why three guards from europe 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 after having to go through career picking 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.440
 in 17 years several generations have rubbed shoulders under the costumes that have 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.140
 makes the group's reputation 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.230
 exposed colored clothes that amazes again we knew how to manage it 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.380
 in September 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.860
 so why beauty is not so close 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.410
 the choregraphy 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.260
 then of course 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.930
 the water on the edges of the spree difference is the least that one 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.780
 can say 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.070
 the carnival federation of baster harris even dispatched his 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.170
 Vice President 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.340
 for this day excluded 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.250
 each leads his saga on the straight downstream 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.830
 and this year it's 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.520
 3 global market is positive 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.420
 with their share already their loved ones 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.400
 because that will be a competitor for me 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.070
 and then the carnival training is transforming itself already ready to launch 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.960
 to attack the streets of guadeloupe 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.119
 its annual theme also seems to have already been developed 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.329
 we still work on guadeloupe 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.189
 the hotel already defined a work already well if it will always be the way 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.909
 of water the jobs will be altered is to choreograph sport goes 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.929
 cross the vast case to him we are here is the bass in more ways than one 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.570
 which also proves that he 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.340
 the group matured is when another music organization solicits the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.760
 unpublished tributes with him 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.970
 here in this case 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.490

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.400
 to discover other types of music and could hide it was the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.429
 defeat we met with great pleasure from elsewhere 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.639
 it does not take more for European modern comedy 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:34.489
 and the instruments and the disturbances are visibly already well developed 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:40.049
