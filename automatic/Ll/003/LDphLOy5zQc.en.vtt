but still my hair just didn't have like
the<00:03:42.550> luster<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:43.420> usually<00:03:43.630> has<00:03:44.140> and

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
the luster that it usually has and

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.150 
the luster that it usually has and
looking<00:03:46.630> at<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.870> ingredients<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.739> realized

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
looking at the ingredients I realized

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.580 
looking at the ingredients I realized
that<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.550> has<00:03:48.760> dimethicone<00:03:49.390> in<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.080> I

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
that it has dimethicone in it and I

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.590 
that it has dimethicone in it and I
can't<00:03:51.010> recall<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.610> last<00:03:51.640> time<00:03:51.940> I<00:03:52.120> use<00:03:52.450> the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
and I'm pretty sure it's probably the

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.950 
and I'm pretty sure it's probably the
dimethicone<00:04:40.940> that<00:04:41.940> my<00:04:42.120> hair<00:04:42.330> does<00:04:42.480> not<00:04:42.510> react

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
long time and that's probably why that
