00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.160
 is that everyone knew swiss leap 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.570
 so we end up in the water today for the video that the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.569
 first donations as the tutorial 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.229
 he does not dictate to him 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:15.779
 so in fact simply its authors and have materials for 100 m 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.029
 dominique thormann plastic 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.589
 so that ashes go even source without needing to go get one 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:23.499
 contact 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.159
 that's all he does 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.289
 while what you need charges 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.310
 you need 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.329
 Germany remains fragmented 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.210
 and 1 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.770
 an open world 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.190
 you have to change something 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.220
 just that it's still opening 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.050
 mercury 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.140
 you make sure to download it edits the narrative however description 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.280
 so then you go to crisis folder chu assigned to afp 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.390
 I'm in great shape mitsubishi the world world 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.710
 alas we can see so 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.710
 so I'm going to do a little sorting 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.770
 and then we will keep 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.140
 but a map too many things magic 236 same neighborhood 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.800
 I also like it on the move 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.110
 preaching body of 65 reais plus four to fourteen so so well before seven 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.800
 punctuated the underground 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.810
 of the first life remains 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.810
 on a map 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.330
 will recover trash 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.570
 know that for all objects costs so that's the number of goals 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.820
 and at most 6,255 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.680
 you can not do more even if I'm bad 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.390
 % and 257 for example 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.230
 I arrive at 255 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.780
 and for example precise 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.070
 then this problem if I take the Europeans to take 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.320
 a color for example 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.000
 so I ask you to 55 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.160
 and in damages 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
 allow - and you put that women for example 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.579
 and that's less than three years 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.579
 32 26 years 57 record selections 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:16.409
 so frankly with that you have a little bit of a 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.629
 the three of his friends of our customers and what I did we have a better 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.249

 result a flying i'm under water 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.430
 normally you have one of the bubbles 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.529
 is 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.529
 and after 6% cibula francs the king 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:33.039
 it's a question for the title 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:37.019
 the vehicle all I read in parallel encryption is not thirsty 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.459
