bit of things that I uncovered so far
running<00:00:48.750> all<00:00:48.930> games<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.410> Windows<00:00:49.680> 8<00:00:49.890> when<00:00:50.550> all

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
running all games on Windows 8 when all

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.760 
running all games on Windows 8 when all
games<00:00:51.120> supports<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> software<00:00:52.170> renderer<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
games supports the software renderer and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.060 
games supports the software renderer and
hardware<00:00:53.309> renderer<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.480> includes<00:00:55.020> D<00:00:55.350> 3d<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
hardware renderer that includes D 3d and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.670 
hardware renderer that includes D 3d and
direct<00:00:56.460> draw<00:00:56.730> both<00:00:57.620> they<00:00:58.620> will<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.219> low<00:00:59.489> FPS

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
direct draw both they will have low FPS

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.910 
direct draw both they will have low FPS
because<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.890> DWM<00:01:02.579> dot<00:01:02.820> exe<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.920> embedded

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
because of DWM dot exe that is embedded

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.000 
because of DWM dot exe that is embedded
in<00:01:05.070> Windows<00:01:06.000> 8<00:01:06.240> themselves<00:01:07.110> okay<00:01:07.500> especially

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
in Windows 8 themselves okay especially

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.219 
in Windows 8 themselves okay especially
when<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> game<00:01:08.400> says<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.939> -<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.869> are<00:01:10.020> most

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
when the game says this - you are most

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.010 
when the game says this - you are most
likely<00:01:10.580> able<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.820> run<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> game<00:01:12.390> only<00:01:12.630> in

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
likely able to run the game only in

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.660 
likely able to run the game only in
software<00:01:13.500> renderer<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.220> better<00:01:14.430> performance

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
software renderer for better performance

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.730 
software renderer for better performance
because<00:01:15.420> when<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.720> run<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.290> treaty<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
because when you run in the treaty you

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.030 
because when you run in the treaty you
will<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.580> low<00:01:17.909> FPS<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:18.810> 25<00:01:19.350> frames<00:01:19.770> I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
will have a low FPS like 25 frames I

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.429 
will have a low FPS like 25 frames I

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
it in a sense of having the original

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.370 
it in a sense of having the original
aspect<00:04:35.920> ratio<00:04:36.250> of<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.730> game<00:04:37.060> but<00:04:37.900> because<00:04:38.230> I'm

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
aspect ratio of the game but because I'm

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.260

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
push the resolution a little bit further

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.470 
push the resolution a little bit further
than<00:04:43.150> 640<00:04:43.870> by<00:04:44.050> 480<00:04:44.590> so<00:04:45.550> here<00:04:45.820> I'm<00:04:45.970> trying<00:04:46.210> to
