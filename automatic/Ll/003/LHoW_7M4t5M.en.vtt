00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.920
 Hello everyone, the channel is without wires 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.350
 floated the topic of today's video tutorial 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.680
 why the phone does not see bluetooth 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.990
 headset well to phone 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.480
 saw a bluetooth headset here you need to 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:24.339
 first of all set up the phone itself 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.679
 no visibility mode to allow this phone 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:29.679
 could be paired with others 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:32.880
 devices for this we go into 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:35.620
 our settings 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.340
 android devices for example choose 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.680
 here bluetooth turn on him after 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.050
 how we turned on the device we should 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.020
 a window will appear in which we can 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.120
 enable visible mode when we have it 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.810
 turn on then we are starting to appear 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:57.070
 our phone icon is colored 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.690
 highlight the blue force there or 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.550
 maybe some other well that is not 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.360
 colorless colorless this is when the mode 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.070
 visibility is not active will not turn on after 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.450
 when you turn on visibility mode 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.079
 preferably also 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.200
 Going to the bluetooth settings that is 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.899
 pressing the function key 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.579
 touch and should appear here 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.890
 time visibility device used 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.689
 files so here choosing a visibility time you 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.170
 This is where the window opens 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.700
 be able to choose the timeout that is through 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.350
 two minutes past five on the best 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.539
 set never set half 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.140
 this way the device will always be 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.330
 in mode 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.320
 visibility for other devices and so 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:45.110
 if you have all set up and bluetooth 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.090
 the headset still does not show up 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.100
 and the phones are still not in sight yes then in 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.380
 In this case, you need to configure it yourself 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.820
 There is a bluetooth headset here 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.390
 an important point that you should know 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.659
 what is bluetooth headset if it is first 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.390
 Once it turns on, she herself enters 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.729
 pairing with another bluetooth 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.789
 devices for example with a phone 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.510
 smartphone and after she is already with 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:15.200
 him connected connected to him 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:19.660
 after that, this mode is already not 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.150
 turns on and even if you turn it off 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.239
 turn on this headset again 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.840
 this mode is not activated already for 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.340
 In order to activate it is necessary 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.820
 perform the following steps Well, how would 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.470
 the choice of action here still depends on 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.840
 what bluetooth headset which model 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.489
 which firm some 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.320
 bluetooth headset is special 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.720
 which key 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.390
 special button separate not that 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.489
 which includes a special button 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.269
 which activates this pairing mode 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.220
 and and accordingly found on the very here 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.459
 This bluetooth headset needs to find this 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.240
 button and press or sometimes some 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.830
 bluetooth manufacturers make 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.240
 as follows, they are a power button 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.670
 programmed in such a way that if her 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:14.140
 hold for a long time well for example 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.990
 for 10-15 seconds then in 10-15 seconds 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.180
 when you clamp this button 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.860
 bluetooth headset with 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.990
 this mode starts again 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.250
 mates when she looks again 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:31.210
 available phones and contacts them 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.400
 connects and detects and therefore 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:38.350
 in order to run this mode 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.600
 pairing need to press a button 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.450
 turn on and not just press and hold it 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.190
 keep her well no less than ten seconds in 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.450
 this moment must be carefully 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:53.980
 look at the LEDs that glow 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.540
 on bluetooth headset if device 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.580
 i.e. bluetooth headset entered 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.800
 the diode's mate mode can 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.050
 sparkle and well or blink or vice versa 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.170
 continuous burn i mean this again 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.700
 depends on model 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.700
 Nutuz device can also be like 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.190
 I may also need an indicator 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.560
 pairing code usually factory code 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.070
 for most bluetooth headsets it is 4 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.579
 0 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.310
 that is, you just have to smartphones 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.520
 enter this code 4 0 and after that 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.910
 device connects and you're ready for 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.250
 work, in principle, this was all with you 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.560
 channel without wires all the while and remember 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.949
 that any problem can be solved the main thing 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.949
 know how
