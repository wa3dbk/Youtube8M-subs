00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.970
 sat by natural 96 and today black 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.620
 ops 2 on hackett in the mode 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.780
 sniper and as I count tell 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.859
 you know what a sniper is 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.820
 I play on a map and that with 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.980
 different weapons 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.350
 they come every 45 seconds 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.380
 new and for every war the park 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.000
 so far 36 from then ten all points the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.949
 you make two times, and then there is the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.109
 times two bonus if you then dead since 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.690
 starts all over again to have the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.550
 weapons you get every 45 seconds 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.399
 new ones depending on another one here 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.079
 example, start the svf with the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.180
 magazine extension afterwards for example 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.120
 can do his thing with muffler and that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.370
 ac visier be so it is really random 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.969
 so what kind of weapons are there 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.550
 arrive 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.550
 and I have a twenty league here 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.050
 to opening for you then I die 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.910
 a bit but I would say for 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.100
 sniper that's just not 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.989
 so bad what I did here 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.850
 l play a lot lately 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.580
 sharpshooter and I'm up to you 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.100
 a series to start a live session 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.299
 just where I was just wager matches 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.549
 I think that is not enough 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.439
 uploaded all of this pdw swing 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.390
 Gebashe is nice and nice 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.100
 but a bit of a change 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.090
 I think it's also good and you 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.560
 really not even the same though 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.570
 same game but from the principle ago 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.159
 that is different but it is also 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.049
 not my topic at all and that is my new one 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.960
 topic my new headset is my topic 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:36.110
 that triton is icx 720 plus and that 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.210
 my role model was icx pro 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.579
 street or over broken it was broken 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.229
 the headset so the micro from 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.070
 hearts were put into it at that time 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.409
 something was broken 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.549
 and then the micro got plugged in 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.420
 do not think that worked 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:56.250
 Amazon herbaceous well and now I have 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.079
 the other than triton x200 720 is the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.149
 precursor and now there are the new ones 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.060
 hype with the one with the plus daughter 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.250
 background kicking plus with new design 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.710
 that looks really level out of everything but out 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.560
 plastic it means the chance that there what 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.680
 Brecht is higher 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.209
 it was clear and yet that was it 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.300
 headset one is also high quality one 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.250
 now also from ton and tonics pro plus 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.020
 has a real 5.1 sound I tell 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.090
 the same as a true 5.1 different 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.069
 went to the x200 720 kicker i say 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.360
 220 times that then he has the 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:35.390
 Coach street gigs 720 iks my plus 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.540
 has a digital one so a digital 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.750
 7 and fear, of course, the difference 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.160
 that per game on 5.11 nights means 1 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.810
 5 headphones speaker or four goods 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.299
 I believe as a man four speakers 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.049
 per ear shell left and right that 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.730
 fifth is just the dqs you have to 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.110
 imagine 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.390
 the apostles and plants and this 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.310
 headset in it and the recorder is the 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.470
 receiver 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:08.090
 so you have to imagine it so in 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.700
 that's the way it is and at one 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.430
 digital is just a speaker in 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.670
 an earcup but it comes out 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.750
 not a sound from a 7.1 sound 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:23.060
 or and here I die by the way 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.040
 at 20 10 by nuclear and 55 and 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.459
 deposit compared to 7.1 sound 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.420
 is clear when tomorrow 1 course 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.190
 more what is more boxing means more sound 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.980
 digital it is digital 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.870
 there one can one stands there all one and 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.010
 So you can be a constant and 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.239
 kick and alex prugh that's why I have 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.690
 that would not do and alex prugh anymore 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.970
 because there's this 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.069
 setting with the five speakers 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.170
 has the pro a left and right in it 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.470
 you can set separately that you can 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.209
 at 720 he is not there is only one 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.670
 loudspeaker is that means you can the 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.220
 Turn off the volume louder 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.560
 minutes and the gangster 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.040
 switch off and that 's it then enter 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.370
 it's all different because you can stop 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.160
 even the job center and how the 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.100
 other white white other two 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.709
 are called 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.420
 right back in the middle one 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.220
 Subwoofer for the bass of the many bugs 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.400
 is responsible you can all separately 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.770
 adjust can adjust the voice 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.780
 and so the voice reverberates mostly 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.210
 always from the middle stop also left 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.800
 and right and that can be individually 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.000
 what a clearer course 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.610
 advantage is but I suffer from one 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.780
 red-green colors weakness that is can 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.180
 so some colors do not recognize so well 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.770
 as well as you the non-families in the name 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.000
 farbblind but farbblind responsible 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.190
 Sometimes people can even take the flags 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.420
 not see so black so I 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.890
 I'm still an edgar wallace film 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.480
 stopped if you do not know 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.900
 what you want is just click 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.420
 recommend old crime series films such as the 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.120
 frog with the mask or dexter good 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.650
 movies right like more old movies than 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.240
 rather after my birth 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:09.700
 come out is just like that 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:11.410
 well 56 prosthetics 720 everything in the plus 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.480
 I can really change both of you 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.470
 only recommend tektronix pro costs but 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.600
 20 euros more 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.260
 170 euro if I am not mistaken or 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.110
 180 then 30 euros more because that's what 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.090
 I have the 720 he costs 150 euro 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.680
 and if you liked it and if 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.700
 you have a headset what I have 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.470
 or had 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.630
 then just write in to see if it is you 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.740
 has like whether they liked the video 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.330
 that writes you regret the same 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.680
 Comments are there for you 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.020
 really liked gives the thumb 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.190
 high and I say bye and one more 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.190
 Happy new year
