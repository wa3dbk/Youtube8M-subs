okay<00:00:05.250> we're<00:00:05.430> at<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.640> drill<00:00:05.850> press<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.150> we're

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
okay we're at the drill press and we're

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.680 
okay we're at the drill press and we're
getting<00:00:06.629> ready<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:07.639> remove<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.820> material<00:00:09.480> for

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
getting ready to remove the material for

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.959 
getting ready to remove the material for
our<00:00:09.719> mortise<00:00:10.200> we've<00:00:10.410> marked<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.740> out<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
our mortise we've marked it out and the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.759 
our mortise we've marked it out and the
one<00:00:12.120> thing<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.450> want<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.719> set<00:00:12.960> here<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.440> um

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
one thing you want to set here is um

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.240 
one thing you want to set here is um
first<00:00:14.580> get<00:00:15.000> our<00:00:15.650> Forstner<00:00:16.650> bit<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.920> here<00:00:17.100> where

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
first get our Forstner bit in here where

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.920 
first get our Forstner bit in here where
Forstner<00:00:17.670> bit<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> drill<00:00:18.300> bit<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.600> creates

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
Forstner bit is a drill bit that creates

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.720 
Forstner bit is a drill bit that creates
a<00:00:18.990> flat<00:00:19.199> bottom<00:00:19.410> straight<00:00:19.770> side<00:00:20.010> hole<00:00:20.279> and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
a flat bottom straight side hole and

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.640 
a flat bottom straight side hole and
that's<00:00:21.180> perfect<00:00:21.539> for<00:00:21.660> making<00:00:21.750> mortises<00:00:22.350> and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
that's perfect for making mortises and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.980 
that's perfect for making mortises and
so<00:00:23.130> we've<00:00:23.609> got<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.000> its<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.330> half<00:00:24.510> inch<00:00:24.750> bit

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
so we've got that in its a half inch bit

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.660 
so we've got that in its a half inch bit
the<00:00:25.859> other<00:00:25.980> thing<00:00:26.189> we're<00:00:26.310> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.490> want<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the other thing we're going to want to

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.490 
the other thing we're going to want to
set<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> depth<00:00:27.750> stop<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.349> only

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
set is that is a depth stop so we only

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.679 
set is that is a depth stop so we only
go<00:00:28.680> down<00:00:28.920> as<00:00:29.279> far<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.060> need<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
go down as far as we need to and on a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.269 
go down as far as we need to and on a
drill<00:00:31.170> press<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.410> usually<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> way<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
drill press you usually have a way to

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.130 
drill press you usually have a way to
force<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.120> drill<00:00:33.390> press<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.719> stop<00:00:33.930> at<00:00:34.079> a

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
force the drill press to stop at a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.569 
force the drill press to stop at a
certain<00:00:34.290> point<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.680> that's<00:00:34.829> what<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.280> so

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
certain point and that's what this is so

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.940 
certain point and that's what this is so
I've<00:00:35.820> set<00:00:36.090> these<00:00:36.239> nuts<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.829> they're

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
I've set these nuts so that they're

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.220 
I've set these nuts so that they're
going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> stop<00:00:38.430> right<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.329> line<00:00:39.510> down

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
going to stop right on the line down

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.200 
going to stop right on the line down
here<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.710> I've<00:00:40.829> marked<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.430> represents

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
here that I've marked that represents

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.209 
here that I've marked that represents
the<00:00:42.329> depth<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.870> our<00:00:43.200> 10<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.770> then<00:00:43.860> how<00:00:44.010> far

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the depth of our 10 and then how far

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.860 
the depth of our 10 and then how far
it's<00:00:44.340> going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.520> go<00:00:44.610> down<00:00:44.789> now<00:00:45.420> one<00:00:45.600> thing<00:00:45.750> with

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
it's going to go down now one thing with

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.540 
it's going to go down now one thing with
mortises<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.260> Tenon's<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:47.010> want<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.370> leave<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
mortises and Tenon's you want to leave a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.610 
mortises and Tenon's you want to leave a
little<00:00:47.879> extra<00:00:48.239> room<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> bottom<00:00:49.050> for<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
little extra room at the bottom for the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.950 
little extra room at the bottom for the
glue<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.829> collect<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.820> we'll<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.210> will<00:00:51.870> be

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
glue to collect so we'll be will be

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.450 
glue to collect so we'll be will be
doing<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.379> as<00:00:52.559> well<00:00:52.739> we're<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.340> little

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
doing that as well we're going a little

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.209 
doing that as well we're going a little
deeper<00:00:53.850> than<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.840> Tenon's<00:00:55.230> actual<00:00:55.980> length

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
deeper than the Tenon's actual length

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.479 
deeper than the Tenon's actual length
but<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.940> should<00:00:57.149> cover<00:00:57.449> us<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.199> depth

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
but that should cover us with the depth

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.250 
but that should cover us with the depth
now<00:00:59.489> we're<00:00:59.670> ready<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> drill<00:01:00.149> when<00:01:01.140> you're

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.090 
so you get down to your bottom there we
go<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:52.450> one<00:01:52.660> side<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.680> will<00:01:53.860> do<00:01:53.950> the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
go that's one side that will do the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:07.320 
go that's one side that will do the
other

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.440 

okay

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.050 

now<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:10.990> can<00:02:11.349> get<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.650> rest<00:02:11.800> of<00:02:12.069> this<00:02:12.190> out<00:02:12.400> just

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
now I can get the rest of this out just

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:24.990 
now I can get the rest of this out just
by<00:02:13.180> going<00:02:13.330> through<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.780> middle

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.450 

it's<00:02:25.420> not<00:02:25.600> much<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.990> grab<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.250> drill

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
it's not much to grab on to so the drill

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.760 
it's not much to grab on to so the drill
press<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:28.090> bid<00:02:28.870> are<00:02:29.020> going<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.200> move<00:02:29.320> around<00:02:29.470> a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
press and bid are going to move around a

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.900 
press and bid are going to move around a
little<00:02:29.890> bit<00:02:30.010> that's<00:02:30.790> okay<00:02:31.560> okay<00:02:32.910> we've

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
little bit that's okay okay we've

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.670 
little bit that's okay okay we've
roughed<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.330> out<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:37.570> that's<00:02:38.230> what<00:02:38.410> we<00:02:38.500> have

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
roughed it out and that's what we have

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.800 
roughed it out and that's what we have
to<00:02:38.800> work<00:02:38.980> with<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:39.700> now<00:02:39.880> we<00:02:39.940> can<00:02:40.240> square<00:02:40.570> this

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
to work with so now we can square this

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.230 
to work with so now we can square this
out<00:02:41.020> using<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.800> using<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.670> chisels

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
out using the using the chisels

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.240 
out using the using the chisels
okay<00:02:44.080> now<00:02:44.230> we're<00:02:44.410> making<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.800> tenon<00:02:45.130> and

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
okay now we're making the tenon and

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.040 
okay now we're making the tenon and
we're<00:02:45.370> using<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.760> table<00:02:46.090> saw<00:02:46.120> with<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.720> set<00:02:47.020> of

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
we're using the table saw with a set of

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.950 
we're using the table saw with a set of
dado<00:02:47.380> blades<00:02:47.770> on<00:02:48.040> here<00:02:48.250> dado<00:02:48.790> blades<00:02:49.150> are<00:02:49.570> set

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
dado blades on here dado blades are set

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.930 
dado blades on here dado blades are set
of<00:02:50.080> blades<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.560> stack<00:02:50.890> up<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.790> make

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
of blades that you stack up and to make

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.400 
of blades that you stack up and to make
a<00:02:51.970> very<00:02:52.210> thick<00:02:52.540> cutting<00:02:52.960> blade<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.290> will

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
a very thick cutting blade that will

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.070 
a very thick cutting blade that will
lose<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.620> lot<00:02:53.800> of<00:02:53.830> material<00:02:54.280> at<00:02:54.370> once<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:55.080> it

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
lose a lot of material at once and it

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.110 
lose a lot of material at once and it
makes<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.560> table<00:02:56.830> saw<00:02:56.980> actually<00:02:57.610> capable<00:02:58.000> of

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
makes the table saw actually capable of

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.370 
makes the table saw actually capable of
doing<00:02:58.300> all<00:02:58.420> kinds<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.780> different<00:02:58.959> jointer

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
doing all kinds of different jointer

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.860 
doing all kinds of different jointer
including<00:02:59.860> making<00:03:00.340> Tenon's<00:03:00.820> very<00:03:01.000> easily<00:03:01.150> so

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
including making Tenon's very easily so

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.120 
including making Tenon's very easily so
there's<00:03:02.050> a<00:03:02.080> couple<00:03:02.320> steps<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.740> setting<00:03:02.950> this

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
there's a couple steps to setting this

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.590 
there's a couple steps to setting this
up<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.459> first<00:03:03.670> one<00:03:03.910> is<00:03:04.030> we've<00:03:04.150> got<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.390> get<00:03:04.480> the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
up the first one is we've got to get the

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.210 
up the first one is we've got to get the
saw<00:03:04.780> blade<00:03:05.050> at<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.230> right<00:03:05.470> height<00:03:05.680> now<00:03:06.040> we're

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
saw blade at the right height now we're

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.010 
saw blade at the right height now we're
going<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.400> be<00:03:06.520> passing<00:03:07.060> this<00:03:07.420> piece<00:03:07.690> of<00:03:07.870> wood

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
going to be passing this piece of wood

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.590 
going to be passing this piece of wood
over<00:03:08.050> top<00:03:08.470> of<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.830> data<00:03:08.980> blades<00:03:09.250> like<00:03:09.459> that<00:03:09.670> so

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
over top of the data blades like that so

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.910 
over top of the data blades like that so
that<00:03:10.690> means<00:03:10.900> we<00:03:11.020> have<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.320> set<00:03:11.560> our<00:03:11.680> blade

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
that means we have to set our blade

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.480 
that means we have to set our blade
height<00:03:12.190> such<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:13.060> we<00:03:13.510> capture<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:15.310> height

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
height such that we capture the height

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.620 
height such that we capture the height
of<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.470> tenon<00:03:17.470> with<00:03:18.370> table<00:03:19.090> saw<00:03:19.209> blades<00:03:19.480> yet

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
of the tenon with table saw blades yet

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.000 
of the tenon with table saw blades yet
to<00:03:19.720> be<00:03:19.840> careful<00:03:20.110> you<00:03:20.230> want<00:03:20.740> to<00:03:20.800> be<00:03:20.860> at<00:03:20.920> the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
to be careful you want to be at the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.040 
to be careful you want to be at the
maximum<00:03:21.220> height<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.970> that<00:03:22.120> arc<00:03:22.360> when<00:03:22.870> you're

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
maximum height of that arc when you're

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.500 
maximum height of that arc when you're
checking<00:03:23.260> here<00:03:23.709> and<00:03:24.610> I'm<00:03:24.760> just<00:03:25.090> lowering<00:03:25.420> the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
checking here and I'm just lowering the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.720 
checking here and I'm just lowering the
blade<00:03:25.720> now<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.200> little<00:03:26.980> bit<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.220> eyeballing

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
blade now a little bit of eyeballing

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.310 
blade now a little bit of eyeballing
here<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:28.150> one<00:03:28.720> of<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.900> things<00:03:29.080> when<00:03:29.230> you

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
here and one of the things when you

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.660 
here and one of the things when you
eyeball<00:03:29.680> measurements<00:03:30.130> like<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.430> is<00:03:30.580> you

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
eyeball measurements like this is you

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.979 
eyeball measurements like this is you
should<00:03:30.850> always<00:03:31.030> run<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.420> piece<00:03:31.600> of<00:03:31.630> scrap

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
should always run a piece of scrap

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.410 
should always run a piece of scrap
through<00:03:32.290> first<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.890> check<00:03:33.010> your<00:03:33.519> check<00:03:34.300> your

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
through first and check your check your

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.150 
through first and check your check your
setup<00:03:34.780> before<00:03:35.320> you<00:03:35.410> work<00:03:35.590> on<00:03:35.739> your<00:03:35.830> actual

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
setup before you work on your actual

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.509 
setup before you work on your actual
pieces<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:36.850> we've<00:03:37.360> got<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.690> height<00:03:37.840> set<00:03:38.519> now

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
pieces so we've got the height set now

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.840 
around evenly cut all the way around on
this<00:03:55.840> piece<00:03:56.049> of<00:03:56.080> wood<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.650> so<00:03:57.370> we're<00:03:57.700> going<00:03:57.790> to

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
this piece of wood and so we're going to

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.210 
this piece of wood and so we're going to
have<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.120> find<00:03:58.330> a<00:03:58.420> way<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.600> make<00:03:59.260> that<00:03:59.530> cuts<00:03:59.830> in

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
have to find a way to make that cuts in

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.009 
have to find a way to make that cuts in
the<00:04:00.340> same<00:04:00.519> place<00:04:00.790> every<00:04:01.030> single<00:04:01.450> time<00:04:01.810> we're

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
the same place every single time we're

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.810 
the same place every single time we're
doing<00:04:02.110> this<00:04:02.290> for<00:04:02.590> this<00:04:02.860> cut<00:04:03.070> four<00:04:03.310> times<00:04:03.580> on

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
doing this for this cut four times on

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.970 
doing this for this cut four times on
this<00:04:03.940> piece<00:04:04.120> of<00:04:04.269> wood<00:04:04.420> so<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.260> way<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.470> do<00:04:05.830> that

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
this piece of wood so the way to do that

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.770 
this piece of wood so the way to do that
in<00:04:06.220> woodworking<00:04:06.519> on<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:06.970> table<00:04:07.209> saw<00:04:07.330> is<00:04:07.540> to

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
in woodworking on the table saw is to

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.750 
in woodworking on the table saw is to
use<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.959> stop<00:04:08.290> block<00:04:08.470> now<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:09.010> stop<00:04:09.340> block<00:04:09.489> is

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
use a stop block now a stop block is

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.190 
use a stop block now a stop block is
just<00:04:09.970> basically<00:04:10.330> a<00:04:10.450> piece<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.840> wood<00:04:11.019> that<00:04:11.049> you

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
just basically a piece of wood that you

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.110 
just basically a piece of wood that you
push<00:04:11.440> up<00:04:11.590> against<00:04:12.010> every<00:04:12.640> time<00:04:12.820> you<00:04:12.940> make<00:04:13.090> a

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
push up against every time you make a

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.030 
push up against every time you make a
cut<00:04:13.360> so<00:04:13.810> that<00:04:13.959> you're<00:04:14.080> in<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.290> same<00:04:14.470> place<00:04:14.709> now

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
cut so that you're in the same place now

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.099 
cut so that you're in the same place now
if<00:04:15.160> I<00:04:15.250> rotate<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.790> round<00:04:15.970> I<00:04:16.209> can<00:04:16.810> bump<00:04:17.019> up

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
if I rotate the round I can bump up

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.800 
if I rotate the round I can bump up
against<00:04:17.410> it<00:04:17.530> again<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:18.010> make<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.220> same<00:04:18.430> cut

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
against it again and make the same cut

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.110 
against it again and make the same cut
so<00:04:19.810> I'm<00:04:20.049> lining<00:04:20.320> up<00:04:20.530> that<00:04:20.799> pencil<00:04:21.190> net<00:04:21.370> with

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
so I'm lining up that pencil net with

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.240 
so I'm lining up that pencil net with
the<00:04:22.240> outside<00:04:22.630> edge<00:04:22.780> of<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:22.990> blade<00:04:23.250> just

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
the outside edge of the blade just

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.880 
the outside edge of the blade just
looking<00:04:24.580> down<00:04:24.790> on<00:04:24.940> top<00:04:25.150> of<00:04:25.180> it<00:04:25.560> getting<00:04:26.560> it<00:04:26.650> set

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
looking down on top of it getting it set

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.420 
looking down on top of it getting it set
up<00:04:27.010> right<00:04:27.479> up<00:04:28.479> against<00:04:28.720> there<00:04:28.990> okay<00:04:29.919> now<00:04:30.160> with

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
up right up against there okay now with

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.640 
up right up against there okay now with
that<00:04:30.580> in<00:04:30.820> place<00:04:30.940> I'm<00:04:31.240> going<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.419> hold<00:04:31.570> that<00:04:31.660> I'm

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
that in place I'm going to hold that I'm

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.950 
that in place I'm going to hold that I'm
going<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:32.830> bring<00:04:32.979> the<00:04:33.130> fence<00:04:33.340> over

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
going to bring the fence over

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.870 
going to bring the fence over
tap<00:04:35.680> it<00:04:35.830> up<00:04:35.919> against<00:04:36.190> there<00:04:36.430> with<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.669> Block

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
tap it up against there with the Block

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.640 
tap it up against there with the Block
in<00:04:37.060> place<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.569> blocks<00:04:37.780> not<00:04:37.960> going<00:04:38.169> to<00:04:38.259> be<00:04:38.380> here

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
in place the blocks not going to be here

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.960 
in place the blocks not going to be here
but<00:04:38.770> I'm<00:04:38.889> just<00:04:39.069> setting<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.430> fence<00:04:39.639> with<00:04:39.850> it

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
but I'm just setting the fence with it

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.840 
but I'm just setting the fence with it
there<00:04:40.150> now<00:04:40.810> I'll<00:04:40.930> lock<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.110> fence<00:04:41.440> down<00:04:41.819> now<00:04:42.819> I

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
there now I'll lock the fence down now I

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.059 
there now I'll lock the fence down now I
can<00:04:43.090> take<00:04:43.240> out<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.509> blog<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:44.650> put<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:44.949> back

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
can take out the blog and put it back

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.900 
can take out the blog and put it back
here<00:04:45.310> somewhere<00:04:45.669> in<00:04:45.759> a<00:04:45.849> safe<00:04:46.030> place<00:04:47.819> so<00:04:48.819> I'm

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
here somewhere in a safe place so I'm

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.550 
here somewhere in a safe place so I'm
going<00:04:49.060> to<00:04:49.120> clamp<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.870> block<00:04:50.080> to<00:04:50.259> the<00:04:50.289> fence

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
going to clamp the block to the fence

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.710 
going to clamp the block to the fence
back<00:04:50.800> here<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:51.729> now<00:04:51.849> when<00:04:52.030> I<00:04:52.060> bump<00:04:52.270> up<00:04:52.360> against

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
back here so now when I bump up against

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.480 
back here so now when I bump up against
that<00:04:52.810> block<00:04:53.050> I'll<00:04:53.470> be<00:04:53.710> in<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.889> right<00:04:54.009> place<00:04:54.220> to

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
that block I'll be in the right place to

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:30.920 
that block I'll be in the right place to
make<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.729> cut

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:06:16.210 

now<00:05:31.470> we<00:05:31.530> don't<00:05:31.710> need<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:31.979> block<00:05:32.160> anymore

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:22.969 

and<00:06:17.220> there's<00:06:17.430> our<00:06:17.610> tenon<00:06:21.290> and<00:06:22.290> I<00:06:22.350> just<00:06:22.590> chopped

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
and there's our tenon and I just chopped

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.029 
and there's our tenon and I just chopped
these<00:06:23.160> out<00:06:23.430> real<00:06:23.669> quick<00:06:24.470> using<00:06:25.470> a<00:06:25.530> couple<00:06:25.770> of

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
these out real quick using a couple of

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:32.960 
these out real quick using a couple of
bench<00:06:26.940> chisels<00:06:31.250> so<00:06:32.250> we<00:06:32.370> have<00:06:32.490> to<00:06:32.580> go<00:06:32.669> down<00:06:32.820> the

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
bench chisels so we have to go down the

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.110 
bench chisels so we have to go down the
hole<00:06:33.150> depth<00:06:33.539> of<00:06:33.690> the<00:06:33.750> mortise<00:06:34.699> but<00:06:35.699> it's<00:06:35.880> not<00:06:36.090> a

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
hole depth of the mortise but it's not a

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.969 
hole depth of the mortise but it's not a
really<00:06:36.870> a<00:06:36.900> good<00:06:37.080> idea<00:06:37.110> to<00:06:37.560> go<00:06:37.650> all<00:06:37.830> the<00:06:37.860> way

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 
really a good idea to go all the way

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.159 
really a good idea to go all the way
down<00:06:38.220> with<00:06:38.430> these<00:06:38.580> bench<00:06:38.820> chisels<00:06:39.060> they<00:06:40.020> don't

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
down with these bench chisels they don't

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.749 
down with these bench chisels they don't
have<00:06:40.289> enough<00:06:40.530> thickness<00:06:41.009> like<00:06:41.280> a<00:06:41.340> real

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 
have enough thickness like a real

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.730 
have enough thickness like a real
mortising<00:06:42.270> chisel<00:06:42.600> wood<00:06:42.780> to<00:06:43.229> get<00:06:43.440> the<00:06:43.500> whole

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
mortising chisel wood to get the whole

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.800 
mortising chisel wood to get the whole
depth<00:06:43.949> out<00:06:44.100> at<00:06:44.250> once<00:06:44.460> so<00:06:45.270> we're<00:06:45.419> just<00:06:45.449> going<00:06:45.720> to

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
depth out at once so we're just going to

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.650 
depth out at once so we're just going to
go<00:06:46.440> gradually<00:06:46.979> and<00:06:47.370> get<00:06:47.910> the<00:06:48.030> material<00:06:48.150> remove

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 
go gradually and get the material remove

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.200 
go gradually and get the material remove
it<00:06:51.919> all<00:06:52.919> right<00:06:53.190> we're<00:06:53.520> almost<00:06:53.639> down<00:06:53.970> to<00:06:54.030> the

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
it all right we're almost down to the

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.150 
it all right we're almost down to the
bottom<00:06:55.220> get<00:06:56.220> the<00:06:56.340> waste<00:06:56.550> out<00:06:57.199> and<00:06:58.199> a<00:06:59.010> little

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
bottom get the waste out and a little

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.510 
bottom get the waste out and a little
more<00:06:59.370> cleanup<00:06:59.639> and<00:06:59.970> we'll<00:07:00.090> be<00:07:00.210> done<00:07:01.370> there<00:07:02.370> we

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
more cleanup and we'll be done there we

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.670 
more cleanup and we'll be done there we
go
