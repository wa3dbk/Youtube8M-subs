00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.830
 I am in a very special place 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.899
 with all shrugs 

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:11.149
 he is on the rope 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.289
 al assad is refusing 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.320
 everything and everyone is about the construction of the human body 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.020
 so another thom as i know everything about the human body i know everything 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.189
 from the body to the outside for all can the inside 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.890
 but also inside the body you look i know exactly what is there 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.579
 sit 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.649
 how it runs feyenoord and what it does 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.929
 and that knowledge holds not only for myself because an important task 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:37.440
 I am not teaching yellow for learners 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.580
 to students who are going to be doctors 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.390
 I also give a lot of essential backs if your back needs surgery 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.280
 the body 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.700
 so still have a very good knowledge for the construction of the human body 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.500
 and there we are actually here 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.140
 we are here in our museum the anatomical museum and it is always like that 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.030
 save sea in knows a whole 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.630
 special collection of objects 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.940
 we are all objects that say something about human construction 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.590
 and some objects quickly largest property are some new some objects they 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.280
 real comes from real pieces of human but say 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.350
 and other objects are counterfeit today made from bass hoof 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.020
 made of plastic 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.920
 they are real here 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.060
 g that such from real people yes founded skulls real people real 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.850
 heart and kidneys 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.760
 everything else everything human body 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.510
 how does the human body actually work 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.930
 so very complicated sides talk about it for hours but it could also be that way 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.140
 The human body can perform many functions 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.880
 and the Stapelstraat very much sadden you even if it is not even 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.230
 necessary 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.200
 our arms and legs take as an example 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.400
 if transport movements can tackle something better 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.530
 that is only possible if the bones are in those arms and legs 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.970
 with that fine giving and firmness otherwise you are well put together like a pudding 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.880
 but that bone can also move sometimes arms and legs can finally 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.580
 movement and the kospi index peaked to indicate that movement development 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.250
 scavenger cartoon 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.970
 the head or example also has the bones 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.679
 and the skull of the skull is just a very important protection 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.810
 for the brain it is a very important task for coming 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.499
 and all this very well protected 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:17.810
 so if I understand correctly, all organs are protected 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.880
 a lot of what other has an important role we are going to be 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.719
 for example heart and lungs 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.769
 and are protected in the chest 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.859
 artis a pump that carries blues throughout the body so that means 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.999
 it could be a food source woman 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:36.589
 and the lungs that cause oxygen to enter the blood, the oxygen 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.079
 which also requires all organs 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.199
 in the western organ which is not actually protected and that is very strange 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.940
 maybe just the largest organ 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.949
 we have skin in our body 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:49.459
 spector from very large 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.280
 and the skin itself on the outside not protected but the skin 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.479
 protect yourself six times a player 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:58.819
 because it is a very good barrier against harmful substances 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:01.129
 and against bacteria 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.689
 it is a very important body house 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.739
 also a dirty drying from the inside is all a bit 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.269
 moderately bloody 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.369
 on the outside his argument 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:13.509
 Well, of course, that is not for nothing 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:17.759
 the body read everything in the book all over the world and a good first aid too 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.799
 being able to grant I think it is important that you know something about the human 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:20.889
 body
