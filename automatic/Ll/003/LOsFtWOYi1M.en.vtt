00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.030
 I started with the mess tin to wash 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.730
 cups and then little by little I have 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.070
 started to become familiar with the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.809
 machine expressed with all the world that 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.250
 behind it is the souvenir desk that 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.160
 the first time I played at 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.529
 morning and I often couldn't get away 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.320
 the group from the car was 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.859
 the beginning was mine my beginning 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.319
 however, with the car machine has 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:35.590
 started to become familiar with 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:38.230
 all the rest but if you do 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.040
 a blend composed of varieties of 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.600
 arabica coffee 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.059
 how do you manage to transmit to the customer a 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.750
 let him understand that that this coffee over 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.820
 because it was done by you 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.160
 something different that must be 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.420
 tasted not only drunk 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.089
 sometimes 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.240
 I find myself explaining the difference between the 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.420
 our brand 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.210
 other mixtures I explain that being a 100 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.650
 for 100 arabica obviously a rate of 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.720
 understand lower attitude in 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:14.920
 comparison to other mixtures of course 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.420
 even a little less like the hand of one 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.850
 amount of double essential oils 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.710
 compared to other michelle e 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.530
 so the taste explosions why 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.110
 you will have once tasted the first 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.990
 sip will be longer over time you will 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.990
 savor it a little bit longer 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.970
 of dream 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.310
 a motorcycle trip 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.820
 maybe in a warm country like Africa 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.460
 being able to visit the areas even where it is 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.380
 he is brewed coffee where it is 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.940
 cultivated so that we can understand better 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.220
 what is the product that 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.000
 and then in the end work all the work 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.390
 days 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.610
 and I imagine myself coming back from this 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.820
 travel with 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.640
 a wealth of experience of sensations 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.920
 being able to tell what's behind that 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.920
 that coffee the sensations all 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.680
 travel 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.480
 who made up the cup 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.480
 get up to arrive at the counter
