00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.699
 hi my name is danil love today 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.680
 I would like to talk not on such 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.539
 fun topic up 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.680
 it turns out in this world exists and 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.080
 sad themes 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.050
 but you know they should cost because 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.739
 amid their funny themes it becomes even 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.770
 more cream is not super except doubly 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.829
 ebb and yes so I am with you today 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.420
 I'll talk on a sad subject literally 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.149
 I recently learned from the one group 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.760
 direction went for and malik and you know 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.210
 honestly i'm not a big fan of van 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.940
 den but i listened to their music listen and they 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.020
 I really like it and so for me 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.180
 this news would be the same 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.210
 shocks like for many directioners 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.980
 of and at first I didnâ€™t even believe it 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.940
 and thought it might be some kind of 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.940
 Is it a joke ? 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.920
 but when we brains started working in 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.100
 right direction before I finally did 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.890
 it came out that this is not a joke not pr 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:53.410
 but reality and I somehow became true 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.600
 sad one hundred percent is the limit in 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.009
 band bands before their producer finally reached 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.140
 what they found nobody needs here they are 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.460
 bought zane 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.710
 although it would be too good to 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.679
 It seemed to be true because we though 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.259
 would mutually see Russia hashtag 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.880
 talent come to russia true we 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.319
 you are waiting for his nose still seems to me to 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.510
 done so you got involved here 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.519
 to be vande thought they were cooler because 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.620
 that their four so they pulled one of 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:22.570
 your team, we know if you 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:30.299
 it would be so that it would not be thrown out 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:30.299
 liam's so ordinary 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.640
 to look like 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.640
 four in a group 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.439
 bad joke ok guys and the main derek 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.359
 toner listen to me now 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:54.060
 carefully 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:59.670
 do not be upset because we have 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.670
 mass suicides out 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:15.569
 it's for you it's for you 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:36.480
 that i just create an injecting 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:38.640
 the atmosphere is all filmed on camera and 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.920
 We post on the Internet with a hashtag for not 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.920
 go away 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.860
 Well, if the truth guys put me in 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.510
 shock those figures of teenagers in Russia and 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.520
 abroad 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:04:06.680
 who did away or tried to do away 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:04:09.180
 with yourself because of this ah yes this one by yao 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.100
 ok can't necessarily disgrace 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:16.100
 my mother, yes, I finally can not leave quickly 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.100
 by the job 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:39.919
 doing god for something didn't give two 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.990
 daughters without brains 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:47.750
 dear maximum that you will have 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.750
 grief nak so this is not a little diarrhea 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:00.030
 after all, as they say all the changes for the better 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.890
 although I do not understand who wrote it at all 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.060
 probably not a hundred percent did not know about 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.060
 news about landi 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.470
 well, in principle, guys are all popular 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.370
 groups 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:19.740
 sooner or later fall apart for example 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:20.850
 flow your black ip black 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.930
 ip 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:37.080
 even from the same aria went boiling and yes a 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:39.420
 I'm no longer the case in all situations 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.540
 need to find positives and 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.120
 You know, I found one now in any 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.400
 the beauties of the world yes what's there and any 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.920

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:54.660
 with chances to meet for it just outside 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:56.370

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.530
 Namul from Hasse 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.150
 sorry of course that now in the group volante 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.700
 free but instead of u and more precisely 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.860
 that they are now 4 and you know using 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:08.330
 situation and would like to sing a song like that 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.330

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.770

 guys this is for today everything i hope in 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.790
 these are difficult moments I could understand you 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.440
 just a little bit of mood and directioners 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:53.680
 don't do yourself something i understand 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.370
 that care is different is insanely sad 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.720
 news 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:01.300
 but I think it's worth the sadness and 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.950
 cry out yes but then take it all 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.380
 because well you direkshioner you 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:08.110
 must understand them more than anyone 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.870
 different and maintain prices in his choice 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.300
 it's his choice and I understand him, and I 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.580
 I hope you understand it even more 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.430
 I am sure that we still have a lot of good 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.230
 hear a view of a group of one de and all u 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.550

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.460
 perhaps it will not be the same 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:28.000
 i want you to have everything cool too 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.050
 don't take everything to heart by the way 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.410
 immerse 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:37.090
 and let us go we have a good week and 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:40.890
