thought 10 would work best because if

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.230 
thought 10 would work best because if
this<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.750> know<00:01:45.869> eight<00:01:46.350> deep<00:01:47.000> favor<00:01:48.000> give

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
some books could fit you can see kind of

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.530

right<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.140> edge<00:01:52.290> some<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.770> them<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:54.060> I

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
right on the edge some of them so I

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.639 
right on the edge some of them so I
didn't<00:01:54.840> want<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.020> go<00:01:55.110> with<00:01:55.229> eight<00:01:55.409> because

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.109 
didn't want to go with eight because

they be hanging off but I didn't want to
go<00:01:57.210> 12<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.869> feel<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.320> would<00:01:58.409> give<00:01:58.590> up

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.190 
go 12 so I feel like that would give up
as<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.820> can<00:01:59.939> see<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.240> kind<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.479> hanging<00:02:00.869> over

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
as you can see it's kind of hanging over

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.480 
as you can see it's kind of hanging over
the<00:02:01.290> edge<00:02:01.320> there<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.740> little<00:02:01.920> bit<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.280> don't

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the edge there a little bit so I don't

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.249 
the edge there a little bit so I don't
want<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.759> be<00:02:02.969> doing<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.570> too<00:02:03.780> much<00:02:03.960> put

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
want it to be doing that too much put

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.340 
want it to be doing that too much put
them<00:02:05.210> yeah<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:06.509> once<00:02:06.719> i<00:02:06.810> do<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.259> know

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
them yeah then once i do that you know

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.040 
them yeah then once i do that you know
just<00:02:07.560> put<00:02:08.220> one<00:02:08.429> board<00:02:08.700> down<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.750> floor<00:02:09.989> so

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
just put one board down on the floor so

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.589 
just put one board down on the floor so
the<00:02:10.709> cement<00:02:11.310> blocks<00:02:11.550> don't<00:02:11.790> mess<00:02:12.330> up<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
the cement blocks don't mess up the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.050 
the cement blocks don't mess up the
floor

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
floor

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.930 
floor
and<00:02:13.390> then<00:02:14.110> put<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.950> cement<00:02:15.400> blocks<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:15.819> there

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
and then put the cement blocks in there

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.460 
and then put the cement blocks in there
i<00:02:15.970> left<00:02:16.239> about<00:02:16.510> two<00:02:16.900> inches<00:02:17.260> here<00:02:18.180> just<00:02:19.470> keep

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
i left about two inches here just keep

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.320 
i left about two inches here just keep
it<00:02:20.620> stable<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.280> little<00:02:21.849> bit<00:02:21.940> better<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.209> think

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
it stable a little bit better I think

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.960 
it stable a little bit better I think
and<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:23.890> it's<00:02:24.040> not<00:02:24.340> like<00:02:24.580> right<00:02:24.819> on<00:02:24.849> the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
and the so it's not like right on the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.140 
and the so it's not like right on the
edge<00:02:25.180> ready<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.599> fall<00:02:25.840> off<00:02:26.080> or<00:02:26.319> anything<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:27.150> I

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
edge ready to fall off or anything and I

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.780 
edge ready to fall off or anything and I
did<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.599> on<00:02:28.720> both<00:02:28.840> sides<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.440> then<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:30.580> put

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
did that on both sides and then you put

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.880 
did that on both sides and then you put
a<00:02:30.849> bore<00:02:31.120> on<00:02:31.269> top<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:31.900> kept<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:32.769> know

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
a bore on top and I kept that you know

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.559 
a bore on top and I kept that you know
measured<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.489> so<00:02:34.090> they're<00:02:34.239> about<00:02:34.360> equal

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
measured it so they're about equal

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.290 
measured it so they're about equal
distance<00:02:35.170> on<00:02:35.290> each<00:02:35.440> side<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.760> it's<00:02:36.910> not<00:02:37.030> you

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
distance on each side so it's not you

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.850 
distance on each side so it's not you
know<00:02:37.360> leaning<00:02:37.810> one<00:02:37.930> way<00:02:37.989> or<00:02:38.260> another<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.680> then

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
know leaning one way or another and then

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.740 
know leaning one way or another and then
same<00:02:39.430> thing<00:02:39.459> here<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.090> know<00:02:40.209> two<00:02:40.269> inches

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
same thing here you know two inches

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.830 
same thing here you know two inches
apart<00:02:41.459> keep<00:02:42.459> this<00:02:42.640> equal<00:02:43.060> distance<00:02:43.450> on<00:02:43.660> both

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
apart keep this equal distance on both

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.620 
apart keep this equal distance on both
sides<00:02:44.349> and<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.640> know<00:02:45.760> keep<00:02:46.060> repeating<00:02:46.510> all

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
sides and you know keep repeating all

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.890 
sides and you know keep repeating all
the<00:02:46.720> way<00:02:46.810> up<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.080> then<00:02:47.620> uh<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:49.510> know<00:02:49.600> just<00:02:49.630> put

don't try to squeeze more there than

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.460 
don't try to squeeze more there than
really<00:03:20.709> should<00:03:21.220> fit<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.750> that's<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.109> I<00:03:23.260> mean

in half and cut the other one in half
and<00:03:36.940> stack<00:03:37.269> them<00:03:37.420> then<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.440> know<00:03:38.560> as<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.910> can

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
and stack them then you know as you can

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.940 
and stack them then you know as you can
see<00:03:40.150> I'm<00:03:40.269> already<00:03:40.359> pretty<00:03:41.109> filled<00:03:41.410> up<00:03:41.590> here
