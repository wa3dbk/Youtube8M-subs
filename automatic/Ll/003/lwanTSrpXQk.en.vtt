00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
use something a little bit larger like

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.040 
use something a little bit larger like
grapefruit<00:00:36.000> if<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.570> only<00:00:36.780> have

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050

tangerines though if you want say a
really<00:00:39.840> pointy<00:00:40.350> bust<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.710> could<00:00:40.860> probably

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
really pointy bust you could probably

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.590 
really pointy bust you could probably
practice<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.760> something<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.239> 11<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:45.000> what

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
practice on something like 11 so what

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.330 
practice on something like 11 so what
I'm<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.020> show<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:46.530> three

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
I'm going to show you are three

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.520 
I'm going to show you are three
different<00:00:47.700> ways<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:48.480> cut<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
different ways that you can cut up the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.369 
different ways that you can cut up the
panel's<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.160> your<00:00:50.579> bust<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:52.079> really

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
panel's of your bust and it's really

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.900 
panel's of your bust and it's really
nice<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.739> practice<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.219> something<00:00:53.550> like<00:00:53.670> this

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
nice to practice on something like this

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.830 
nice to practice on something like this
which<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.660> know<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:55.440> hemispherical<00:00:56.840> so

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
which is you know it's hemispherical so

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.889 
which is you know it's hemispherical so
it<00:00:58.109> sort<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.530> resembles<00:00:58.770> what<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.000> bust<00:01:00.570> is

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
it sort of resembles what the bust is

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.229 
it sort of resembles what the bust is
going<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.199> be<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.489> gives<00:01:03.090> you

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
going to be like but it gives you

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.240 
going to be like but it gives you
something<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> practice<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.350> before<00:01:05.040> you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
something to practice on before you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.920 
something to practice on before you
actually<00:01:05.460> cut<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:05.970> your<00:01:06.119> duct<00:01:06.390> tape<00:01:06.659> dress

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
actually cut up your duct tape dress

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.370 
actually cut up your duct tape dress
form<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> first<00:01:08.670> method<00:01:08.909> quite<00:01:09.479> simple<00:01:10.020> is

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
form so the first method quite simple is

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.600 
form so the first method quite simple is
to<00:01:10.680> make<00:01:10.860> many<00:01:11.189> thin<00:01:12.000> panels<00:01:12.750> across<00:01:14.509> like<00:01:15.509> so

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
to make many thin panels across like so

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.710 
to make many thin panels across like so
so<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:18.030> divide<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.540> bust<00:01:18.750> into<00:01:20.390> three<00:01:21.390> or

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
so you can divide the bust into three or

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.469 
so you can divide the bust into three or
even<00:01:21.750> four<00:01:22.290> different<00:01:23.130> panels<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.299> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
even four different panels so that it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.800 
even four different panels so that it
will<00:01:24.630> lie<00:01:24.869> some<00:01:25.799> what's<00:01:25.979> left

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.029 

and<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.289> it's<00:01:31.409> starting<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.920> look

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
and as you can see it's starting to look

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:43.420 
and as you can see it's starting to look
kind<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.429> like<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> basketball<00:01:33.090> right<00:01:33.390> now

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.340 

so<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.789> see<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.689> cut<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.200> into

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
so you can see here that I cut it into

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.080 
so you can see here that I cut it into
four<00:01:46.770> different<00:01:46.950> panels<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.820> imagine

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
four different panels and if you imagine

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.539 
four different panels and if you imagine
that<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:49.380> rest<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.710> course<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.039> extends

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
that the rest of the course it extends

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.779 
that the rest of the course it extends
downwards<00:01:51.329> from<00:01:51.689> from<00:01:52.289> these<00:01:52.530> edges<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.759> can

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
downwards from from these edges you can

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.090 
downwards from from these edges you can
see<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:54.899> more<00:01:55.140> or<00:01:55.200> less<00:01:55.350> flat<00:01:55.860> like

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
see that it's more or less flat like

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.260 
see that it's more or less flat like
this<00:01:56.570> when<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.689> actually<00:01:57.960> make<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.829> out<00:01:59.009> of

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
this when you actually make it out of

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.690 
this when you actually make it out of
your<00:02:00.270> fabric<00:02:00.929> then<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.740> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.429> a

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
your fabric then it's going to be a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.300 
your fabric then it's going to be a
little<00:02:03.270> bit<00:02:03.450> geometric<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.829> break<00:02:05.100> in

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
little bit geometric but as you break in

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.460 
little bit geometric but as you break in
your<00:02:05.490> corset<00:02:05.970> it<00:02:06.390> should<00:02:06.600> smooth<00:02:06.960> out<00:02:07.140> because

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
your corset it should smooth out because

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.740 
your corset it should smooth out because
you<00:02:07.860> know<00:02:07.979> fabric<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.550> not<00:02:08.729> completely<00:02:09.179> sturdy

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
you know fabric is not completely sturdy

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.160 
you know fabric is not completely sturdy
it<00:02:10.110> will<00:02:10.259> be<00:02:10.380> able<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.739> drape<00:02:11.039> over<00:02:11.430> curves<00:02:12.170> so

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
it will be able to drape over curves so

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.229 
it will be able to drape over curves so
this<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.650> one<00:02:14.040> way<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.550> can<00:02:14.730> shape<00:02:15.209> your

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
this is one way that you can shape your

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.259 
this is one way that you can shape your
bust<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:17.099> next<00:02:17.489> way<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.700> can<00:02:18.000> shape<00:02:18.239> your

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
bust the next way you can shape your

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.979 
bust the next way you can shape your
bust<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.500> first<00:02:19.769> divide<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.459> into<00:02:20.989> two

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
bust is to first divide it into two

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.830 
bust is to first divide it into two
pieces<00:02:22.549> and<00:02:25.069> many<00:02:26.069> commercial<00:02:27.060> corset

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
pieces and many commercial corset

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.720 
pieces and many commercial corset
patterns<00:02:28.230> only<00:02:28.650> divide<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.069> bust<00:02:29.250> into<00:02:29.489> two

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
patterns only divide the bust into two

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:37.490 
patterns only divide the bust into two
pieces<00:02:29.940> like<00:02:30.269> this<00:02:35.420> but<00:02:36.420> as<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.780> can<00:02:36.959> see<00:02:37.019> it

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
pieces like this but as you can see it

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.400 
pieces like this but as you can see it
still<00:02:37.829> doesn't<00:02:38.250> lie<00:02:38.579> that<00:02:38.970> flat<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:40.079> what<00:02:40.319> you

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
still doesn't lie that flat so what you

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.160 
still doesn't lie that flat so what you
can<00:02:40.590> do<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:40.980> actually<00:02:41.190> slash<00:02:41.880> this<00:02:44.959> just<00:02:45.959> like

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
can do is actually slash this just like

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.720 
can do is actually slash this just like
that<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.090> creates<00:02:48.510> kind<00:02:48.989> of<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.500> V<00:02:50.100> shape<00:02:50.430> or

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
that so it creates kind of a V shape or

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.990 
that so it creates kind of a V shape or
a<00:02:50.760> Y<00:02:51.120> shape<00:02:51.769> just<00:02:52.769> like<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:53.700> can<00:02:53.850> see

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
a Y shape just like that and you can see

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.500 
a Y shape just like that and you can see
now<00:02:54.359> it<00:02:54.569> lies<00:02:54.750> flat<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:56.130> when<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.880> are<00:02:57.209> going

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
now it lies flat so when you are going

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.680 
now it lies flat so when you are going
to<00:02:57.630> take<00:02:57.810> your<00:02:57.959> pattern<00:02:58.230> piece<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.690> actually

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
to take your pattern piece and actually

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:09.449 
to take your pattern piece and actually
trace<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.170> out<00:03:01.260> onto<00:03:01.500> fabric

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:20.130 

such<00:03:10.459> as<00:03:10.640> this

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.650 

then<00:03:20.740> you'll<00:03:21.310> be<00:03:21.700> left<00:03:21.910> was<00:03:22.150> probably

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
then you'll be left was probably

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.020 
then you'll be left was probably
something<00:03:23.020> like<00:03:23.050> this<00:03:23.440> in<00:03:23.800> which<00:03:23.950> case<00:03:24.220> we<00:03:24.790> see

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
something like this in which case we see

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.580 
something like this in which case we see
these<00:03:25.270> lines<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:26.050> I<00:03:26.170> made<00:03:26.380> right<00:03:26.560> there

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
these lines that I made right there

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.590 
these lines that I made right there
you're<00:03:27.100> going<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.430> have<00:03:27.580> to<00:03:27.760> form<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.270> dart

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
you're going to have to form a dart

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.860 
you're going to have to form a dart
there<00:03:29.170> so<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.010> just<00:03:30.220> match<00:03:30.640> those<00:03:30.940> two<00:03:31.330> sewing

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
there so you just match those two sewing

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.000 
there so you just match those two sewing
lines<00:03:32.050> together<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.920> then<00:03:33.670> press<00:03:34.420> it<00:03:34.569> down<00:03:35.010> so

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
lines together and then press it down so

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.860 
lines together and then press it down so
you'll<00:03:36.190> be<00:03:36.310> left<00:03:36.490> with<00:03:36.610> something<00:03:37.030> like<00:03:37.660> this

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
you'll be left with something like this

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.740 
you'll be left with something like this
and<00:03:38.110> you<00:03:38.170> can<00:03:38.320> see<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.680> now<00:03:38.860> it<00:03:39.220> has<00:03:39.690> more<00:03:40.690> of

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
and you can see it now it has more of

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.510 
and you can see it now it has more of
the<00:03:40.840> shape<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.410> desire<00:03:41.440> when<00:03:42.370> you're

the shape that you desire when you're

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.460 
the shape that you desire when you're
making<00:03:42.670> a<00:03:42.880> dart<00:03:43.120> try<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:44.340> really<00:03:45.340> spread<00:03:46.060> out

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
making a dart try and really spread out

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.430 
making a dart try and really spread out
that<00:03:47.700> extra<00:03:48.700> material<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.360> try<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.569> really

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
that extra material and try to really

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.160 
that extra material and try to really
taper<00:03:50.800> off<00:03:51.040> your<00:03:51.730> sewing<00:03:52.150> line<00:03:52.360> so<00:03:52.959> that<00:03:52.989> you

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170

taper off your sewing line so that you
can<00:03:53.350> get<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.590> funky<00:03:54.220> little<00:03:54.340> point<00:03:54.700> right<00:03:54.880> there

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
can get a funky little point right there

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.500 
can get a funky little point right there
you<00:03:55.239> want<00:03:55.480> it<00:03:55.570> to<00:03:55.690> be<00:03:56.370> somewhat<00:03:57.370> more<00:03:57.510> smooth

going to show you is actually using
plastic<00:04:03.850> cores<00:04:04.060> so<00:04:04.720> what<00:04:05.140> the<00:04:05.620> scores<00:04:05.920> are<00:04:06.100> or

plastic cores so what the scores are or
hip<00:04:06.550> cores<00:04:06.820> are<00:04:07.030> it's<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.720> little<00:04:08.080> triangular

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
hip cores are it's a little triangular

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.160 
hip cores are it's a little triangular

triangle so as you can see this lies

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.110 
triangle so as you can see this lies
more<00:04:26.539> or<00:04:26.660> less<00:04:26.810> flat<00:04:27.080> right<00:04:27.410> now<00:04:27.620> I<00:04:28.340> look<00:04:28.880> fat<00:04:29.090> a

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
more or less flat right now I look fat a

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.629 
more or less flat right now I look fat a
little<00:04:29.300> bit<00:04:29.509> and<00:04:29.840> then<00:04:30.560> afterwards<00:04:31.310> are<00:04:31.430> going

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
little bit and then afterwards are going

to have to sew in these little

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.480 
to have to sew in these little
triangular<00:04:33.620> inserts

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
triangular inserts

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.070 
triangular inserts
right<00:04:34.789> there<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.300> give<00:04:35.449> you<00:04:35.569> the<00:04:35.599> desired

right there to give you the desired
roundness<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:37.280> fullness<00:04:37.550> of<00:04:37.849> the<00:04:37.940> bus<00:04:38.090> and

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
roundness and fullness of the bus and

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.809 
roundness and fullness of the bus and
your<00:04:39.380> bus<00:04:39.530> of<00:04:39.650> course<00:04:39.740> they<00:04:40.009> don't<00:04:40.130> have<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.669> be

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
your bus of course they don't have to be

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.450 
your bus of course they don't have to be
triangular<00:04:41.479> shape<00:04:41.780> like<00:04:41.990> this<00:04:42.220> because<00:04:43.220> as

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
triangular shape like this because as

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.219 
triangular shape like this because as
you<00:04:43.580> can<00:04:43.729> see<00:04:43.940> when<00:04:44.240> you<00:04:44.330> have<00:04:44.509> a<00:04:44.569> triangular

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
you can see when you have a triangular

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.110 
you can see when you have a triangular
shape<00:04:45.410> like<00:04:45.620> that<00:04:45.889> it<00:04:46.370> gives<00:04:46.490> you<00:04:46.699> more<00:04:46.729> of<00:04:46.940> a

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
shape like that it gives you more of a

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.200 
shape like that it gives you more of a
demi<00:04:47.330> bust<00:04:47.599> where<00:04:47.810> you<00:04:47.900> have<00:04:48.050> fullness

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
demi bust where you have fullness

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.360 
demi bust where you have fullness
underneath<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.840> bus<00:04:51.139> and<00:04:51.470> then<00:04:51.680> it<00:04:51.919> cuts<00:04:52.160> off

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
underneath the bus and then it cuts off

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.240 
underneath the bus and then it cuts off
and<00:04:52.639> you<00:04:53.360> don't<00:04:53.509> have<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:54.110> rest<00:04:54.410> of<00:04:54.740> that

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
and you don't have the rest of that

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.210 
and you don't have the rest of that
material<00:04:55.639> to<00:04:55.970> cover<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.830> top<00:04:57.830> part<00:04:58.099> of<00:04:58.160> your

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
material to cover the top part of your

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.909 
material to cover the top part of your
bus<00:04:58.460> so<00:04:59.030> what<00:04:59.300> you<00:04:59.419> can<00:04:59.570> do<00:04:59.810> is<00:05:00.110> actually<00:05:00.410> make

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
bus so what you can do is actually make

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.430 
bus so what you can do is actually make
more<00:05:01.310> of<00:05:01.460> a<00:05:01.550> marquise<00:05:02.030> shape<00:05:02.509> so<00:05:03.020> this<00:05:03.289> is<00:05:03.410> a

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
more of a marquise shape so this is a

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.279 
more of a marquise shape so this is a
marquise<00:05:03.979> shape<00:05:04.280> it's<00:05:04.550> kind<00:05:04.880> of<00:05:04.970> like<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:05.389> a

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
marquise shape it's kind of like a a

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.370 
marquise shape it's kind of like a a
rounded<00:05:07.130> out<00:05:07.250> Diamond<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.909> so<00:05:08.539> you<00:05:08.990> can<00:05:09.169> see

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
rounded out Diamond and so you can see

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.249 
rounded out Diamond and so you can see
that<00:05:10.060> there's<00:05:11.060> less<00:05:11.360> fullness<00:05:11.780> at<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.050> top

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
that there's less fullness at the top

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:14.290 
that there's less fullness at the top
and<00:05:12.530> then<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:12.860> goes<00:05:13.039> into<00:05:13.220> more<00:05:13.520> fullness<00:05:13.849> to

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
and then it goes into more fullness to

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.770 
and then it goes into more fullness to
cut<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:14.900> breast<00:05:15.139> and<00:05:15.560> then<00:05:16.360> it<00:05:17.360> tapers<00:05:17.569> down

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
cut the breast and then it tapers down

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.270 
cut the breast and then it tapers down
like<00:05:18.650> that

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
like that

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.749 
like that
into<00:05:19.580> nothing<00:05:19.759> so<00:05:20.720> that<00:05:20.960> you<00:05:21.110> get<00:05:21.320> a<00:05:21.349> nice

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
into nothing so that you get a nice

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.420 
into nothing so that you get a nice
roundness<00:05:22.759> that<00:05:23.180> supports<00:05:24.169> both<00:05:24.349> the<00:05:24.650> top<00:05:25.159> and

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
roundness that supports both the top and

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.909 
roundness that supports both the top and
the<00:05:25.580> bottom<00:05:25.729> of<00:05:26.150> your<00:05:26.389> breast<00:05:26.630> so<00:05:27.590> once<00:05:27.800> again

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
the bottom of your breast so once again

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.740 
the bottom of your breast so once again
here<00:05:28.310> are<00:05:28.400> the<00:05:28.490> three<00:05:28.729> examples<00:05:29.270> that<00:05:29.449> I<00:05:29.570> just

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
here are the three examples that I just

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.270 
here are the three examples that I just
showed<00:05:29.990> you<00:05:30.020> side<00:05:30.409> by<00:05:30.560> side<00:05:30.830> so<00:05:31.009> you<00:05:31.099> can

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
showed you side by side so you can

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.700 
showed you side by side so you can
compare<00:05:31.699> so<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.449> first<00:05:32.659> technique<00:05:32.870> is<00:05:33.320> having

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
compare so the first technique is having

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.279 
compare so the first technique is having
many<00:05:34.009> very<00:05:34.550> narrow<00:05:35.120> vertical<00:05:35.780> pattern<00:05:35.960> pieces

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
many very narrow vertical pattern pieces

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.709 
many very narrow vertical pattern pieces
that<00:05:36.680> just<00:05:36.800> blend<00:05:37.130> down<00:05:37.370> into<00:05:37.969> the<00:05:38.090> torso<00:05:38.330> like

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:38.719 
that just blend down into the torso like

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:41.770 
that just blend down into the torso like
that<00:05:38.990> and<00:05:39.320> the<00:05:40.310> second<00:05:40.699> technique<00:05:40.849> is<00:05:41.240> having

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
that and the second technique is having

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.399 
that and the second technique is having
larger<00:05:42.710> vertical<00:05:43.099> pattern<00:05:43.880> pieces<00:05:44.270> but<00:05:45.139> then

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
larger vertical pattern pieces but then

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.020 
larger vertical pattern pieces but then
you<00:05:45.500> have<00:05:45.680> to<00:05:45.710> slash<00:05:46.099> it<00:05:46.280> either<00:05:46.490> at<00:05:46.729> the<00:05:46.849> top

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
you have to slash it either at the top

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.089 
you have to slash it either at the top
or<00:05:47.090> the<00:05:47.300> bottom<00:05:47.389> to<00:05:48.229> be<00:05:48.349> able<00:05:48.469> to<00:05:48.680> distribute

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
or the bottom to be able to distribute

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.100 
or the bottom to be able to distribute
that<00:05:49.460> fullness<00:05:49.909> and<00:05:50.180> when<00:05:50.300> you<00:05:50.419> transfer<00:05:50.960> this

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
that fullness and when you transfer this

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.620 
that fullness and when you transfer this
pattern<00:05:51.770> to<00:05:52.340> fabric<00:05:52.849> you'll<00:05:53.090> have<00:05:53.270> to<00:05:53.419> make<00:05:53.599> a

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
pattern to fabric you'll have to make a

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.870 
pattern to fabric you'll have to make a
dark<00:05:53.930> right<00:05:54.530> there<00:05:54.770> where<00:05:55.039> you<00:05:55.130> slashed<00:05:55.490> and

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
dark right there where you slashed and

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.379 
dark right there where you slashed and
in<00:05:56.840> this<00:05:57.050> example<00:05:57.560> you're<00:05:58.490> going<00:05:58.789> to<00:05:58.909> have<00:05:59.120> the

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
in this example you're going to have the

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.510 
in this example you're going to have the
scores<00:05:59.750> or<00:05:59.990> bust<00:06:00.199> closets<00:06:00.710> where<00:06:01.250> you<00:06:01.340> have

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
scores or bust closets where you have

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.969 
scores or bust closets where you have
little<00:06:02.030> either<00:06:02.539> triangular<00:06:03.320> or<00:06:03.469> marquise

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
little either triangular or marquise

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.380 
little either triangular or marquise
pieces<00:06:04.550> that<00:06:05.270> you<00:06:05.449> can

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
pieces that you can

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.040 
pieces that you can
search<00:06:06.570> to<00:06:07.200> give<00:06:07.710> the<00:06:08.130> cup<00:06:08.370> more<00:06:08.730> fullness<00:06:09.050> so

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
search to give the cup more fullness so

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.170 
search to give the cup more fullness so
I<00:06:10.080> hope<00:06:10.320> this<00:06:10.470> helped<00:06:10.740> you<00:06:10.950> and<00:06:11.130> I<00:06:11.640> will<00:06:11.850> see
