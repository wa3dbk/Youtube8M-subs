00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
wouldn't advise as they're exactly the

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.200 
wouldn't advise as they're exactly the
same<00:01:14.780> anyway<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.830> does<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> few<00:01:17.820> flaws

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
same anyway so it does have a few flaws

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.020 
same anyway so it does have a few flaws
but<00:01:18.960> mainly<00:01:19.350> they<00:01:19.680> are<00:01:19.710> perfect<00:01:20.610> headphones

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
but mainly they are perfect headphones

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.789 
but mainly they are perfect headphones
than<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.360> they're<00:01:21.540> really<00:01:21.690> good<00:01:21.870> to<00:01:22.049> start

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
than that they're really good to start

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.590 
than that they're really good to start
with<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.430> don't<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.940> a<00:01:23.970> detachable<00:01:24.360> cable

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
with they don't have a detachable cable

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.800 
with they don't have a detachable cable
which<00:01:25.320> really<00:01:26.070> isn't<00:01:26.310> well<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.479> not<00:01:27.600> too<00:01:27.780> bad

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
which really isn't well it's not too bad

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.260 
which really isn't well it's not too bad
they<00:01:28.260> do<00:01:28.320> want<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.530> transport<00:01:28.979> them<00:01:29.280> then<00:01:30.120> it

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
they do want to transport them then it

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.180 
they do want to transport them then it
yes<00:01:30.510> they're<00:01:30.720> inconvenient<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.830> cable

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
yes they're inconvenient and the cable

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.340 
yes they're inconvenient and the cable
is<00:01:32.310> free<00:01:32.549> meters<00:01:33.030> long<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:33.900> pretty

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
is free meters long so it's pretty

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.250 
is free meters long so it's pretty
pretty<00:01:34.830> long<00:01:35.600> considering<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.720> most<00:01:36.900> tables

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
pretty long considering that most tables

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.730 
pretty long considering that most tables
about<00:01:37.470> one<00:01:37.770> meter<00:01:38.010> long

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
about one meter long

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.190 
about one meter long
obviously<00:01:40.740> these<00:01:40.860> headphones<00:01:41.100> are<00:01:41.900> around<00:01:42.900> it

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
obviously these headphones are around it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.990 
obviously these headphones are around it
and<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:43.920> probably<00:01:44.070> tell<00:01:44.280> by<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.549> vast

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and you can probably tell by the vast

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.469 
and you can probably tell by the vast
size<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.630> them<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:47.250> they<00:01:48.000> are<00:01:48.180> very

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
size of them and they are very

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.090 
size of them and they are very
comfortable<00:01:48.720> they<00:01:49.049> have<00:01:49.409> padding<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:49.979> top

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
comfortable they have padding on the top

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.090 
comfortable they have padding on the top
and<00:01:50.610> obviously<00:01:51.150> very<00:01:51.530> very<00:01:52.530> soft<00:01:52.710> padding<00:01:53.040> on

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
and obviously very very soft padding on

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.300 
and obviously very very soft padding on
the<00:01:53.189> sides<00:01:53.689> in<00:01:54.689> comparison<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.830> beats

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the sides in comparison with the beats

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.929 
the sides in comparison with the beats
they<00:01:56.760> literally<00:01:57.750> obliterate<00:01:58.560> them<00:01:58.770> beats<00:01:59.759> of

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
they literally obliterate them beats of

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.730 
they literally obliterate them beats of
nothing<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.390> they<00:02:00.540> are<00:02:00.689> literally

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
nothing and they are literally

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.510 
nothing and they are literally
compared<00:02:03.049> and<00:02:04.049> bass<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.159> pay<00:02:05.280> for<00:02:05.310> a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
compared and bass you just pay for a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.690 
compared and bass you just pay for a
brand<00:02:05.790> where<00:02:06.240> these<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.200> pay<00:02:07.470> tiny<00:02:08.310> bit<00:02:08.519> for<00:02:08.640> a

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
good design however they do have a

adjustable that goes from 1 to 12 but
not<00:02:58.800> quite<00:02:59.250> sure<00:02:59.750> what<00:03:00.750> sort<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.640> measuring

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
not quite sure what sort of measuring

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.200 
not quite sure what sort of measuring
scale<00:03:03.180> that<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:06.540> yeah
