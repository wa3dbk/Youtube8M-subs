how to use watercolor pencils the first
one<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.640> of<00:04:14.970> course<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.450> apply<00:04:15.780> them<00:04:15.990> on<00:04:16.079> dry

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
one is of course to apply them on dry

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.380 
one is of course to apply them on dry
surface<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.100> blend<00:04:17.340> them<00:04:17.489> with<00:04:17.700> water<00:04:17.940> the

surface and blend them with water the
second<00:04:18.750> one<00:04:18.959> is<00:04:19.230> shown<00:04:19.530> here<00:04:19.950> you<00:04:20.489> can<00:04:20.670> take<00:04:20.880> a

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
second one is shown here you can take a

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.510 
second one is shown here you can take a
clean<00:04:21.269> sheet<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.630> paper<00:04:22.070> smear<00:04:23.070> some<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.400> the

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
clean sheet of paper smear some of the

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.000 
clean sheet of paper smear some of the
pigment<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.210> use<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.050> paper<00:04:25.260> as<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.530> palette

pigment and use the paper as a palette

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.790 
pigment and use the paper as a palette
you<00:04:27.000> can<00:04:27.030> now<00:04:27.300> apply<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.690> color<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.620> wet

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
you can now apply the color to the wet

00:04:28.800 --> 00:05:08.550 
you can now apply the color to the wet
surface

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560

the<00:05:09.560> third<00:05:09.830> way<00:05:10.039> to<00:05:10.069> apply<00:05:10.460> watercolor

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
the third way to apply watercolor

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.779 
the third way to apply watercolor
pencils<00:05:11.750> is<00:05:12.259> to<00:05:12.500> use<00:05:12.620> a<00:05:12.650> wet<00:05:12.949> brush<00:05:13.219> on<00:05:13.550> the

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
pencils is to use a wet brush on the

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:29.310 
pencils is to use a wet brush on the
pencil<00:05:14.270> tip

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.850 

Oh

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.990 

the<00:05:37.860> last<00:05:38.070> technique<00:05:38.280> is<00:05:38.580> to<00:05:38.700> take<00:05:38.880> the

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
the last technique is to take the

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.240
