starting point so that when your

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.320 
starting point so that when your
contouring<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:27.799> can<00:01:27.950> actually<00:01:28.100> see<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:29.180> the

contouring you can actually see that the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.780 
contouring you can actually see that the
contour<00:01:29.840> comes<00:01:30.080> up<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:30.500> it's<00:01:30.710> finished<00:01:31.280> by

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
depths that you want now here's where it

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.350 
depths that you want now here's where it
starts<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.830> get<00:01:39.980> tricky<00:01:40.250> this<00:01:40.610> parts<00:01:40.970> simple

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
starts to get tricky this parts simple

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.540 
starts to get tricky this parts simple
because<00:01:41.540> that's<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.990> bridge<00:01:42.200> of<00:01:42.350> your<00:01:42.380> nose

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
because that's the bridge of your nose

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.310 
because that's the bridge of your nose
it<00:01:43.550> already<00:01:44.030> has<00:01:44.270> its<00:01:44.510> own<00:01:44.750> natural

it already has its own natural

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.130 
it already has its own natural
definition<00:01:45.850> it's<00:01:46.850> pulling<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.570> contour

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
definition it's pulling that contour

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.990 
definition it's pulling that contour
down<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.710> side<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.190> nose<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:49.610> tends<00:01:49.880> to

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
down the side of the nose that tends to
