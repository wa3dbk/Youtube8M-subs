00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.110 
watching it thank you um I'm stopping
them<00:01:43.510> in<00:01:43.720> a<00:01:43.780> process<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.410> actually<00:01:44.970> redoing<00:01:45.970> my

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
them in a process of actually redoing my

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.140 
them in a process of actually redoing my
entire<00:01:46.690> catalog<00:01:47.500> so<00:01:47.770> what<00:01:48.670> I'm<00:01:48.760> doing<00:01:49.000> now<00:01:49.030> is

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
entire catalog so what I'm doing now is

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.390 
entire catalog so what I'm doing now is
as<00:01:49.450> I<00:01:49.630> bring<00:01:49.810> stuff<00:01:49.960> over<00:01:50.170> I'm<00:01:50.500> cataloging<00:01:51.250> it

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
as I bring stuff over I'm cataloging it

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.610 
as I bring stuff over I'm cataloging it
so<00:01:52.060> it<00:01:52.600> takes<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.900> little<00:01:52.990> bit<00:01:53.110> longer<00:01:53.260> than

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
so it takes a little bit longer than

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.770 
so it takes a little bit longer than
just<00:01:53.860> sticking<00:01:54.100> some<00:01:54.250> stuff<00:01:54.430> in<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.640> in<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.540> box

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
just sticking some stuff in a in a box

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.060 
just sticking some stuff in a in a box
and<00:01:56.020> bring<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.320> over<00:01:56.409> I<00:01:56.590> actually<00:01:56.800> have<00:01:57.010> to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
and bring it over I actually have to

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.830 
and bring it over I actually have to
take<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.310> time<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.700> catalog<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.210> all<00:01:58.300> then<00:01:58.690> put

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
take the time to catalog it all then put

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.240 
take the time to catalog it all then put
in<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:58.960> box<00:01:59.140> and<00:01:59.320> then<00:01:59.620> bring<00:01:59.800> it<00:01:59.890> over<00:02:00.010> so<00:02:00.159> it

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
in the box and then bring it over so it

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.490 
in the box and then bring it over so it
is<00:02:00.370> taking<00:02:00.760> a<00:02:00.909> little<00:02:01.659> bit<00:02:01.810> longer<00:02:01.960> but<00:02:02.290> like<00:02:02.409> I

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
is taking a little bit longer but like I

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.080 
is taking a little bit longer but like I
said<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.740> do<00:02:02.830> have<00:02:03.100> some<00:02:03.280> more<00:02:03.430> things<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:03.940> build
