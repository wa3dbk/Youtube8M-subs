00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.850
 and the beauty gallery here is the locus game 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:14.280
 I'm once again going to make a 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:17.160
 tutorial for you is out there ready 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.490
 so I was here to make a video 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.859
 about lighting and visual effects in 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.779
 setting I'll show you 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.769
 tools that generally do not use the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.070
 videos but are legal tools that 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.969
 leads to perfection and I hope that you 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.969
 Enjoy it, come on. 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.120
 starting as with lighting has 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.239
 sure a lot of people will stay 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.239
 speaking there he if what is just to fill of 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.239
 light on the guy and ended up falling apart 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.860
 wrong let's use the sun as an example 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.680
 you can see her move the sun it 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.600
 will not change anything in the character if you can 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.460
 staring at him the elimination 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.939
 has no effect whatsoever 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.369
 Come on, let's go to the menu and we'll find the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.560
 camera 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:15.810
 here you play see what's the distance 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.220
 cool you want to shine those splits 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.960
 all things 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.560
 always left in default does not change this 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.750
 here you choose the power button to turn the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:32.280
 light or do not need you know catch it and 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.500
 to see a cool illumination there the doll was 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.829
 getting much more real I believe that the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.600
 ideal way, I'm just going to do the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.780
 next I'll put in the direction of the sun 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.420
 as if there was light from the sun 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.670
 Let's try to make it cool, then. 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.130
 Let's get it here. 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.979
 The sun is coming from behind so let's go 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.659
 put it back so you can see it there 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.280
 will say the squid but this antenna goes 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:04.530
 stand there in front of the damn sight not 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:10.580
 just in new number it falls into co 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:15.720
 here is transparency leaves there at the end 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:19.260
 and just clicking on it erases understood 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.330
 See how much more real it is. 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.489
 allofs the beautiful scenery i want 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.040
 highlight an object 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.040
 relax just do the same thing 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.360
 that that plant you're going to be here 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.360
 she could not appear well 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.810
 I will not do the same thing as 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:47.459
 had come from the sun will run again 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:50.100
 a lot of transparency to zero and pokes 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.390
 barclay on what was already deleted 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.799
 let's go next 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:59.780
 now it's much more real for 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.780
 change the direction of the sun 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.800
 The entity seeks are Benedict 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.380
 This certain she'll say more or 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.880
 less where the sun will be clicking 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.069
 holding on by right clicking you 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.380
 you will have this property option where 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.800
 You will be able to send away the 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.020
 size the color of the lot of thing 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.230
 these things I recommend that you 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.500
 just remember that for you to enter 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.880
 on property you have to insure the 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.420
 place the mouse pointer over the 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.390
 object to press the right button and 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.010
 click property 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.540
 fla believes it is as if it were a 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.569
 distance from the horizon 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.549
 if you hold the button to be click the 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.000
 property right you will change the 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.340
 color in the background will change the distance goes 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.480
 change without internal or external 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.760
 these leaves this knowledge can 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.400
 do as if it was dawn could 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.530
 do as we had in the morning the 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.750
 choices all like here is 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.420
 It seems like the day is dawning. 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.010
 there is a good tool 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.950
 interesting and lastly I do not 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:20.910
 important sky than do you 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:25.200
 You're going to change from day to night stars. 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:28.490
 will put a darker time a 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.410
 clearer weather rainy weather 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:35.340
 that he works with actually three 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.250
 layers if I'm not mistaken the main one is the 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.650
 which is between the main one in the case is 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:46.350
 as if you from the horizon are standing 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:48.630
 changing now and in the case and in general as 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.560
 is that she stays in general I add 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.430
 stars 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.900
 I can make your debut move 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.660
 of the speed that I want 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.160
 It's like having a space, I already have 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.360
 You here now, more or less like you are. 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.729
 that is very interesting 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:09.780
 It's good for the fight scenes, you go. 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.780
 to do now what a show is like 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.310
 So that's it , people end up here. 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.379
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.330
 video do not forget to leave there and 15 in 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:22.319
 Stupid because it gives a little work. 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:27.360
 when this type of crime that looks and 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.360
 until the next they embrace and
