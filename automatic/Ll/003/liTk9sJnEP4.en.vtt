00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 all right 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.320
 thank you for continuing with us who 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.970
 live the morning when couples are 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.340
 a lot of time together some activities 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.750
 they can become monotonous or left of 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.730
 practice but as for the 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.349
 how often sex 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.939
 they must have today is with us the 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.919
 professional counselor rob arteaga for 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.990
 tell us about this topic good morning rum 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.970
 thank you for being here good morning 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.220
 that way we're going to talk about what 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.410
 so frequent should be the activity 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.480
 the couple does not have that little time for 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.579
 them together clear look at studies that 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.090
 have been made with couples who already have 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.039
 time together the normal thing that has come out is 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.250
 between two or three times per month or 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:45.500
 until once a week then this 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.449
 what is important here is that when 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.699
 we ask this question normally 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.850
 we want to compare ourselves with other people and 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.890
 that can be dangerous because because 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.749
 although these couples are having 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.239
 frequent relationships does not mean 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:01.969
 who are satisfied in the relationship 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.089
 then there are studies and even that 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.610
 indicate that not necessarily 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.580
 relationships but signs of affection like 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.190
 hugs kisses caresses that indicates more a 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.440
 little more satisfaction in the relationship 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.060
 and not necessarily the relationships or 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.620
 what he is saying is because 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.560
 example if a couple does not have 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.170
 sexual intercourse so frequently 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.270
 does not mean either that he is not 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.800
 satisfied with your partner but you have 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.840
 many does not mean that they are 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.330
 the happiest simply because there is 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.580
 times that maybe a topic has more 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.740
 I wish the other and can make another 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.480
 the other person is feeling 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.670
 pressed to have relationships then 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.650
 a better question would be how 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.870
 I am happy with the frequency 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.090
 sexual of my relationship and how 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.620
 important is for me because it can be 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.660
 that there are other aspects of the 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.480
 relationship that are healthy that are 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.980
 healthy and that the relationship can be 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.110
 be affected by maybe even a 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.470
 sickness or how much and not be so 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.810
 important clear or is basically more or 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.820
 least once a week with couples 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.740
 that have already enough time together is 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.040
 Exactly nothing is normal 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.190
 and then we are seeing that figure in 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.590
 the couples in the studios but also 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.590
 as I say to the caressing samples 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.030
 as hugs kisses indicate better the 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.610
 clear but also if you're too 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.410
 loving with your partner all day or in 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.720
 public that does not mean that then 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.130
 you no longer have to have privacy in the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.750
 partner 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.430
 I like the two affection during the day 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.130
 but they also need to feed that 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.900
 part of the relationship clear and when one 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.360
 the question is asked how happy 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.090
 I am with the sexual frequency that 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.280
 will guide one to better know how 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.020
 deal with the situation because it can be 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.420
 that nothing else have to have one 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.300
 talk with our partner about how 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.300
 frequent wants one the relationships or 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.400
 maybe sex is a symptom of other 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.220
 things that are wrong in the relationship and already 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.200
 be time for professional help for 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.420
 see what other aspects are also not 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.300
 very well on track in a relationship 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.830
 now what happens when couples one of 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.660
 both of you if you want to have sex 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.730
 sexual forms more frequency but the 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.120
 another person not the typical one hurts the 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.120
 head 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.609
 it's a balance in me trying to give in and 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:26.469
 satisfy my partner not only 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.239
 physically but the seduction starts 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:31.329
 since the last relationship ends 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.480
 sexual in contributing at home in knowing 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.670
 I'm making an effort to 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.950
 relationship for so the other person 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.379
 feel like also be pleased 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.310
 in other aspects if normally the other 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.379
 it's not so your sexual appetite is not the 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.030
 same as mine, well then, if 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.980
 the husband does not want cuchi cuchi 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.329
 wash dishes but it's true if this 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.280
 type of activities does not follow 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.019
 taking care for your partner that is that 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.400
 then follow up falling by 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.980
 as a result you spend more 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.689
 time when you feel supported by 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.629
 the other person especially the woman 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:10.090
 it's when it's more open and feels 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.859
 more emotionally connected because more 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.689
 or less in his psychology it is told that 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.359
 it says good it supports me 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:17.859
 it satisfies me emotionally so I 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.269
 I also want to contribute for your 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.889
 very good satisfaction 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:27.069
 also then wash the dishes because 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:29.259
 that makes me successful in living the morning and the 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:31.150
 today's question specifically with 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.520
 how often do you think a 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.680
 married couple 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.910

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.910
