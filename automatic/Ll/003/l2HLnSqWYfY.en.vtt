if I click it boom it turns on this
redstone<00:02:07.950> lamp<00:02:08.190> but<00:02:08.310> if<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.459> click<00:02:08.640> anywhere

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
redstone lamp but if I click anywhere

redstone lamp but if I click anywhere
else<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.599> any<00:02:09.780> other<00:02:09.929> face<00:02:10.170> nothing<00:02:10.530> will

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
else on any other face nothing will

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.520 
else on any other face nothing will
happen<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:12.510> now<00:02:12.840> we're<00:02:12.989> going<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.170> go<00:02:13.260> into<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
happen so now we're going to go into the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.990 
happen so now we're going to go into the
chest

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
chest

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.180 
chest
show<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.660> two<00:02:14.960> things<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.500> adds<00:02:15.860> in<00:02:16.070> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
show you the two things that adds in the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.350 
show you the two things that adds in the
game<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:16.520> is<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.700> pressure<00:02:16.880> point<00:02:17.120> block

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
game so this is the pressure point block

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.090 
game so this is the pressure point block
this<00:02:17.660> in<00:02:17.840> this<00:02:18.050> case<00:02:18.230> its<00:02:18.440> cobblestone<00:02:18.800> and

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
this in this case its cobblestone and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.650 
this in this case its cobblestone and
this<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.430> pressure<00:02:19.610> point<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:20.180> lure<00:02:20.540> the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
this is the pressure point to lure the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.540 
this is the pressure point to lure the
pressure<00:02:20.840> point<00:02:21.140> like<00:02:21.290> button<00:02:21.620> thing<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.520> that

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
pressure point like button thing so that

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.130 
pressure point like button thing so that
the<00:02:23.060> craft<00:02:23.390> Minister<00:02:23.690> before<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.930> pressure

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
the craft Minister before the pressure

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.300 
the craft Minister before the pressure
point<00:02:24.350> button<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.740> going<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:24.980> be<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.070> piece<00:02:25.280> of

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
point button is going to be a piece of

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.400 
point button is going to be a piece of
redstone<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.480> button<00:02:26.780> your<00:02:27.080> input<00:02:27.290> those

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.390 
redstone and a button your input those
next<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.680> each<00:02:27.800> other<00:02:27.890> you're<00:02:28.100> going<00:02:28.160> get<00:02:28.280> the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
next to each other you're going get the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.730 
next to each other you're going get the
pressure<00:02:28.550> point<00:02:28.820> button<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.780> you're<00:02:30.620> going

face<00:04:17.540> I<00:04:17.870> could<00:04:18.229> set<00:04:18.440> one<00:04:18.470> on

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
face I could set one on

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.920 
face I could set one on
this<00:04:19.950> space<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.580> then<00:04:20.760> any<00:04:21.060> one<00:04:21.360> of<00:04:21.390> those<00:04:21.660> is

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
this space and then any one of those is

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.930 
this space and then any one of those is
going<00:04:22.500> through<00:04:22.680> sorry<00:04:22.950> about<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.370> guys<00:04:23.730> and

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
going through sorry about that guys and

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.150 
going through sorry about that guys and
then<00:04:24.360> any<00:04:24.660> one<00:04:24.900> of<00:04:24.930> those<00:04:25.290> is<00:04:25.500> going<00:04:25.890> to<00:04:25.980> set<00:04:26.130> it

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
then any one of those is going to set it

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.130 
then any one of those is going to set it
off<00:04:26.340> so<00:04:26.550> I<00:04:26.610> think<00:04:26.670> if<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.420> said<00:04:27.630> right<00:04:27.810> right

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
off so I think if I said right right

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.830 
off so I think if I said right right
here<00:04:28.880> so<00:04:29.880> if<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.060> click<00:04:30.120> right<00:04:30.510> there<00:04:30.540> it's

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
here so if I click right there it's

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.270 
here so if I click right there it's
gonna<00:04:30.930> open<00:04:31.110> if<00:04:31.350> I<00:04:31.440> click<00:04:31.650> right<00:04:31.890> there<00:04:31.920> it's

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
gonna open if I click right there it's

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.190 
gonna open if I click right there it's
going<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.490> open<00:04:32.580> if<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:32.940> click<00:04:33.150> right<00:04:33.420> I<00:04:33.660> don't

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
going to open if I click right I don't

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.690 
going to open if I click right I don't
know<00:04:34.290> where<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.500> set<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:34.860> over<00:04:34.920> here<00:04:35.100> but

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
know where I set it over here but

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.640 
know where I set it over here but
wherever<00:04:35.970> I<00:04:36.150> said<00:04:36.420> it<00:04:36.660> would<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.170> would<00:04:37.440> open

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
wherever I said it would it would open

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.770 
wherever I said it would it would open

that<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:51.990> know<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.470> should<00:04:52.710> note<00:04:52.890> in

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
that you know you should note in

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.440 
that you know you should note in
uniforms<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:53.820> couldn't<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.210> know<00:04:54.240> make

that middle one you know it set it off

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.630 
that middle one you know it set it off
um<00:04:56.730> a<00:04:56.870> few<00:04:57.870> little<00:04:58.020> tricks<00:04:58.260> guys<00:04:58.650> is<00:04:58.860> that<00:04:59.070> the

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
um a few little tricks guys is that the

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.420 
um a few little tricks guys is that the
only<00:04:59.820> person<00:05:00.390> that<00:05:00.570> can<00:05:00.810> set<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.560> set<00:05:02.220> these

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
only person that can set a set these

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.490 
only person that can set a set these
points<00:05:02.940> on<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.330> blocks<00:05:03.570> is<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:04.170> person<00:05:04.350> who

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
points on the blocks is the person who

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.630 
points on the blocks is the person who
placed<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:05.010> block<00:05:05.220> if<00:05:05.370> you're<00:05:05.520> on

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
placed the block if you're on

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.800 
placed the block if you're on
multiplayer<00:05:05.940> server<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:06.480> somebody<00:05:06.690> else

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
multiplayer server and somebody else

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.660 
multiplayer server and somebody else
place<00:05:07.080> that<00:05:07.260> you<00:05:07.380> cannot<00:05:07.740> place<00:05:07.980> it<00:05:08.160> unless

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
place that you cannot place it unless

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.210 
place that you cannot place it unless
you<00:05:09.210> first<00:05:09.450> go<00:05:09.750> into<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.110> config<00:05:10.620> file<00:05:10.920> and

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
you first go into the config file and

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.040 
you first go into the config file and
you<00:05:11.490> change<00:05:11.820> there<00:05:12.060> there's<00:05:12.390> a<00:05:12.480> setting<00:05:12.780> there

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
you change there there's a setting there

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.230 
you change there there's a setting there
so<00:05:13.440> that<00:05:13.470> other<00:05:14.040> other<00:05:14.640> people<00:05:14.970> who<00:05:15.060> aren't

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
so that other other people who aren't

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.370 
so that other other people who aren't
the<00:05:15.330> owner<00:05:15.510> can<00:05:15.660> actually<00:05:15.930> set<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.140> pressure

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
the owner can actually set the pressure

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.920 
the owner can actually set the pressure
points<00:05:16.800> but<00:05:17.190> as<00:05:17.370> of<00:05:17.640> you<00:05:17.940> know<00:05:18.060> default<00:05:18.540> you

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
points but as of you know default you

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.090 
points but as of you know default you
cannot<00:05:19.230> set<00:05:19.440> the<00:05:19.530> pressure<00:05:19.650> points<00:05:19.950> unless

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
cannot set the pressure points unless

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.290 
cannot set the pressure points unless
you<00:05:20.310> are<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.550> one<00:05:20.640> that<00:05:20.670> placed<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.060> block

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
you are the one that placed the block

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.820 
you are the one that placed the block
another<00:05:21.870> thing<00:05:22.020> to<00:05:22.050> know<00:05:22.200> is<00:05:22.230> if<00:05:22.440> you<00:05:22.530> hit<00:05:22.650> f3

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
another thing to know is if you hit f3

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.800 
another thing to know is if you hit f3
as<00:05:23.310> you<00:05:23.670> can<00:05:23.820> see<00:05:24.060> there's<00:05:24.360> there's<00:05:24.660> some

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
as you can see there's there's some

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.150 
as you can see there's there's some
points<00:05:25.110> over<00:05:25.320> here<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:25.620> I<00:05:25.650> can<00:05:25.800> actually<00:05:26.100> go

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
points over here and I can actually go

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.830 
points over here and I can actually go
go<00:05:26.400> boom<00:05:26.610> boom<00:05:27.090> and<00:05:27.360> you're<00:05:27.450> going<00:05:27.540> to<00:05:27.600> see<00:05:27.720> all

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
go boom boom and you're going to see all

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.570 
go boom boom and you're going to see all
these<00:05:27.990> points<00:05:28.230> appear<00:05:28.650> and<00:05:28.830> that<00:05:29.010> is<00:05:29.190> all<00:05:29.400> the

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
these points appear and that is all the

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.630 
these points appear and that is all the
pressure<00:05:29.820> points<00:05:31.040> for<00:05:32.040> these<00:05:32.340> these

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
pressure points for these these

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.040 
pressure points for these these
different<00:05:33.030> blocks<00:05:33.210> here<00:05:33.420> so<00:05:33.600> I<00:05:33.630> can<00:05:33.690> go<00:05:33.900> over

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
different blocks here so I can go over

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.240 
different blocks here so I can go over
here<00:05:34.230> you<00:05:34.380> guys<00:05:34.470> since<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.860> pressure<00:05:35.040> point

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
here you guys since the pressure point

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
here you guys since the pressure point
right<00:05:35.370> there<00:05:35.400> you<00:05:35.610> guys<00:05:35.700> to<00:05:35.850> see<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.090> pressure

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
right there you guys to see the pressure

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.240 
right there you guys to see the pressure
point<00:05:36.480> over<00:05:36.690> there<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:37.110> you<00:05:37.770> guys<00:05:37.890> can<00:05:38.100> see

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
point over there and you guys can see

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.310 
point over there and you guys can see
all<00:05:38.430> of<00:05:38.460> them<00:05:38.670> so<00:05:38.850> f3<00:05:39.510> mode<00:05:39.720> is<00:05:39.870> really<00:05:40.080> helpful

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
all of them so f3 mode is really helpful

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.900
