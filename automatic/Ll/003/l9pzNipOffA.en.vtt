00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.250 
was right next to the drugstore where i

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
showed you in that spot in the previous

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.939 
showed you in that spot in the previous
video<00:00:16.470> but<00:00:17.070> there's<00:00:17.550> no<00:00:18.410> patrol<00:00:19.410> around<00:00:19.560> them

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
video but there's no patrol around them

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.920 
video but there's no patrol around them
says<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.090> one<00:00:21.270> coming<00:00:21.510> up<00:00:21.660> behind<00:00:21.779> me<00:00:23.359> but

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.179 

other<00:00:27.930> than<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:30.109> it<00:00:31.109> looks<00:00:31.140> like<00:00:31.650> he's<00:00:32.009> going

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
other than that it looks like he's going

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:57.020 
other than that it looks like he's going
to<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.399> easy<00:00:32.640> pickings

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.689 

turn<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> fight<00:00:58.110> under<00:00:58.410> those<00:00:58.699> things

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
turn on a fight under those things

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.819 
turn on a fight under those things
there's<00:01:00.059> three<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.750> four<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.140> mine<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.620> it's

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
there's three to four of mine so it's

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.229 
there's three to four of mine so it's
just<00:01:01.949> easier<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> get<00:01:02.550> away<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> choice

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
just easier to get away and as a choice

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.600 
just easier to get away and as a choice
it<00:01:03.600> was<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> safe<00:01:04.140> house<00:01:04.350> already<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.339> can

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it was a safe house already that you can

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.160 
it was a safe house already that you can
duck<00:01:05.850> into<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:08.640> that's<00:01:09.000> probably<00:01:09.360> that's<00:01:09.990> I

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
duck into so that's probably that's I

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
duck into so that's probably that's I
think<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.590> easies

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.300 

found<00:01:20.120> this<00:01:21.120> wasn't<00:01:21.510> any<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.780> does

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
found this wasn't any so does

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.660 
found this wasn't any so does
that's<00:01:24.290> less<00:01:25.290> easiest<00:01:25.799> thought<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.040> found<00:01:26.460> that

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
that's less easiest thought I found that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.350 
that's less easiest thought I found that
you<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:28.460> get<00:01:29.460> some<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.759> tissue<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.149> make

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
you can get some that tissue to make

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.310 
you can get some that tissue to make
your<00:01:30.509> mods<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.350> got<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:31.710> get

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
your mods but you got to go get

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.120 
your mods but you got to go get
underwater<00:01:34.320> algae<00:01:35.030> which<00:01:36.049> as<00:01:37.049> far<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.070> know

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
underwater algae which as far as I know

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.710 
underwater algae which as far as I know
can<00:01:38.909> only<00:01:39.210> be<00:01:39.450> found<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.970> this<00:01:41.970> area<00:01:42.479> of

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
can only be found in this this area of

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.389 
can only be found in this this area of
the<00:01:42.750> map<00:01:43.020> over<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.679> there's<00:01:45.740> that<00:01:46.740> section

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the map over here there's that section

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.770 
the map over here there's that section
and<00:01:47.579> there's<00:01:47.789> normally<00:01:48.119> another<00:01:48.360> one<00:01:48.539> during

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and there's normally another one during

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.330 
and there's normally another one during
the<00:01:48.869> daytime<00:01:49.320> maybe<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.009> because<00:01:50.159> it's

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
the daytime maybe it's just because it's

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.700 
the daytime maybe it's just because it's
night<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.700> shadowed<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.470> find

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
night it shadowed in but you can find

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.460 
night it shadowed in but you can find
that<00:01:52.890> over<00:01:53.100> there<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.549> then<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:54.470> come

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
that over there and then you can come

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.020 
that over there and then you can come
down<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.709> and<00:01:56.220> you<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.429> meet<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.700> bolter

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
down here and you can meet the bolter

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.480 
down here and you can meet the bolter
poison<00:01:57.509> mod<00:01:57.659> which<00:01:57.929> does<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.830> fair<00:01:59.159> amount<00:01:59.250> of

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
poison mod which does a fair amount of

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.679 
poison mod which does a fair amount of
damage<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.030> your<00:02:00.179> heavy<00:02:01.140> weapons<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.689> your

one-handed I think it does around 59 for
those<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.890> 78<00:02:08.549> for<00:02:08.880> your<00:02:09.030> your<00:02:09.630> big<00:02:09.899> ones<00:02:10.110> so
