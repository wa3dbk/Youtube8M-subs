00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
many many people I'll TV another example

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.619 
many many people I'll TV another example
of<00:03:00.510> how<00:03:00.870> like<00:03:02.000> even<00:03:03.000> if<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.299> have<00:03:03.450> make<00:03:03.599> a

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
of how like even if you have make a

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.569 
of how like even if you have make a

great call of duty it may not sell

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:06.680 
great call of duty it may not sell

because it does have the name

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.839 
because it does have the name
recognition<00:03:06.920> let's<00:03:07.920> take<00:03:08.129> for<00:03:08.340> example<00:03:08.400> you

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
recognition let's take for example you

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.170 
recognition let's take for example you
know<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.450> Super<00:03:09.840> Mario<00:03:10.109> series<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:11.180> there's

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
like a wonderful very i'll link it to if

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.530 
like a wonderful very i'll link it to if
I<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.129> game<00:03:14.400> theory<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:14.819> basically<00:03:15.180> explains

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
I the game theory so basically explains

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.939 
I the game theory so basically explains
this<00:03:15.659> a<00:03:15.720> lot<00:03:15.930> better<00:03:16.169> than<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:16.470> do<00:03:16.530> by<00:03:16.829> just

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
this a lot better than I do by just

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:18.199 
this a lot better than I do by just
trying<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.250> explain<00:03:17.459> this<00:03:17.639> in<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.910> call<00:03:18.090> of

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
trying to explain this in the call of

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.430 
trying to explain this in the call of
duty<00:03:18.239> since<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:20.419> the<00:03:21.419> Super<00:03:21.780> Mario<00:03:22.049> Brothers

gains the 2d side score games they can

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.979 
gains the 2d side score games they can
basically<00:03:25.889> refresh<00:03:26.639> your<00:03:26.849> rehash<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.269> make

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
basically refresh your rehash it make

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.569 
basically refresh your rehash it make
make<00:03:28.349> little<00:03:28.680> better<00:03:28.829> graph<00:03:29.099> is<00:03:29.280> here<00:03:29.459> and

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
make little better graph is here and

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.569 
make little better graph is here and
there<00:03:29.669> but<00:03:29.730> it's<00:03:30.030> literally<00:03:30.389> the<00:03:30.419> same<00:03:30.840> game

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
there but it's literally the same game

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.339 
there but it's literally the same game
