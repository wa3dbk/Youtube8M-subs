00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
that I think that icon does a nice job

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.140 
that I think that icon does a nice job
of<00:02:55.500> incorporating<00:02:55.769> at<00:02:56.190> least<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.550> level<00:02:57.060> of

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
of incorporating at least a level of

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.610 
of incorporating at least a level of
protection<00:02:57.300> in<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.870> it's<00:02:58.319> going<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.530> be<00:02:58.590> a

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
protection in this it's going to be a

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.860 
protection in this it's going to be a
step<00:02:58.890> above<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.220> traditional<00:02:59.700> vest<00:02:59.970> now<00:03:00.569> Tony
