 ic recorder motion is in 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.869
 A little better sound appearance seen I think this design I'm pretty good or let's brackets of goods 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.490
 I like it 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.040
 Two microphones and a stereo microphone 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:56.020
 Zoom microphone in the center in a l and r 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:02:00.220
 The monitor remains at a reasonable size and the various buttons are almost all over the surface . 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:05.680
 Because everyone like my recorder is like this, when I look in from the side 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.730
 If you look at the microphone just outside the front just next to the outside, you can put an external microphone into the jack and headphones 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.100
 It has been queued Shi do

 This is so convenient that you can immediately transfer data to your computer in this ic sx 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.710
 The biggest feature of the war 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:45.560
 I put on the headphones a little U popular , but how this ic recorder 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:50.700
 It is the first cat 5 point feature, but you can play high res sound source 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:55.380
 It has become possible to reproduce the 192 khz 24-bit signal 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:00.730
 So the high resolution sound source I got in e onkyo 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:04.480
 Let's play the sound of high res when such a file is transferred to here 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:09.310
 S master who can and will be in that sony walkman 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.049
 Because it is also equipped with a digital amplifier to say that the feature is that the sound is very good 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.430
 Even as a music player 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:19.510
 Yeah it because it can be used as a music player to listen at a fairly high-quality sound 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.720
 It is often you are using as the image click players that the real voice recorder 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.220
 It is good I also have a battery 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.410
 Voice recorder for you of sx line in it from compared to its place in here ic 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.840
 But the voice of the things in it 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.890
 The adapter with that stand can be put in this way and put it in place 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.850
 I did not say 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.850

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.860

 It little is Saddle comes with a leather cover leather cover 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.620
 Well cheating 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.950
 It looks like a naked apron 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.780
 Flag comes with a hat for the enemy or I hope the type 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.440
 The wear and I Toka because it prevents it the sound of the wind ingredients in Well I think that can be used 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.370
 but 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.910
 Usa to it a little it is but something kinda cute not using in do this parentheses bad 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.490
 this guy 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:08.210
 What 's of sealed after the other in the Afro hair shop Sony 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:13.580
 I'd headphones came in that I have said or dot that I lost another 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:14.720
 This ic recorder is a very high performance and good product, but Uz's Anmari 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.830
 I do not use it 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:22.490
 In particular, I do not use most of it recently as a voice recorder 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.480
 But I'm think you can see your order and what say big 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.650
 Is not there iphone Usan 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.590
 So has entered chair recorder to this I is okay in other smartphone also then 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:36.220
 you know 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:37.030
 So if you want to take a sound on the audio side or something that you need, then put the phone and it's your brother 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.520
 That's right 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:47.350
 It's not so much anything I said in a different need to bring bother stone recorder is now 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.580
 Moreover, if it is a smartphone, the younger brother can attach it to an email as it is, and it is immediately with pc 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:54.500
 You can also send via wi-fi 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:58.460
 It is also here because I lucky end of here I also usb to say why such is the case you move 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:02.000
 It's easy, but I've always narrated videos, but at that time 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:06.259
 After all I took it here, but the sound is amazing. 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.289
 I wanted to say that it's already good I'm going to use voice-eco control, but I 'm sure this is a dedicated use 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:13.919
 Ne 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:17.009
 Firm sleeping because Makoto Hisashi because I lucky to music festival seat felt is hit in a totally different way 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:20.639
 I want to use ic recorder when I want to kill only voice 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:26.189
 However, I think that after all I would have to just use a smartphone to carry around usually 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:27.280
 This ne ic cx line We did a little introduction of this product a little more 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:27.990
 This kid who sells 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.170
 2 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:39.180
 Ic If a portable audio player I water is a good sound that I think they sell still probably 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.900
 The dcf line sounds very good, and it has become an ic recorder compatible with the old high res. 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.500
 Because 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.640
 Very recommended for those who want to use a voice recorder and an audio player together 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.980
 I think I can 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:53.080
 Media of music is also distributed free of charge at Sony 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.980
 You can use this application to transfer sound, so it's inconvenient at all 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.490
 Not 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:03.520
 In today's Sony configuration ic recorder ic sx 1000 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:07.969
 We have introduced you to another video 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:13.399
 As for the sound, I'm angry with what I took with my iphone 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:17.769
 Strong took the video that was little compared to the speech was to know there is no I think that I should try to up 

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:17.769
 I will take it for a while
