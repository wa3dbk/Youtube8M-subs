that<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.840> difference<00:02:09.200> between<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.709> two<00:02:09.890> by

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
that the difference between the two by

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.300 
that the difference between the two by
putting<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.120> in<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.630> we<00:02:12.620> can<00:02:12.650> make<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.130> just

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
putting that in and we can make it just

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.949 
putting that in and we can make it just
a<00:02:13.430> little<00:02:13.459> stronger<00:02:14.060> than<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.240> by<00:02:14.569> this<00:02:14.630> is<00:02:14.930> a

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
a little stronger than that by this is a

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.530 
a little stronger than that by this is a
Payne's<00:02:15.800> gray<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.580> ordinarily<00:02:17.000> if<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.420> were

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
Payne's gray and ordinarily if you were

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.540 
Payne's gray and ordinarily if you were
to<00:02:17.660> use<00:02:17.690> this<00:02:17.930> would<00:02:18.170> be<00:02:18.290> very<00:02:18.530> strong<00:02:18.920> but

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
to use this would be very strong but

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.839 
to use this would be very strong but
because<00:02:19.819> we're<00:02:20.030> putting<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.480> as<00:02:20.599> an<00:02:21.380> influence

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
because we're putting it as an influence

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.089 
because we're putting it as an influence
color<00:02:22.849> we<00:02:23.810> can<00:02:23.959> just<00:02:24.140> add<00:02:24.349> just<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.799> little<00:02:24.829> bit

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
color we can just add just a little bit

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.100 
color we can just add just a little bit
of<00:02:25.189> extra<00:02:25.340> depth

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
of extra depth

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.710 
of extra depth
i'm<00:02:27.440> also<00:02:27.740> here<00:02:28.220> i'm<00:02:28.460> going<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.820> drag<00:02:29.660> this

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
i'm also here i'm going to drag this

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.680 
i'm also here i'm going to drag this
across<00:02:30.110> some<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.680> blue<00:02:30.890> in<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.130> moment<00:02:31.690> like

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
across some of the blue in a moment like

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.170 
across some of the blue in a moment like
this<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.560> we<00:02:33.710> get<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.890> little<00:02:34.100> bit<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.460> dark

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
this so we get a little bit of dark

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.040 
this so we get a little bit of dark
cloud<00:02:36.050> coming<00:02:36.320> over<00:02:36.980> there<00:02:37.160> just<00:02:37.490> a<00:02:37.640> touch

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
cloud coming over there just a touch

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.730 
cloud coming over there just a touch
like<00:02:39.050> that<00:02:40.000> okay<00:02:41.000> now<00:02:41.930> I'll<00:02:42.140> complete<00:02:42.710> the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
like that okay now I'll complete the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.140 
like that okay now I'll complete the
rest<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.190> picture<00:02:43.490> and<00:02:43.520> we'll<00:02:43.730> see<00:02:43.940> how<00:02:44.090> it

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
rest of the picture and we'll see how it

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.820 
rest of the picture and we'll see how it
looks<00:02:44.390> now<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:47.150> finished<00:02:47.690> as<00:02:48.020> much<00:02:48.350> as<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.620> want

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.770 
looks now I finished as much as I want
to<00:02:48.860> do<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.280> don't<00:02:49.370> have<00:02:49.570> got<00:02:50.570> quite<00:02:50.690> a

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
to do that I don't have got quite a

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.360 
to do that I don't have got quite a
little<00:02:50.990> gray<00:02:51.200> over<00:02:51.470> here<00:02:51.680> but<00:02:51.890> not<00:02:52.130> too<00:02:52.340> much

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
little gray over here but not too much

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.360 
little gray over here but not too much
over<00:02:52.700> there<00:02:52.970> no<00:02:53.360> but<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.470> can<00:02:54.620> now<00:02:54.770> go<00:02:54.950> back<00:02:54.980> in

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
over there no but you can now go back in

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.320 
over there no but you can now go back in
and<00:02:55.780> add<00:02:56.780> more<00:02:57.080> white<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:58.100> picture<00:02:59.000> just

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
and add more white to the picture just

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.030 
and add more white to the picture just
give<00:02:59.660> them<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.900> may<00:03:00.080> be<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.230> bit<00:03:00.380> more<00:03:00.560> fluffy

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
give them it may be a bit more fluffy

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.910 
give them it may be a bit more fluffy
there<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:02.020> I<00:03:03.220> through<00:03:04.220> here<00:03:05.800> now<00:03:06.800> have

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
there and I through here now have

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.270 
there and I through here now have
already<00:03:07.040> done<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:07.430> but<00:03:07.760> I'm<00:03:07.880> just

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
already done this but I'm just

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.160 
already done this but I'm just
pretending<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.580> do<00:03:10.700> this<00:03:10.850> for<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.239> but<00:03:12.050> I've

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
pretending to do this for you but I've

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.570 
pretending to do this for you but I've
already<00:03:12.290> I've<00:03:12.650> already<00:03:12.830> gone<00:03:13.040> over<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.459> again

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
already I've already gone over it again

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.520 
already I've already gone over it again
to<00:03:14.030> save<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.270> lot<00:03:14.480> of<00:03:14.540> time<00:03:14.660> but<00:03:15.020> it's<00:03:15.290> quite

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
to save a lot of time but it's quite

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.190 
to save a lot of time but it's quite
time<00:03:15.770> consuming<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:17.630> there<00:03:17.810> we<00:03:17.870> are<00:03:17.900> we<00:03:18.080> can

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
time consuming so there we are we can

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.260 
time consuming so there we are we can
add<00:03:18.410> more<00:03:18.650> wiped<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.060> other<00:03:20.180> thing

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
add more wiped to it and the other thing

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.780 
add more wiped to it and the other thing
we<00:03:20.480> can<00:03:20.630> do<00:03:20.750> which<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.590> rather<00:03:21.739> exciting<00:03:22.340> as<00:03:22.580> we

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
we can do which is rather exciting as we

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.600 
we can do which is rather exciting as we
can<00:03:22.910> use<00:03:23.030> one<00:03:23.180> of<00:03:23.209> these<00:03:23.390> now<00:03:24.170> this<00:03:24.290> is<00:03:24.470> a

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
can use one of these now this is a

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.479 
can use one of these now this is a
polychrome<00:03:25.610> asst<00:03:25.820> past<00:03:26.720> will<00:03:26.900> stick<00:03:27.489> soft

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
polychrome asst past will stick soft

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.280 
polychrome asst past will stick soft

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
passel sticks are fine and you can use

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.100 
passel sticks are fine and you can use
those<00:03:30.470> too<00:03:30.770> but<00:03:30.950> I<00:03:31.580> hope<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:32.000> can<00:03:32.180> see<00:03:32.390> this<00:03:32.420> on

detail<00:04:33.830> in<00:04:34.099> through<00:04:34.430> here<00:04:34.900> which<00:04:35.900> is<00:04:35.990> going<00:04:36.080> to

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
detail in through here which is going to

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.830 
detail in through here which is going to
be<00:04:36.259> quite<00:04:36.530> strong<00:04:37.330> almost<00:04:38.330> silhouetted

be quite strong almost silhouetted

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.020

against<00:04:39.199> the<00:04:39.289> sky<00:04:39.409> that<00:04:40.159> sky<00:04:40.550> is<00:04:40.610> going<00:04:40.970> to

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
against the sky that sky is going to

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.390 
against the sky that sky is going to
melt<00:04:41.300> into<00:04:41.569> the<00:04:41.720> background<00:04:42.009> but<00:04:43.009> I<00:04:43.069> tell<00:04:43.280> you

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
melt into the background but I tell you

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.700 
melt into the background but I tell you
what<00:04:43.580> it's<00:04:43.879> going<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.090> look<00:04:44.150> cracking<00:04:44.710> let's

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
what it's going to look cracking let's

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.610 
what it's going to look cracking let's
say<00:04:46.150> it<00:04:47.150> wasn't<00:04:47.690> and<00:04:47.870> we<00:04:48.050> felt<00:04:48.319> that<00:04:48.379> we<00:04:48.500> needed

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
say it wasn't and we felt that we needed

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.830 
say it wasn't and we felt that we needed
to<00:04:48.979> water<00:04:49.250> a<00:04:49.400> little<00:04:49.520> bit<00:04:49.819> nothing<00:04:50.330> to<00:04:50.599> stop<00:04:50.810> us

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
to water a little bit nothing to stop us

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.600 
to water a little bit nothing to stop us
just<00:04:51.259> putting<00:04:51.620> our<00:04:51.710> finger<00:04:51.889> on<00:04:52.099> and<00:04:52.460> just

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
just putting our finger on and just

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.089 
just putting our finger on and just
changing<00:04:53.180> it<00:04:53.330> round<00:04:53.569> I<00:04:53.870> wouldn't<00:04:54.620> rub<00:04:54.830> it<00:04:54.949> out

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
changing it round I wouldn't rub it out

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:06.250 
changing it round I wouldn't rub it out
but<00:04:55.460> what<00:04:55.669> we<00:04:55.789> could<00:04:55.970> do<00:04:56.150> is<00:04:56.360> alter<00:04:56.690> it<00:04:57.759> great

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.320
