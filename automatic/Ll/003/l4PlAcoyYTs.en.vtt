00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.490
 video in this one I'll teach you to do this 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.700
 makeup 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.650
 julian wilson for day to day is the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.679
 that I usually do every day and 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.410
 I hope you like it a lot and like this 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.500
 Daily I do not use contact lenses 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.750
 well we will start with a bikini I use 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.400
 at this time the mineral pressure of 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.609
 fact cause in the color more clarito and is 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.719
 a very good bicrim has a protector 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:38.010
 of 30 and although my favorite is still 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:41.760
 the orange the skin seven and night 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.600
 I would apply it with a touch 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.350
 makeup sponge that previously 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.350
 moistened with a cream 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.710
 I will use a concealer for my dark circles 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.360
 This is from vogue I have some dark circles 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.970
 rather 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.970
 but well at least it gave me a little 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.299
 apply the concealer to taps and 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.869
 then I will blur it with the 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.869
 lace 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
 two 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:27.509
 use in teaspoon to curl my 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.359
 eyelashes normally on a day to day basis 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.920
 I put mascara on only me 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.920
 cresto fans 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.220
 I will use my black aligner is 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.520
 anyone the truth is that I like 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.380
 much my mom just gave me 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.829
 I make the same line of makeup 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.960
 previous I do not like to apply measures the 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.700
 eyeliner is the lacrimal I do not like 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.369
 as you see me there were many and you 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.439
 I look very nice I do with 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.320
 pencil eyeliner there is a lot of light to 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.320
 enrique and also look very good 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.210
 I will make this brochita angular and with a 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.149
 little bit of shade or coffee we are going to seal 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.270
 the eyeliner so that it does not run 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.880
 last us all day I like that effect 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.320
 so there is also a little 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.620
 smoked and it is very nice I apply it 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.130
 taps to completely seal the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.130
 fear 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.760
 yes 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.390
 without applying more products I make a 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.270
 little tail in with the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.580
 same brochita and diffuse it a little 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.200
 with my girl you can be with everything 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.200
 a brush or a brush 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.840
 I will use is for umbrellas and I will take 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.350
 a white shadow to illuminate the area 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.790
 of my tears 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.790
 only with very little 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.410
 I will use a moisturizer and to be 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.890
 full of these I will use the color 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.500
 stick of the riva and is a pink is 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.190
 a crayon 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:40.530
 and it has a very nice effect on this there 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.530
 in pink in red and in orange 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.750
 and I'm going to blur the dots with my 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.890
 fingers you can also do it with some 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.890
 unfair brushes 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.690
 and 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:14.299
 I will use a little decision 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.340
 and I'll put it over my lips 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.150
 it does not have a number so I do not know what number 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.150
 wait 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.960
 as a blush I will use the day of and the one 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.599
 today I'm going to be is number 2 is a 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.840
 rosita and comes with its own applicator 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:41.639
 It is very useful , I say, and it also brings a 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.569
 mirror on top and what 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.569
 applied to patches 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.230
 And finally just brush a little bit my 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.110
 hair you can use some accessory and in 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.720
 this case I will use some little ears 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.910
 I hope you liked this 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.610

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.710
