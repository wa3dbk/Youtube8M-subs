00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.300
 knitting american gum 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:30.010
 first we collect the number of needles 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:36.840
 loops which is a multiple of three and two more 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.840
 edge loops first loop 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:56.829
 then knit 2 face loops 1 and 2 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:01:04.320
 and knit 1 purl loop further 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:04.320
 repeat knit 2 facial loops and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.460
 wrong side and so knit to the end of the row 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.640
 and knit the last loop 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.640
 purl loop 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:57.980
 first row ready now knitting 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:06.210
 turn over and begin to knit 2 row 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:09.680
 we remove the first loop and then we knit 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.680
 one face loop 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:21.140
 after this we do a nakid and knit 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:28.320
 2 more face loops following 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:34.230
 the eyelets now catch the cape with the left 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:36.660
 Knitting needles and dragging the last two 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:47.370
 loops through this 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:54.930
 wrap up like that we repeat we knit one 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:03:06.290
 knit the front loop then knit 2 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:08.480
 facial loops and capturing 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:15.209
 left knitting needle 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:18.870
 we pull the last two loops through 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:28.610
 this nakid and now that's ready and continue so 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:28.610
 before the end of the row, front cover 2 facial 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:42.560
 then grab the nakid and drag 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.560
 last two loops through it 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.910
 last time 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.070
 last loop knit purl 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:17.450
 then repeat the knitting 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.450
 alternating the first and second rows 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:27.330
 It turns out that this gum is very 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:30.630
 beautiful but not very elastic but with 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.050
 of the back side, it looks completely 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.050
 differently
