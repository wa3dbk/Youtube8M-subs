 bigger swords then good at the 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.670
 description against all that then 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.650
 you can download it you know it has 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.510
 that go to the universe and success page 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.980
 on my facebook page found what 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.420
 is the latest version of grunge and if not 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.640
 they do not have to install anymore they know they have 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.850
 that unzip zip files and there's the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.020
 texture pack and js point well then 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.390
 let's explain everything about the 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.800
 champions of the shields as you can see 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.060
 they are different shields which 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.250
 they also have their updates 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.380
 The three main shields are these 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.260
 the wooden shield that what 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.170
 we would be with what they are 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.840
 66 cubes works normally and 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.580
 next one of this piece called leader 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.920
 no no but it works but it was good 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.300
 we would try is the main the main 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.740
 The next shield would be the stone 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.570
 the one of convulsion we compose what they are 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.830
 six of cobos are and what is the leader 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.600
 the next would be the iron in which 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.759
 let's deal with and iron English in a 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.770
 leader and here we have the one of 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.050
 iron are the four main this 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.850
 good shields and the latter what 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.479
 we want with what toys are called 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.990
 you things giving thus what a leader is 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.610
 well these shields have their 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.080
 update which we are going to occupy gold 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.789
 what does this help us 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.289
 update but we simply 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.429
 will help what is a little bit more than 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:51.740
 protection and what is the smallest load in 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.060
 charge what is covered of shield not 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.759
 it's good to change them simply 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.679
 Come on , you know the shield that we already 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.810
 we had previously bought before and 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.280
 we remove them from gold with good six with 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.680
 six gold and you will simply be at 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.690
 day of what is this 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.750
 each one of these shields like the 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.990
 update they are called god of the sun 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.390
 and good now how we punish them 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.310
 we're just going to touch the floor and like 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.100
 you can see we get one where as a 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.680
 load which this will indicate when 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.810
 already the shield is loaded each each 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.690
 shield depending on your material then 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.970
 is going to have a different charge and how 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.830
 I told them what helps us in the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.350
 gold update because it will help us 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.730
 what is this a lesser burden of each 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.100
 it's how it protects us from any enemy 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.100
 just we touch the floor and after 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.840
 finish what is the burden on him of the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.870
 good load of this one because it would last longer 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.100
 or yes and well and the other thing that we 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.260
 would do as I told you are the super 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.300
 swords is well wallace we would try very 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.010
 we simply put them a little 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.850
 obviously a little more material 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.070
 of the commons already know about iron and 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.810
 all this hair like we can check all 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.280
 the champions here as you can see 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.140
 here the first one and it's good we're going to 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.239
 take out the iron store as we have it 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.310
 with how many are 6 iron and what is a 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.240
 stick the next one to see let's go girl 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.880
 over here the gold as the portfolio 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.330
 six gold six ingots of gold and what 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.050
 which is a stick and the next would be the 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.740
 gold installed 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.740
 diamond room 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.880
 you will see that there is the diamond one and then the 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.920
 we get the same with what are six 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.819
 they call tuco if what is a stick and I 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.560
 missing one that is the main 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.240
 simply the most basic that is the 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.880
 let's make the cheapest one for that of the 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.680
 wood always not and good each one of them 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.910
 has different attack power you know 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.450
 that of the golden one of the dear one of 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.250
 is diamond because it goes down faster and 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.170
 the others equal the detainee of his 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.730
 material but they are all very powerful and 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.960
 well, this has been the whole bike 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.250
 I hope you liked it already you know in 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.200
