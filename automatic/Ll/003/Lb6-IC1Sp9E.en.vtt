 earnings accumulate damage when I use them 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.300

 this will take off and marry this red e 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.209
 then buy the other cable splitter 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.820

 dubber and connect this white e 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:59.260
 this white to the dubber and then 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:02.239
 naturally connect these 3 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.450
 these three respectively to these 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:09.140
 three other settings are three and three 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.780
 easy on just go on settings 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.769
 Display I can put HDMI 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.049
 put of the cable of terminal where there 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.540
 sara lee may these three cables is 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.540
 when setting put ab multi 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.659
 scart and only these two will come out 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.739
 cables is so you can thesis to play with 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:33.590
 headphones play and whether 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:38.169
 record that play with headphones 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:42.139
 so both is the grade and headphones px3 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:45.560
 or even turtle beach for what it is 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:47.810
 also high turtle beach and headphones 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.989
 similar who have these enters of which 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.239
 they have no key places here and no boys 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.090
 the video was finished there were only three 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.189
 videos for highs to tell him that I had 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:04.190
 a connection problem 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:05.780
 in fact there was the other day that I was 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.780
 yes it suddenly came off me and 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.609
 called yours they told me 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.479
 that there was a technical problem for 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:17.479
 what about my connection that 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:21.500
 let's say it aims to precisely decrease the 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.510
 download and to fix this vast 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.740
 they had to disconnect the connection e 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.800
 for 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.930
 tomorrow you should arrive tomorrow 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.620
 it works because there really is on the internet 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.620
 Apparently historical fact been're seeing 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.620
 tomorrow 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.150
 on the internet I can only go there 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:46.300
 with ps3 it doesn't let me connect to al 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.030
 playstation network is therefore going to be same 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.979
 a problem maybe on ps3 is more 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.650
 sensitive needs more connection 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.000
 strange though I think that after having 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.340
 solved this problem with the telecom 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.990
 of selling all bern I tried to 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.699
 centralizing the modern was fine 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.069
 however, I think the problem is there 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.909
 this I have not dwelt for a while 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:08.590
 too my kids for my destiny 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.050
 some if they like left like 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.289
 if you want to continue watching videos of 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:18.599
 black ops 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:22.439
