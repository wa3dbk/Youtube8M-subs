00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:23.210
 i thinking already in the american of the next game we are at the table 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.479
 tribune fox and forales antonio carlos santos fabián estay bonifacio núñez 

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:27.119
 vega 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.759
 luqueño days the president of the town ricardo ojeda m there he listens to us of the 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.190

 he also greeted and gave everything 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.540
 well the first question follows 2% how to start the year as a table 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.160
 almonte kings explained to us technical soto a few days ago the 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.410
 interviewed that 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.250
 has little time there will be that vacation that the team does not because it is not at its 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.600
 better level, however, which win they were going to look for a ticket in Santander 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.360
 liberators of the good the important thing is that 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.800
 little by little go grabbing the rhythm that 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.490
 what should we have and 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.880
 and obviously 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.200
 Personally, they also choose 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.170
 a barral physical rhythm 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.450
 I believe you 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.350
 that we kept it from the last tournament and if with that mystique I did not continue with that 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.450
 mystical of 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.350
 in the winning mentality that is that it has not been done well and 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.750
 and try to settle when little by little not by endowing force and good night 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.690
 boots when he does very well congratulations good year 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.630
 when it happened to them about the war that with the two archives 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.320
 those of us who love football know what was flagrant sunny in hand and the 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.780
 graph and stays but the truth many congratulations 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.080
 p aldo 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.510
 tuc tuc proposed for this year part go to the liberators cup which are 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.830
 really are to lead the national team and the world because we have 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.510
 promoted a lot antonio combo nippon so there was no I think that 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.030
 the accident is a very important possibility 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.450
 I think you need 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.770
 play again at that same level is recovering but I think that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.359
 this one says that it's soon four and a half months away I think he needs the 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:57.780
 selection and yourself 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.800
 Vicente Maple to be in that process 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.250
 pc obviously 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.500
 they are personal goals that they do not have or the truth that 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.980
 which is a dream of tomic personal longing 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.379
 it's a dream that 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.939
 I have but I think that as you commented it is not this afternoon to keep 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:17.579
 that level continue to work with humility and and I think this is not followed 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.879
 in one trying to do things right within his team 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.009
 and hopefully and 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:24.409
 and continue the same as the important event that is the most difficult 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.179
 stay and not 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.059
 How about a hug 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.949
 for your brother and this year also that there is a lot of health 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:38.109
 initially in that game the first time we saw a monterrey and enlarged 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.259
 remember that the greater the hierarchy, the greater the responsibility 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:46.769
 really monterrey and is internalized in that responsibility of 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.449
 be champion of mexico 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.030
 I believe that yes I think it is a very lively challenge 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.069
 very strong 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.769
 as what is increasing right now I think that now comes the difficult thing does not come what 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.289
 difficult because but what 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:01.129
 that the difficult thing is to keep that level to stay the same 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.509
 and I think the team is psyched to it 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:07.679
 the truth that we are working very hard with humility the team is 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:08.749
 very united and 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:13.430
 and you have to search is or not match after match and and step by step but but I think 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:14.569
 that the team 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.689
 I think it's fine and little by little talking after level 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.009
 today I am with flavor to nights my best wishes to acquire a very sensation 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:23.829
 great states in a great job 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.899
 as well said fabian 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:28.949
 Networks of those deserving of an opportunity are in the selection but 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:33.019
 not as we did nobody knew that maybe you have to take issues 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.779
 time to see how far I can go 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:39.659
 but I wonder directives from a little founded rather to what said bonino 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.889
 more than enlarged and it seems that 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.989
 I see them a very good team, a team that 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.559
 cross what happens the bean bag takes a long time I do not think I'm calling 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:55.889
 serious it does not seem like you do not feel powerless but you 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.319
 team inside the court peace and I walk when you're playing a 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.379
 important tournament to search 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.480
 aa a personal thing for you to internationalize out there having the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.249
 opportunity that has been seen so that everyone 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.519
 but out of the country 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.939
 tacuara will be able to take out another team 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.779
 really what is that the worst forgive me but 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:19.019
 but this is played as a team not when the team is doing well one also walks 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.769
 good things are facilitated 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.180
 I believe that 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.900
 that was produced but having the ball we have players that is very very 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.050
 well the ball 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.969
 this but 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:32.669
 in that game and I think that there has been missing a little more layoffs the front 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.090
 be more vertical 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.159
 I think that in this game there were more more goal actions 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.590
 and little by little I'm going to grab onto that, it's not so easy 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.889
 and I think we are improving that is spoken in sidor tone has been spoken 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.580
 we are aware of this and simply that we continue to work for 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.400
 improve that and and improve both footballingly another question already for 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.790
 paralyze giraldo 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.260
 you already know the rival is America a team that has been playing very well in 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.370
 this 2010 in fact here we commented on the largest stand 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.129
 of the world 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.580
 the first half of the seventh game against tecos the time it gets better 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.409
 medicare a lot of time 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.849
 you want the line of the last league this match they think that 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:11.589
 pemex 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:13.839
 but very complicated match 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:17.619
 America look at it when the tournament was very well done too 

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:23.289
 comic-with very important players and obviously you have to look for 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.889
 work before the match 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.820
 be well standing and not despair cut I spent a very difficult game and 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.330
 we know how it comes when the average but I think but paper and speak to you 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.830
 you how we did it well 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.740
 in the league and and nothing else that notices late mentalize us in search of winning 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.280
 parties appreciate their valuable time nor are they going to all the celestial squad for 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.650
 recall in the lipton cup that the fabia greet him for it he wished sometimes 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.379
 moral values ​​a hug to basketball 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:51.840
 thank you thanks to the attack 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.199
 we will return with you 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.099
 little by little percent more 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.219
 go ahead and let's see the summary of the first
