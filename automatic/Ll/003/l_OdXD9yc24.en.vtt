a look here at the Tom Berenger this is
my<00:00:10.769> sniper<00:00:11.010> class<00:00:11.599> and<00:00:12.599> I'm<00:00:12.750> using<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.280> m110

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
my sniper class and I'm using the m110

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.359 
my sniper class and I'm using the m110
sniper<00:00:15.139> opposed<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.500> other<00:00:16.710> sniper<00:00:17.010> rifle

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
sniper opposed to the other sniper rifle

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.740 
sniper opposed to the other sniper rifle
which<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.609> like<00:00:17.910> an<00:00:18.029> intervention<00:00:18.300> for<00:00:18.570> call

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
which is like an intervention for call

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.920 
which is like an intervention for call
duty<00:00:19.430> because<00:00:20.430> uh<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:21.449> anything<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.720> unlocked

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
duty because uh it's anything I unlocked

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.929 
duty because uh it's anything I unlocked
right<00:00:22.050> now<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.470> think<00:00:22.590> I'm<00:00:22.740> like<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.890> sixteen<00:00:23.820> or

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
right now I think I'm like a sixteen or

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.410 
right now I think I'm like a sixteen or
seventeen<00:00:24.000> ranking<00:00:24.769> but<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.070> used<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.820> RPG

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
seventeen ranking but I used the RPG

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.720 
seventeen ranking but I used the RPG
launcher<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:28.170> every<00:00:28.470> class<00:00:28.710> if<00:00:29.279> somebody<00:00:29.640> has

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
launcher on every class if somebody has

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.720 
launcher on every class if somebody has
a<00:00:29.760> vehicle<00:00:30.269> I'd<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:32.009> able<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.189> EMP<00:00:32.610> it

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
a vehicle I'd like to be able to EMP it

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.430 
a vehicle I'd like to be able to EMP it
that's<00:00:33.030> why<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> EMP<00:00:33.600> grenade<00:00:34.290> on

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that's why I have the EMP grenade on

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.860 
that's why I have the EMP grenade on
every<00:00:34.620> class<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.160> may<00:00:35.820> switch<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.180> out<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:36.300> c4

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
every class I may switch it out for c4

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.479 
every class I may switch it out for c4
when<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.230> want<00:00:37.500> unlock<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.370> like

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
when I want unlock it I think it's like

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.319 
when I want unlock it I think it's like
level<00:00:38.820> 22<00:00:39.090> or<00:00:39.420> something<00:00:39.540> like<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:41.329> but

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
level 22 or something like that but

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.180 
level 22 or something like that but
basically<00:00:42.719> if<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.140> Humvee<00:00:43.440> or<00:00:43.469> tank<00:00:44.040> or

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
basically if a Humvee or tank or

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.279 
basically if a Humvee or tank or
something<00:00:44.460> comes<00:00:44.610> by<00:00:44.820> use<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:45.629> EMP<00:00:45.989> grenade

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
something comes by use your EMP grenade

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.350 
something comes by use your EMP grenade
iymp<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.489> take<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.760> out<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.000> larger

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
iymp it and I take it out for larger

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.959 
iymp it and I take it out for larger
since<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.629> have<00:00:48.780> c4<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.430> usually<00:00:50.670> don't

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
since I'm have c4 and I usually don't

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.139 
since I'm have c4 and I usually don't
use<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.210> flak<00:00:51.449> jacket<00:00:51.899> I'm<00:00:52.699> not<00:00:53.699> sure<00:00:53.969> about

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
use the flak jacket I'm not sure about

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.750 
use the flak jacket I'm not sure about
it<00:00:54.449> yet<00:00:54.809> especially<00:00:54.989> sniping<00:00:55.800> but<00:00:56.039> I'll<00:00:56.610> show

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
it yet especially sniping but I'll show

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.580 
it yet especially sniping but I'll show
you<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> don't<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.210> any<00:00:57.329> kill<00:00:58.230> streaks<00:00:58.469> or

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
you I don't have any kill streaks or

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.349 
you I don't have any kill streaks or
anything<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.340> my<00:00:59.579> next<00:00:59.820> video<00:01:00.120> you'll

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
anything on here in my next video you'll

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.200 
anything on here in my next video you'll
have<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.600> watch<00:01:01.190> so<00:01:02.190> there's<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> reason<00:01:03.090> why<00:01:03.180> I

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
have to watch so there's a reason why I

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.479 
have to watch so there's a reason why I
don't<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.510> any<00:01:03.539> missiles<00:01:04.379> or<00:01:04.650> drones<00:01:05.309> or

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
don't have any missiles or drones or

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.149 
don't have any missiles or drones or
anything<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.890> but<00:01:07.890> let's

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
anything like that on here but let's

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.030 
anything like that on here but let's
take<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.670> look<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.299> at<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.930> primary<00:01:10.619> weapon

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
take a look here at the primary weapon

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.730 
take a look here at the primary weapon
first<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:12.540> has<00:01:12.750> no<00:01:13.080> attachments<00:01:13.650> available

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
first it has no attachments available

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.070 
first it has no attachments available
for<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> sniper<00:01:14.640> rifle<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:17.750> it's<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.840> little

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
for the sniper rifle but it's a little

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.980 
for the sniper rifle but it's a little
bit<00:01:19.200> more<00:01:19.409> weaker<00:01:20.360> than<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.890> M<00:01:22.890> 200<00:01:23.840> but<00:01:24.840> as

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
bit more weaker than the M 200 but as

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.240 
bit more weaker than the M 200 but as
you<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.320> has<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> bigger<00:01:25.770> rate<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.040> fire

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
you can see has a bigger rate of fire

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.160 
you can see has a bigger rate of fire
the<00:01:27.210> m10<00:01:27.799> actually<00:01:29.360> holds<00:01:30.360> 10<00:01:30.570> rounds<00:01:30.600> as

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the m10 actually holds 10 rounds as

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.060 
the m10 actually holds 10 rounds as
opposed<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.130> 5<00:01:32.640> rounds<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:34.500> one<00:01:34.680> has<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> four

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
opposed to 5 rounds this one has a four

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.910 
opposed to 5 rounds this one has a four
times<00:01:35.310> fire<00:01:35.549> soap<00:01:35.850> that's<00:01:36.450> thermal<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.740> one

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
times fire soap that's thermal this one

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.929 
times fire soap that's thermal this one
has<00:01:38.430> an<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.700> thermal<00:01:39.210> three<00:01:39.630> time<00:01:39.810> scope<00:01:40.140> so

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
has an on thermal three time scope so

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.639 
has an on thermal three time scope so
guess<00:01:41.939> has<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> little<00:01:42.630> bit<00:01:42.720> we're<00:01:42.869> range<00:01:43.350> since

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
guess has a little bit we're range since

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.469 
guess has a little bit we're range since
you<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.860> see<00:01:44.040> better<00:01:44.630> but<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:47.240> getaway<00:01:48.240> your

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
you can see better but the getaway your

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.789 
you can see better but the getaway your
difference<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.960> I'm<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.350> use<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.590> one

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
difference is I'm going to use this one

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.249 
difference is I'm going to use this one
so<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.640> can't<00:01:50.970> really<00:01:51.090> rate<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:51.990> there<00:01:52.170> will

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
so I can't really rate it but there will

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.420 
so I can't really rate it but there will
be<00:01:52.380> nice<00:01:52.560> because<00:01:52.590> there's<00:01:53.070> always<00:01:53.220> people

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
be nice because there's always people

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.719 
be nice because there's always people
like<00:01:53.729> hiding<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.360> weeds<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.930> trees<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.500> like

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
like hiding in weeds and trees and like

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.069 
like hiding in weeds and trees and like

snipers<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.680> game<00:01:59.360> and<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.600> fun<00:02:00.630> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
snipers on this game and it's fun and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.510 
snipers on this game and it's fun and
easiest<00:02:01.350> knife<00:02:01.619> but<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:01.979> not<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.280> quick

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
easiest knife but it's not like quick

easiest knife but it's not like quick
scoping<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.299> more<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:04.939> battlefield

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
scoping it's more like battlefield

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.300 
scoping it's more like battlefield
middle<00:02:06.360> Vaughn<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.659> kind<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.930> sniping

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
distance so you might not need the
