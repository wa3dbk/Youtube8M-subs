00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
based off of the cartoon networkcartoon

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.790 
based off of the cartoon networkcartoon
and<00:00:24.720> I'm<00:00:24.779> going<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.960> start<00:00:25.140> by<00:00:25.199> creating<00:00:25.650> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
and I'm going to start by creating a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.820 
and I'm going to start by creating a
character<00:00:25.980> using<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.180> randomized<00:00:27.840> set<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.590> name

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830

so<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.130> can<00:00:29.279> see<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:30.000> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.269> kind<00:00:30.840> of

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
so you can see it's going to be kind of

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.870 
so you can see it's going to be kind of
a<00:00:31.050> couple<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.349> adjectives<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.070> noun<00:00:32.850> and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
also an avatar that i can pick through

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.580 
also an avatar that i can pick through
using<00:00:35.899> some<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> different<00:00:37.469> characters

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590

assist so I'm running forward you do get

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.910 
assist so I'm running forward you do get
like<00:03:43.599> a<00:03:43.689> really<00:03:43.959> big<00:03:44.230> run<00:03:44.500> boost<00:03:44.709> when<00:03:44.829> you

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
like a really big run boost when you

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.869 
like a really big run boost when you
come<00:03:45.069> out<00:03:46.409> other<00:03:47.409> than<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.709> in<00:03:48.069> terms<00:03:48.700> of

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
come out other than that in terms of

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.490 
come out other than that in terms of
simplicity<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:51.489> map<00:03:51.760> reminds<00:03:52.269> me<00:03:52.450> of<00:03:52.720> smites

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
simplicity the map reminds me of smites

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.500 
simplicity the map reminds me of smites
map<00:03:53.799> when<00:03:53.980> it<00:03:54.069> first<00:03:54.549> came<00:03:54.879> out<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:55.389> that

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
map when it first came out and that

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.780 
map when it first came out and that
there's<00:03:55.720> only<00:03:55.780> like<00:03:55.959> one<00:03:56.680> one<00:03:57.159> or<00:03:57.190> two<00:03:57.370> towers

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
there's only like one one or two towers

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.240 
there's only like one one or two towers
and<00:03:57.940> you're<00:03:58.120> there<00:03:58.269> a<00:03:59.019> little<00:03:59.709> bit<00:03:59.859> of<00:03:59.980> creeps

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
and you're there a little bit of creeps

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.610 
and you're there a little bit of creeps
but<00:04:00.519> not<00:04:00.700> tons<00:04:01.120> so<00:04:01.900> it's<00:04:02.170> not<00:04:02.290> going<00:04:02.439> to<00:04:02.530> be

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
but not tons so it's not going to be

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.589 
but not tons so it's not going to be
nearly<00:04:02.859> as<00:04:03.159> complex<00:04:03.700> or<00:04:03.970> his<00:04:04.090> dense<00:04:04.329> and<00:04:04.480> other

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
nearly as complex or his dense and other

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.479 
nearly as complex or his dense and other
gangs<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:05.500> see<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:05.799> was<00:04:05.920> just<00:04:06.129> a<00:04:06.220> little

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
gangs you see that was just a little

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.750 
gangs you see that was just a little
pack<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.819> three<00:04:07.780> basic<00:04:08.409> jungle<00:04:08.799> mobs<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.250> it

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
pack of three basic jungle mobs and it

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.949 
pack of three basic jungle mobs and it
took<00:04:09.909> me<00:04:09.939> to<00:04:10.090> half<00:04:10.269> health<00:04:10.480> I'm<00:04:10.659> gonna<00:04:10.780> have<00:04:10.870> to

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
took me to half health I'm gonna have to

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.899 
took me to half health I'm gonna have to
run<00:04:11.079> back<00:04:13.260> eventually<00:04:14.260> you'll<00:04:14.379> be<00:04:14.470> able<00:04:14.590> to

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
run back eventually you'll be able to

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.520 
run back eventually you'll be able to
push<00:04:15.909> in<00:04:16.150> towards<00:04:16.449> your<00:04:16.509> opponent's<00:04:16.959> base<00:04:17.109> and

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
push in towards your opponent's base and

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.569 
push in towards your opponent's base and
you<00:04:17.769> can<00:04:17.859> see<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:17.949> music's<00:04:18.280> get<00:04:18.400> a<00:04:18.430> little

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
you can see the music's get a little

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.849 
you can see the music's get a little
more<00:04:18.639> epic<00:04:18.970> astre<00:04:19.150> pushing<00:04:19.419> forward<00:04:19.829> he's<00:04:20.829> a

more epic astre pushing forward he's a

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.279 
more epic astre pushing forward he's a
lie<00:04:21.609> a<00:04:21.970> liar<00:04:22.270> were<00:04:22.419> there<00:04:22.570> is<00:04:22.690> actually<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.020> tart

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
lie a liar were there is actually a tart

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.110 
lie a liar were there is actually a tart
detecting<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.830> target<00:04:24.250> from<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.729> tower<00:04:24.940> and

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
detecting the target from the tower and

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.710 
detecting the target from the tower and
while<00:04:25.389> we're<00:04:26.130> still<00:04:27.210> fighting<00:04:28.210> creeps<00:04:28.510> off

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
while we're still fighting creeps off

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.140 
while we're still fighting creeps off
and<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:30.039> can<00:04:30.099> see<00:04:30.370> there<00:04:30.699> was<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:30.910> bit<00:04:31.060> of

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
and you can see there was a bit of

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.210 
and you can see there was a bit of
latency<00:04:31.510> there<00:04:31.810> I<00:04:31.840> dieded<00:04:32.229> the<00:04:32.320> tower<00:04:32.530> after<00:04:33.190> I

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
latency there I dieded the tower after I

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.909 
latency there I dieded the tower after I
walked<00:04:33.550> out<00:04:33.729> of<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:33.970> area<00:04:34.180> fact<00:04:34.659> oops<00:04:35.169> my

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.350 

so<00:05:17.950> then<00:05:18.280> it's<00:05:18.430> so<00:05:18.700> matches<00:05:19.690> almost<00:05:20.080> half<00:05:20.590> over

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
so then it's so matches almost half over

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.820 
so then it's so matches almost half over
you<00:05:22.360> can<00:05:22.480> see<00:05:22.660> looks<00:05:22.870> like<00:05:23.050> we're<00:05:23.410> talking<00:05:23.560> at

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
you can see looks like we're talking at

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.650 
you can see looks like we're talking at
our<00:05:24.010> towards<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.460> bottom<00:05:24.610> right<00:05:24.910> now<00:05:25.030> so<00:05:25.360> and

pushing up into the enemy base one of

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.270 
pushing up into the enemy base one of
they<00:05:29.500> can<00:05:29.620> look<00:05:29.740> for<00:05:29.860> words<00:05:29.980> you<00:05:30.040> see<00:05:30.160> those

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
they can look for words you see those

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.880 
they can look for words you see those
pluses<00:05:30.850> with<00:05:31.060> the<00:05:31.410> like<00:05:32.410> kind<00:05:32.650> of<00:05:32.710> looks<00:05:32.830> like
