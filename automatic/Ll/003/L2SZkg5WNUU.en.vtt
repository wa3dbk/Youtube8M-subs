00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
produced I mean some people don't like

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.030 
produced I mean some people don't like
it<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.390> has<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.780> option<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.470> traction

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040

control but frankly I don't really care

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.160 
control but frankly I don't really care
because<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.700> thing<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.090> beast<00:01:45.180> if<00:01:45.960> no

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
awesome they really are and I say of

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.610 
awesome they really are and I say of
course<00:02:37.390> right<00:02:37.750> as<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:37.989> go<00:02:38.109> off<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.379> track<00:02:38.409> I

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
course right as I go off the track I

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.830 
course right as I go off the track I
mean<00:02:38.829> that<00:02:39.010> corner<00:02:39.400> was<00:02:39.970> just<00:02:40.209> an<00:02:40.329> absolute

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
mean that corner was just an absolute

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.720 
mean that corner was just an absolute
mess<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.859> reason<00:02:42.189> why<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.370> think<00:02:42.549> that

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
mess the reason why I think that

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.780 
mess the reason why I think that
happened<00:02:43.329> was<00:02:43.959> because<00:02:44.139> this<00:02:44.889> car<00:02:45.189> is<00:02:45.220> really

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
happened was because this car is really

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.030 
happened was because this car is really
grippy<00:02:46.450> um<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.920> its<00:02:48.909> it's<00:02:49.120> got<00:02:49.329> this<00:02:49.540> snap<00:02:50.169> grip

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
grippy um in its it's got this snap grip

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.670 
grippy um in its it's got this snap grip
which<00:02:51.340> is<00:02:51.489> which<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.909> odd<00:02:52.180> but<00:02:53.049> it's<00:02:53.319> what<00:02:53.590> it

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
which is which is odd but it's what it

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.679 
which is which is odd but it's what it
is<00:02:53.829> is<00:02:54.010> because<00:02:54.159> why<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.090> happens<00:02:55.450> is<00:02:55.569> because

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 
is is because why it happens is because

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.770 
is is because why it happens is because
the<00:02:56.560> rear<00:02:56.799> tires<00:02:57.069> are<00:02:57.459> so<00:02:57.790> incredibly<00:02:58.389> wide

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
the rear tires are so incredibly wide

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.149 
the rear tires are so incredibly wide
that<00:02:59.620> if<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:00.669> don't<00:03:00.879> know<00:03:01.120> how<00:03:01.389> to<00:03:01.419> properly

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
that if you don't know how to properly

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.920 
that if you don't know how to properly

buts about it the car will snap so you

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.640 
buts about it the car will snap so you
have<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.769> be<00:03:14.799> ready<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:16.180> have<00:03:16.419> to<00:03:16.599> be<00:03:16.720> ready<00:03:16.900> to

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
feed in the steering and the power in a

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
balanced and direct way because I'm like

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.830 
balanced and direct way because I'm like
again<00:03:23.739> if<00:03:23.859> you<00:03:23.979> don't<00:03:24.250> then<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.299> car<00:03:25.510> is<00:03:25.629> going

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
again if you don't then the car is going

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.479 
again if you don't then the car is going
to<00:03:25.930> snap<00:03:26.199> and<00:03:26.260> it's<00:03:26.680> going<00:03:26.859> to<00:03:26.949> either<00:03:27.190> go

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
to snap and it's going to either go

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.330 
to snap and it's going to either go
swerve<00:03:28.060> all<00:03:28.389> over<00:03:28.629> the<00:03:28.720> road<00:03:28.900> or<00:03:29.889> it's<00:03:30.159> going

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
swerve all over the road or it's going

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.849 
swerve all over the road or it's going
to<00:03:30.489> spin<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:31.379> that's<00:03:32.379> something<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.709> you

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
to spin so that's something that you

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.789 
to spin so that's something that you
definitely<00:03:33.069> have<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.549> watch<00:03:33.879> out<00:03:34.180> for<00:03:34.209> but<00:03:34.870> the

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
definitely have to watch out for but the

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.219 
definitely have to watch out for but the
good<00:03:36.129> thing<00:03:36.159> about<00:03:36.669> having<00:03:37.209> these<00:03:37.479> super<00:03:37.989> fat

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:38.229 
good thing about having these super fat

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:40.830 
good thing about having these super fat
rear<00:03:38.500> tires<00:03:38.859> is<00:03:39.220> that<00:03:39.849> once<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.180> get<00:03:40.359> used<00:03:40.690> to

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
rear tires is that once you get used to

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.229 
rear tires is that once you get used to
them<00:03:40.989> they're<00:03:41.620> actually<00:03:42.370> really<00:03:42.549> really

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
them they're actually really really

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.539 
them they're actually really really
controllable<00:03:44.169> I<00:03:44.260> mean<00:03:44.440> there<00:03:44.919> is<00:03:45.190> there

controllable I mean there is there

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.460 
controllable I mean there is there
obviously<00:03:45.879> there's<00:03:46.659> a<00:03:46.780> bit<00:03:47.109> of<00:03:47.139> a<00:03:47.290> learning

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
obviously there's a bit of a learning

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.369 
obviously there's a bit of a learning
curve<00:03:47.680> with<00:03:48.069> them<00:03:48.280> but<00:03:48.909> once<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.569> once<00:03:50.260> you

curve with them but once you once you

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.199 
curve with them but once you once you
practice<00:03:50.739> with<00:03:51.159> them<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.489> once<00:03:51.639> you<00:03:51.849> kind<00:03:52.060> of

video soon but i want to see what you

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.970 
video soon but i want to see what you
guys<00:04:39.720> think<00:04:40.080> it<00:04:40.230> is<00:04:40.350> because<00:04:40.500> there<00:04:40.830> aren't

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
guys think it is because there aren't

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.190 
guys think it is because there aren't
many<00:04:41.130> cars<00:04:41.580> that<00:04:42.360> are<00:04:42.480> rear-wheel<00:04:42.870> drive<00:04:43.080> and

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
many cars that are rear-wheel drive and

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.620 
many cars that are rear-wheel drive and
hat<00:04:43.920> in<00:04:44.160> forza<00:04:44.640> anyway<00:04:44.940> there<00:04:45.120> are<00:04:45.150> many<00:04:45.390> cars

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
hat in forza anyway there are many cars

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.120 
hat in forza anyway there are many cars
that<00:04:45.810> are<00:04:45.900> rear-wheel<00:04:46.260> drive<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:46.710> have<00:04:46.800> less

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
that are rear-wheel drive and have less

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.610 
that are rear-wheel drive and have less
than<00:04:47.160> 200<00:04:47.550> horsepower<00:04:48.060> so<00:04:48.510> if<00:04:48.690> you<00:04:49.170> can<00:04:49.380> guess

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
than 200 horsepower so if you can guess

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.130 
than 200 horsepower so if you can guess
that<00:04:49.650> then<00:04:50.580> that'll<00:04:51.390> be<00:04:51.480> pretty<00:04:51.630> cool<00:04:51.930> let's

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
that then that'll be pretty cool let's

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.670 
that then that'll be pretty cool let's
see<00:04:52.230> well<00:04:52.860> let's<00:04:52.890> try<00:04:53.340> and<00:04:53.460> see<00:04:53.520> who<00:04:53.850> gets<00:04:54.060> some

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680
