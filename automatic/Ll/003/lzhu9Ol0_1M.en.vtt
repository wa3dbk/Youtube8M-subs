00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.940
 we start the match at the start of the second half at the state of the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.469
 four 10 14 and see an attack by doll interpreter 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.080
 to fall behind the tranquility of the 13 11 it must be a limitation 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.129
 and even gets ahead of it 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.499
 mountain diplomats 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:23.819
 The team from Driebergen the disease in that phase in a flow he uses 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:27.179
 a somewhat lesser period at dos 46 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.999
 jos roseboom 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.060
 on my client brandsma 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.019
 and that concern other debts just two hits 14 16 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.040
 dos 46 should not do so 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.320
 casper tree 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.700
 mirjam de kleijn again casper boom 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.210
 peter lageweg 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.210
 all minor offense made on the spy 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.520
 6 the referee 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.520
 and that violation has been made by the program of the mountain 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.410
 free throw than for dos 46 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.300
 three hundred leaders 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.300
 he brings the difference back to 15 16 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.430
 but up to and tariq opponent 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.800
 bob de jong 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.800
 on linda from bottom mountain 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.240
 the young are looking for space on the other side 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 and then get a violation made by the tubes 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.810
 utrecht on the dam to open the free throws 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.900
 bob de jong cda is the designated man 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.460
 on the big man at the death toll 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.690
 and scores very simply here 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.690
 the difference again on two hits 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.570
 dos 46 must then step up a gear 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.950
 of course this man wants to fight back in the match 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.950
 andré coopers from a distance 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.790
 not all that simple 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.790
 shortly afterwards a foul on him made it is just a goal 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.840
 dos 46 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.280
 bear held with bruinsma again the margin increased to two hits sixteen 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.850
 until eighteen 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.339
 and then we jump into the competition 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:12.339
 with still that lead for the dalto of two hits 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.680
 violation of this monique brandsma mirjam de kleijn 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.989
 this led to complaints 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.219
 and the rest than the stafford for dos 46 peter lageweg 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.259
 good for four goals in the match 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.309
 19 to 20 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:34.179
 you also have a source under a new image 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.099
 so speak 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.269
 he steps on the foot of an opponent 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.489
 the game continues 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.229
 but look at his ankle injured 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.229
 has a lot of pain 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.299
 must then be cared for 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.609
 it doesn't seem right the supporters see the accident taking place 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.609
 a little later is replaced 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.869
 han polman from dos 46 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.869
 casper boom cda the moment you need one very badly 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.599
 he scored the equalizer 20 20 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.379
 and so we enter the exciting final phase 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.340
 at the stand now from 21 to 22 in favor of proto 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.549
 the visitors played 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.269
 there is in the match 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.519
 heerenveen anp bob de jong also makes the difference again on two hits 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.749
 and again dead 46 have to make up a backlog for IJsselmuiden 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.799
 this is the search for andré coopers 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.799
 four lucky he does not get the ball yet but take a look 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.969
 23 23 still not recovered 146 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:46.050
 sabrina adj 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.679
 andré coopers 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:49.599
 he grows in the competition 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.299
 at the lucas 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.579
 sabrina egank search another category was the ticket site 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.749
 the competition management both sides side by side 23 23 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.889
 we are actually already in the last two minutes of the game 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.489
 casper tree from distance 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.379
 dos 46 

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:19.269
 the audience then had its own game behind it 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.099
 but that was still not sold 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.099
 the translation of this dos 46 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:31.999
 he accuses him of doing so 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.169
 both sides side by side 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.469
 herman's favor takes a time out 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.020
 consultation with his teammates for the win 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.180
 or are we satisfied with a tie 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.620
 it is not satisfied with the tie andré coopers on another 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.620
 blockbusters can fall 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.590
 because the atmosphere in the sports hall 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.819
 cannot score on the attack 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:03.960
 first match 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.960
 we decide 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:11.180
 it's going to be an exciting driving competition with 25 24 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.069
 the chance that I'm exhausted and their coach herman of favor 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.050
 and women at dos 46 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.879
 numerous supporters 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.530
 I let myself be spawned by the public 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.930
 everyone has stood 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.309
 but that does say it was enough everyone could encourage them to escape 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:30.219
 know how to bring those balls to the last quarter of an hour because of that 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:32.300
 were open again but all you need 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.490
 they had to go very deep with the name 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.680
 once nice 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.029
 fantastically beautiful roles every week we go deep 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:43.029
 we adopt calls with suspicious bulls to be ready on time 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.710
 to 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.650
 The inflation level will be very high and I also have another player that guy plans 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.029
 to a dramatic one 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:52.749
 and I did glad that I play something on the man
