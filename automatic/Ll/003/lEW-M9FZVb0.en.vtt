hello<00:00:00.390> today<00:00:01.079> we're<00:00:01.199> going<00:00:01.290> to<00:00:01.410> change<00:00:01.650> the

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hello today we're going to change the

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.400 
hello today we're going to change the
amount<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.760> filter<00:00:03.210> on<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.659> CLK<00:00:04.110> 230<00:00:04.920> compressor

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.410 
amount of filter on a CLK 230 compressor

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:19.400 
amount of filter on a CLK 230 compressor
and<00:00:08.480> show<00:00:09.480> what<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.690> new<00:00:09.840> one<00:00:09.960> looks<00:00:10.050> like<00:00:18.410> so

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
and show what a new one looks like so

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.150 
and show what a new one looks like so
air<00:00:19.680> comes<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.220> through<00:00:21.029> through<00:00:21.480> here<00:00:22.160> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
air comes in through through here the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.689 
air comes in through through here the
sensor<00:00:23.609> measures<00:00:24.680> that<00:00:25.680> heats<00:00:25.920> up<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.519> gets

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
sensor measures that heats up and gets

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.880 
sensor measures that heats up and gets
cooled<00:00:27.029> down<00:00:27.180> by<00:00:27.390> air<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> variance<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
cooled down by air and the variance the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.950 
cooled down by air and the variance the
changing<00:00:29.460> resistance<00:00:29.970> send<00:00:30.720> out<00:00:30.869> an

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
changing resistance send out an

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.830 
changing resistance send out an
electrical<00:00:31.260> signal<00:00:31.439> which<00:00:31.890> tells<00:00:32.160> deep<00:00:32.809> ECU

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
electrical signal which tells deep ECU

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.280 
electrical signal which tells deep ECU
how<00:00:34.079> much<00:00:34.230> air<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.500> passing<00:00:35.100> through<00:00:36.140> this<00:00:37.140> is

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
how much air is passing through this is

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.900 
how much air is passing through this is
an<00:00:37.410> original<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.190> been<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:38.460> 13

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
an original one so it's been here 13

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.610 
an original one so it's been here 13
years<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.450> gets<00:00:39.719> plugged<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.969> with<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.620> dirty

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
years it gets plugged up with the dirty

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.430 
years it gets plugged up with the dirty
air<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.600> you<00:00:45.600> know<00:00:45.690> I've<00:00:45.780> tried<00:00:46.020> cleaning<00:00:46.289> it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
air and you know I've tried cleaning it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.410 
air and you know I've tried cleaning it
before<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.280> still<00:00:47.550> giving<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> issues<00:00:48.210> so

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
before but still giving the issues so

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.720 
before but still giving the issues so
it's<00:00:48.780> time<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.960> change<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.280> start<00:00:50.550> off

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
it's time to change it so we start off

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.950 
it's time to change it so we start off
by<00:00:51.090> unplugging<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:52.370> lovin<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:55.879> show<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.960> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
by unplugging the lovin it show you the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.319 
by unplugging the lovin it show you the
other<00:00:58.050> side<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.160> just<00:01:00.149> press<00:01:00.300> that

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
other side of it this is just press that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.950 
other side of it this is just press that
and<00:01:00.989> pull<00:01:01.320> pull<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.399> side<00:01:05.570> on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.750> side<00:01:06.930> of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
and pull pull that side on the side of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.960 
and pull pull that side on the side of
it<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.200> should<00:01:07.290> see<00:01:07.530> two<00:01:07.799> hooks<00:01:08.070> they<00:01:08.610> simply

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
it you should see two hooks they simply

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.950 
it you should see two hooks they simply
lift<00:01:09.180> up<00:01:09.360> one

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
lift up one

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.980 
lift up one
and<00:01:12.970> so<00:01:13.970> that's<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.540> stupid<00:01:14.990> commute<00:01:15.520> and

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
and so that's the stupid commute and

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.940 
and so that's the stupid commute and
then<00:01:17.990> we<00:01:18.140> can<00:01:18.290> approach<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:18.680> in<00:01:18.799> different

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
then we can approach you in different

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.850 
then we can approach you in different
ways<00:01:19.130> but<00:01:19.580> I<00:01:19.640> said<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.970> me<00:01:20.060> to<00:01:20.270> remove<00:01:20.540> this<00:01:21.530> top

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
ways but I said to me to remove this top

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.830 
ways but I said to me to remove this top
part<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:23.740> easiest<00:01:24.740> way<00:01:25.009> this<00:01:25.310> one<00:01:28.840> I'll

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
part the easiest way this one I'll

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.529 
part the easiest way this one I'll
probably<00:01:30.080> go<00:01:30.409> for<00:01:30.680> removing<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.909> top<00:01:32.360> part

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
probably go for removing the top part

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.469 
probably go for removing the top part
that<00:01:32.659> goes<00:01:32.750> into<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.200> butterfly<00:01:34.009> valve

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
that goes into the butterfly valve

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:44.260 
that goes into the butterfly valve
throttle<00:01:35.479> body<00:01:35.659> at<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.869> top

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.429 

there's<00:01:45.270> these<00:01:45.390> two<00:01:46.520> metal<00:01:48.229> fashion<00:01:49.229> round

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
there's these two metal fashion round

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:58.890 
there's these two metal fashion round
bit<00:01:49.759> in<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> flat<00:01:51.270> screwdriver

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.590 

so<00:01:59.900> remove<00:02:00.200> these<00:02:00.350> bolts<00:02:00.590> from<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.600> throttle

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
so remove these bolts from the throttle

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:14.790 
so remove these bolts from the throttle
body<00:02:02.690> up<00:02:02.900> there<00:02:07.990> okay<00:02:09.400> the<00:02:10.400> way<00:02:13.600> here<00:02:14.600> we<00:02:14.690> go

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
body up there okay the way here we go

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.460 
body up there okay the way here we go
quite<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:15.830> bit<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.130> water<00:02:16.810> what<00:02:17.810> happens<00:02:17.840> all

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
quite a bit of water what happens all

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.140 
quite a bit of water what happens all
contaminations<00:02:19.310> one<00:02:19.820> of<00:02:19.970> them<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.210> kills<00:02:20.480> it

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
contaminations one of them that kills it

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.590 
contaminations one of them that kills it
the<00:02:23.150> issue<00:02:23.210> has<00:02:23.450> been<00:02:23.480> given<00:02:23.840> me<00:02:23.960> with<00:02:25.600> it

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
the issue has been given me with it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.630 
the issue has been given me with it
would<00:02:26.840> have<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.440> supercharger<00:02:28.250> on<00:02:28.310> for<00:02:28.580> about

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
would have a supercharger on for about

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.370 
would have a supercharger on for about
four<00:02:28.940> thousand<00:02:29.330> revs<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.930> then<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.260> would

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
four thousand revs and then you would

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.400 
four thousand revs and then you would
just<00:02:30.530> cut<00:02:30.740> it<00:02:30.890> out<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.460> that's<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.730> safety

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
just cut it out and that's a safety

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.470 
just cut it out and that's a safety
feature<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.770> cloth<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.550> there<00:02:34.970> if<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.240> can't

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
feature of cloth and there if you can't

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.170 
feature of cloth and there if you can't
get<00:02:35.630> enough<00:02:35.750> air<00:02:36.080> of<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:37.280> see<00:02:37.490> it<00:02:37.520> figured<00:02:38.090> out

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
get enough air of you see it figured out

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.800 
get enough air of you see it figured out
this<00:02:38.270> problems<00:02:38.630> would<00:02:38.750> be<00:02:39.280> okay<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:40.340> we<00:02:40.580> can

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
this problems would be okay so we can

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.490 
this problems would be okay so we can
place<00:02:41.810> your<00:02:42.220> mask<00:02:43.220> somewhere<00:02:43.580> else<00:02:44.470> take<00:02:45.470> a

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
place your mask somewhere else take a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.660 
place your mask somewhere else take a
new<00:02:45.710> one<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.400> see<00:02:46.580> this<00:02:46.700> an<00:02:46.820> arrow<00:02:47.030> on<00:02:47.210> it

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
new one and you see this an arrow on it

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.190 
new one and you see this an arrow on it
good<00:02:49.670> for<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:49.970> direction<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.720> flow<00:02:50.900> from

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
good for the direction of flow from

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.750 
good for the direction of flow from
Germans<00:02:52.030> as<00:02:53.030> yes<00:02:53.390> coming<00:02:53.750> this<00:02:54.530> way<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.130> into

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
Germans as yes coming this way and into

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.060 
Germans as yes coming this way and into
the<00:02:55.850> engine

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
the engine

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.530 
the engine
make<00:02:58.070> sure<00:02:58.310> that<00:03:00.190> this<00:03:01.190> grid<00:03:01.550> is<00:03:02.060> pointing

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
make sure that this grid is pointing

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.900 
make sure that this grid is pointing
downwards<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.500> can<00:03:03.650> see<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.160> metals<00:03:04.489> exposed
