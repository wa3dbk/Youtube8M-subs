thing is behind me actually it's it's

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.519 
thing is behind me actually it's it's
called<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.670> wall<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.150> north<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:16.199> is

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
called the wall of the north and it is

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.480 
called the wall of the north and it is
found<00:00:16.920> at<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.430> coordinates<00:00:18.500> minus<00:00:19.500> 8,000<00:00:20.369> on

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
found at the coordinates minus 8,000 on

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.759 
found at the coordinates minus 8,000 on
the<00:00:20.609> z<00:00:20.789> axis<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.539> pretty<00:00:21.960> much<00:00:22.140> if<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.439> look<00:00:22.650> at

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
the z axis so pretty much if you look at

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.410 
the z axis so pretty much if you look at
the<00:00:22.859> map<00:00:23.010> right<00:00:23.250> now<00:00:23.310> i've<00:00:23.670> teleported<00:00:24.269> here

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the map right now i've teleported here

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.550 
the map right now i've teleported here
because<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:26.210> but<00:00:27.210> yeah<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.660> spawn<00:00:27.960> spawn<00:00:28.349> down

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
because I but yeah I spawn spawn down

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.599 
because I but yeah I spawn spawn down
here<00:00:28.830> as<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:28.980> can<00:00:29.039> see<00:00:29.220> he's<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.400> little

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
here as you can see he's a little

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.580 
here as you can see he's a little
rendered<00:00:29.910> world<00:00:30.090> down<00:00:30.330> there<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.720> then<00:00:31.199> i

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
rendered world down there and then i

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.830 
rendered world down there and then i
teleported<00:00:32.040> up<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:33.030> basically<00:00:33.420> what

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
teleported up here but basically what

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.030 
teleported up here but basically what
you<00:00:33.930> need<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.170> do<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.620> like<00:00:34.739> keep<00:00:35.010> going

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
you need to do is just like keep going

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.920 
you need to do is just like keep going
north<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.760> hence<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> name<00:00:36.480> wall<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
north and hence the name wall in the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.380 
north and hence the name wall in the
north<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.770> keep<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.219> north<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.700> you'll

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
north just keep going north and you'll

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.720 
north just keep going north and you'll
get<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> wall<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.460> basically<00:00:41.460> what<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.700> can

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
get to a wall but basically what you can

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.369 
get to a wall but basically what you can
see<00:00:41.940> here<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> wall<00:00:42.570> spreading<00:00:43.200> across

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
see here is the wall spreading across

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.840 
see here is the wall spreading across
I've<00:00:43.680> rendered<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.700> actually

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
I've rendered it out so I can actually

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.610 
I've rendered it out so I can actually
show<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.660> explain<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:46.050> little<00:00:46.230> bit<00:00:46.410> more

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
show you and explain a little bit more

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.920 
show you and explain a little bit more
about<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:47.550> we'll<00:00:48.090> go<00:00:48.210> there<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.570> second

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
about it but we'll go there in a second

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.049 
about it but we'll go there in a second
the<00:00:49.020> actual<00:00:49.260> game<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:49.770> why<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.030> a

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the actual game but why it is it is a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.950 
the actual game but why it is it is a
wall<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.930> 72<00:00:52.739> blocks<00:00:53.190> high<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
wall that is 72 blocks high and it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.720 
wall that is 72 blocks high and it
spreads<00:00:55.610> infinitely<00:00:56.610> from<00:00:56.940> east<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.390> west<00:00:57.510> so

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
spreads infinitely from east to west so

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.700 
spreads infinitely from east to west so
yeah<00:00:59.730> that's<00:01:00.059> that's<00:01:00.660> pretty<00:01:00.960> awesome<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
yeah that's that's pretty awesome and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.529 
yeah that's that's pretty awesome and
the<00:01:02.039> purpose<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.000> actually

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the purpose of this is a actually

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.750 
the purpose of this is a actually
awesome<00:01:03.989> because<00:01:04.189> if<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.339> don't<00:01:05.519> watch<00:01:05.610> my

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
awesome because if you don't watch my

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.450 
awesome because if you don't watch my
let's<00:01:05.970> play<00:01:06.150> series<00:01:06.330> we've<00:01:06.750> gonna<00:01:07.380> go<00:01:07.590> here<00:01:07.920> at

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
let's play series we've gonna go here at

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.990 
let's play series we've gonna go here at
some<00:01:08.820> point<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.890> what<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.460> separate

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
some point but what it is it's separate

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.750 
some point but what it is it's separate
it<00:01:12.150> obviously<00:01:12.240> separates<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.439> north<00:01:14.310> from

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
it obviously separates the north from

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.510 
it obviously separates the north from
the<00:01:14.909> far<00:01:15.119> north<00:01:15.590> which<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.830> what<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.130> does<00:01:17.250> and

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the far north which is what it does and

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.910 
the far north which is what it does and
well<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:17.909> got<00:01:18.090> some<00:01:18.270> mushroom<00:01:19.229> spawning<00:01:19.590> well

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
well we got some mushroom spawning well

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.649 
well we got some mushroom spawning well
there<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.280> mushroom<00:01:20.610> biome<00:01:21.119> down<00:01:21.299> there<00:01:21.479> but

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
there is a mushroom biome down there but

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.190 
there is a mushroom biome down there but
well<00:01:22.700> what<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.600> separates<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
well what it is it just separates the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.170 
well what it is it just separates the
north<00:01:25.409> from<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> far<00:01:25.950> north<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.090> can

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
north from the far north and as you can

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.510 
north from the far north and as you can
see<00:01:27.530> there's<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.619> pirate<00:01:28.890> ship<00:01:28.920> down<00:01:29.159> there<00:01:29.189> but

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
see there's a pirate ship down there but

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.520 
see there's a pirate ship down there but
it<00:01:29.970> was<00:01:30.119> added<00:01:30.360> by<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.509> better<00:01:30.780> dungeon<00:01:31.200> smart

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
it was added by the better dungeon smart

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.660 
it was added by the better dungeon smart
and<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.610> does<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.470> from<00:01:34.470> from<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> actual

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
and what it does is from from the actual

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.420 
and what it does is from from the actual
north<00:01:36.659> further<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.470> from<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> wall<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.189> far

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
north further on from the wall the far

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.060 
north further on from the wall the far
north<00:01:38.700> dungeons<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.110> higher<00:01:40.590> chance<00:01:40.920> of

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
north dungeons have a higher chance of

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.700 
north dungeons have a higher chance of
spawning<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> massive<00:01:42.409> high<00:01:43.409> chance

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
spawning so it is a massive high chance

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.620 
spawning so it is a massive high chance
spawning<00:01:44.040> actually<00:01:44.399> because<00:01:44.640> as<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.420> see

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
spawning actually because as you can see

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.109 
spawning actually because as you can see
in<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.950> bottom<00:01:47.100> part<00:01:47.460> which<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
in the bottom part which is just the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:48.469 
in the bottom part which is just the
north

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
north

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.060 
north
we've<00:01:48.930> only<00:01:49.020> got<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.320> one<00:01:49.530> part<00:01:49.770> ship<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
we've only got like one part ship and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.469 
we've only got like one part ship and
like<00:01:50.159> half<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.549> pirate<00:01:50.820> ship<00:01:50.850> that's<00:01:51.149> actually

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
like half a pirate ship that's actually

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.030 
like half a pirate ship that's actually
spawned<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> wall<00:01:52.140> there<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.590> don't<00:01:52.920> know

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
spawned in the wall there I don't know

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.160 
spawned in the wall there I don't know
that<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.280> think<00:01:53.520> that's<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> type<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.119> book<00:01:54.509> but

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
that I think that's the type of book but

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.300 
that I think that's the type of book but
it's<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.189> majorly<00:01:56.909> buggy<00:01:57.719> book<00:01:58.310> yeah

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
it's not that majorly buggy book yeah

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.459 
it's not that majorly buggy book yeah
you<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.640> kind<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.030> see<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.689> amount<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.020> pirate

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
you can kind of see the amount of pirate

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.280 
you can kind of see the amount of pirate
ships<00:02:01.710> spawned<00:02:02.159> past<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.090> wall<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.630> crazy

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
ships spawned past the wall is a crazy

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.560 
ships spawned past the wall is a crazy
amount<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.700> keep<00:02:05.909> searching<00:02:06.180> and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
amount and if you keep searching and

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.059 
amount and if you keep searching and
stuff<00:02:06.810> obviously<00:02:07.320> because<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:07.740> gonna<00:02:07.890> be

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
stuff obviously because it's gonna be

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.430 
stuff obviously because it's gonna be
higher<00:02:08.520> up<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> north<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.289> not

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
higher up in the north that it's not

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.809 
higher up in the north that it's not
really<00:02:10.649> gonna<00:02:10.739> be<00:02:10.830> mainland<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.640> there's

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
really gonna be mainland so there's

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.220 
really gonna be mainland so there's
gonna<00:02:11.910> be<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> lot<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.330> ocean<00:02:12.599> I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
gonna be a lot of ocean I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.770 
gonna be a lot of ocean I
unless<00:02:13.709> there<00:02:14.069> might<00:02:14.220> be<00:02:14.250> big<00:02:14.819> islands<00:02:15.330> that

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
unless there might be big islands that

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.250 
unless there might be big islands that
you<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:15.989> search<00:02:16.200> for<00:02:17.000> basically<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
you can search for basically the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.600 
you can search for basically the
dungeons<00:02:19.260> have<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.739> better<00:02:19.980> chance<00:02:20.430> of

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
dungeons have a better chance of

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.089 
dungeons have a better chance of
spawning<00:02:20.970> here<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.019> I<00:02:22.260> don't<00:02:22.620> think<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.920> loop

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
spawning here and I don't think the loop

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.920 
spawning here and I don't think the loop
changes<00:02:23.459> it's<00:02:23.819> just<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> amount<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.450> dungeons

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
changes it's just the amount of dungeons

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.970 
changes it's just the amount of dungeons
that<00:02:25.019> actually<00:02:25.500> spawn<00:02:26.310> but<00:02:27.440> yeah<00:02:28.440> there's

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
that actually spawn but yeah there's

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.830 
that actually spawn but yeah there's
actually<00:02:29.220> armored<00:02:29.700> Enderman<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.360> guard

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
actually armored Enderman that guard

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.630 
actually armored Enderman that guard
them<00:02:31.080> as<00:02:31.200> well<00:02:31.380> which<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.620> which<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.220> crazy<00:02:32.430> I

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
them as well which is which is crazy I

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.860 
them as well which is which is crazy I
haven't<00:02:32.849> actually<00:02:32.940> seen<00:02:33.120> one<00:02:33.390> yet<00:02:33.569> because<00:02:33.840> I

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
haven't actually seen one yet because I

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.210 
haven't actually seen one yet because I
haven't<00:02:34.019> been<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.290> them<00:02:34.560> type<00:02:34.739> of<00:02:34.890> dungeons

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
playing a survival in this you probably

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.430 
playing a survival in this you probably
want<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.610> go<00:02:47.819> set<00:02:48.299> up<00:02:48.390> base<00:02:48.630> get<00:02:48.989> get<00:02:49.410> a

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
want to go set up base get get a

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.080 
want to go set up base get get a
foothold<00:02:49.739> on<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.220> world<00:02:50.400> first<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.940> then

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
foothold on the world first and then

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.650 
foothold on the world first and then
actually<00:02:51.540> start<00:02:52.200> exploring<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:52.980> bit<00:02:53.010> more<00:02:53.310> but

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
actually start exploring a bit more but

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.210 
actually start exploring a bit more but
my<00:02:54.660> recommendations<00:02:55.410> if<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.650> spawn<00:02:55.980> like

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
my recommendations if you spawn like

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.280 
my recommendations if you spawn like
really<00:02:56.730> far<00:02:56.940> away<00:02:57.120> down<00:02:57.510> like<00:02:57.840> more<00:02:58.049> in<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
really far away down like more in the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.550 
really far away down like more in the
south<00:02:58.560> I'd<00:02:59.549> get<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.940> ton<00:03:00.329> of<00:03:00.360> electric<00:03:01.290> staffs

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
south I'd get a ton of electric staffs

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.069 
south I'd get a ton of electric staffs
and<00:03:02.040> then<00:03:02.459> if<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:03.269> didn't<00:03:03.569> know<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:03.810> already

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
and then if you didn't know this already

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.350 
and then if you didn't know this already
staffs<00:03:05.010> are<00:03:05.310> actually<00:03:05.610> free<00:03:05.819> to<00:03:05.849> enchant

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.319 
in breaking free on the electric staff
then<00:03:28.139> it<00:03:28.709> will<00:03:28.859> it<00:03:29.639> will<00:03:29.730> last<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.150> lot<00:03:30.269> longer

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
then it will it will last a lot longer

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.660 
then it will it will last a lot longer
when<00:03:30.930> you're<00:03:31.079> going<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.859> if<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.400> don't<00:03:32.579> know

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
when you're going and if you don't know

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.920 
when you're going and if you don't know
what<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.850> electric<00:03:32.940> staff<00:03:33.450> does<00:03:33.690> it

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
what the electric staff does it

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.990 
what the electric staff does it
basically<00:03:34.230> if<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.130> right-click<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.790> just

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
basically if you right-click it just

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.840 
basically if you right-click it just
makes<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.600> fly<00:03:36.840> really<00:03:37.440> fast<00:03:37.590> pretty<00:03:38.340> much<00:03:38.549> so

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
makes you fly really fast pretty much so

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.030 
makes you fly really fast pretty much so
yeah<00:03:39.540> that's<00:03:39.810> that's<00:03:40.350> pretty<00:03:40.530> much<00:03:40.709> shot<00:03:40.859> that

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
yeah that's that's pretty much shot that

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.500 
yeah that's that's pretty much shot that

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
were commenting saying that the wall of

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.000 
were commenting saying that the wall of
the<00:04:06.690> north<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.049> good<00:04:07.230> place<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.590> go<00:04:07.739> if<00:04:07.920> we

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
the north is a good place to go if we

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.250 
the north is a good place to go if we
want<00:04:08.160> to<00:04:08.220> get<00:04:08.310> loop<00:04:08.549> so<00:04:09.269> past<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.930> wall<00:04:10.049> of<00:04:10.200> the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
want to get loop so past the wall of the

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.990 
want to get loop so past the wall of the
north<00:04:10.440> which<00:04:10.650> I'm<00:04:10.859> actually<00:04:11.579> there<00:04:11.730> now

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
north which I'm actually there now

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.580 
north which I'm actually there now
there's<00:04:12.269> gonna<00:04:12.359> be<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.569> lot<00:04:12.870> more<00:04:13.079> dungeon

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
there's gonna be a lot more dungeon

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.250 
there's gonna be a lot more dungeon
spawning<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.819> if<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:15.389> I<00:04:15.419> guess<00:04:15.750> if<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.169> on

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
spawning so if you I guess if you it on

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.810 
spawning so if you I guess if you it on
the<00:04:16.380> quest<00:04:16.650> for<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.919> bane<00:04:17.099> of<00:04:17.130> pigs<00:04:17.519> are<00:04:17.639> some

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
the quest for the bane of pigs are some

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.240 
the quest for the bane of pigs are some
it<00:04:17.910> then<00:04:18.380> going<00:04:19.380> past<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.709> wall<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.039> north

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
it then going past the wall of the north

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.529 
it then going past the wall of the north
is<00:04:20.370> actually<00:04:20.729> a<00:04:20.760> really<00:04:21.060> good<00:04:21.180> idea<00:04:21.299> because

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
is actually a really good idea because

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.240 
is actually a really good idea because
there'll<00:04:21.959> be<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.049> lot<00:04:22.109> more<00:04:22.260> dungeons<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:23.010> find

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
there'll be a lot more dungeons to find

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.700 
there'll be a lot more dungeons to find
and<00:04:23.550> this<00:04:24.450> is<00:04:24.599> kind<00:04:24.780> of<00:04:24.840> like<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.020> pirate<00:04:25.349> Cove

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
and this is kind of like a pirate Cove

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.210 
and this is kind of like a pirate Cove
isn't<00:04:26.010> it

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
isn't it

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.280 
isn't it
well<00:04:27.120> yeah<00:04:27.240> this<00:04:27.390> is<00:04:27.540> one<00:04:27.720> of<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.900> dungeons

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
well yeah this is one of the dungeons

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.440 
well yeah this is one of the dungeons
that<00:04:29.250> I'm<00:04:29.430> guessing<00:04:29.790> is<00:04:29.880> gonna<00:04:30.030> be<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.180> lot<00:04:30.300> of

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
that I'm guessing is gonna be a lot of

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.720 
that I'm guessing is gonna be a lot of
loot<00:04:30.630> in<00:04:30.660> here<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.340> guess<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:32.400> have<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.520> make

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
your way to the top then I don't know

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.280 
your way to the top then I don't know
what<00:04:35.370> this<00:04:35.460> is

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
what this is

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.660 
what this is
thinking<00:04:37.290> boss<00:04:37.500> much<00:04:37.740> for<00:04:37.980> up<00:04:38.100> here<00:04:38.160> some<00:04:38.520> I
