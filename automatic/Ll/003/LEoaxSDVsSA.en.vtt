00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
system should operate without state

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.029 
system should operate without state
intervention<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.090> state<00:00:45.360> supervised

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039

was<00:00:48.930> saying<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> Statesman<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
was saying to the Statesman do this and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.459 
was saying to the Statesman do this and
then<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.360> country<00:00:51.629> will<00:00:51.750> get<00:00:51.870> wealthy<00:00:52.289> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
then the country will get wealthy and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.619 
then the country will get wealthy and
Adam<00:00:52.980> Smith<00:00:53.160> also<00:00:53.370> said<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.210> wealth<00:00:54.420> can

Adam Smith also said and the wealth can
then<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.899> spread<00:00:55.170> around<00:00:55.289> that's<00:00:55.980> what<00:00:56.100> Adam

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
then be spread around that's what Adam

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.760 
then be spread around that's what Adam
Smith<00:00:56.579> said<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.390> hear<00:00:57.870> Smith<00:00:58.199> quoted<00:00:58.620> all

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the time and all of those aspects of

the time and all of those aspects of
Adam<00:01:00.840> Smith<00:01:01.079> are<00:01:01.260> always<00:01:01.620> left<00:01:01.859> out<00:01:02.070> it's

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
Adam Smith are always left out it's

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.030 
Adam Smith are always left out it's
always<00:01:03.030> seems<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.840> they<00:01:04.049> always<00:01:04.320> say<00:01:04.470> Adam

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
always seems to be they always say Adam

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.410 
always seems to be they always say Adam
Smith<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> free<00:01:05.850> market<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
Smith was about a free market and the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.630 
Smith was about a free market and the
state<00:01:06.630> should<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.930> nothing<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.439> with<00:01:07.560> it

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.770 

if<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.790> accept<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.180> you're<00:01:12.330> saying<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
if you accept what you're saying and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.960 
if you accept what you're saying and
then<00:01:12.869> Adam<00:01:13.260> Smith<00:01:13.470> was<00:01:13.619> about<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.580> still

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
then Adam Smith was about it still

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
then Adam Smith was about it still
remains<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.360> he<00:01:15.659> thought<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.229> free<00:01:16.439> market

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
remains that he thought that free market

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.190 
remains that he thought that free market
capitalism<00:01:17.130> not<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.540> form<00:01:18.960> perhaps

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
capitalism not in this form perhaps

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.990 
capitalism not in this form perhaps
right<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> form<00:01:20.520> he<00:01:20.640> was<00:01:20.790> suggesting

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
right but in the form he was suggesting

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.420 
right but in the form he was suggesting
was<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> best<00:01:21.990> system<00:01:22.320> are<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.100> accepting

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
was the best system are you accepting

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.820 
was the best system are you accepting
that<00:01:23.790> no<00:01:24.210> I'm<00:01:24.570> not<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.290> tell<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> very

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
that no I'm not and I tell you a very

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.370 
that no I'm not and I tell you a very
simple<00:01:25.950> reason<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:27.229> capitalism<00:01:28.229> is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
simple reason because capitalism is

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.749 
simple reason because capitalism is
about<00:01:28.409> growth<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.390> it's<00:01:30.390> about<00:01:31.130> 3%<00:01:32.130> compound

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
about growth and it's about 3% compound

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.410 
about growth and it's about 3% compound
growth<00:01:33.000> forever<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.689> mean<00:01:33.930> that's<00:01:35.060> it<00:01:36.060> there<00:01:36.299> is

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
growth forever I mean that's it there is

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.210 
growth forever I mean that's it there is
a<00:01:36.450> lot<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.780> course<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.890> healthy

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
a lot of course but that is the healthy

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.399 
a lot of course but that is the healthy
catalyst<00:01:38.640> system<00:01:38.820> grows<00:01:39.240> at<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.869> minimum<00:01:40.259> at<00:01:40.350> a

3%<00:01:40.740> compound<00:01:41.369> growth<00:01:41.490> forever<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.180> what

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
3% compound growth forever and what

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.899 
3% compound growth forever and what
we're<00:01:42.869> talking<00:01:43.079> about<00:01:43.320> now<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.890> 3%<00:01:44.250> compound

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
we're talking about now is 3% compound

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.910 
we're talking about now is 3% compound
growth<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> basis<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.350> everything<00:01:46.680> that's

growth on the basis of everything that's

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.350 
growth on the basis of everything that's
going<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> world<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:47.939> now<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.299> you

growth<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.959> do<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.520> could<00:03:23.670> have<00:03:23.820> zero

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
growth to do that so you could have zero

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.520 
growth to do that so you could have zero
growth<00:03:24.450> but<00:03:24.750> at<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.870> same<00:03:25.080> time<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.410> could

change<00:07:41.070> and<00:07:41.520> one<00:07:42.419> of<00:07:42.510> the<00:07:42.599> things<00:07:42.780> I<00:07:42.870> tried<00:07:43.110> to

00:07:43.219 --> 00:07:43.229 
change and one of the things I tried to

change and one of the things I tried to
do<00:07:43.409> in<00:07:43.620> the<00:07:43.740> book<00:07:43.919> that<00:07:43.949> I<00:07:44.130> just<00:07:44.190> written<00:07:44.490> was

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:44.669 
do in the book that I just written was

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:46.370 
do in the book that I just written was
to<00:07:44.789> talk<00:07:45.030> about<00:07:45.060> the<00:07:45.360> processes<00:07:45.960> of<00:07:45.990> social

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380 
to talk about the processes of social

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.589 
to talk about the processes of social
change<00:07:46.590> how<00:07:46.860> the<00:07:47.430> social<00:07:47.820> change<00:07:48.090> should

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 
change how the social change should

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:51.320 
change how the social change should
occur<00:07:48.930> and<00:07:49.169> the<00:07:50.070> the<00:07:50.490> way<00:07:50.669> though<00:07:50.909> the<00:07:50.940> method

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:51.330 
occur and the the way though the method

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.240 
occur and the the way though the method
if<00:07:51.780> you<00:07:51.930> like<00:07:52.110> of<00:07:52.349> arriving<00:07:52.830> at<00:07:52.919> a<00:07:52.979> better

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:53.250 
if you like of arriving at a better

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.279 
if you like of arriving at a better
society<00:07:53.610> than<00:07:54.210> the<00:07:54.300> one<00:07:54.449> we<00:07:54.599> are<00:07:54.630> currently<00:07:54.840> in

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:55.289 
society than the one we are currently in

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:59.510 
society than the one we are currently in
so<00:07:55.949> where<00:07:56.940> we<00:07:57.120> end<00:07:57.270> up<00:07:57.479> I<00:07:57.720> don't<00:07:58.380> see<00:07:58.830> a<00:07:58.860> utopia

00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 
so where we end up I don't see a utopia

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.030 
so where we end up I don't see a utopia
which<00:07:59.639> is<00:07:59.759> a<00:07:59.789> thing
