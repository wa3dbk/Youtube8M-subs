00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.050
 had in this tutorial I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:08.760
 to make a model of another model of 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.490
 removes fluff is home 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.340
 but this has the peculiarity that 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.139
 is disposable then the first thing that 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.770
 let's do what we're going to need is 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.580
 a roll of masking tape 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.140
 it does not matter if the tape is the same as it is 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.990
 American ribbon that to packing tape 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.699
 paper tape is also the only thing that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.360
 we have to take into account is the thickness 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.520
 have a little thickness 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.190
 and the other thing we're going to need is some 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.410
 scissors only with this then for 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.350
 start 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:48.020
 We opened the tape a little and cut a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.020
 piece about two fingers wide 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.640
 it does not matter if it is irregular in this piece 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.640
 we are going to cut it in 2 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.350
 and one of the ends one end 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.740
 we're going to fold it so we can take it off 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.190
 after and in this exactly the same 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.340
 one of the ends we doubled 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.290
 we just have to take off a piece of 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.040
 tape 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.040
 is left to wrap half the roll 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.100
 when we have it, we take one of the 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.590
 pieces of tape 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.590
 and we paste it on the edge 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.060
 and the other piece of tape 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.430
 on the other edge to leave 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:55.040
 the big piece well caught and that is not 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.040
 move what is the cardboard roll 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.380
 once we have pasted it we have a 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.950
 surface that is not going to move and that 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.490
 we can go through the clothes perfectly 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.929
 for lives 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.880
 all the fluff when we have the 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.160
 adhesive full of lint and no longer absorb 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.360
 more is as simple as lifting the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.560
 piece of paper that we have made to 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:24.300
 first throw a little and cut by the 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.470
 second piece of tape that we have put 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.500
 and we repeat 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.830
 the first part is the first phase 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.530
 and this is a roll of duct tape 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.860
 become a household fluff remover many 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.860
 Thank you
