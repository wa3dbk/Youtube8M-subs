00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.370 
the ball hub in FIFA the fake left go
right<00:02:34.490> is<00:02:35.030> another<00:02:35.360> skill<00:02:35.810> move<00:02:35.990> which<00:02:36.230> I

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
right is another skill move which I

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.690 
right is another skill move which I
think<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:37.240> ninety-five<00:02:38.240> percent<00:02:38.660> of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
star skilled moves but in my opinion

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.440

each player that has to start skill

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.200 
each player that has to start skill
