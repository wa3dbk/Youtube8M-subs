00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.990
 the photo that you see below 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:17.820
 it will sound very familiar is the fashion of the century 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.390
 21 using mobile phones but a 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.000
 scientific study through which 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.720
 shows that if we talk more than 50 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.489
 minutes with the phone stuck in your ear 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.759
 we will have a negative impact on 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.560
 an area of â€‹â€‹the brain this new and this 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.680
 new study was published by the 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.210
 flame magazine that shows that the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.940
 metabolism of glucose in the brain 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.450
 increases when the antennas of 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.700
 cell phones to the ear 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.160
 the radiation of mobile phones is a 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.130
 radiation that apparently is not 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.070
 dangerous but that if used excessively 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.580
 that is, if you are in contact during 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.950
 a period of more than 50 minutes may 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.010
 get to cause an alteration of 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.170
 functioning of the brain is something very 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.420
 worrying because he could be associated 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.470
 also to the increase of the last 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.620
 years of brain cancer as well as 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.270
 increase of testicular cancer a 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.040
 area where you usually save your mobile is 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.070
 in your pocket that as you well know is 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.900
 quite close to the testicles and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.750
 would also of course affect the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.119
 mobility and the amount of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.450
 sperm we are talking about that 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.300
 mobiles an invention that for all is 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.619
 an incredibly good solution for 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.260
 the communication may actually be 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.420
 destroying the inside 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.750
 they exercise a type of radiation that is 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.150
 harmful to the human being today still 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.420
 is trying to investigate and demonstrate 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.070
 with tests what are the 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.200
 consequences of using such 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.900
 repeated the mobile but I'll tell you 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.810
 something that will make you think 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.060
 in the case that you can find something 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.490
 to give the mobile companies to the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.430
 mobile phones as guilty of the 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.400
 cancer do not think that is going to pull the 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.230
 light will not be brought to light by the is 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.780
 for the simple reason that money 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.240
 moves the world and the companies of 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.100
 mobile phone will not let go 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.920
 your business 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.780
 they will not let it be enacted in these 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.600
 studies until many 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.310
 years and there are many cases and be obvious 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.530
 as in the case of tobacco 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.200
 it's a pity that this has to be like this and 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.120
 it's a pity that many people are 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.280
 affected by the radiations of these 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.489
 mobile phones that in no case are 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.550
 beneficial my particular advice if 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:52.989
 you have a mobile you never throw more than 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.970
 50 minutes with the ear stuck in my ear 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.849
 recommendation is that you do not have it 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.980
 stuck to the ear not even five minutes 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.280
 as little as possible because it has been shown 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.860
 that radiations radiation 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.049
 mobile phone directly affect the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.709
 glucose processing from the side of the 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.110
 brain where the mobile is put so 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.360
 a lot of eye with what you do that no if not 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.200
 always what what others do not 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.299
 always the fashions are good many of 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.540
 snuff them as the alcohol 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:29.380
 drugs a series of fashions including the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.940
 mobile phones are detrimental to health and 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.500
 you have to be aware of it because 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.319
 although we say media 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.480
 communication that are purchased 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.480
 these things are like that
