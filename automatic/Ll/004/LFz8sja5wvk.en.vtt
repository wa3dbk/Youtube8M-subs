off and let's say around eight in the
morning<00:03:07.210> and<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.480> would<00:03:07.570> probably<00:03:07.780> be<00:03:08.200> almost

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
it's I don't know it's hard for me to do

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.140 
it's I don't know it's hard for me to do
these<00:03:32.770> it's<00:03:33.040> not<00:03:33.190> like<00:03:33.370> anything<00:03:33.580> else<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:34.030> mean

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150
