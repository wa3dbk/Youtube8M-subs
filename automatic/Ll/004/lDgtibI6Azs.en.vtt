00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.240
 hello friends of r 8 thousand in this video lesson 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.850
 we'll cover the primary commands 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.430
 information provided by the map page 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.500
 as well as some tools for 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.840
 on-site training eight thousand 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.300
 we will use in this public demonstration 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.550
 8 thousand in fux mode is the configuration 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.100
 default when we download the 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.080
 even for the realization of this 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.480
 training we should enter the 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.579
 singular 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.739
 we will now see an important tool 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.780
 for the training and understanding of 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.469
 several r 8 mil functions 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.909
 the long replay allows you to view 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:52.620
 We flights recorded on GPS for both 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:57.179
 we should click on main menu config 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.489
 config again and logo replay 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:02.949
 now we are in the blank to 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.020
 side of the word file 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:14.219
 we have selected the demo point egc file 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:18.310
 click on select start up close 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:22.509
 we will see that in a few moments the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.890
 recorded flight begins to be replayed already 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.350
 called by rotating 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.789
 we will then see the map page commands 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.460
 in this there are three levels of command 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:36.009
 In this video, we'll cover only the command 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.859
 1 which allows primary approach or 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.270
 zoom out map 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.880
 dividing the map into two parts 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.079
 horizontally if we touch the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.659
 higher 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.549
 we have the zoom function that approximates the 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.579
 map 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.520
 if we stay at the bottom 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.939
 we will have the zoom out function which 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.939
 the map 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.049
 Now let's understand a little of the 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.289
 information that this map provides us 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.929
 for that I will use some commands 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.000
 on the display submenu within the 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.500
 main menu turns on or off 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.600
 layers 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.030
 this way we can evaluate 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.870
 the five layers that 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.870
 make up the map 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.739
 in the first layer we have information 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.200
 on the ground 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.989
 this is a raster image generated by 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.780
 that associating colors with the 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.030
 allows us to interpret the relief 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.970
 we'll see in the videos about settings 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.099
 we can choose the color set 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.760
 which is best for each type of 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:59.459
 A rather interesting function 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.680
 associated with the ground is that the shadow of 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.730
 mountains are associated with the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.970
 wind 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.599
 the light part of the mountain indicates 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.560
 likely ascending or lifting zone and 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:18.389
 shadow to the probable dark areas of 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:24.930
 rotor in the second layer we have 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:28.379
 topology information the topology is 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.980
 bedside associated with highways railways 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:36.439
 rivers mass of water urban densities 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.439
 names of cities and regions in general 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.879
 in the third layer we have the points 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.290
 in them all the points of the 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.680
 point files 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.319
 these can be anonymous heroes summit of 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:02.310
 mountain crossing points among others 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:05.849
 are also known as ipoint in 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.180
 fourth layer have air spaces 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.940
 these are bordered areas 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.400
 map shadows and must be respected 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:20.789
 being restricted or prohibited 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:22.919
 Finally we have the layer of 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.500
 overlaps that are a set of 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.860
 important values â€‹â€‹associated with flight and 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.500
 navigation quoted on the map 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.520
 which will be covered in the next video lesson 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.520
 until then
