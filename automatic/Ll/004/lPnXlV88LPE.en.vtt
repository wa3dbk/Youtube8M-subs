00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
Cavs for the last couple of months he

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.980 
Cavs for the last couple of months he
really<00:00:23.640> has<00:00:23.910> been<00:00:23.939> interested<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.660> coming

really has been interested in coming

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.269 
really has been interested in coming
back<00:00:25.199> because<00:00:25.439> he<00:00:25.619> had<00:00:25.769> some<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.160> best

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
back because he had some of the best

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.269 
back because he had some of the best
years<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.640> his<00:00:26.880> career<00:00:27.150> there<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:29.039> think

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
years of his career there and I think

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.830 
years of his career there and I think
from<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.490> Cavs<00:00:29.730> perspective<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
from the Cavs perspective this is a

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.520 
from the Cavs perspective this is a
value<00:00:31.650> signing<00:00:32.309> he's<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:34.020> know<00:00:34.110> they<00:00:34.200> got<00:00:34.410> him

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
value signing he's you know they got him

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.810 
value signing he's you know they got him
for<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> little<00:00:34.770> over<00:00:35.010> two<00:00:35.190> million<00:00:35.489> dollars

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
for a little over two million dollars

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.760 
for a little over two million dollars
for<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.120> year<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.540> considering<00:00:37.050> what<00:00:37.590> some

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
for this year and considering what some

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.729 
for this year and considering what some
other<00:00:37.890> players<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:39.030> gone<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:40.559> is

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
other players have gone for this is

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.350 
other players have gone for this is
that's<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.980> pretty<00:00:41.129> good<00:00:41.340> deal<00:00:41.550> he<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.149> play

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
that's a pretty good deal he can play

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.520 
that's a pretty good deal he can play
both<00:00:42.570> guard<00:00:42.899> positions

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
both guard positions

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.709 
both guard positions
I<00:00:43.620> think<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.520> Cavs<00:00:44.760> had<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.270> do<00:00:45.390> something

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
I think the Cavs had to do something

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.779 
I think the Cavs had to do something
this<00:00:45.840> summer<00:00:46.140> where<00:00:46.860> they<00:00:46.980> had<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> starter

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
this summer where they had a starter

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.750 
this summer where they had a starter
quality<00:00:48.329> guard<00:00:48.950> off<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.340> they<00:00:50.460> could<00:00:50.610> bring

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
quality guard off that they could bring

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.459 
quality guard off that they could bring
off<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> bench<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.600> when<00:00:51.750> Kyrie<00:00:52.110> Irving

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
off the bench for when Kyrie Irving

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.709 
off the bench for when Kyrie Irving
either<00:00:53.129> goes<00:00:53.460> down<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:53.879> injury<00:00:54.239> or<00:00:54.390> as<00:00:54.539> he

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
either goes down with injury or as he

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.119 
either goes down with injury or as he
recovers<00:00:55.140> from<00:00:55.230> his<00:00:55.410> knee<00:00:55.559> injury<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:55.949> he

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
recovers from his knee injury that he

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.040 
recovers from his knee injury that he
suffered<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.120> finals<00:00:57.510> he<00:00:57.539> may<00:00:57.750> not<00:00:57.930> be

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
suffered in the finals he may not be

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.540 
suffered in the finals he may not be
able<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.289> start<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> season<00:00:58.949> as<00:00:59.039> he<00:00:59.160> recovers

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
able to start the season as he recovers

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.340 
able to start the season as he recovers
from<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.059> they<00:01:00.570> were<00:01:00.629> able<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.170> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
from that so they were able to do that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.369 
from that so they were able to do that
here<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.699> other<00:01:02.850> side<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.049> know

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
here the other side of it is you know

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.160 
here the other side of it is you know
he's<00:01:04.650> 32<00:01:05.070> years<00:01:05.220> old<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.450> know<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.900> past

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
he's 32 years old and you know it past

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.580 
he's 32 years old and you know it past
his<00:01:07.380> prime<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.090> he's<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> small<00:01:09.540> guard<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.140> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
his prime and he's a small guard and so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.340 
his prime and he's a small guard and so
it's<00:01:11.430> very<00:01:11.610> difficult<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.600> him<00:01:12.840> in

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it's very difficult to see him in

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.100 
it's very difficult to see him in
scenarios<00:01:14.010> playing<00:01:14.430> alongside<00:01:14.820> Kyrie<00:01:15.600> Irving

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
scenarios playing alongside Kyrie Irving

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.490 
scenarios playing alongside Kyrie Irving
or<00:01:16.500> playing<00:01:16.830> alongside<00:01:17.189> Matthew<00:01:17.909> Dellavedova

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
or playing alongside Matthew Dellavedova

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.899 
or playing alongside Matthew Dellavedova
because<00:01:19.500> they<00:01:20.130> would<00:01:20.430> leave<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> Cavs

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
because they would leave the Cavs

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.700 
because they would leave the Cavs
honorable<00:01:21.479> defensively<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.350> he's<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
honorable defensively and he's not a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.490 
honorable defensively and he's not a
great<00:01:23.040> defensive<00:01:23.580> player<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.380> ideally<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
great defensive player so ideally the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.990 
great defensive player so ideally the
Cavs<00:01:25.740> would<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.130> gotten<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.460> bigger<00:01:26.670> guard

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
Cavs would have gotten a bigger guard

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.580 
Cavs would have gotten a bigger guard
but<00:01:27.299> they<00:01:27.479> certainly<00:01:27.750> investigated<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
but they certainly investigated the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.380 
but they certainly investigated the
market<00:01:29.009> weren't<00:01:29.640> able<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
market weren't able to do that and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.609 
market weren't able to do that and
they're<00:01:30.479> not<00:01:30.570> done<00:01:30.780> making<00:01:30.930> moves<00:01:31.290> they<00:01:31.470> may

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
they're not done making moves they may

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.870 
they're not done making moves they may
be<00:01:31.680> able<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.950> make<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.159> trade<00:01:32.490> or<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:32.700> may

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
be able to make a trade or they may

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.660 
be able to make a trade or they may

well<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.060> think<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.390> would<00:02:12.570> be<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> fair

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
well I think that would be a fair

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.330 
well I think that would be a fair
question<00:02:13.110> ask<00:02:13.500> David<00:02:13.890> West<00:02:14.070> right<00:02:14.310> now

question ask David West right now

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.010

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
because you know the cabs were on his

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.280 
because you know the cabs were on his
shortlist<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.680> he<00:02:16.770> chose<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:18.090> play<00:02:18.240> for<00:02:19.140> San

Antonio for less money than the Cavs

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.430 
Antonio for less money than the Cavs
could<00:02:21.390> offer<00:02:21.570> I<00:02:21.780> don't<00:02:21.960> think<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.260> was<00:02:22.350> an

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
could offer I don't think it was an

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.470 
could offer I don't think it was an
accident<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.730> Cavs<00:02:23.940> waited<00:02:24.330> until

using part of their mid-level exception
on<00:02:29.250> Mo<00:02:29.460> Williams<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.630> know<00:02:30.720> maybe<00:02:30.900> the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
on Mo Williams so you know maybe the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.110 
on Mo Williams so you know maybe the
uncertainty<00:02:31.680> over<00:02:31.710> playing<00:02:32.100> time<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.820> and

the older veteran players in the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.350 
the older veteran players in the
playoffs<00:02:37.890> maybe<00:02:38.430> played<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> role<00:02:38.970> there<00:02:39.180> only

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
playoffs maybe played a role there only

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.610 
playoffs maybe played a role there only
he<00:02:39.720> really<00:02:39.990> knows<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.640> but<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.670> do<00:02:41.790> think<00:02:41.940> that

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
he really knows that but I do think that

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.670 
he really knows that but I do think that

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
into the playoffs this year was a little

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.690 
into the playoffs this year was a little
bit<00:02:51.630> extreme<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.260> Cavs<00:02:52.500> had<00:02:52.800> an<00:02:53.400> extreme

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
bit extreme the Cavs had an extreme

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.130

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.680 
situation they made a couple of trade
midseason<00:02:55.700> but<00:02:56.700> by<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.940> end<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.360> year<00:02:57.540> he

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
midseason but by the end of the year he

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.570 
midseason but by the end of the year he
was<00:02:57.810> only<00:02:57.990> playing<00:02:58.260> eight<00:02:58.500> guys<00:02:58.740> in<00:02:59.280> the

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
was only playing eight guys in the

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.760 
was only playing eight guys in the
rotation<00:02:59.760> in<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.360> regular<00:03:00.690> season<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.230> that

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
rotation in the regular season and that

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.230 
rotation in the regular season and that
didn't<00:03:02.190> bode<00:03:02.340> well<00:03:02.370> for<00:03:02.640> them<00:03:02.970> when<00:03:03.150> they

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
didn't bode well for them when they

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.000 
didn't bode well for them when they
needed<00:03:03.450> help<00:03:03.780> at<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.080> end<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:04.530> when<00:03:04.920> David

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
needed help at the end so when David

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.800 
needed help at the end so when David
Blatt<00:03:05.340> re-evaluates<00:03:06.150> things<00:03:06.390> this<00:03:06.570> year<00:03:06.780> I

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
Blatt re-evaluates things this year I

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.600 
Blatt re-evaluates things this year I
think<00:03:07.110> that's<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.290> chance<00:03:07.530> he<00:03:08.130> tries<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.459> play

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
think that's a chance he tries to play

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.340 
think that's a chance he tries to play
more<00:03:08.820> players<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.270> get<00:03:09.570> more<00:03:09.750> rest<00:03:09.990> for<00:03:10.230> guys

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
more players and get more rest for guys

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.830 
more players and get more rest for guys
and<00:03:10.790> but<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:11.850> don't<00:03:12.030> know<00:03:12.120> how<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.330> affected

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
and but I don't know how that affected

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.690 
and but I don't know how that affected
millions<00:03:13.190> decision<00:03:14.190> we'll<00:03:14.310> see<00:03:14.459> how<00:03:14.640> many

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700
