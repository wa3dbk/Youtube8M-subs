your toe will hang off the board and so

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.639 
your toe will hang off the board and so
from<00:00:38.460> there<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:39.030> kind<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.629> put<00:00:40.500> your

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
gloves down and just push out as hard as

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.119 
gloves down and just push out as hard as
you<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.559> morning<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.920> can

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
you can it's just like a morning you can

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:56.660 
you can it's just like a morning you can
afford<00:00:54.379> you<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.530> see<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.890> trick<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.399> pretty

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
afford you can see this trick is pretty

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.229 
afford you can see this trick is pretty
simple

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
simple

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.099 
simple
so<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.920> most<00:00:59.550> common<00:01:00.030> mistakes<00:01:00.390> are<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.930> go

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
so like most common mistakes are you go

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.200 
so like most common mistakes are you go
on<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> slide<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:02.340> don't<00:01:02.489> want<00:01:02.640> us<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.969> any

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
on the slide you don't want us to be any

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.399 
on the slide you don't want us to be any
kind<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> cool<00:01:03.920> halfway<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.189> Shh<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.880> stop

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
kind of cool halfway like Shh you stop

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.690 
kind of cool halfway like Shh you stop
another<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.770> foot<00:01:08.189> placement<00:01:08.549> isn't

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
another one is foot placement isn't

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.230 
another one is foot placement isn't
right

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
right

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.420 
right
and<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.930> hang<00:01:10.260> off<00:01:10.439> both<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.920> your<00:01:11.010> feet<00:01:11.220> or

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
and you hang off both of your feet or

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.280 
and you hang off both of your feet or
you're<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.909> not<00:01:12.090> ham<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.570> your<00:01:12.840> feet<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
you're just not ham and your feet and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.899 
you're just not ham and your feet and
you<00:01:13.740> don't<00:01:13.920> spin<00:01:14.189> you're<00:01:14.369> putting<00:01:14.640> your<00:01:14.729> board

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
you don't spin you're putting your board

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.880 
you don't spin you're putting your board
this<00:01:15.030> goes<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.570> way<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.110> keep<00:01:16.380> rolling<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
this goes that way you keep rolling and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.330 
this goes that way you keep rolling and
you<00:01:16.979> fall<00:01:17.479> so<00:01:18.479> that's<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.710> also<00:01:20.070> there's

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
you fall so that's about it also there's

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.399 
you fall so that's about it also there's
some<00:01:20.689> variations<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.380> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
some variations you can do it like a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.789 
some variations you can do it like a
pendulum<00:01:22.830> or<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:24.119> push<00:01:24.420> up<00:01:24.570> our<00:01:24.720> side<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
pendulum or to push up our side but to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.520 
pendulum or to push up our side but to
mention<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:27.210> push<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> power<00:01:27.630> slide<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.170> same

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
mention or push a power slide the same

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.039 
mention or push a power slide the same
same<00:01:29.369> feet<00:01:29.579> placement<00:01:29.820> except<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.659> need<00:01:30.990> a

with the song well it's pretty easy for
a<00:02:36.840> beginner<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:39.220> yeah<00:02:46.560> it's<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.620> pretty<00:02:47.830> easy<00:02:48.130> so

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
a beginner so yeah it's a pretty easy so

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.789 
a beginner so yeah it's a pretty easy so
I<00:02:48.430> like<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.880> push-up<00:02:49.440> some<00:02:50.440> common<00:02:50.739> mistakes

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
I like the push-up some common mistakes

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.620 
I like the push-up some common mistakes
again<00:02:51.370> are<00:02:51.730> they<00:02:52.060> don't<00:02:52.150> get<00:02:52.330> enough<00:02:52.480> speed

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
again are they don't get enough speed

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.560 
again are they don't get enough speed
and<00:02:53.019> their<00:02:53.920> board<00:02:54.220> starts<00:02:54.670> rolling<00:02:54.910> they

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
and their board starts rolling they

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.050 
and their board starts rolling they
don't<00:02:55.750> slide<00:02:55.989> it<00:02:56.170> off<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.560> then<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.910> other

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
don't slide it off and then the other

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.640 
don't slide it off and then the other
one<00:02:58.329> is<00:02:58.359> when<00:02:58.720> they<00:02:58.840> don't<00:02:58.959> put<00:02:59.260> their<00:02:59.440> weight

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
one is when they don't put their weight

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.150 
one is when they don't put their weight
on<00:02:59.890> their<00:03:00.010> back<00:03:00.940> hand<00:03:01.329> and<00:03:02.230> they<00:03:02.560> just<00:03:02.769> don't

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
on their back hand and they just don't
