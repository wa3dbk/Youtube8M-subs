00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
we've really tried to do is make bait

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.919 
we've really tried to do is make bait
casting<00:00:22.890> easy<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.820> simple<00:00:24.240> for<00:00:24.300> beginner

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:24.929 
casting easy and simple for beginner

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.599 
casting easy and simple for beginner
level<00:00:25.500> bait<00:00:25.800> cast<00:00:26.570> anglers<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.749> also<00:00:28.019> youth

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
level bait cast anglers and also youth

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.429 
level bait cast anglers and also youth
so<00:00:29.609> what<00:00:29.759> this<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.480> makes<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.810> unique<00:00:30.960> it

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
so what this is what makes it unique it

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.730 
so what this is what makes it unique it
incorporates<00:00:32.099> an<00:00:32.250> anti<00:00:32.520> backlash<00:00:33.030> mechanism

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
incorporates an anti backlash mechanism

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.340 
incorporates an anti backlash mechanism
so<00:00:34.740> when<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> spool<00:00:35.490> is<00:00:35.640> engaged<00:00:36.020> at<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.230> end

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
so when the spool is engaged at the end

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.900 
so when the spool is engaged at the end
of<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.500> cast<00:00:37.739> there's<00:00:38.130> a<00:00:38.190> little<00:00:38.430> censor<00:00:38.760> bar

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
of the cast there's a little censor bar

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.760 
of the cast there's a little censor bar
here<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.150> flips<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:39.720> and<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.260> prevents<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
here that flips up and it prevents the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.580 
here that flips up and it prevents the
line<00:00:40.950> from<00:00:41.250> back<00:00:41.430> lashing<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.350> cast

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
line from back lashing so you can cast

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.500 
line from back lashing so you can cast
all<00:00:43.920> day<00:00:44.160> long<00:00:44.400> never<00:00:44.790> have<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.180> thumb<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
all day long never have to thumb the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.240 
all day long never have to thumb the
spool<00:00:45.780> when<00:00:46.380> you<00:00:46.500> become<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.830> little<00:00:47.100> more

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
spool when you become a little more

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.400 
spool when you become a little more
comfortable<00:00:47.610> go<00:00:48.060> ahead<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.420> start<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:49.230> thumb

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
comfortable go ahead and start to thumb

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.620 
comfortable go ahead and start to thumb
the<00:00:49.560> spool<00:00:49.830> to<00:00:49.860> become<00:00:50.310> more<00:00:50.460> accurate<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
the spool to become more accurate and

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.930 
the spool to become more accurate and
then<00:00:51.900> after<00:00:52.200> that<00:00:52.380> turn<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.310> mechanism<00:00:53.790> off

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
then after that turn the mechanism off

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.210 
then after that turn the mechanism off
just<00:00:54.240> by<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.420> flip<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.960> lever<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.920> casts

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
just by the flip of a lever and it casts

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.980 
just by the flip of a lever and it casts
like<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> normal<00:00:56.760> bait<00:00:56.910> cast<00:00:57.150> reel<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.810> I'm<00:00:57.870> just

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
like a normal bait cast reel so I'm just

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.570 
like a normal bait cast reel so I'm just
going<00:00:58.110> to<00:00:58.200> demonstrate<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:58.830> I'm<00:00:59.430> going

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
going to demonstrate it here I'm going

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.190 
going to demonstrate it here I'm going
to<00:00:59.640> cast<00:00:59.910> right<00:01:00.180> against<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.600> wall<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.140> as

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
to cast right against this wall and as

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.780 
to cast right against this wall and as
you<00:01:01.290> can<00:01:01.440> imagine<00:01:01.650> what<00:01:02.190> would<00:01:02.310> happen<00:01:02.610> to<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
you can imagine what would happen to a

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.950 
you can imagine what would happen to a
normal<00:01:03.090> bait<00:01:03.270> cast<00:01:03.540> reel

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.390 

no<00:01:07.770> some<00:01:08.100> no<00:01:08.670> backlash<00:01:09.119> every<00:01:09.659> time

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
no some no backlash every time

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.730 
no some no backlash every time
just<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> little<00:01:12.660> demonstration<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
just as a little demonstration for the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
you what would happen if you cast a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.200 
you what would happen if you cast a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
and don't use your thumb to stop the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.320 
and don't use your thumb to stop the
line<00:01:24.500> as<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.620> can<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.980> you<00:01:26.130> got<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> got<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> few

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
line as you can see you got a got a few

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.690 
line as you can see you got a got a few
hours<00:01:27.480> of<00:01:27.690> picking<00:01:28.380> out<00:01:28.470> bird's<00:01:28.710> nest<00:01:28.980> let's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
hours of picking out bird's nest let's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.990 
hours of picking out bird's nest let's
try<00:01:29.910> that<00:01:30.200> with<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.260> Shakespeare<00:01:32.010> easy<00:01:32.250> cast

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:47.179 

as<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.690> see<00:01:36.930> no<00:01:37.380> backlash

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.300 

one<00:01:48.119> unique<00:01:48.450> thing<00:01:48.510> about<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.500> anti<00:01:49.860> backlash

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
one unique thing about the anti backlash

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.789 
one unique thing about the anti backlash
mechanism<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.540> really<00:01:51.840> rewards<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.590> good

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
mechanism is it really rewards a good

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.380 
mechanism is it really rewards a good
cast<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:53.790> going<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> great

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
cast so it's going to be a great

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.680 
cast so it's going to be a great
teaching<00:01:54.659> tool<00:01:54.990> for<00:01:55.020> beginner<00:01:55.799> anglers<00:01:56.690> if

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
teaching tool for beginner anglers if

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.350 
teaching tool for beginner anglers if
you<00:01:57.869> do<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> quick<00:01:58.320> choppy<00:01:58.830> cast<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.820> mechanism

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
you do a quick choppy cast the mechanism

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.649 
you do a quick choppy cast the mechanism
will<00:02:00.450> automatically<00:02:00.990> stop<00:02:01.259> your<00:02:01.440> cast<00:02:01.649> as<00:02:01.890> a

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
will automatically stop your cast as a

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.380 
will automatically stop your cast as a
you<00:02:03.659> would<00:02:03.810> normally<00:02:04.229> backlash<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.979> reel<00:02:05.299> so<00:02:06.299> if

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
you would normally backlash a reel so if

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.660 
you would normally backlash a reel so if
you<00:02:06.479> do<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> nice<00:02:06.869> smooth<00:02:07.259> cast<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.039> really

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
you do a nice smooth cast and really

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.710 
you do a nice smooth cast and really
practice<00:02:09.090> you're<00:02:09.239> going<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.420> be<00:02:09.509> able<00:02:09.569> to

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
practice you're going to be able to

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.740
