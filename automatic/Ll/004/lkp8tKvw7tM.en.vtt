fish to death doom but the puppet that
that<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:36.100> they<00:01:36.520> get<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.790> decade<00:01:37.119> at<00:01:37.240> that

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.789 

starting<00:01:56.659> off<00:01:56.810> again<00:01:57.850> with<00:01:59.289> sextuplets<00:02:00.289> six

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
starting off again with sextuplets six

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.700 
starting off again with sextuplets six
notes<00:02:01.070> in<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.490> beat<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.289> semiquaver<00:02:03.289> triplets

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
notes in the beat so semiquaver triplets

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.649 
notes in the beat so semiquaver triplets
they<00:02:03.920> get<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:04.670> they<00:02:04.789> get<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.060> depth<00:02:05.299> down

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
they get that they get the depth down

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.199 
they get that they get the depth down
but<00:02:06.110> instead<00:02:06.229> of<00:02:06.560> one<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.340> here<00:02:07.939> I<00:02:07.969> was

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
but instead of one and here I was

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.509 
but instead of one and here I was
playing<00:02:08.420> 1e<00:02:09.050> ant<00:02:09.349> which<00:02:09.979> means<00:02:10.250> we've

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
playing 1e ant which means we've

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.570 
playing 1e ant which means we've
switched<00:02:11.060> from<00:02:11.540> semi<00:02:12.319> covert<00:02:12.680> triplets<00:02:13.040> to

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
switched from semi covert triplets to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.539 
switched from semi covert triplets to
semiquavers<00:02:14.569> so<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.530> can<00:02:15.860> practice<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.250> on

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
semiquavers so you can practice that on

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.660 
semiquavers so you can practice that on
the<00:02:16.670> pad<00:02:16.849> as<00:02:17.150> well<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:19.010> six<00:02:19.220> stroke<00:02:19.459> roll

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
the pad as well so the six stroke roll

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.220 
the pad as well so the six stroke roll
