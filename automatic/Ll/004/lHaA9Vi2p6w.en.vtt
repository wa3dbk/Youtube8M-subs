00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.369 
silk base closure but you will have to
go<00:02:24.659> in<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.939> probably<00:02:26.939> put<00:02:27.360> concealer<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.140> the

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
go in and probably put concealer on the

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.179 
go in and probably put concealer on the
parting<00:02:28.829> so<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.609> matches<00:02:29.939> your<00:02:30.629> skin<00:02:30.989> tone

parting so it matches your skin tone

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.429 
parting so it matches your skin tone
because<00:02:32.189> it<00:02:32.579> can<00:02:32.939> look<00:02:33.299> a<00:02:33.540> little<00:02:33.840> bit<00:02:33.989> lighter

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
because it can look a little bit lighter

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.649 
because it can look a little bit lighter
