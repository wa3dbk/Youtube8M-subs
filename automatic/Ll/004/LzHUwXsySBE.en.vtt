00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.529
 once more batman beat his boots 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.190
 it's not my fault for all that he 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.969
 because he creates something beats until 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.490
 now he's the cheeky one I got in 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.650
 debate day but hit boots in this 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.869
 last arc in the game that there is 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.810
 Capulo gang leaders where cuts 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.180
 in a final battle the batman and the joker 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.310
 are buried in rubble 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.320
 And then, like violin, he predicted that the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.630
 newspaper in fact the bass died 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.270
 We will also have a 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.040
 new replacement which has been revealed that 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.770
 will be commissioner gordon is with a 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.570
 visual change can not even say that I 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.910
 like because it is communicating through 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.620
 of marina series shaved so is 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.570
 he scratched his mustache too. 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.370
 He had a mustache and barely recognizes the guy and 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.680
 he is the one who is going to use this 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.690
 armor of the rabbit san-san beats sanction 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.129
 the penalty mark and gives attention from 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.600
 of June in the United States when it hits 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.329
 a life in this armor and for the police 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.940
 the route and bruce wayne is gone 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.979
 because he was buried there is all that air 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.110
 involving the figure is increased 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.640
 batman mythology batman as figure 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.799
 or a joker who maybe as a 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.080
 immortal another figure also the two 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.240
 Hugs hug there until he comes back. 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.390
 because they thought it was not logical 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.189
 football dude died did not die it goes 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.659
 back we know you will weigh with 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.970
 scott snyder he knows what he is 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.159
 making is a guy who can not write 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.659
 it's a gift it's a guy who matters in this 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.549
 kind of gooseberry it stays but brasilia 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.810
 good but he has earned the right to 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.880
 write 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.400
 He gave an interview saying that it could be 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.470
 The most stupid idea idea 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.049
 made by the border does not say no 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.149
 I foresee this stupid idea that 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.619
 like he already saw then he was himself know 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.509
 but it was not as he said it was not the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.380
 first time the wizard and hit the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.689
 boots 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.340
 he had already died sometimes 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.380
 died first in the fall of the bat 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.450
 when the good went there and broke the rib 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.799
 He was wheelchair she just 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.689
 is there the goalkeeper broke the rib and 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.860
 he can not play because he was 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.560
 every day 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.630
 Ana Marcela you are thinking about getting married 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.700
 anatomy but in the comics he stays 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.360
 in the wheelchair and the big ael 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.250
 take over 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.170
 açaí is one of the first substitutes of the 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.510
 Batman in the comics he is actually 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.790
 one test tube baby who had his DNA the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.250
 their genes mixed and was also 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.680
 descendant of an order is today is the 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.040
 it was great israel, he kind of gets 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.080
 paranoid and violated each with each new 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.370
 edition of hq until the moment it is 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.170
 responsible for the death of the villain 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.760
 slaughterhouse and everyone starts to 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.480
 question because this is the batman that 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.130
 people want 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.750
 broke it goes there and takes back the 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.060
 place after the fall of the 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.250
 bat your arm around like you said 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.230
 but soon after he hands over the charge 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.090
 hands the batman cloak for the first time. 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.560
 time for an ex young man who is the dick 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.940
 grayson uec or upgrade that grows 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.190
 the first time he takes over the mantle of the 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.989
 Batman and Grayson Were Favorite 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.700
 to be the new batman but there the bruno 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.350
 cell phone inside there at the core of it 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.090
 thought I will not do that because that will 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.400
 bn it kills it is also always this 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.980
 problem he creates the kids there to be 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.019
 the successor also creates training 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.830
 then he the rule now I do not want to play 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.150
 for life 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.769
 But this story was cool because I 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.540
 I say this he learned from 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:21.220
 past and difficult became a less expensive 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.380
 impetuous and such but of course I 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.930
 I indicated already came Batman Mantle 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.690
 sometimes at the end of the final crisis 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.940
 when dark side kills the batman he went 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.230
 he who went there and said that he always has 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.970
 that there is a batman 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.100
 This bad I think the premise the escort 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.630
 in the street zenaide took it that for 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.269
 and that the fat man himself 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.680
 put it there in the mentalization does not have 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.410
 to have a batman since there is no one 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.030
 better you the same is the the creation 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.130
 palaia took over the mantle of Batman the 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.560
 beginning because in the in succession it is 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.959
 always the first is the first hobby is 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.400
 on the scene it has to be the dna is very 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.049
 little has stories in reality 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.760
 that you hate when you become an adult 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.040
 He becomes a batman but he's too stupid. 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.440
 Morrison's ox had already written the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.030
 final crisis he also wrote Batman 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.160
 and robin was a series created for 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.660
 or establish connection as Batman and 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.100
 game as a hobby but it 's funny that 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.959
 no one ever remembers the poor ones 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.690
 Because money can not have 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.209
 picked up resulted from an unbalanced 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.859
 as the moon is logical edson can he already 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.540
 comes a wrong editorial decision until 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.180
 killed cara and leave love 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.160
 I should not have come back in our 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.120
 the hell I say you said jason 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.040
 Not yet, dude. 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.990
 really unbalanced in the 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.760
 battle for the hood that is when all 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:36.610
 knocks millions fight there the mantle of 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:39.460
 batman and fasting can be out 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.260
 tortured to leave her the criminals 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.130
 going hungry and maybe a boot does not hit 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.500
 very well 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.080
 I 'm also very young, I 'm black. 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.020
 I did not have anyone had much 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.380
 My problem, this is a thing of 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.750
 teenager he always denied problems 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.280
 girl with means that vuitton is but I think 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.200
 that the guild was the most indicated guy 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.580
 to become batman and that beginning of 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.690
 Batman and Robin that much bigger fall 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.040
 that 's very cool 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.780
 there is a moment when they take a corpse 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.370
 he tried to revive a little and 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.140
 discovers that it is the clone created by dark 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.790
 side is a super cool moment that the 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.220
 batman to fight with everyone who 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.600
 Batman monstrengo, this is fine. 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.760
 cool but what matters is that bruce 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.270
 wayne actually returns after Batman and 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.890
 robin 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.200
 He learns one more thing, either. 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.630
 smoke the batman corporation when he 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.480
 scatter several guards as well. 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.780
 by various batman each continent have the 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.400
 your bass you have Argentines and I have 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.500
 African, this is a Japanese. It 's really cool. 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.480
 It's just starting with we also had 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.520
 in addition to several of these 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.800
 neighborhood that take on the mantle we had 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.900
 villains also last year where it was made 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.460
 that level forever they were leaving 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.700
 the villains as protagonists of some 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.100
 of some hqs and a good one and was one of the 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.810
 took over the batman figure he picked up the 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.000
 truth the batman clothes in a war 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.410
 of gangs and became a batman an 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.460
 gigantic, right? 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.380
 It's a business they did not take advantage of. 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.000
 so much so that the batman after 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.610
 went to fight with good the good was very 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.500
 more like the good of the movie and another 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.240
 who also got hold of the mantle of the 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.000
 bat was the foreigner who 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.670
 psychiatrist is that he can give a 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.920
 batman in bd secret entity on it and there 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.690
 begins to act on two fronts 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.910
 it starts to undermine the finances of 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.410
 family on the one hand and on the other hand 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.680
 he establishes an auction and maintains the 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.870
 bruce wayne batman arrested and he stays 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.870
 acting as a batman he gets 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.490
 auction on your secret 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.030
 bat man is very interesting 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.449
 this bow there and the taste of you knows the 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.270
 from batman 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:37.490
 batman arkham series which was goal 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.680
 went back to apple milan is half 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.870
 forgotten not exchange we spoke of ael 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.050
 which was the first he appears naked arkham 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.059
 city with a secondary role so it is 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.159
 You've been doing parallel missions, but 

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:51.259
 now in Markan night he appeared and 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:52.669
 it looks like it's going to be the main guy 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:53.870
 so after the scarecrow that is going to be 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.819
 a bigger villain 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.979
 azfael will be a very 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:00.559
 batman partner and we will have the 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:02.120
 night wing will have the robot then you can 

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:04.550
 be seen a passage of 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.110
 also in the game was any 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.029
 way in the comics was not 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.949
 cool for a long time I think 

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:12.529
 he also took advantage of the 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:14.749
 months and such euros or even come back in the year 

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:17.210
 he deserves debate rabbit is expensive 

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:19.159
 nice bizarre the list appears in 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.539
 It's my job, Batman.
