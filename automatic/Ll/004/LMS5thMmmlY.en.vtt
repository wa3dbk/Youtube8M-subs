with the pinks and whites from the buds
and<00:00:16.619> then<00:00:17.039> these<00:00:17.160> reproductive<00:00:17.910> structures

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
and then these reproductive structures

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.890 
and then these reproductive structures
the<00:00:18.900> stamens<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.529> come<00:00:19.770> out<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.250> are<00:00:20.900> very

flowy and contain all the pollen on the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.769 
flowy and contain all the pollen on the
outside<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.920> very<00:00:26.099> nice<00:00:26.420> very<00:00:27.420> unique
