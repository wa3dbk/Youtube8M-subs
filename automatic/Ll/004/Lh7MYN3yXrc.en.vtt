have to read as much every single night

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.670 
have to read as much every single night
because<00:00:39.030> you're<00:00:39.420> there<00:00:39.719> every<00:00:39.989> single<00:00:40.379> day

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
because you're there every single day

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.459 
because you're there every single day
for<00:00:41.489> five<00:00:41.760> days<00:00:41.790> every<00:00:42.629> week<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.410> two

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
for five days every week for two

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.310 
for five days every week for two
semesters<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.579> lot<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.270> times<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.930> college

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
semesters a lot of times in college

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.139 
semesters a lot of times in college
classes<00:00:46.800> you're<00:00:47.250> there<00:00:47.399> only<00:00:47.640> three<00:00:47.969> days<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
classes you're there only three days a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.139 
classes you're there only three days a
week<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.750> 16<00:00:49.079> weeks<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.520> that's<00:00:50.700> why<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.910> have

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
week for 16 weeks so that's why you have

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.330 
week for 16 weeks so that's why you have
to<00:00:51.270> read<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.629> lot<00:00:52.320> more<00:00:52.649> than<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.129> high

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
to read a lot more than you do in high

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.580 
to read a lot more than you do in high
school<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.449> think<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.079> lot<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.289> kids

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
school and I think that a lot of kids

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.529 
school and I think that a lot of kids
kind<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.250> suffer<00:00:56.610> from<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.969> because<00:00:57.120> I'm<00:00:57.420> not

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
kind of suffer from that because I'm not

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.060 
kind of suffer from that because I'm not
used<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.960> reading<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.289> much<00:00:58.590> every<00:00:58.829> single

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
used to reading that much every single

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.670 
used to reading that much every single
night<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.520> plus<00:01:00.149> that's<00:01:00.480> one<00:01:00.809> class<00:01:01.170> then<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
night and plus that's one class then you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.820 
night and plus that's one class then you
have<00:01:01.890> how<00:01:02.760> many<00:01:02.820> other<00:01:03.090> classes<00:01:03.830> another

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
have how many other classes another

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.410 
have how many other classes another
thing<00:01:05.100> that's<00:01:05.250> different<00:01:05.549> between<00:01:05.729> college

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
thing that's different between college

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.520 
thing that's different between college
classes<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.840> high<00:01:07.080> school<00:01:07.320> classes

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
classes and high school classes

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.850 
classes and high school classes
basically<00:01:07.920> class<00:01:08.430> size<00:01:09.110> from<00:01:10.110> me<00:01:10.290> I've<00:01:10.590> never

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
basically class size from me I've never

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.800 
basically class size from me I've never
had<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.340> problem<00:01:11.580> because<00:01:12.030> I've<00:01:12.360> got<00:01:12.659> to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
had this problem because I've got to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.590 
had this problem because I've got to
choose<00:01:13.020> small<00:01:13.470> colleges<00:01:14.130> both<00:01:15.090> times<00:01:15.420> have

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
choose small colleges both times have

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600 
choose small colleges both times have
been<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.840> class<00:01:16.049> but<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.310> 300

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
been in class but you can have up to 300

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190 
been in class but you can have up to 300
people<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.299> your<00:01:18.479> classes<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.049> college

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
people in your classes in college

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.950 
people in your classes in college
probably<00:01:20.070> even<00:01:20.250> more<00:01:20.580> depending<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.360> how<00:01:21.750> big

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
probably even more depending on how big

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960 
probably even more depending on how big
the<00:01:21.990> college<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.740> go<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.340> in

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the college is that you go to and in

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.880 
the college is that you go to and in
those<00:01:24.150> colleges<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.049> professor<00:01:25.560> won't<00:01:25.680> know

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
those colleges the professor won't know

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.260 
those colleges the professor won't know
your<00:01:26.040> name<00:01:26.220> you're<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.790> number<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.150> them

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
your name you're just a number to them

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.700 
your name you're just a number to them
and<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.180> that's<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.600> big<00:01:30.900> difference

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and so you know that's a big difference

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.160 
and so you know that's a big difference
and<00:01:31.890> you're<00:01:32.009> not<00:01:32.130> getting<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.520> one-on-one

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
and you're not getting the one-on-one

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.690 
and you're not getting the one-on-one
work<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.500> usually<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.130> high<00:01:35.369> school

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
work that you usually get in high school

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.460 
work that you usually get in high school
and<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.329> lot<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.600> people<00:01:36.840> probably<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.200> said

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and a lot of people probably have said

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.630 
and a lot of people probably have said
this<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.070> you're<00:01:38.159> thinking<00:01:38.310> yeah

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
this to you and you're thinking yeah

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.780 
this to you and you're thinking yeah
whatever<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.299> deal<00:01:39.450> with<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:40.790> even

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
whatever I can deal with that but even

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.460 
whatever I can deal with that but even
if<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.180> are<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> really<00:01:42.600> good<00:01:42.689> student<00:01:43.110> now<00:01:43.200> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
if you are a really good student now and

I never had study hall I never learned
how<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.879> study<00:02:15.360> because<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.870> didn't<00:02:16.230> need<00:02:16.379> to<00:02:16.650> so

I<00:02:16.890> didn't<00:02:17.129> have<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.370> teach<00:02:17.580> myself<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.299> then

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
I didn't have to teach myself and then

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.630 
I didn't have to teach myself and then
we<00:02:19.319> didn't<00:02:19.530> have<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.709> study<00:02:19.980> hall<00:02:20.159> on<00:02:20.280> top<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.549> it

we didn't have a study hall on top of it

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.520 
we didn't have a study hall on top of it
so<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.760> never<00:02:20.879> learned<00:02:21.269> good<00:02:21.569> study<00:02:21.930> habits<00:02:22.019> and
