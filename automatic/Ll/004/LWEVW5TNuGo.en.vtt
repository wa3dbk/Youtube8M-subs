00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
good with the after effect but you can

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.360 
good with the after effect but you can
see<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.470> everything<00:02:24.470> works<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:25.220> way<00:02:25.340> you

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
see that everything works the way you

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.570 
see that everything works the way you
expected<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.769> looks<00:02:27.769> awesome<00:02:28.190> even<00:02:28.340> the

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
expected it looks awesome even the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.580 
expected it looks awesome even the
lights<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.330> color<00:02:29.569> of<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.900> lights<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.530> the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
lights the color of the lights is the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.460 
lights the color of the lights is the
same<00:02:30.980> one<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:33.280> what<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.370> call<00:02:34.519> it<00:02:35.140> an<00:02:36.140> after

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
same one and what you call it an after

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.670 
same one and what you call it an after
effect<00:02:36.739> so<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:38.569> get<00:02:38.720> even<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:39.110> colors<00:02:39.440> light

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
effect so you get even the colors light

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.770 
effect so you get even the colors light
and<00:02:39.920> everything<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.400> then<00:02:40.880> set<00:02:41.540> up<00:02:41.630> the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.330 
and everything and then set up the
materials<00:02:42.319> for<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.620> for<00:02:42.799> example<00:02:42.890> if<00:02:43.220> you

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
materials for you for example if you

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.940 
materials for you for example if you
have<00:02:43.489> bunch<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.970> images<00:02:44.269> will<00:02:45.170> set<00:02:45.500> out<00:02:45.590> set

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
have bunch of images will set out set

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.039 
have bunch of images will set out set
the<00:02:46.310> material<00:02:46.730> for<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:47.000> that's<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.630> good<00:02:47.810> thing

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
the material for you that's a good thing

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.170 
the material for you that's a good thing
but<00:02:48.980> definitely<00:02:49.459> know<00:02:49.549> maybe<00:02:49.819> you<00:02:49.940> want<00:02:50.060> to

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
but definitely know maybe you want to

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.789 
but definitely know maybe you want to
tweak<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.750> specular<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.410> all<00:02:51.500> this<00:02:51.680> stuff

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
tweak the specular and all this stuff

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.449 
tweak the specular and all this stuff
but<00:02:52.250> hey<00:02:53.120> works<00:02:53.630> fine<00:02:53.900> as<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:54.200> can<00:02:54.319> see<00:02:54.470> pretty

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
but hey works fine as you can see pretty

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.110 
but hey works fine as you can see pretty
cool<00:02:56.410> stuff<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.590> guess<00:02:57.799> they<00:02:58.040> did<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.549> maximum

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
cool stuff I guess they did the maximum

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.390 
cool stuff I guess they did the maximum
for<00:02:59.450> this<00:02:59.630> update<00:02:59.930> I'll<00:03:00.799> leave<00:03:01.070> a<00:03:01.100> link<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.340> the

description so you guys can go and
download<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.950> works<00:03:04.790> for<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.769> think<00:03:06.769> almost

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
download and works for I think almost

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.500 
download and works for I think almost
after<00:03:08.390> all<00:03:08.510> after<00:03:08.750> effects<00:03:09.290> cs5<00:03:09.859> three<00:03:10.640> cs4

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
after all after effects cs5 three cs4

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.940 
after all after effects cs5 three cs4
and<00:03:11.780> cs5<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.890> CS<00:03:13.609> five<00:03:13.820> point<00:03:14.209> five<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:15.079> works

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
and cs5 and CS five point five so works

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.340 
and cs5 and CS five point five so works
with<00:03:16.130> everything<00:03:16.370> works<00:03:17.380> with<00:03:18.380> our<00:03:19.000> 12<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.510> 13

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
with everything works with our 12 and 13

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.809 
with everything works with our 12 and 13
I<00:03:21.500> think<00:03:21.530> I'm<00:03:21.920> not<00:03:22.069> sure<00:03:22.130> let<00:03:22.549> me<00:03:22.579> check<00:03:22.760> for

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
I think I'm not sure let me check for

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:31.940 
I think I'm not sure let me check for
you<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:25.450> let's<00:03:26.450> see<00:03:26.569> oh<00:03:27.250> actually<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.760> work<00:03:29.030> til

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.790 

six<00:03:32.950> point<00:03:33.580> five<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.270> seven<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.200> zero<00:03:35.230> for<00:03:35.650> D

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
six point five and seven to zero for D

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.350 
six point five and seven to zero for D
so<00:03:36.160> that's<00:03:36.550> a<00:03:36.730> good<00:03:36.910> thing

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
so that's a good thing

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.340 
so that's a good thing
eleven<00:03:38.020> point<00:03:38.260> five<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:39.040> our<00:03:39.760> 12<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.450> our<00:03:40.959> 13

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
eleven point five and our 12 and our 13

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.580 
eleven point five and our 12 and our 13
so<00:03:42.100> basically<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.090> think<00:03:43.180> what<00:03:43.450> works<00:03:43.660> in<00:03:43.840> every

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
so basically I think what works in every

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.800 
so basically I think what works in every
version<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:45.160> snow<00:03:45.430> for<00:03:45.610> D<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:46.360> anyway<00:03:46.660> guys

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
version of snow for D so anyway guys

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.559 
version of snow for D so anyway guys
