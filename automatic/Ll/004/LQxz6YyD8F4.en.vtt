00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.340
 At that time 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.040
 The words are 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:58.840
 If this is a super visit then it's a ghost 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:04.300
 It's a government, and when it's crooked, it follows the principle of the example 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:07.590
 But I'm good when I have Well Let It is that dialogue called Yossha

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:13.490
 It is super powerful to say that it becomes hearing 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:18.300
 That's because today I'm missing, but it's a super powerful record, but the major will give, but the target

 Enemy if not two or more people is not invoked as a 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.569
 It is to say 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:29.890
 In other words 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:32.690
 It says that the enemy can not be used in boss missions and super boss mission that only come out one body 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.350
 That's right 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.350
 Put simply 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:44.790
 It will be super-powerful that will cause hearing power damage Well this will be improved later 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:50.489

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:11.280
 A card that transforms into a superbed when you combine it into a bedit and put it out in the ward area 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:14.810
 I wanted to add an option . 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:19.220
