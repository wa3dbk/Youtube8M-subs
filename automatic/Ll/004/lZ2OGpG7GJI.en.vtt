 The corporation wanted to catch it as if I had said that all four 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.250
 expires we show that and percent show you that that is yes 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.859
 Draw at the draw happened 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:18.659
 I'll show you a short time yes said it would have been done so really me 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:21.150
 hold on again that my good so far I stop again 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.070
 put this first if the water so that we do not get off this somehow 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.009
 marked 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.369
 they all look the same out of these white and in is a divorced one so that 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.669
 everything was fair 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.370
 I'll look at all the camera and then grab in the middle and percent 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.570
 with the fact that I would rather have cheated but such a festival just the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.540
 colorful bow like that 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.530
 warned twice 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.620
 Percent are the odds and so in the Bix that he will appreciate with theirs and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.350
 give all information on the homepage 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.950
 and Federer was normal just rereading the GZ why the draw was down too 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.630
 see who plays against whom 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.170
 I started with the first draws Fire Department could that is unfair 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.180
 it sounds like that, I have not seen it myself yet 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.980
 Exten us pastors Ackerman year 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.860
 it is only about the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.860
 it is rather calmer killer set 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.520
 FM Munzer is a bit closer to the camera for Hewitt than that 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.880
 Vista Red APA 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.700

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.150
 Pechstein monsters 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.210
 who play against them use Lula da Silva is machinery 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.710
 the tournament in Halle 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 melodious singing 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.820
 besides luck 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.120
 Haarmann german-american work as the love 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.010
 if he stands like that group 8 ever 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
 Warner continues pretty unspectacular No 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.770
 often turn around once before 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.300
 Cologne we go 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.930
 erö permission Plattling times want to see Berlin are opponents 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.440
 not all my animals extremely horny the Allmend second highest 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.549
 on 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.729
 APA in peace 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.459
 Policies further this advance 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.329
 hor 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.379
 but that's part of a loss Scheer I can not do anything 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.469
 I'm sorry 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:27.009
 and he's still playing net from gross after a completely gone 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:31.429
 SK SupplyOn close to that is group b 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:35.829
 that might be interesting to say helper to attack must be scared that it is 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:36.739
 not bad 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.069
 the really interesting group 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.029
 defense 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:45.319
 and there we have what is there Kobe Steel Co here comes the 4 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.759
 Friedhoff Janina a cap there 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.239
 If you actually know only one participant, Corner can go there 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.239
 she was gaming 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.459
 on the other hand, German Kurt Schori is the wrong Walter 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.329
 Note on 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.329
 but on the subject I thought three groups 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:15.259
 sometimes in four groups 4 No yes jerking 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:18.879
 to occupy quite a bit but really wondered would be timeless 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.899
 that could be something for everyone 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:26.089
 there but absolutely Barroso the first did not even confuse LG this water 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:30.050
 I say nothing against it but what yesterday a way 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.049
 Accidentally mispronounced because I have no violations 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.609
 not only in moderation 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.609
 The cardiac is some of the Hope Shari Zey too heavy 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:44.209
 but kill García Rohde is big Euro 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.319
 GEU 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.369
 let's see what that should be 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:53.220
 Before that had become tough with us in a group 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.589
 Euro and thus come between the country and municipalities 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:04:00.739
 the most interesting group but I have to say it's fair so talk 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.739
 last last slip first cap is logical 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:11.349
 so that's the eyes and ears off we're here our partner is planning with Cadel 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.809
 Evans in a group «The Internet is very arrogant the lotter exactly 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:17.349
 went out 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.139
 Snow sitting up 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.280
 I know something that is no fun and variety anymore 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.960
 Anyone just ask best to stop the homepage 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.210
 or meters then I mean the the Dingo Grande 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.660
 I ask you all in the juice vaguely send us that's too much he is 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.759
 usually again 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.199
 To reiterate that he rate of each participant simply fairness 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.090
 stays fair he drives Cup should be fun 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.540
 and year of the best song wins »to get all information from the AG and to stand 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.610
 Paech, too, then he has every chance Mom has left 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.780
 Saturday to season and there you can play against us but come but 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.210
 the new Force India where is the time 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.139
 I definitely want 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.349
 everyone a lot of fun and percent 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:01.889
 if a game is fair 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.889
 5 so solves 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.779
 if I think I do not have my voice anyway 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.580
 but you should 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.180
 you should not 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.550
 global 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.550
 So I burn my eyes 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.879
 but have increased 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.409
 this CAD is percent 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.330
 the crater could be the 2 1 for 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.779
 my 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:39.399
 which opened every hen open and Selge David Banda but from then on the couple 

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:45.639
 have Ralf Bochert mine reachable so the Erlanger high percentage Pletnow 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:45.899
 Come on
