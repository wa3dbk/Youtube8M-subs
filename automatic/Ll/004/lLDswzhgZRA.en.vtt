00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.850

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.410
 the release of the transfer pokashevar world will become 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.449
 tastier it's hard to say why I am today 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.370
 decided to make it seem simple but in 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.440
 same time awesome tasty dish 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.719
 maybe just because 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.390
 simple and tasty we are also 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.120
 big guys like me love everyones 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.550
 sandwich isn't it today's general 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.589
 hero pozhevarim club sandwich 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.690
 I do not know why he is a club but I know 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.300
 why sandwich say man such 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.280
 there was a graph of some sort with the last name sandwich yes 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.500
 it does n't matter what 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.150
 here the club sandwich is different from what 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.190
 another way ford 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.070
 or a burger well, perhaps the fact that 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.960
 the classics use three layers of bread and two 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.290
 layer filling and unchanged attribute 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.150
 This sandwich is crisp bread 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.800
 for some reason it seems to me that it is quite possible 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.320
 get rid of one tradition 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.300
 use only two pieces of bread on 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.400
 spit on tradition Okay first things 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.080
 let's order the ingredients first 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.780
 first we need a good one 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.970
 thick bread i will take 8 pieces so 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.800
 how are we going to prepare 4 sandwiches we 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.630
 we will use some meat 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.360
 component of me it will be a chicken leg 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.280
 well or beef can be both in 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.320
 principle put we need for juiciness 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.570
 good tomato certainly not very good 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.850
 necessarily but desirable to use 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.620
 Bacon Bacon around the head 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.200
 need some crispy salad y 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.710
 me this iceberg lettuce choose any in 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.020
 principle 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.390
 better not to take these know curly varieties 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.660
 salad and they are crunching we still need 3-4 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.660
 eggs mayonnaise and mustard syrochek 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.790
 let's first prepare after in 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.100
 principle, this can be done in a toaster 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.260
 but if it is not there it is quite possible 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.420
 dry in a dry skillet without 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.550
 any oil is desirable but 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.860
 do not have to dry bread only with 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.239
 one side with the second leave his ball 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.239
 although you can fry two 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.870
 generally very cool if you have 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.090
 griddle grill then you get not 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.850
 only Russian but also beautiful such 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.410
 with chopsticks Let us add bacon 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.870
 bacon in almost any dish 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.330
 It adds to our hundred percent karma 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.250
 undoubtedly improves the dish it is necessary too 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.890
 until crispy fry on 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.750
 the pan so that excess fat is removed from 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.180
 add bacon to the pan 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.360
 necessary because fat in bacon is enough 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.360
 my 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.159
 it is desirable to get wet 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.409
 paper towels to excess fat 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:30.180
 imbibed so we will create at least an illusion 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.180
 that we care about our health 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.709
 now about the meat in the classic 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.420
 sandwich club recipe use turkey 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.700
 or chicken breast then I recommend to you 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.329
 just go to the store and buy like you 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.769
 delicious hot what a cool beef 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.110
 use it even if it is not on 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.940
 canons but it is no worse at all 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.340
 by the way if since yesterday you have 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.900
 left any meat can it 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.120
 use in this sandwich 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.799
 We put a waste-free production 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.109
 boiled eggs eggs must be fully 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.989
 cook until cool condition after 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.120
 boiling eggs are boiled for 9 minutes then not 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.680
 ready to leave them cool desirable 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.930
 put in cold water then they 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.510
 it will be easier to clean now the sauce in 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.459
 the classics use ordinary mayo but I 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.829
 I think it knocks on any burger 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.770
 sandwiches mayonnaise better 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.470
 mustard th ' proportion of about 1 to 3 1 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.400
 a piece of mustard and three pieces of mayonnaise then 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.400
 it will be delicious 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:48.980
 iceberg lettuce should be washed and divided into 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:51.020
 a piece of paper is desirable from excess moisture 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.910
 get rid of blotting it with paper 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.310
 towels to not put our 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:00.130
 sandwich now cooled eggs cut into 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.130
 circles and tomatoes too on circles 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.509
 every piece of toasted bread 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:15.220
 grease our sauce on one side 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:17.229
 only now we are going to make a sandwich 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.509
 in a big way in no particular order 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:43.590
 can keep and my order bread 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:43.590
 bacon tomato salov meat egg cheese and bread 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.830
 classic club sandwich dock 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.680
 skewers in four places and share on 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.870
 4 triangles but this is not our format 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.750
 no shpes only one diagonal 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:04.930
 cut and here it is cool is considered well 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:07.270
 I consider that something like this 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.219
 turned out great club sandwiches 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.110
 sandwich and this is anyway delicious well 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:13.210
 let me try for a proforma 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.780
 now i will take more comfortable let's 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:19.570
 I'll tell you an hour 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.930
 quite useful and but it's really cool 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:25.030
 yummy and of course bacon bacon in 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.550
 Generally something like this if you liked it 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.009
 huskies are not forbidden even in some 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.960
