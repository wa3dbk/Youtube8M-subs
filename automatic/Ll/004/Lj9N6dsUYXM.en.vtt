when you know having just ridden for

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.390 
when you know having just ridden for
instance<00:01:26.689> resit<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:26.990> hornet<00:01:27.590> 900<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:28.280> know

instance resit the hornet 900 you know
that<00:01:28.610> comes<00:01:28.850> in<00:01:28.970> a<00:01:29.000> little<00:01:29.030> bit<00:01:29.210> more<00:01:29.420> and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
that comes in a little bit more and

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.890 
that comes in a little bit more and
again<00:01:30.710> though<00:01:31.150> this<00:01:32.150> is<00:01:32.330> what<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:32.540> need<00:01:32.689> isn't

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
again though this is what you need isn't

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.120 
again though this is what you need isn't
it<00:01:33.049> really<00:01:33.290> if<00:01:33.439> you're<00:01:33.590> especially<00:01:33.830> if<00:01:34.040> you're

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
it really if you're especially if you're

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.929 
it really if you're especially if you're
commuting<00:01:34.310> around<00:01:34.549> town<00:01:34.729> there<00:01:34.909> are

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
commuting around town there are

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.670 
commuting around town there are
obviously<00:01:35.330> you<00:01:35.659> can<00:01:35.810> get<00:01:35.930> bigger<00:01:36.200> luxuries

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
obviously you can get bigger luxuries

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:51.230 
obviously you can get bigger luxuries
bigger<00:01:36.950> bikes<00:01:42.250> yet

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.580 

yeah<00:01:52.240> yeah<00:01:52.479> yeah<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:52.720> think<00:01:52.870> this<00:01:53.050> is<00:01:53.110> this<00:01:53.380> one

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
yeah yeah yeah I think this is this one

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.990 
yeah yeah yeah I think this is this one
with<00:01:53.740> ABS<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:54.220> can't<00:01:54.400> remember<00:01:54.580> if<00:01:54.760> it<00:01:54.850> was

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
with ABS I can't remember if it was

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.850 
with ABS I can't remember if it was
enough<00:01:55.300> I<00:01:55.600> think<00:01:55.990> yeah<00:01:56.170> I<00:01:56.200> think<00:01:56.320> it<00:01:56.620> is<00:01:56.650> I

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
enough I think yeah I think it is I

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.780 
enough I think yeah I think it is I
think<00:01:56.950> that's<00:01:57.100> what<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.340> brakes<00:01:57.520> are<00:01:57.670> so

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
think that's what the brakes are so

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.399 
think that's what the brakes are so
gonna<00:01:57.970> be<00:01:58.450> obviously<00:01:58.780> as<00:01:58.930> you<00:01:59.020> say<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.229> comes

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
gonna be obviously as you say it comes

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.680 
gonna be obviously as you say it comes
with<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.920> 650<00:02:00.460> as<00:02:01.090> well<00:02:01.360> that<00:02:01.540> you<00:02:01.630> can

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
with it the 650 as well that you can

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.630 
with it the 650 as well that you can
have<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.900> GS<00:02:02.110> X<00:02:02.290> F<00:02:02.500> which<00:02:02.830> has<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.130> fairing<00:02:03.520> on

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
have the GS X F which has the fairing on

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.300 
have the GS X F which has the fairing on
slightly<00:02:04.390> every<00:02:04.960> tuned<00:02:05.229> engine<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:06.220> the

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
slightly every tuned engine and the

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.530 
slightly every tuned engine and the
spent<00:02:06.550> some<00:02:06.670> time<00:02:06.820> on<00:02:06.850> that<00:02:07.030> so<00:02:07.270> if<00:02:07.360> you<00:02:07.450> were

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
spent some time on that so if you were

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.639 
spent some time on that so if you were
looking<00:02:07.630> at<00:02:07.810> maybe<00:02:07.930> doing<00:02:08.110> slightly<00:02:08.380> more

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
looking at maybe doing slightly more

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.410 
looking at maybe doing slightly more

this long-distance journeys motorway
stuff<00:02:10.600> that<00:02:11.050> might<00:02:11.200> be<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.380> one<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.620> go<00:02:11.740> for<00:02:37.019> it

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
stuff that might be the one to go for it

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.840 
stuff that might be the one to go for it
obviously<00:02:38.170> looks<00:02:38.440> very<00:02:39.040> different<00:02:39.370> as<00:02:39.489> well<00:02:39.670> I

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
not talking beast but that's so it's too

not talking beast but that's so it's too
designed<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.380> be<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.980> as<00:03:06.130> you<00:03:06.220> say<00:03:06.370> it's<00:03:06.519> a

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
designed to be and as you say it's a

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.520 
designed to be and as you say it's a
great<00:03:06.790> almost<00:03:07.000> stepping<00:03:07.299> stone<00:03:07.690> insert<00:03:08.320> then

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
great almost stepping stone insert then

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.780 
great almost stepping stone insert then
maybe<00:03:08.799> from<00:03:09.040> this<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.400> could<00:03:09.549> get<00:03:09.700> yourself

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
maybe from this you could get yourself

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.750 
maybe from this you could get yourself
on<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.480> know<00:03:10.600> chips<00:03:11.260> of<00:03:11.380> 600<00:03:11.860> maybe<00:03:12.010> or<00:03:12.400> as<00:03:12.670> you

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
on you know chips of 600 maybe or as you

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:21.150 
on you know chips of 600 maybe or as you
say<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.000> GSX<00:03:13.620> 650f<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:20.049> is<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.230> machine<00:03:20.829> isn't

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
say the GSX 650f that is a machine isn't

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.500 
say the GSX 650f that is a machine isn't
it<00:03:21.250> yeah<00:03:21.489> in<00:03:21.730> fact<00:03:21.850> that<00:03:22.030> would<00:03:22.150> be<00:03:22.299> a<00:03:22.329> nice

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
it yeah in fact that would be a nice

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.670 
it yeah in fact that would be a nice
step<00:03:22.780> up<00:03:22.959> from<00:03:23.110> this<00:03:23.260> because<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.530> get<00:03:23.650> on

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
step up from this because you get on

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.110 
step up from this because you get on
this<00:03:23.980> have<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.220> lot<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.370> fun<00:03:24.579> with<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.760> then<00:03:24.910> step

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
this have a lot of fun with it then step

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.360 
this have a lot of fun with it then step
on<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.299> and<00:03:25.450> it<00:03:25.510> would<00:03:25.630> seem<00:03:25.840> like<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:26.049> huge

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
on that and it would seem like a huge

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.890 
on that and it would seem like a huge
power<00:03:27.370> difference<00:03:27.820> but<00:03:28.209> it<00:03:28.630> would<00:03:28.780> be

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
power difference but it would be

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.550 
power difference but it would be
manageable

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.110
