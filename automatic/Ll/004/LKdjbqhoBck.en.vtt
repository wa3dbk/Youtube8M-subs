00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.639

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.860
 it unusually did not sound underground 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.470
 traffickers milk trafficking illegal 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.330
 business amounted to 4 billion rubles from 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.000
 Belarusian agricultural enterprises they 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.849
 worked on barter changed auto parts 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.160
 on milk according to controllers like 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.779
 dairy buyers today and illegally and 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.790
 legally working across the country 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.770
 Russian businessmen for a ton 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.079

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.629

 diesel timely payment immediately on 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.570
 there without any bureaucratic 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.879
 procrastination 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.800
 our factories are the same way work 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.379
 they buy milk from and from the state farms 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.300
 transported with our factories to work 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.610
 heavy because brought his milk 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.840
 and two months wait for it to pay with them 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.879
 much easier and easier to work 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.559
 really in the next Bryansk 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.449
 Russian area has several 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.129
 private cheese factories which are in their 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.140
 production is actively used 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.670
 Belarusian raw materials and I must say that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.560
 such a scheme when the Russian 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.659
 the manufacturer does not need to invest in 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.060
 Land or farm in Belarusian search 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.549
 markets seem to be comfortable with both 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.350
 parties according to state control in the past 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.720
 year the three largest dairy 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.210
 Gomel region actively resold 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.640
 raw milk to russia although power 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.930
 allowed to recycle it in their course 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.880
 checking shareholders open 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.729
 stock company dairy products 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.250
 it was established that during 2012 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.369
 years and also January february current 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.430
 year enterprises on an ongoing basis 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.590
 reflected dairy products 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.100
 that is, pour the milk tank 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.049
 Russian companies only for specified 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.049
 period as i said 12 january february 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.229
 this year more than 30 were shipped 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.420
 thousand tons of milk we pour in a cistern that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.130
 makes up 13 percent of the total 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.649
 milk obtained from agricultural organizations 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.210
 Do not sell raw materials and ready-made 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.579
 production is a priority 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.009
 conditions of Belarusian exports in essence 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.750
 government policy that creates 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.810
 jobs and brings billions 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.700
 dollars to the budget white gold exactly 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.069
 so by analogy with oil is called 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.489
 today milk see today demand 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.519
 what prices for dairy products 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.470
 good cantabile work i only 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.550
 I would like to say that in four 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.480
 months we sold products 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.860
 agricultural production on more than 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.960
 200 billion 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.380
 million dollars here during this time 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.870
 about 990 baryon positive 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.210
 balance of export earnings figures given 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.040
 lost profit and talk in the milkman scheme 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.670
 apparently it is that they can be 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.710
 more 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.170
 of course it can not be understood in the 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.610
 enterprises are not ready to correct mistakes 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.680
 if the facts that we had 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.940
 confirmed to enter that service 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.890
 checks which today 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.260
 God appointed to the enterprise then they will 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.870
 relevant principles adopted 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.730
 measures and perpetrators will be punished 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.500
 test results are not forced 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.080
 wait by order of the regional authorities 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.810
 all milk processing enterprises 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.430
 the region stopped to let the milk 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.660
 tanks required power for 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.790
 recycling found 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.410
 for each drop stanislav protein 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.950
 Vladimir Putin is the nerve of our news 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.950
 Gomel region
