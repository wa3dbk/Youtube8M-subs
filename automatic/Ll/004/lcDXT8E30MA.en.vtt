00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.860

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.900
 you carry the phantom 2 without any 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.429
 previous experience or in radio control 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.829
 neither in helicopters or anything 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:37.719
 because he agreed that you can feel us 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.229

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:43.269

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.370
 impressions the learning process 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:50.440
 which I had to go through arrived while 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.510
 I give you advice on how to solve 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.120
 problems that I have already had 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.430
 I concentrate to face 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.320
 I'm encouraging to bring this channel because 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.969
 as you will discover most of 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.879
 of reliable information about our 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.159
 bugs comes from the internet and is in 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.350
 English and a lot of people have real 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.000
 problems with the language and despair 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.430
 If you do not find the solution to 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.200
 problems that come up I know that 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.780
 many of you turn to forums or 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.430
 Spanish websites where you can help and 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.310
 despite having gone through there 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.960
 time trying to help people already 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.850
 I see myself repeating certain things 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.100
 periodically and I consider that this 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.039
 it can be a better way to get to 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.780
 others the format of this video already what 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.539
 you are already saying it will be quite 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.580
 simple and do not expect many 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.590
 elaborate editions nor many 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.050
 virguerÃ­as I intend to make the video 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.539
 relatively short that allow me 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.490
 create a lot of content explaining well the 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.590
 as many things as possible but without 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.650
 neither invest too much time in 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.320
 it 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.210
