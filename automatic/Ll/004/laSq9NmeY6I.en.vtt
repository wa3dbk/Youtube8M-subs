00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.640
 same texture of a macbook was that the 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.120
 which thickens a little is the two 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.480
 screens too but of course this 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.310
 compensates 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.470
 Okay, so I said a little about it. 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.120

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.970
 In fact it is the best product box is not 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.060

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.280

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.680

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.830
 Asus also made this promotion and 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.600
 then sent the product through the air or use it 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.730
 know a little bit and then I can 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.560
 that a video a hands-on talking more 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.390
 on the cash withdrawal plan is 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.280
 knowing everything sometimes we talk 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.600
 another bullshit, for example, the pen is 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.460
 I do not know what exactly it is for 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.060
 still or in the look for us to be able 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.100
 speak 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.780
 Knowing what you're talking about is always good. 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:50.120

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.120
