hey<00:02:55.360> hey<00:02:55.720> guys<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.410> I've<00:02:56.740> always<00:02:56.920> wanted<00:02:57.160> to

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
hey hey guys so I've always wanted to

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.130 
hey hey guys so I've always wanted to
have<00:02:57.490> a<00:02:57.550> spiral<00:02:58.060> staircase<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.630> opens<00:02:59.020> and

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
have a spiral staircase that opens and

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.320 
have a spiral staircase that opens and
closes<00:02:59.350> on<00:02:59.590> whims<00:02:59.860> notice<00:03:00.250> but<00:03:00.880> I<00:03:01.090> haven't

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
closes on whims notice but I haven't

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.790 
closes on whims notice but I haven't
been<00:03:01.450> able<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.780> find<00:03:01.930> one<00:03:02.170> on<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.410> interwebs

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
been able to find one on the interwebs

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.520 
been able to find one on the interwebs
so<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.730> just<00:03:04.060> decided<00:03:04.210> to<00:03:04.570> make<00:03:04.720> one<00:03:04.870> myself<00:03:05.020> um

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
so I just decided to make one myself um

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.370 
so I just decided to make one myself um
it's<00:03:06.400> basically<00:03:06.940> just<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.420> T<00:03:07.930> flip-flop

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
it's basically just in T flip-flop

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.070 
it's basically just in T flip-flop
hooked<00:03:08.650> up<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.370> whole<00:03:10.330> bunch<00:03:10.360> of<00:03:10.690> correctly

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
hooked up to a whole bunch of correctly

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.440 
hooked up to a whole bunch of correctly
time<00:03:11.350> pistons<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.040> one<00:03:12.580> tick<00:03:12.730> generators<00:03:13.210> and

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
time pistons and one tick generators and

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.070 
time pistons and one tick generators and
of<00:03:14.410> course<00:03:14.770> a<00:03:15.700> double<00:03:16.330> piston<00:03:16.480> expander

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
of course a double piston expander

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.380 
of course a double piston expander
extender<00:03:17.860> I<00:03:18.040> designed<00:03:19.000> this<00:03:19.090> one<00:03:19.240> myself

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
extender I designed this one myself

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.230 
extender I designed this one myself
because<00:03:19.750> they<00:03:19.780> need<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:20.050> output<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.860> be<00:03:21.240> one

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
because they need the output to be one

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.390 
because they need the output to be one
wide<00:03:22.420> nice<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.050> compact<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.650> couldn't<00:03:24.280> find

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
wide nice and compact and couldn't find

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.010 
wide nice and compact and couldn't find
that<00:03:24.610> anyway<00:03:25.050> surprisingly<00:03:26.050> enough<00:03:26.290> um<00:03:28.020> but

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
that anyway surprisingly enough um but

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.420 
that anyway surprisingly enough um but
so<00:03:29.170> yeah<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.440> could<00:03:29.680> hook<00:03:29.770> it<00:03:29.830> up<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.070> an<00:03:30.280> iron

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
so yeah you could hook it up to an iron

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.600 
so yeah you could hook it up to an iron
RS<00:03:31.030> nor<00:03:31.240> latch<00:03:31.300> array<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.160> have<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.310> type<00:03:33.460> in

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
RS nor latch array and have to type in

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.010 
RS nor latch array and have to type in
the<00:03:33.670> code<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:34.030> get<00:03:34.120> into<00:03:34.330> it<00:03:34.450> like<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:34.840> saw<00:03:34.990> a

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
the code to get into it like you saw a

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.660 
the code to get into it like you saw a
little<00:03:35.320> clip<00:03:35.470> beforehand<00:03:36.100> um<00:03:38.400> yes<00:03:39.400> we'll

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
little clip beforehand um yes we'll

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.150 
little clip beforehand um yes we'll
watch<00:03:39.850> how<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.210> works<00:03:40.420> from<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.930> inside<00:03:41.160> ish

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
watch how it works from the inside ish

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.120 
watch how it works from the inside ish
she<00:03:44.190> closes<00:03:46.470> there's<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.530> little<00:03:47.710> lag<00:03:47.890> there

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
she closes there's a little lag there

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:58.920 
she closes there's a little lag there
but<00:03:48.340> you<00:03:48.520> get<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.670> gist<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.350> she<00:03:50.350> opens<00:03:57.930> when

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
but you get the gist and she opens when

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.420 
but you get the gist and she opens when
we<00:03:59.170> do<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.530> one<00:03:59.740> cuz<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.070> lagged<00:04:00.340> a<00:04:00.490> little

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
we do that one cuz it lagged a little

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.730 
we do that one cuz it lagged a little
closes<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:05.250> opens

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.710 

this<00:04:10.460> guy<00:04:10.640> takes<00:04:10.820> a<00:04:10.970> little<00:04:11.090> longer<00:04:11.330> because

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
this guy takes a little longer because

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.260 
this guy takes a little longer because
uh<00:04:12.160> just<00:04:13.160> how<00:04:13.250> things<00:04:13.490> worked<00:04:13.700> out<00:04:13.820> or<00:04:14.030> else<00:04:14.150> I

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
uh just how things worked out or else I

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.250 
uh just how things worked out or else I
would<00:04:14.390> have<00:04:14.420> had<00:04:14.570> to<00:04:14.660> make<00:04:14.810> a<00:04:14.840> whole<00:04:15.110> nother

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
would have had to make a whole nother

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.910 
would have had to make a whole nother
line<00:04:15.560> around<00:04:15.860> it<00:04:16.120> uh<00:04:17.120> wouldn't<00:04:18.110> worked<00:04:18.739> out

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
line around it uh wouldn't worked out

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.670 
line around it uh wouldn't worked out
too<00:04:19.100> well<00:04:19.280> um<00:04:19.870> but<00:04:20.870> yeah<00:04:21.050> so<00:04:21.290> if<00:04:21.410> enough

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
too well um but yeah so if enough

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.220 
too well um but yeah so if enough

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
interest in show is showed in this thing

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.910 
interest in show is showed in this thing
I'll<00:04:24.850> make<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:25.880> tutorial<00:04:26.270> for<00:04:26.480> it<00:04:26.750> or<00:04:26.920> possibly

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
I'll make a tutorial for it or possibly

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.520 
I'll make a tutorial for it or possibly
upload<00:04:28.580> my<00:04:28.790> world<00:04:29.060> for<00:04:29.300> download<00:04:29.660> so<00:04:30.410> you<00:04:30.440> can

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
upload my world for download so you can

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.900 
upload my world for download so you can
see<00:04:30.920> for<00:04:31.130> yourself<00:04:31.160> um<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:33.500> I'm<00:04:34.400> also<00:04:34.640> working

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
see for yourself um and I'm also working

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.110 
see for yourself um and I'm also working
on<00:04:35.150> a<00:04:35.210> version<00:04:35.600> 2<00:04:35.900> right<00:04:36.530> now<00:04:36.650> which<00:04:36.890> it<00:04:37.120> will

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
on a version 2 right now which it will

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.660 
on a version 2 right now which it will
be<00:04:38.180> more<00:04:38.690> compact<00:04:39.080> and<00:04:39.380> hopefully<00:04:40.220> slightly

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
be more compact and hopefully slightly

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.150 
be more compact and hopefully slightly
faster<00:04:41.200> but<00:04:42.200> that's<00:04:42.470> all<00:04:42.650> I<00:04:42.680> got<00:04:42.860> for<00:04:43.040> you<00:04:43.100> guys

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
faster but that's all I got for you guys
