00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.359 
kind of like a sunburst effect once
that's<00:02:05.149> all<00:02:05.390> done<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.930> lock<00:02:06.290> down<00:02:06.590> my<00:02:06.829> lacing<00:02:07.250> in

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
that's all done I lock down my lacing in

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.359 
that's all done I lock down my lacing in
the<00:02:07.520> center<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.119> then<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:08.929> start<00:02:09.319> my<00:02:09.469> pulls<00:02:09.950> I

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.789 
the center and then I start my pulls I
what<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:10.819> mean<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.299> I'm<00:02:11.510> not<00:02:11.870> right<00:02:12.319> here<00:02:12.590> in<00:02:12.709> the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
middle

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.510 
middle
and<00:02:14.270> then<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.510> start<00:02:14.840> my<00:02:15.020> pulls<00:02:15.470> one<00:02:16.100> single

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
and then I start my pulls one single

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.370 
and then I start my pulls one single
knot<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:17.060> wrapped<00:02:17.330> around<00:02:17.540> all<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.230> these

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
knot is wrapped around all of these

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.680 
knot is wrapped around all of these
lacings<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.190> kind<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.550> binds<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.240> center

lacings and kind of binds the center

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.320 
lacings and kind of binds the center
together<00:02:21.050> then<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:21.980> start<00:02:22.280> pulling<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.060> would

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
together then I start pulling so I would

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.950 
together then I start pulling so I would
pull<00:02:23.630> here<00:02:24.260> run<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.190> through<00:02:25.600> find<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.720> thread

lacing on this side pull here and I just

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.100 
lacing on this side pull here and I just
work<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.070> same<00:02:34.370> Sun<00:02:34.730> pattern<00:02:35.270> three

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
work that same Sun pattern three

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.560 
work that same Sun pattern three
consecutive<00:02:36.620> times<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.850> first<00:02:38.150> one<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.540> just

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
consecutive times the first one is just

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.350 
consecutive times the first one is just
to<00:02:38.990> lay<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.350> lacings<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.490> second<00:02:40.940> one<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:41.330> to

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
to lay the lacings the second one is to

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.870 
to lay the lacings the second one is to
straighten<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.440> lacings<00:02:42.890> out<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.370> pull<00:02:43.670> out

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
straighten the lacings out and pull out

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.840 
straighten the lacings out and pull out
most<00:02:44.210> of<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.540> slack<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:45.470> can<00:02:45.680> see<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.640> most

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
most of the slack you can see that most

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.030 
most of the slack you can see that most
of<00:02:47.000> my<00:02:47.030> lay<00:02:47.240> things<00:02:47.480> are<00:02:47.630> very<00:02:47.900> very<00:02:48.230> flat<00:02:48.740> I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
of my lay things are very very flat I

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.920 
of my lay things are very very flat I
don't<00:02:49.250> like<00:02:49.400> I'm<00:02:49.550> twisted

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
don't like I'm twisted

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.350 
don't like I'm twisted
I<00:02:50.960> think<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.620> drum<00:02:51.950> looks<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.550> lot<00:02:52.850> neater<00:02:53.210> and

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
I think the drum looks a lot neater and

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.600 
I think the drum looks a lot neater and
a<00:02:53.660> lot<00:02:53.840> more<00:02:53.870> presentable<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.070> also<00:02:55.220> think

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
a lot more presentable and I also think

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.210 
a lot more presentable and I also think
it<00:02:55.820> dries<00:02:56.210> better<00:02:56.600> if<00:02:57.050> all<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.590> lacings<00:02:58.040> are

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
it dries better if all the lacings are

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.060 
it dries better if all the lacings are
flat<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.910> laid<00:02:59.290> right<00:03:00.290> up<00:03:00.410> against<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:00.890> wood

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
flat and laid right up against the wood

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.600 
flat and laid right up against the wood
this<00:03:01.880> one<00:03:02.090> actually<00:03:02.600> right<00:03:02.780> here<00:03:02.810> needs<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.470> be

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
this one actually right here needs to be

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.770 
this one actually right here needs to be
pulled<00:03:04.610> in<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.880> little<00:03:05.150> bit<00:03:05.300> that's<00:03:05.540> another

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
pulled in a little bit that's another

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.630 
pulled in a little bit that's another
thing<00:03:06.050> that<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.380> can<00:03:06.560> kind<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.220> at<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.460> last

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
thing that you can kind of at the last

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.580 
thing that you can kind of at the last
second<00:03:08.210> you<00:03:08.240> can<00:03:08.480> adjust<00:03:08.930> these<00:03:09.140> just<00:03:09.500> a

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
second you can adjust these just a

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.350 
second you can adjust these just a
little<00:03:09.830> bit<00:03:09.950> go<00:03:10.160> around<00:03:10.460> each<00:03:10.670> one<00:03:10.700> and

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
little bit go around each one and

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.990 
little bit go around each one and
straighten<00:03:11.780> them<00:03:11.870> out<00:03:11.990> I<00:03:12.950> like<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.490> use<00:03:13.640> two

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
straighten them out I like to use two

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.020 
straighten them out I like to use two
holes<00:03:14.270> on<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:15.440> sides<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.860> my<00:03:15.920> drum<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.640> on<00:03:16.850> the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
holes on the sides of my drum and on the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.510 
holes on the sides of my drum and on the
head<00:03:17.240> I<00:03:17.510> think<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:17.960> looks<00:03:18.350> nicer<00:03:18.950> some<00:03:19.250> people

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
head I think it looks nicer some people

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.210 
head I think it looks nicer some people
do<00:03:19.670> one<00:03:19.970> I<00:03:20.270> actually<00:03:21.140> saw<00:03:21.500> one<00:03:21.530> guy<00:03:21.860> that<00:03:22.040> did

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
do one I actually saw one guy that did

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.970 
do one I actually saw one guy that did
three<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:22.880> was<00:03:23.000> kind<00:03:23.270> of<00:03:23.360> neat<00:03:23.660> he<00:03:23.900> he<00:03:24.680> almost

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
three it was kind of neat he he almost

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.010 
three it was kind of neat he he almost
did<00:03:25.160> like<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.340> little<00:03:25.490> knotting<00:03:26.030> system<00:03:26.510> but<00:03:26.810> I

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
did like a little knotting system but I

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.380 
did like a little knotting system but I
just<00:03:27.350> think<00:03:27.500> two<00:03:27.740> is<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.190> simple<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.820> easy<00:03:29.060> and

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
just think two is is simple and easy and

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.050 
just think two is is simple and easy and
it<00:03:29.480> looks<00:03:29.510> real<00:03:29.900> nice<00:03:30.250> okay<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:31.580> you've<00:03:31.850> done

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.510 
it looks real nice okay so you've done
the<00:03:32.240> second<00:03:32.690> one<00:03:32.840> go<00:03:33.140> back<00:03:33.350> in<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.830> do<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.010> third

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
the second one go back in and do a third

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.990 
the second one go back in and do a third
pull<00:03:35.200> then<00:03:36.200> you<00:03:36.500> do<00:03:36.710> your<00:03:37.130> tie<00:03:37.400> off<00:03:37.640> in<00:03:37.880> the

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
pull then you do your tie off in the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.880 
pull then you do your tie off in the
middle<00:03:38.300> and<00:03:38.510> do<00:03:38.840> your<00:03:39.020> wrap<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.320> like<00:03:39.710> I<00:03:39.740> said

the<00:04:06.200> biggest<00:04:06.530> thing<00:04:06.710> that<00:04:06.740> I<00:04:06.920> wanted<00:04:07.220> you<00:04:07.280> to

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
the biggest thing that I wanted you to

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.510 
the biggest thing that I wanted you to
see<00:04:07.760> is<00:04:08.060> that<00:04:08.120> these<00:04:09.110> are<00:04:09.170> not<00:04:09.710> extremely

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
see is that these are not extremely

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.870

tight<00:04:10.910> if<00:04:11.300> you<00:04:12.020> get<00:04:12.290> them<00:04:12.500> too<00:04:12.890> tight<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:13.520> think

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
tight if you get them too tight I think

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.360 
tight if you get them too tight I think
your<00:04:14.120> drum<00:04:14.600> has<00:04:15.020> a<00:04:15.050> tendency<00:04:15.590> of<00:04:15.620> going<00:04:15.860> way<00:04:16.340> up

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
in pitch and it's also taking the chance

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.630 
in pitch and it's also taking the chance
of<00:04:20.120> ripping<00:04:20.480> out<00:04:20.870> your<00:04:21.080> threads<00:04:21.590> here<00:04:22.250> ripping
