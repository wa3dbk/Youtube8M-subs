00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
you can learn just that for weight

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.870 
you can learn just that for weight
training<00:01:10.010> yeah<00:01:11.010> you're<00:01:11.549> more<00:01:11.700> than<00:01:11.820> halfway

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
training yeah you're more than halfway

up properly to get on the bench press
their<00:01:26.979> light<00:01:27.130> now<00:01:27.310> they<00:01:28.299> pick<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.539> weight<00:01:28.689> up

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
bench press they lift the legs up stuff

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.990 
bench press they lift the legs up stuff
like<00:01:45.740> that<00:01:45.860> well<00:01:46.370> you're<00:01:46.730> going<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:46.910> be

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
like that well you're going to be

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.430 
like that well you're going to be
unstable<00:01:47.390> if<00:01:47.690> you're<00:01:47.780> going<00:01:47.870> to<00:01:47.930> be<00:01:48.020> unstable

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
unstable if you're going to be unstable

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.780 
unstable if you're going to be unstable
you're<00:01:49.130> not<00:01:49.190> going<00:01:49.400> to<00:01:49.460> be<00:01:49.520> able<00:01:49.550> to<00:01:49.700> generate

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
you're not going to be able to generate

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.710 
you're not going to be able to generate
the<00:01:50.090> right<00:01:50.210> amount<00:01:50.450> of<00:01:50.510> power<00:01:50.660> so<00:01:52.450> also<00:01:53.450> it

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
the right amount of power so also it

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.660 
the right amount of power so also it
comes<00:01:53.870> from<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.080> legs<00:01:54.370> so<00:01:55.370> if<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:55.490> want<00:01:55.610> a

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
comes from the legs so if you want a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.390 
comes from the legs so if you want a
really<00:01:55.760> improve<00:01:56.060> your<00:01:56.150> bench<00:01:56.300> press<00:01:56.570> we<00:01:57.020> do

you check the correct grip on the bar

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.180 
you check the correct grip on the bar
will<00:02:08.630> get<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.960> grip<00:02:09.110> in<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.289> second<00:02:09.649> and

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
will get to the grip in a second and

and you tuck your feet down and then you

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.340 
and you tuck your feet down and then you
squeeze<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.580> glutes<00:02:19.810> now<00:02:20.810> what<00:02:20.960> that<00:02:20.990> does

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
squeeze the glutes now what that does

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.260 
squeeze the glutes now what that does
that's<00:02:21.950> created<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.400> lot<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.640> tension<00:02:23.060> in<00:02:23.150> my

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
that's created a lot of tension in my

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.240 
that's created a lot of tension in my
legs<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.110> can<00:02:24.320> then<00:02:24.440> use<00:02:24.680> my<00:02:24.860> legs<00:02:25.070> the

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
legs and I can then use my legs the

back well then raise up my stir them so

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.000 
back well then raise up my stir them so
that<00:02:41.630> I've<00:02:41.810> got<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.959> higher<00:02:42.230> point<00:02:42.440> depressed

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
that I've got a higher point depressed

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.300 
that I've got a higher point depressed
to<00:02:43.340> press<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.700> bar<00:02:43.910> with<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.900> final<00:02:45.380> point<00:02:45.650> in

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
to press the bar with the final point in

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.550 
to press the bar with the final point in
terms<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.820> posture<00:02:47.239> is<00:02:47.690> as<00:02:47.959> you<00:02:48.080> lower<00:02:48.350> the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
terms of the posture is as you lower the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.070 
terms of the posture is as you lower the
bar<00:02:48.770> you<00:02:49.430> retract<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.420> shoulder<00:02:50.720> blades<00:02:50.930> so

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
bar you retract the shoulder blades so

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.199 
bar you retract the shoulder blades so
you<00:02:51.200> squeeze<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:52.040> back<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.700> squeeze<00:02:53.060> the

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
you squeeze the back you squeeze the

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.270 
you squeeze the back you squeeze the
shoulder<00:02:53.510> blades<00:02:53.540> back<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.110> down<00:02:54.350> as<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:55.010> go

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
shoulder blades back and down as you go

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.790 
shoulder blades back and down as you go
down<00:02:55.459> if<00:02:55.850> you<00:02:56.060> round<00:02:56.360> you've<00:02:57.110> got<00:02:57.350> no<00:02:57.500> power

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
down if you round you've got no power

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.100 
down if you round you've got no power
the<00:02:58.790> best<00:02:59.000> analogy<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.660> can<00:02:59.840> give<00:02:59.989> you

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
the best analogy that I can give you

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.490 
the best analogy that I can give you
here<00:03:00.350> is<00:03:01.660> when<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:02.750> try<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:02.930> punch<00:03:03.170> somebody

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
here is when you try to punch somebody

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.020 
here is when you try to punch somebody
if<00:03:03.770> you<00:03:03.830> try<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.040> put<00:03:04.280> something<00:03:04.550> like<00:03:04.700> this

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
if you try to put something like this

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.850 
if you try to put something like this
you've<00:03:05.390> got<00:03:05.540> no<00:03:05.660> power<00:03:05.900> but<00:03:06.200> if<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:06.709> put

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
you've got no power but if you put

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.050 
you've got no power but if you put
something<00:03:07.130> like<00:03:07.160> this<00:03:07.400> this<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:07.880> where<00:03:08.030> all

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
something like this this is where all

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.610 
something like this this is where all
the<00:03:08.150> power<00:03:08.390> comes<00:03:08.690> from<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.320> you<00:03:09.350> want<00:03:09.530> to

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
the power comes from so you want to

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.030 
the power comes from so you want to
mimic<00:03:09.860> this<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:12.200> basically<00:03:12.590> want<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:12.920> have

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
mimic this you basically want to have

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.710 
mimic this you basically want to have
your<00:03:13.190> your<00:03:13.400> upper<00:03:13.730> arm<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.030> humerus<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.600> a

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
your your upper arm the humerus in a

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.020 
your your upper arm the humerus in a
stable<00:03:14.989> position<00:03:15.260> as<00:03:15.560> possible<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:16.310> is

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
stable position as possible and that is

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.160 
stable position as possible and that is
created<00:03:17.570> by<00:03:17.959> squeezing<00:03:18.290> back<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.739> down<00:03:18.890> here
