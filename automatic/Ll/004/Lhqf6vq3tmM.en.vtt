00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 The next game is Transformers game. 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Two players will start a scene 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 I'm going to hit the bump. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 And then, when I hit the pimple 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 The scene freezes 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 A new player will enter 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 You're going to take one of those frozen ones. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Resets the scene 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Other way 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 And there will laugh more 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 So I'll ask that two players 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 That are... 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Mauro and Evilasio come here for the middle 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Start dancing a crazy dance, very crazy 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 That will be played by our friend Diego 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 When I hit the sinetinha they freeze and the scene will start 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Stopped! 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 What a fucking fish! 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 This is from the Dead Sea 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Come here. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 And he's redhead looks 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Looks like the clown fish 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Stay like this, father! 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 I'll make the goal visible! 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Pha Filha 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 I did not even kick it! 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Are you kidding Daddy, huh? 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 So what the hell? 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Stay there dad 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Go to the filth, the trivela ... 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 You do not even know, right? 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 ET.phonephone ... 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Hi! 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 But if you do not want to have Tim .. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 And then what? 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Have to live 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And then what? 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 The one with the ... 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 In today's class we will learn 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 How the australopithecines made fire 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 They would take something and pass it on the floor. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 With enough force until the blood leaves 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 And served as fuel 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 And they would do a little ... 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 Human bonfire 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 And that gave rise to the squad that lives in the Coke 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 My embroidery doll 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Came broken. Buaaaaaaaa
