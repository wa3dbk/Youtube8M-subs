00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.390
 application called google keygen that we 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.660
 will serve as much as for the system 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.470
 operative android and also for windows 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.020
 the link to download this application 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.030
 will be in the description of the video not 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.489
 being on the official page of this 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.460
 tool we will go to the option that 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.190
 says to bend and as you can see we have the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.520
 option to download the apk file for 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.160
 our android devices as much as 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.980
 the executable file to install it on 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.340
 windows we will click on this occasion in 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.800

 executable file we have something like 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.910
 this I recommend deactivating the 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.460
 antivirus that they have installed in their 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.250
 system because it can give problems to the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.350
 installation time 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.270
 once the antivirus is disabled we will 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.370
 right click and execute as 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.729

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.460
 they come to us from 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.280
 wi-fi antenna that we own 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.080
 and well the next step will be to enter 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.080
 the name of the network in which we want 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.970
 take out the password for example I have 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.330
 guided by the last of these which is of 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.950
 infinite a 79 zx we will write this 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.010
 name in the part they see on the screen 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.780
 as well as the sea direction that 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.780
 appears in the option here 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.590
 and we had entered the address 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.780
 more we will click on calculate and 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.849
 automatically we will see a 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.249
 password calculated on the right side 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.189
 of our screen we will right click 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:03:00.019
 and copy we can do this 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.469
 procedure with each of the networks 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.239
 and so try where it works can you 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.219
 we have more chance that the 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.280
 passwords that appear in supported 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:12.919
 are more likely that the 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.889
 password is correct in this in this 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:18.319
 option that says not supported can that 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:22.040
 work on occasions and in others 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:24.379
 not times so they can do the 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.889
 I try with each and every one of the 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:30.049
 networks that appear on your screen and 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.819
