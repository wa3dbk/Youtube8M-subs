00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 I am showing two exercises today 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.339
 which will allow you to minimize 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.250
 load on the spine for those guys 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.370
 or athletes who suffer pain in 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.450
 back or pro friends or intervertebral 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.429
 hernia even like mine 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.670
 what i do the first exercise allows 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.609
 I develop a common bicep head and 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.109
 lengthen the canvas 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.900
 some suffer short talk about 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.090
 so long clouds are writing for you 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.920
 big and now I'll show you what i do for 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.929
 to make it big 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.369
 increase fiber length first 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.290
 exercise the second exercise will show 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.510
 complete isolation on the biceps head 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.160
 with a minimum load on your back or 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.510
 virtually no back strain 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.510
 so the first exercise went home 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:52.390
 [music] 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.860

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.880
