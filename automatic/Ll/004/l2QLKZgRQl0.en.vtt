might be the street name for this watch

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.900 
might be the street name for this watch
I<00:00:33.390> don't<00:00:33.510> know<00:00:33.600> if<00:00:33.660> it's<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> official<00:00:34.260> name

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
I don't know if it's the official name

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.950 
I don't know if it's the official name
now<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.329> see<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.750> particular

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
hands now for the record the loom is

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.289 
hands now for the record the loom is
very<00:01:40.070> weak<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.520> I<00:01:40.789> don't<00:01:40.820> find<00:01:41.149> it

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
very weak and I don't find it

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.499 
very weak and I don't find it
particularly<00:01:41.659> useful<00:01:42.729> too<00:01:43.729> so<00:01:44.299> if<00:01:44.360> there's

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
particularly useful too so if there's

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.389 
particularly useful too so if there's
any<00:01:44.720> slight<00:01:45.049> downside<00:01:45.679> to<00:01:45.829> this<00:01:45.950> watch<00:01:46.159> I

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
any slight downside to this watch I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:56.069 
any slight downside to this watch I
would<00:01:46.759> say<00:01:46.969> to<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.210> loom<00:01:52.929> flat<00:01:53.929> mineral<00:01:54.439> glass

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
would say to the loom flat mineral glass

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.730 
would say to the loom flat mineral glass
see<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.259> very<00:01:57.470> low<00:01:57.679> profile<00:01:59.229> doesn't<00:02:00.229> stick

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
see the very low profile doesn't stick

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.690 
see the very low profile doesn't stick
up<00:02:03.130> you've<00:02:04.130> got<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.310> screw<00:02:04.700> on<00:02:04.759> case<00:02:05.090> back<00:02:06.640> has<00:02:07.640> a

now<00:02:22.270> how<00:02:22.480> do<00:02:22.540> we<00:02:22.630> operate<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.290> watch<00:02:23.470> now<00:02:23.800> this

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
now how do we operate the watch now this

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.640 
now how do we operate the watch now this
watch<00:02:24.910> does<00:02:25.180> not<00:02:25.330> hand<00:02:25.630> wine<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.140> basically<00:02:26.560> to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
watch does not hand wine so basically to

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.970 
watch does not hand wine so basically to
get<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:26.890> started<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.940> have<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.090> shake<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.980> show

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
get it started you have to shake it show

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.710 
get it started you have to shake it show
a<00:02:30.010> lot<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.400> have<00:02:30.670> cycles<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.300> Japanese

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
a lot of you have cycles and Japanese

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.390 
a lot of you have cycles and Japanese
watches<00:02:32.110> are<00:02:32.230> familiar<00:02:32.590> with<00:02:32.680> that<00:02:32.860> shake<00:02:33.250> it

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
watches are familiar with that shake it

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.080 
watches are familiar with that shake it
10<00:02:33.550> 15<00:02:33.730> seconds<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.630> get<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.020> going<00:02:35.910> if<00:02:36.910> you

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
10 15 seconds to get it going if you

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.610 
10 15 seconds to get it going if you
want<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.630> change<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:39.240> day<00:02:40.240> you<00:02:41.200> push<00:02:41.440> this

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
now let's talk a little bit about the

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.660 
now let's talk a little bit about the

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
bracelet the links are hollow it's very

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.570 
bracelet the links are hollow it's very
light<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.090> sometimes<00:05:06.780> a<00:05:06.870> bracelet<00:05:07.320> is

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
light and sometimes a bracelet is

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.700 
light and sometimes a bracelet is
unflatteringly<00:05:08.960> described<00:05:09.960> as<00:05:10.110> being<00:05:10.350> cheap

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.500 
unflatteringly described as being cheap
I<00:05:13.160> think<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.250> bracelet<00:05:14.610> is<00:05:14.670> very<00:05:14.820> very<00:05:15.030> decent
