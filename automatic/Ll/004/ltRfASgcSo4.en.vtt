00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hello dear friends, I have not been 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.849
 I post the video on my channel and here 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.510
 decided to shoot a video how to make a plane 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.750
 from lego 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:20.640
 but we'll get these we need here 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:22.480
 such a cube and take here such a wing 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.680
 so fasten 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:33.430
 then take here is a cube two on 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:35.590
 four for them on the other end for sure here 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.560
 So 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.550
 further and the same technology we catch 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.550
 window sill 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.430
 and cling wing so 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.210
 we do it like this 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:58.410
 then we take just such a spare part and 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.410
 staple sow in the middle like this 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:09.590
 then we take this 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.770
 and fasten from here in front to lower 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:19.370
 From the front, we take this 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.370
 spare and fasten like this 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.670
 then we need two of these 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.789
 spare parts we put on the second 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.060
 down the middle on each wing 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.060
 like this 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.520
 also which here it is so 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.520
 chain yourself 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:50.390
 then we take these are not creaked 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.610
 I stand on these little yellows of course you can 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.840
 take the plane produced i only 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.439
 decided to make it green 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.439
 So 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.920
 so on we carry that part 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.920
 and so fasten together 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.679
 that is, we are already beginning to emerge 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.939
 painting by plane 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:18.859
 then we take just such a spare part and 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:18.859
 put it here so here 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.330
 Do I need a cube 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.330
 we will stay at the beginning 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:34.400
 and finally that it was here 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.400
 the gap is still stingy like this 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:42.630
 then we take just such a spare part and 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:46.170
 we put it like this is seen once about 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:51.650
 swing gap then take two here 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.650
 such so fasten 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.250
 so where 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.250
 it is but me 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.319
 but the gap behind we close here 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.319
 this 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:14.480
 and so we get such a ball of this 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.320
 shit not everywhere such billet further 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:23.960
 we will need another quad 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.440
 we put it here in the middle and two more 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.270
 wing 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.270
 we put it here 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:37.900
 like this 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.900
 and the second wing like this 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.740
 but then we take 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.260
 so who 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.280
 and we need such a spare part we 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.280
 they are fastened like this 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.659
 and put it here 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.590
 but in short I already have 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.920
 not so love yes not so fastened 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:27.920
 so here we will need two 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.920
 such as 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.310
 so and 2 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:44.320
 that's what we get so on we 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.320
 turn over and catch the rear wheels 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:58.310
 and that's how it turns out 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.310
 and here we have you already become here in the airplane 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.319
 I donâ€™t beat the pillar in the stomach 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.319
 we catch him here 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.200
 it turns out about the killer 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.200
 but 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:21.330
 then we take the headband here 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.330
 The edges put here are greens 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:44.539
 constructor 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.539
 then we take just such a spare 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:06:00.070
 here we get this design 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.510
 collect and of course beautiful further we 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:07.360
 take this one 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:08.790
 that is , you see such a board here 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.660
 is yakova 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:15.110
 like this 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:19.280
 we get this seems 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:21.800
 that our airplane is ready here it is 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.650
 rides spinning forgive go move 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.150
 these too can regulate 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:32.320
 go up 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.320
