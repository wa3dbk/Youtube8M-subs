00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.549
 in the year here, the van is back from 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.490
 fotobuch.de with a new video for 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.980
 preparation today it should be about the topic 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.960
 contrasts are evolving in the area 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.920
 that is how can you contrasts in 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.410
 the image directly influence it 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.090
 generally at least two options 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.600
 namely, this contrasts here 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.180
 regulator in which we really want to be global 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.609
 x raise or lower the contrasts 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.410
 there is a problem for both possible 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.450
 the whole story is old only to her 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.040
 it really happens over everyone 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.410
 Sound means that you can not 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.399
 adorned by additive or the bright ones 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.579
 influence 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.500
 you have not said any possibilities so 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.000
 I would say we do not do it 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.320
 is a better way, namely 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.840
 this gradation curve 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.289
 that means here you have the now 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.000
 possibility specifically determined 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.890
 to increase the sound levels accordingly or 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.879
 lower and then number the contrasts 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.719
 to influence in the picture again 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.129
 moderately if he is still nothing 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.000
 the whole thing is a first 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.820
 straight line 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.740
 that is, each clearly initially worth 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.460
 equal output value we still have 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.820
 nothing changed 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.409
 that means here on this x-axis 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.939
 the initial values ​​of the tonal values ​​and 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.570
 then here according to the output values 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.299
 if you have changed what well have what 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.920
 We here at possibilities says first 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.520
 This point curve can be quite normal in the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.840
 his year 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.909
 by default, if you have nothing 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.430
 did or you have already 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.710
 all if you have that every user of 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.079
 lead two other presets once 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.280
 middle contrast there is the whole here 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.479
 nicely put into a point look 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.240
 up here you have the regulators too 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.939
 looks better as I said that is 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.290
 Possibility 1 it is in an easy time 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.380
 been brought into shape 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.080
 and here in this deep area yet 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.940
 time the dark place again 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.530
 been lowered or here 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.890
 the bright spots are raised slightly 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.840
 been 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.430
 one can amplify afterwards again 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.350
 by saying okay I go strong 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.190
 Contrast one sees it in the picture as well 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.070
 I'll switch back pa 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.899
 and then it really starts contrasting 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.910
 It's quite clear that it's the same 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.850
 Contrast won only because I here the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.630
 deep further lowered and belong 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.830
 have raised here again 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.240
 the congratulationscour did that when I got the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.100
 first of all a light one from or 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.150
 I have made stronger shape 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.890
 already won a lot 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.000
 but you can go further now 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.930
 that means you have the 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.430
 possibility either right here in the 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.820
 you will once have the fields 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.010
 deep the dark midrange the bright 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.750
 Medium tones and the holds the lights 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.459
 now you can just totally 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.350
 specifically with pressed mouse button for 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.690
 Example of just lower again there 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.190
 her the opportunity and look below 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.350
 here on this regulator 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.810
 that is if I change something up here 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.240
 change his holding down the mouse button 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.740
 The regulators, too, that's what it means completely 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.680
 no matter if we are right here in the 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.830
 does presentation or here has both 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.540
 Curves, so to speak, influence that 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.330
 the possibility is once you have 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.060
 For example, this curve is still directly from 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.739
 to influence the shape 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.019
 furthermore, you already have them here 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.150
 limits are set by default 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.040
 Of course you can also move that 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.140
 that means I end now here too 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.709
 nothing to these values ​​but 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.090
 just move the border of 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.060
 here after there that I am in the moment 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.310
 more of the dark area, so to speak 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.050
 midrange then you realize that 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.880
 a picture now so immediately in the realm 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.580
 the wall looks new items, although I 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.160
 nothing to change the values 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.260
 since the wall changes the same case 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.180
 to the time back that's this 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.900
 Variant one in which he really does this 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.790
 affected areas here accordingly 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.060
 That's how it seems to be nice again 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.090
 back double just hangs up again 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.769
 this possibility and we had been 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.750
 only briefly seen at the beginning of the 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.549
 of course there are also the videos 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.240
 possibility directly to this point curve 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.610
 to edit 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.600
 then these controllers are hidden 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.550
 and now I can 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.990
 really say okay i want 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.080
 We'll go for a bit more for my sake 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.220
 to change 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.120
 still a little further 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.790
 You can discover it the way you can 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.020
 her the contrasts directly in the sample 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.730
 you can influence on my account 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.160
 to add the new points in one 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.900
 certain places I like something 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.170
 I do not want that I would like to have it like that 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.880
 if you have such a point then 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.800
 the pressed mouse button then looks 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.560
 is indeed gone he has the 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.520
 simply deleted 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.780
 and if he does not know which ones 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.240
 you're actually putting it right now 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.380
 you just want to influence 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.020
 the place in the picture then you still have 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.280
 the possibility by target correction 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.220
 just there on the target correction 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.320
 Tool to go and say okay 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.880
 look at what ever in which 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.040
 I'm here with the mouse 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.190
 then he shows that here too 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:58.480
 as I am now up here was on 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.040
 this piece is nice and bright 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.510
 sims believe it has you then see 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.850
 already there this black point like that 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.200
 is moving or here right in 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.220
 the wall in the dark places and 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.110
 if I hold down the mouse button 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:14.060
 either go up and clear then I raise 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.430
 these tone values ​​or maybe if 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.530
 I go further down then I see the 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.720
 continue from then so you can also completely 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.580
 really targeted if this 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.000
 Target correction tool becomes single 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.670
 to influence the image as well as to say 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.990
 that is the possibility one to theirs 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.300
 Contracts increase decrease over this 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.190
 Gradation curve then I still have 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.280
 a second example prepared 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.720
 Here we take that for a moment 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.790
 yes not always really contrast 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.410
 also to increase then one can also to 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.890
 for example , to reduce contrasts 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.540
 by having certain moods 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.820
 wants to achieve how such a picture What 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.590
 I took in the morning and around that 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.570
 a whole year still a little 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.790
 to lower contrasts to get to a room 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.870
 mood and give can still produce 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.610
 I also say it clearly 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.210
 the contrasts just want to go further 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.110
 Decrease this curve here 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.400
 move 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.530
 I do not want to do that now 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.480
 So I want to take off 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.570
 not but I wanted one 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.980
 here only a little bit 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.330
 next to it, so to speak, the dark places 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.090
 take out the same thing a bit more 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.830
 here and then, for example, I reach 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.230
 such a picture mood if you do that now 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.670
 still a little bit inks again from 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.920
 the color comes with a bit of sepia 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.110
 Ton sees it again very differently 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.760
 You can go out here in this 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.570
 compared to then also times exactly 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.760
 to compare 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:35.150
 Let's get the snapshot start here 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.560
 in and then we have that here now 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.510
 so to speak about the contrasts again 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.860
 have lowered then you see that here 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:44.030
 also very nice in the comparison 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.770
 view okay that's it today too 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.690
 again with this new video for 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.950
 burden 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.210
 I hope I could show you what you are 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.370
 so everything with the grande nation scope 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.170
 can do when you contrasts in one 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.360
 specific area of ​​the image targeted 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.280
 I would like to thank you 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.720
 wish again for your attention 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:05.140
 Have a nice day and see you 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:05.140
 next time learn from fotobuch.de
