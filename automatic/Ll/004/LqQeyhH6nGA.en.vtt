 McDonald's shocked McDonald's this time 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:55.800
 He said that the act of being unacceptably reported is absolutely unacceptable 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:03.940

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:09.470

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:15.620

 Indicated a policy to claim damages from a food processing company in Shanghai as soon as facts can be confirmed 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.650
 Was 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:57.050
 On the other hand , regarding the response to customers, it was confirmed that the improperly processed food was shipped to Japan. 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:59.290

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.290
 is 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:12.980

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:36.989
 In that 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:44.120

00:02:49.030 --> 00:03:02.800
 It is important to thoroughly protect safety when procuring products from a high profile, but in the unlikely event safety is protected
