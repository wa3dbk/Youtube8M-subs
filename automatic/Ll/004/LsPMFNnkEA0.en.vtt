the pocket clip screws to be very hard
to<00:01:49.970> remove<00:01:50.300> I<00:01:50.920> suspect<00:01:51.920> they're<00:01:52.100> using<00:01:52.430> some

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
to remove I suspect they're using some

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.180 
to remove I suspect they're using some
sort<00:01:52.850> of<00:01:53.000> thread<00:01:53.360> Locker<00:01:53.660> on<00:01:53.810> them<00:01:54.200> which<00:01:54.890> is

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
sort of thread Locker on them which is

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.100 
sort of thread Locker on them which is
really<00:01:55.340> rather<00:01:55.760> unfortunate<00:01:56.210> for<00:01:56.720> something

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
really rather unfortunate for something

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.560 
really rather unfortunate for something
they<00:01:57.380> should<00:01:57.590> be<00:01:57.619> expecting<00:01:58.280> people<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:58.670> want

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
they should be expecting people to want

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.740 
they should be expecting people to want
to<00:01:59.630> swap<00:01:59.900> to<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.110> other<00:02:00.290> side<00:02:00.590> now<00:02:04.540> this<00:02:05.540> knife

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
to swap to the other side now this knife

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.090 
to swap to the other side now this knife
is<00:02:05.900> also<00:02:05.960> very<00:02:06.350> lightweight<00:02:06.619> at

approximately 2 ounces this is due to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.710 
approximately 2 ounces this is due to
the<00:02:11.900> fact<00:02:12.200> that<00:02:12.560> there<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:13.450> relatively<00:02:14.450> little

feature<00:03:14.299> is<00:03:14.660> this<00:03:14.900> knife<00:03:15.110> has<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.890> bottle

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
feature is this knife has a bottle

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.770 
feature is this knife has a bottle
opener<00:03:16.370> or<00:03:16.790> cap<00:03:17.120> lifter<00:03:17.360> as<00:03:17.600> they're

sometimes<00:03:17.989> called<00:03:18.590> on<00:03:18.769> it<00:03:19.570> now<00:03:20.570> personally<00:03:21.170> I

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
sometimes called on it now personally I

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.660 
sometimes called on it now personally I
think<00:03:21.410> this<00:03:21.739> is<00:03:21.890> sort<00:03:22.100> of<00:03:22.160> an<00:03:22.280> overdone

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
think this is sort of an overdone

think this is sort of an overdone

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.330 
classy manner if you haven't spotted it
yet<00:03:35.060> it's<00:03:35.750> right<00:03:36.049> here<00:03:36.410> this<00:03:37.130> little

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
yet it's right here this little

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.069 
yet it's right here this little
projection<00:03:38.030> on<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.450> back<00:03:38.600> of<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.840> blade

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
projection on the back of the blade

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.960 
projection on the back of the blade
works<00:03:39.829> together<00:03:40.220> with<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:40.549> part<00:03:40.820> of<00:03:40.910> the

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
works together with this part of the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.150 
works together with this part of the
handle<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:42.110> form<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.680> pivot<00:03:43.359> so<00:03:44.359> you<00:03:44.419> hook<00:03:44.720> the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
handle to form a pivot so you hook the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.229 
handle to form a pivot so you hook the
little<00:03:46.160> mental<00:03:46.370> projection<00:03:46.790> there<00:03:46.910> under<00:03:47.150> the

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
little mental projection there under the

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.240 
little mental projection there under the
cap

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250

you'll<00:03:48.370> ever<00:03:48.550> upwards<00:03:49.440> really<00:03:50.440> that's<00:03:51.070> that's

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
you'll ever upwards really that's that's

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.170 
you'll ever upwards really that's that's
very<00:03:51.670> clever<00:03:51.910> I<00:03:52.090> like<00:03:52.240> that<00:03:56.880> overall<00:03:57.880> I<00:03:58.060> think

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
very clever I like that overall I think

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.600 
very clever I like that overall I think
this<00:03:58.450> is<00:03:58.630> an<00:03:58.840> excellent<00:03:59.260> knife<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.980> a<00:04:00.370> truly

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
this is an excellent knife and a truly

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.470 
this is an excellent knife and a truly
outstanding<00:04:00.730> knife<00:04:01.720> for<00:04:01.990> the<00:04:02.080> money<00:04:03.480> build

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
outstanding knife for the money build

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.480 
outstanding knife for the money build
quality<00:04:04.720> wise<00:04:05.050> I<00:04:05.380> would<00:04:05.500> class<00:04:05.830> it<00:04:06.040> up<00:04:06.220> there

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
quality wise I would class it up there

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.400 
quality wise I would class it up there
with<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.730> Spyderco<00:04:07.180> delica<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.810> really<00:04:08.230> would

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
with the Spyderco delica I really would

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.620 
with the Spyderco delica I really would
and<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:09.459> think<00:04:09.670> they<00:04:09.790> fill<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.030> very<00:04:10.330> similar

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
and I think they fill a very similar

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.070 
and I think they fill a very similar
role<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:12.190> don't<00:04:12.640> have<00:04:12.760> my<00:04:12.910> delica<00:04:13.330> with<00:04:13.870> me

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
role I don't have my delica with me

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.670 
role I don't have my delica with me
right<00:04:14.290> now

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
right now

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.550 
right now
but<00:04:15.220> they're<00:04:15.370> fairly<00:04:15.520> similarly<00:04:16.120> sized<00:04:16.560> the

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
but they're fairly similarly sized the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.319 
but they're fairly similarly sized the
blade<00:04:17.769> profile<00:04:18.220> is<00:04:18.370> different<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:18.910> delicas

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
blade profile is different the delicas

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.330 
blade profile is different the delicas
is<00:04:19.540> much<00:04:19.720> straighter<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.859> handle<00:04:21.190> is<00:04:21.310> a

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
is much straighter and the handle is a

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.360 
is much straighter and the handle is a
little<00:04:21.669> longer<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.770> speaking<00:04:23.770> of<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:23.980> handle

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
little longer and speaking of the handle

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.010 
little longer and speaking of the handle
we<00:04:25.210> come<00:04:25.450> to<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:28.240> place<00:04:28.360> where<00:04:28.480> I<00:04:28.720> have<00:04:28.990> to

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
we come to the place where I have to

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.280 
we come to the place where I have to
give<00:04:29.290> this<00:04:29.530> knife<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:30.070> few<00:04:30.430> knocks<00:04:31.050> not<00:04:32.050> bad

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
give this knife a few knocks not bad

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.550 
give this knife a few knocks not bad
ones<00:04:33.300> but<00:04:34.300> basically<00:04:34.630> I<00:04:34.750> could<00:04:34.990> sum<00:04:35.169> it<00:04:35.200> up<00:04:35.350> by

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
ones but basically I could sum it up by

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.530 
ones but basically I could sum it up by
saying<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:36.070> think<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.490> ergonomics<00:04:37.030> are<00:04:37.180> good

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
saying I think the ergonomics are good

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.250 
saying I think the ergonomics are good
