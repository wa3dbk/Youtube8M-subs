00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.080
 In one of the previous clips, we saw that we can look at 2/3 by 6 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.460
 any number equal to 2/3 of the distance to 6 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.450
 of the numerical axis we saw was 4. 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.300
 Or another way to think about it is by expressing 4 as 2/3 of 6. 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.110
 2/3 of 6 can be considered as ... 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.530
 Well, how much do I have if I take 2/3 of 6? 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.110
 What we want to do is apply the same idea, 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.800
 but to multiply not an integer with an integer, 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.220
 a liver with a liver. 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.060
 Let's take 3/4 and multiply it 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.290
 1/2. 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.000
 Naturally, 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.460
 by which we multiply, does not matter. 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.330
 That's exactly the same thing 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.940
 as the product of 1/2 and 3/4. 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.730
 And to imagine where it takes us, 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.760
 let's draw one 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.500
 numerical axis. 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.250
 I'll make her big enough to 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.680
 we have a little more room to work. 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.590
 This is 0 here. 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.560
 And this is 1. 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.940
 And, of course, our axis can last forever. 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.210
 Let's first imagine 3/4 by 1/2 as 3/4 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.850
 from the distance to 1/2. 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.840
 Let's first put 1/2 on our numerical axis. 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.380
 1/2 is literally half way between 0 and 1. 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.330
 That's 1/2. 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.660
 And how much does it represent 3/4 of the way to 1/2? 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.320
 We can think about 1/4 of 1/2. 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.940
 And, we can divide this part of the number axis 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.150
 on 4 equal segments. 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.240
 These are 2 straight segments. 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.422
 And that's four straight lines. 

00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:41.630
 And while we're here, let's divide all the halves 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.690
 on four equal segments. 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.600
 That is, let us divide all the halves into four equal segments each. 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.330
 These are 4 segments. 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.810
 Let us now deal with this. 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.960
 I make every effort to draw them as straight lines. 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.730
 I took each of the halves and I am them 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.030
 divided into 4 equal segments. 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.504
 So this point here is 1/4 of 1/2. 

00:02:04.504 --> 00:02:05.920
 But that does not interest us right now. 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.560
 We want to get to 3/4 of 1/2. 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.160
 And we want to get 1, 2, 3/4 of 1/2. 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.350
 So this point here is literally equal to 3/4 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.840
 1/2. 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.360
 And this here is naturally 1/2. 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.359
 But what number 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.604
 is that? 

00:02:27.604 --> 00:02:29.020
 Let me use a new color here. 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.500
 Now we can visualize it on the numerical axis. 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.040
 But what is that number? 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.500
 Well, a great joker is the fact that before 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.290
 divide the segment between 0 and 1 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.550
 on 2 straight segments, we only had to put 1/2. 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.520
 But then we took these two straight lines 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.360
 and divided them each 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.630
 on 4 more segments. 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.480
 By doing so, in essence 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.890
 divide the segment between 0 and 1 in 8 straight segments. 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.280
 So each of them is actually 1/8. 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.210
 And this point here is 1/8. 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.210
 This is 2/8. 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.750
 Then this is 3/8. 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.660
 This corresponds to 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.130
 as seen in a multiplication of common fractions. 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:23.230
 There must be a tie of 3 in 1 on 4 by 2, 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.010
 which is equal 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.780
 on 3/8. 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.790
 And everything we talk about, 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.850
 not to be confused, all this 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.332
 refers to this point here on the numerical axis. 

00:03:39.332 --> 00:03:41.540
 But what if we think otherwise? 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.910
 What if we think about 1/2 of the distance to 3/4? 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.650
 We can divide the space between 0 and 1 per quarters. 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.940
 Let's do it. 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.370
 This is 1/4, 2/4, 3/4. 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.250
 This is the number 3/4. 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.990
 And we want to go half the distance to 3/4. 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.440
 How much is half the distance to 3/4? 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.810
 We divide this segment into 2 straight segments. 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.050
 We can do it 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.760
 separation there. 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.870
 And we want to go a distance, equal to one of the stretches. 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.520
 1/2 of 3/4 takes us back here again, 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.017
 at this point - 3/8. 

00:04:26.017 --> 00:04:28.350
 So, in either way, imagine it, 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.530
 whether we take 3/4 of 1/2, or say that we will travel 3/4 of the distance 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.420
 to 1/2, or we say we'll take half the distance 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.520
 to 3/4, in both ways, to hope that it is now clearer. 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.770
 We can imagine it, and the numerical value, 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.090
 which is available, is equal to 3/8.
