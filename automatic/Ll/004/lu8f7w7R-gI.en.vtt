it's the same whining at the telly
pickup<00:02:21.819> same<00:02:22.390> output<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.650> sounds

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
pickup same output and it sounds

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.830 
pickup same output and it sounds
basically<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.340> same<00:02:24.549> and<00:02:24.819> then<00:02:25.299> I<00:02:25.390> just<00:02:25.720> two

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
basically the same and then I just two

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.930 
basically the same and then I just two
years<00:02:25.959> ago<00:02:26.049> put<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.410> strap<00:02:26.799> pick<00:02:27.069> up<00:02:27.220> in<00:02:27.400> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
years ago put a strap pick up in the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.490 
years ago put a strap pick up in the
neck<00:02:28.180> because<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.569> think<00:02:28.690> tele<00:02:28.989> pickups<00:02:29.380> are

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
neck because I think tele pickups are

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.870 
neck because I think tele pickups are
this<00:02:29.650> muddy<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.250> wanted

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
this muddy and I wanted

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.110 
this muddy and I wanted
I<00:02:31.660> like<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.590> strat<00:02:32.920> telling<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:33.700> it's<00:02:33.940> a

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
I like that strat telling so it's a

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.230 
I like that strat telling so it's a

pickup so what I have done what you want
to<00:02:41.350> do<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:42.490> wrap<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.090> cavities<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:44.220> foil<00:02:45.220> and

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
to do is wrap the cavities in foil and

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.440 
to do is wrap the cavities in foil and
I've<00:02:45.460> done<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.790> with<00:02:45.940> my<00:02:46.090> electric

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
I've done this with my electric

cavity there the humbucker wasn't going
to<00:02:55.330> do<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.420> because<00:02:55.600> there's<00:02:55.750> no<00:02:55.870> harm<00:02:56.050> but<00:02:56.170> I

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
to do it because there's no harm but I

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.860 
to do it because there's no harm but I
figured<00:02:56.650> what<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.890> heck<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:58.240> then<00:02:58.420> also<00:02:58.630> on

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
figured what the heck and then also on

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.600 
figured what the heck and then also on
the<00:02:59.850> pickguard<00:03:00.850> there<00:03:01.300> in<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.930> back<00:03:02.110> side

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
ok and actually preferable that you

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.690 
ok and actually preferable that you
leave<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.840> little<00:03:08.020> overhang<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.400> way<00:03:09.490> that

so<00:03:43.270> that<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.540> will<00:03:43.600> run<00:03:43.960> properly<00:03:44.560> if<00:03:44.950> you<00:03:45.130> just

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
so that it will run properly if you just

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.180 
so that it will run properly if you just
throw<00:03:45.610> tape<00:03:45.910> in<00:03:46.150> there<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.660> might<00:03:46.930> help<00:03:47.260> keep

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
throw tape in there it might help keep

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.430 
throw tape in there it might help keep
some<00:03:48.459> buzz<00:03:48.670> out<00:03:48.850> but<00:03:49.150> grounding<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:49.990> really

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
some buzz out but grounding it is really

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.050 
some buzz out but grounding it is really
where<00:03:50.590> you're<00:03:50.740> going<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:50.980> get<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.250> most<00:03:51.430> out

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
where you're going to get the most out

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.809 
where you're going to get the most out
of<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:52.330> so<00:03:52.630> i<00:03:52.870> soldered<00:03:53.740> a<00:03:53.890> another<00:03:54.220> black<00:03:54.280> wire

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819

to<00:04:21.400> ya<00:04:21.579> I<00:04:21.820> just<00:04:22.450> I<00:04:22.690> couldn't<00:04:23.080> get<00:04:23.200> it<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.350> stick

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
to ya I just I couldn't get it to stick

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.880 
to ya I just I couldn't get it to stick
and<00:04:24.910> I<00:04:25.240> think<00:04:25.540> by<00:04:25.720> wrapping<00:04:26.260> it<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.530> grounding

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
and I think by wrapping it and grounding

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.380 
and I think by wrapping it and grounding
it<00:04:26.950> all<00:04:27.130> just<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.610> tape<00:04:27.790> itself<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.330> think

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
it all just the tape itself I think

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.200 
it all just the tape itself I think
should<00:04:28.840> be<00:04:29.050> plenty<00:04:29.410> good<00:04:29.710> enough<00:04:30.060> this<00:04:31.060> should

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
should be plenty good enough this should

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.550 
should be plenty good enough this should
help<00:04:31.330> eliminate<00:04:31.660> any<00:04:31.990> noise<00:04:32.169> if<00:04:32.410> you're

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
help eliminate any noise if you're

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.959 
help eliminate any noise if you're
having<00:04:32.770> buzz<00:04:33.550> issues<00:04:34.090> with

just put LED chem lights on every stage
in<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.009> world<00:04:47.509> it<00:04:48.509> would<00:04:48.659> a<00:04:48.899> reduce<00:04:49.259> heat<00:04:49.529> and

00:04:49.549 --> 00:04:49.559 
in the world it would a reduce heat and

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:51.469 
in the world it would a reduce heat and
B<00:04:49.860> get<00:04:50.159> rid<00:04:50.279> of<00:04:50.369> buzz<00:04:50.579> it<00:04:50.789> would<00:04:50.879> just<00:04:50.969> make<00:04:51.329> the
