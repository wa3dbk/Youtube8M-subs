00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
them lurch their way down there and

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.510 
them lurch their way down there and

and and talk to them softly and let them

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.360 
and and talk to them softly and let them
figure<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.150> out<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.660> give<00:03:18.810> them<00:03:18.989> time<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.650> think

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
figure it out and give them time I think

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.949 
figure it out and give them time I think
it<00:03:20.610> goes<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.760> lot<00:03:21.000> better<00:03:21.060> there's<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.720> whole

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
it goes a lot better there's a whole

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.440 
it goes a lot better there's a whole
theory<00:03:22.709> about<00:03:22.830> breastfeeding<00:03:23.730> which<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.270> also

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
theory about breastfeeding which is also

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.080 
theory about breastfeeding which is also
that<00:03:24.780> or<00:03:24.930> latching<00:03:25.830> babies<00:03:26.160> which<00:03:26.730> is<00:03:26.910> that

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
that or latching babies which is that

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.420 
that or latching babies which is that
the<00:03:27.330> baby<00:03:27.510> can<00:03:27.750> only<00:03:27.900> latch<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.530> one<00:03:28.860> swift

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
the baby can only latch in one swift

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.729 
the baby can only latch in one swift
movement<00:03:29.760> right<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.050> tickle<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.500> baby's

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
movement right so you tickle the baby's

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.920 
movement right so you tickle the baby's
lip<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.520> then<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.760> baby<00:03:32.940> goes<00:03:33.120> opens<00:03:33.720> wide

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
lip and then the baby goes opens wide

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.630 
lip and then the baby goes opens wide
and<00:03:34.170> then<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.350> bring<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.739> baby<00:03:34.890> on<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.310> then

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
and then you bring the baby on and then

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.310 
and then you bring the baby on and then
if<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.820> hurts<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.270> it's<00:03:36.420> not<00:03:36.570> right<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:37.020> take

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
if it hurts and it's not right you take

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.760 
if it hurts and it's not right you take
the<00:03:37.380> baby<00:03:37.860> off<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:39.090> try<00:03:39.480> again<00:03:39.650> well<00:03:40.650> when

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
the baby off and you try again well when

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.020 
the baby off and you try again well when
you've<00:03:40.890> done<00:03:41.070> that<00:03:41.220> four<00:03:41.400> or<00:03:41.459> five<00:03:41.580> times<00:03:41.790> the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
you've done that four or five times the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.360 
you've done that four or five times the
baby's<00:03:42.360> really<00:03:42.750> mad<00:03:43.019> at<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.350> right<00:03:43.380> yeah<00:03:44.220> and

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
baby's really mad at you right yeah and

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.130 
baby's really mad at you right yeah and
you're<00:03:44.580> really<00:03:45.060> sore<00:03:45.330> because<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.780> nipples

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
you're really sore because the nipples

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.259 
you're really sore because the nipples
been<00:03:46.290> damaged<00:03:47.130> several<00:03:47.459> times<00:03:47.850> by<00:03:48.030> being

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
been damaged several times by being

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.620 
been damaged several times by being
latched<00:03:48.450> on<00:03:48.690> wrongly<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.700> think<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:51.030> in<00:03:51.390> fact

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
latched on wrongly I think that in fact

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.960 
latched on wrongly I think that in fact
we<00:03:51.870> might<00:03:51.989> be<00:03:52.140> better<00:03:52.290> off<00:03:52.550> letting<00:03:53.550> babies

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
we might be better off letting babies

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.229 
we might be better off letting babies
latch<00:03:54.209> themselves<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:55.260> then<00:03:56.060> altering<00:03:57.060> their

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
latch themselves and then altering their

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.850 
latch themselves and then altering their
position<00:03:57.720> move<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.080> baby<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.500> this<00:03:58.620> way

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
position move the baby of it this way

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.920 
position move the baby of it this way
move<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.430> bit<00:03:59.550> that<00:03:59.730> way<00:03:59.910> move<00:04:00.269> it<00:04:00.390> up<00:04:00.540> move

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
move it a bit that way move it up move

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.380 
move it a bit that way move it up move
it<00:04:01.019> down<00:04:01.160> angle<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.250> out<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.400> bit<00:04:02.790> we've<00:04:03.360> got

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
it down angle it out a bit we've got

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.360 
it down angle it out a bit we've got
three<00:04:03.780> dimensions<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:04.650> which<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.980> move<00:04:05.130> this

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
three dimensions in which to move this

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.460 
three dimensions in which to move this
baby<00:04:05.610> around<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.300> make<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.480> cut<00:04:06.750> make<00:04:06.989> yourself

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
baby around to make it cut make yourself

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.130 
baby around to make it cut make yourself
comfortable<00:04:07.860> and<00:04:08.690> maybe<00:04:09.690> we<00:04:09.870> should<00:04:09.900> be<00:04:10.080> doing

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
comfortable and maybe we should be doing

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.769 
comfortable and maybe we should be doing
some<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.530> that
