pretty high I think it's a 10 point oh I

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:01.160 
pretty high I think it's a 10 point oh I
got<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.089> regular<00:01:00.269> I<00:01:00.479> think<00:01:00.689> this<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> rich

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
got the regular I think this is a rich

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.759 
got the regular I think this is a rich
100<00:01:02.040> watt<00:01:02.220> bulbs<00:01:02.790> regular<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:04.470> one<00:01:04.589> back

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
100 watt bulbs regular the one back

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.170 
100 watt bulbs regular the one back
there<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> UVA<00:01:05.610> bulb<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.820> red<00:01:09.000> one

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
there is a UVA bulb and the red one

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.850 
there is a UVA bulb and the red one
stays<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.659> all<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.960> time<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.439> nighttime

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
stays on all the time it's the nighttime

bulb<00:01:11.299> I've<00:01:12.299> got<00:01:12.479> another<00:01:12.689> UV<00:01:13.259> light<00:01:13.439> right

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
bulb I've got another UV light right

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.429 
bulb I've got another UV light right
there<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:14.070> think<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.549> 5.0<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.600> ordered<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
there I think it's a 5.0 but I ordered a

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.389 
there I think it's a 5.0 but I ordered a
a<00:01:17.810> mega<00:01:18.810> ray<00:01:21.020> 275<00:01:22.020> watt<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.280> I've

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
a mega ray 275 watt just because I've

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.899 
a mega ray 275 watt just because I've
had<00:01:23.549> losers<00:01:23.939> before<00:01:24.149> that<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:25.140> gotten<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.909> MBD

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
had losers before that have gotten a MBD

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.469 
had losers before that have gotten a MBD
with<00:01:27.320> bulbs<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.409> say<00:01:29.340> they<00:01:29.490> work<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
with bulbs that say they work and the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.600 
with bulbs that say they work and the
band<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.870> not<00:01:31.020> working<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:32.490> pretty

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
band of not working so it's pretty

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.719 
band of not working so it's pretty
expensive<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.360> think<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:33.659> worth<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.120 

the<00:01:40.150> only<00:01:40.330> other<00:01:40.540> thing<00:01:40.720> I<00:01:40.810> can<00:01:40.930> think<00:01:40.960> of<00:01:41.290> is<00:01:41.470> a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.890 

that<00:01:45.130> I'm<00:01:45.640> probably<00:01:45.909> not<00:01:46.120> doing<00:01:46.300> right<00:01:46.570> is<00:01:46.870> uh

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
that I'm probably not doing right is uh

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.899 
that I'm probably not doing right is uh
the<00:01:47.560> waters<00:01:47.920> down<00:01:48.159> there<00:01:48.430> but<00:01:48.670> they<00:01:48.760> hardly

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
the waters down there but they hardly

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.030 
the waters down there but they hardly
ever<00:01:49.240> go<00:01:49.510> down<00:01:49.690> there<00:01:49.930> because<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:50.710> guess<00:01:50.890> just

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
ever go down there because I guess just

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.149 
ever go down there because I guess just
because<00:01:51.310> it's<00:01:51.550> so<00:01:51.840> cold<00:01:52.840> or<00:01:53.200> it's<00:01:53.680> not<00:01:53.830> really

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
because it's so cold or it's not really

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.190 
because it's so cold or it's not really
what<00:01:54.310> they<00:01:54.430> want<00:01:54.670> so<00:01:54.970> trying<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.810> think<00:01:55.900> of<00:01:56.080> a

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
what they want so trying to think of a

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.180 
what they want so trying to think of a
way<00:01:56.650> I<00:01:56.680> can<00:01:56.979> have<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:58.380> somehow<00:01:59.380> bring<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.950> water

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
way I can have a somehow bring the water

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.310 
way I can have a somehow bring the water
up<00:02:00.310> so<00:02:00.700> they<00:02:00.820> can<00:02:00.970> sit<00:02:01.150> at<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.840> probably<00:02:02.229> the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
up so they can sit at the probably the

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.140 
up so they can sit at the probably the
height<00:02:02.500> that<00:02:02.740> there<00:02:02.979> are<00:02:03.130> now<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.909> I'm<00:02:07.060> still

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
height that there are now but I'm still

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.630 
height that there are now but I'm still
trying<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.479> figure<00:02:07.630> out<00:02:07.750> how<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:07.869> do<00:02:08.080> that<00:02:08.640> I'm

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
trying to figure out how to do that I'm

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.979 
trying to figure out how to do that I'm
also<00:02:09.789> looking<00:02:09.970> for<00:02:10.209> some<00:02:10.360> wallpaper<00:02:10.810> or

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
also looking for some wallpaper or

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.510 
also looking for some wallpaper or
something<00:02:11.319> to<00:02:11.380> make<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.530> little<00:02:11.800> little<00:02:12.370> bit

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
something to make a little little bit

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.559 
something to make a little little bit
cooler

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.789
