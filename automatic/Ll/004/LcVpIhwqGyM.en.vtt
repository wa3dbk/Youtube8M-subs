pretty much any flavor that you want to
put<00:03:08.599> into<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.079> it's<00:03:09.200> great<00:03:09.319> for<00:03:09.439> spaghetti

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
put into it so it's great for spaghetti

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.780 
put into it so it's great for spaghetti
sauces<00:03:10.750> soups<00:03:11.750> anything<00:03:12.379> like<00:03:12.530> that<00:03:12.609> on<00:03:13.609> the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
sauces soups anything like that on the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.759 
sauces soups anything like that on the
trail<00:03:14.000> on<00:03:14.359> the<00:03:14.569> water<00:03:14.750> this<00:03:14.989> is<00:03:15.379> absolutely

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
trail on the water this is absolutely

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.559 
trail on the water this is absolutely
fantastic<00:03:16.010> it's<00:03:16.609> a<00:03:16.669> great<00:03:16.940> source<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.359> protein

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
fantastic it's a great source of protein

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.689 
fantastic it's a great source of protein
like<00:03:18.049> I<00:03:18.169> say<00:03:18.379> it's<00:03:18.530> like<00:03:18.680> tofu<00:03:18.919> it<00:03:19.190> absorbs<00:03:19.549> any

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:19.699 
like I say it's like tofu it absorbs any

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.520 
like I say it's like tofu it absorbs any
flavor<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.599> doesn't<00:03:20.870> really<00:03:20.989> bring<00:03:21.260> much

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
flavor and it doesn't really bring much

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.710 
flavor and it doesn't really bring much
of<00:03:21.680> its<00:03:21.829> own<00:03:21.949> flavor<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.549> plate<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.329> just<00:03:23.660> a

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
of its own flavor to the plate so just a

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.150 
of its own flavor to the plate so just a
few<00:03:23.870> spices<00:03:24.109> and<00:03:24.500> things<00:03:24.650> like<00:03:24.799> that<00:03:24.859> you

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
few spices and things like that you

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.099 
few spices and things like that you
could<00:03:25.250> have<00:03:25.430> this<00:03:25.609> plain<00:03:25.909> but<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:26.959> also

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
could have this plain but it also

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.080 
could have this plain but it also
becomes<00:03:27.739> a<00:03:27.949> very<00:03:28.129> interesting<00:03:28.250> texture<00:03:28.909> when

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
becomes a very interesting texture when

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.050 
becomes a very interesting texture when
you<00:03:29.180> add<00:03:29.359> it<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.709> add<00:03:30.709> it<00:03:30.889> to<00:03:30.919> sauces<00:03:31.430> one<00:03:31.879> thing

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
you add it to add it to sauces one thing

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.250 
you add it to add it to sauces one thing
you<00:03:32.120> want<00:03:32.299> to<00:03:32.329> remember<00:03:32.540> about<00:03:32.810> having<00:03:33.169> a

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
you want to remember about having a

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.020 
you want to remember about having a
textured<00:03:33.650> vegetable<00:03:33.859> protein<00:03:34.159> product<00:03:34.879> with

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
textured vegetable protein product with

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.569 
textured vegetable protein product with
you<00:03:35.209> it<00:03:35.900> does<00:03:36.169> do<00:03:36.409> the<00:03:36.560> same<00:03:36.769> thing<00:03:37.010> as<00:03:37.129> tofu<00:03:37.549> or

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
you it does do the same thing as tofu or

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.699 
you it does do the same thing as tofu or
bean<00:03:37.909> curd<00:03:38.239> if<00:03:38.419> you<00:03:38.540> will<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:39.500> if<00:03:39.590> you're

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
bean curd if you will so if you're

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.039 
bean curd if you will so if you're
sensitive<00:03:39.979> to<00:03:40.250> those<00:03:41.000> types<00:03:41.299> of<00:03:41.449> things<00:03:41.720> if<00:03:41.930> it

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
sensitive to those types of things if it

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.759 
sensitive to those types of things if it
gives<00:03:42.199> you<00:03:42.379> the<00:03:42.440> indigestion<00:03:42.979> and<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:44.769> how

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769
