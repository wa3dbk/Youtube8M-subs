00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.460
 This is a relatively inexpensive cable with 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.560
 type-c connectors do not produce this woman 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.210
 too vivid impressions from the first 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.410
 glance 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.710
 extruded housing and connectors 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.970
 made of durable plastic and 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.949
 provide long service life 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.619
 cable conductors are enclosed in 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.360
 polyethylene insulation and its external 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.960
 light blue protective shell 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.850
 made of polyvinyl chloride with more 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.649
 close and attentive acquaintance 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.980
 it turns out that the model is not so 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.700
 as simple as it seems each of her 2 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.739
 twisted pairs 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.170
 has its own shielding for 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.600
 maximum protection against mutual influence 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.960
 against each other and from the effects of various 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.910
 external radio frequency interference in quality 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.120
 conductor material used 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.250
 high purity tinned copper 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.199
 cable is characterized by low capacitance and 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.210
 provides effective suppression 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.619
 interference 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.119
 reliable shielded connectors 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.210
 match the standard 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.939
 usb 2 0 specification and have a golden 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.490
 cover 24 carats for more 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.680
 effective contact and also for 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.560
 prevent oxidation 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.990
 the model is able to transfer data from high 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.049
 at 1200 megabits per second at 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.850
 distance up to 15 meters which is 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.700
 pretty serious indicator 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.400
 cable has great flexibility 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.530
 resistant to wear and aging it also 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.810
 has a great build quality 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.630
 but the most important trump card is 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.939
 excellent value for money 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.310
 should also add that model 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.820
 received the highest score in the comparative 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.979
 the test 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.329
 famous specialized edition 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.329
