but it says on here that you cannot

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.820 
but it says on here that you cannot
remove<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.430> because<00:02:13.760> it's<00:02:13.940> built-in<00:02:14.500> on<00:02:15.500> the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
remove it because it's built-in on the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.070 
remove it because it's built-in on the
side<00:02:16.040> over<00:02:16.340> here<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.550> have<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:17.209> SIM<00:02:17.629> card<00:02:17.870> slot

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
side over here you have a SIM card slot

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.870 
side over here you have a SIM card slot
where<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.440> can<00:02:18.650> put

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
where you can put

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.680 
where you can put
your<00:02:19.120> SIM<00:02:19.360> card<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:21.270> believe<00:02:22.270> there<00:02:22.660> should

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
your SIM card and I believe there should

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.930 
your SIM card and I believe there should
be<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:23.110> memory<00:02:24.070> no<00:02:24.400> sorry

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
be a memory no sorry

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.340 
be a memory no sorry
this<00:02:25.270> phone<00:02:25.450> has<00:02:25.480> eight<00:02:25.870> gigs<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.320> memory

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
this phone has eight gigs of memory

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.370 
this phone has eight gigs of memory
built<00:02:27.010> in<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:27.760> there<00:02:28.660> is<00:02:28.780> no<00:02:28.930> need<00:02:29.140> for<00:02:29.170> a

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
built in so there is no need for a

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.710 
built in so there is no need for a
memory<00:02:29.680> card<00:02:29.920> slot<00:02:30.190> which<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.210> would<00:02:31.570> be

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
memory card slot which it would be

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.510 
memory card slot which it would be
pretty<00:02:31.990> nice<00:02:32.170> if<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:32.500> could<00:02:32.620> add<00:02:33.010> on<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.490> it

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
pretty nice if you could add on to it

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.640 
pretty nice if you could add on to it
but<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:34.120> guess<00:02:34.720> eight<00:02:34.930> gigs<00:02:35.200> for<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.440> lot<00:02:35.620> of

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
but I guess eight gigs for a lot of

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.520 
but I guess eight gigs for a lot of
people<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.160> lot<00:02:36.400> for<00:02:36.910> me<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.360> can<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:38.110> cannot

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
people is a lot for me I can I cannot

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.000 
people is a lot for me I can I cannot
live<00:02:38.740> with<00:02:38.920> eight<00:02:39.310> gigs<00:02:39.990> but<00:02:40.990> you<00:02:41.770> have<00:02:41.890> the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
live with eight gigs but you have the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.780 
live with eight gigs but you have the
power<00:02:42.040> button<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.700> side<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:45.280> volume<00:02:45.490> up

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
power button on the side and a volume up

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.430 
power button on the side and a volume up
volume<00:02:45.820> down<00:02:46.300> button<00:02:46.660> right<00:02:46.960> on<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.260> same

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
volume down button right on the same

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.150 
let's go ahead and set it up so that's
the<00:04:03.880> back<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.360> then<00:04:05.020> the<00:04:05.350> front<00:04:05.620> camera<00:04:05.830> you

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
can just flip it from here oh I think I

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.440

turned<00:04:09.640> it<00:04:09.940> off

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
turned it off

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
so let's go ahead and flip it and that's

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.080
