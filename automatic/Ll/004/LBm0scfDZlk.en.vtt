00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
okay it works what I'm doing here

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:55.910 
okay it works what I'm doing here
there's<00:00:54.539> three<00:00:54.660> prongs<00:00:55.019> now<00:00:55.409> hook<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.739> to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
there's three prongs now hook this to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.099 
there's three prongs now hook this to
the<00:00:56.010> six<00:00:56.250> volt<00:00:56.460> battery<00:00:56.909> rather<00:00:57.839> than<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the six volt battery rather than a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.270 
the six volt battery rather than a
twelve<00:00:58.379> volt<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.859> don't<00:00:58.979> want<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.159> blow

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
twelve volt because I don't want to blow

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.509 
twelve volt because I don't want to blow
it<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.519> I'm<00:01:00.479> grounding<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.379> Center<00:01:01.890> prong<00:01:02.219> of

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
it up I'm grounding this Center prong of

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.329 
it up I'm grounding this Center prong of
the<00:01:02.640> three<00:01:02.909> and<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:04.049> when<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.229> put<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.649> hot

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the three and then when I put the hot

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.380 
the three and then when I put the hot
wire<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:07.440> one<00:01:07.619> side<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.979> should<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.880> dim

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
wire to one side I should have a dim

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.899 
wire to one side I should have a dim
light<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> other<00:01:11.070> side<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.369> should<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
light to the other side I should have a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.139 
light to the other side I should have a
bright<00:01:12.180> light<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:12.990> know<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.830> works

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
bright light so I know this one works

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.389 
bright light so I know this one works
this<00:01:15.149> bulb<00:01:15.479> works<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:16.049> could<00:01:17.090> if<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.299> wanted<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
this bulb works I could if I wanted to

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.620 
this bulb works I could if I wanted to
just<00:01:20.399> put<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.729> whole<00:01:20.939> thing<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.479> there

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
just put this whole thing in there

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.899 
just put this whole thing in there
rather<00:01:21.899> than<00:01:22.220> dismembering<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.399> and<00:01:23.550> someone

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
rather than dismembering it and someone

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.370 
rather than dismembering it and someone
said<00:01:24.179> the<00:01:24.300> other<00:01:24.450> day<00:01:24.479> about<00:01:24.630> they<00:01:25.140> weren't

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
said the other day about they weren't

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.570 
said the other day about they weren't
brave<00:01:25.590> enough<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.860> take<00:01:26.100> one<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.310> these<00:01:26.429> apart

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
brave enough to take one of these apart

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.059 
brave enough to take one of these apart
because<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.060> has<00:01:27.240> all<00:01:27.390> these<00:01:27.509> little<00:01:27.600> wire

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
because it has all these little wire

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.469 
because it has all these little wire
things<00:01:29.069> in<00:01:29.340> here<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.729> holds<00:01:30.030> everything<00:01:30.119> in

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
things in here that holds everything in

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.690 
things in here that holds everything in
place<00:01:30.799> but<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:31.890> brave<00:01:32.100> enough<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> take<00:01:32.580> it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
place but I'm brave enough to take it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.490 
place but I'm brave enough to take it
apart<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.420> will<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:34.369> doubt<00:01:36.020> if<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.229> light

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
apart and I will I doubt if this light

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.740 
apart and I will I doubt if this light
works<00:01:37.860> although<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.759> could<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.030> wrong<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.659> you

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
works although I could be wrong and you

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.440 
works although I could be wrong and you
know<00:01:39.869> what<00:01:40.080> we<00:01:40.649> could<00:01:40.770> test<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:42.209> if<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
know what we could test it and if it

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.419 
know what we could test it and if it
didn't<00:01:42.690> work<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.959> suppose<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.319> could<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.500> throw

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
didn't work I suppose I could just throw

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.669 
didn't work I suppose I could just throw
the<00:01:44.610> whole<00:01:44.640> bucket<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.420> there<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.530> basically

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
the whole bucket in there so basically

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:47.870 
the whole bucket in there so basically
the<00:01:46.979> way<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.100> would<00:01:47.369> work<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.700> should

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the way that would work you should

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.630 
the way that would work you should
ground<00:01:48.119> one<00:01:48.630> side<00:01:48.929> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> bulb<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.709> cut<00:01:50.520> your

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
ground one side of the bulb and cut your

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.410 
ground one side of the bulb and cut your
wire<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.209> the<00:01:51.330> other<00:01:51.679> part<00:01:52.679> I<00:01:53.179> can't<00:01:54.179> see<00:01:54.330> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
wire to the other part I can't see the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.569 
wire to the other part I can't see the
ball<00:01:54.600> from<00:01:54.719> the<00:01:54.840> same<00:01:55.109> ball<00:01:55.320> maybe<00:01:56.100> y'all<00:01:56.369> can

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
ball from the same ball maybe y'all can

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.950 
ball from the same ball maybe y'all can
but<00:01:56.789> I<00:01:56.880> can't<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.329> let<00:01:57.479> me<00:01:57.570> turn<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.869> around

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
but I can't so let me turn it around

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.940 
but I can't so let me turn it around
this<00:01:58.200> way

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.550 

that<00:02:06.950> would<00:02:07.310> be<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.520> negatory<00:02:08.149> Ghost<00:02:08.660> Rider<00:02:08.929> so

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
that would be a negatory Ghost Rider so

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.779 
that would be a negatory Ghost Rider so
that's<00:02:09.920> no<00:02:10.039> problem<00:02:10.340> we'll<00:02:10.429> pull<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.670> apart

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
that's no problem we'll pull that apart

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.560 
that's no problem we'll pull that apart
I<00:02:11.210> want<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.870> test<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.140> oven<00:02:12.380> while<00:02:12.530> I'm<00:02:12.650> at<00:02:12.770> it

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
I want to test the oven while I'm at it

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.930 
I want to test the oven while I'm at it
we<00:02:14.570> know<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.140> good<00:02:15.350> one<00:02:15.800> we'll<00:02:16.700> set<00:02:16.910> it

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
we know this is a good one we'll set it

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.070 
we know this is a good one we'll set it
right<00:02:17.180> here<00:02:18.100> I'll<00:02:19.100> take<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:19.430> other<00:02:19.670> one<00:02:19.850> here

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
right here I'll take this other one here

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.890 
right here I'll take this other one here
we'll<00:02:21.080> see<00:02:21.230> if<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.440> works<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.510> we<00:02:23.510> do<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.720> same

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
we'll see if it works so we do the same

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.040 
we'll see if it works so we do the same
thing<00:02:24.140> we<00:02:24.290> come<00:02:24.410> around<00:02:24.590> with<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.770> ground

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
thing we come around with the ground

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.760 
thing we come around with the ground
ground<00:02:27.050> wire

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.420 

dang<00:02:30.770> I'm<00:02:31.040> getting<00:02:31.250> rust<00:02:31.459> on<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.820> legs

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
dang I'm getting rust on the legs

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.590 
dang I'm getting rust on the legs
dang<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:35.680> one<00:02:36.680> works<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.730> that<00:02:37.820> works<00:02:38.180> okay

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
dang that one works and that works okay

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.250 
I got two good light bulbs pretty sweet
I<00:02:42.010> wonder<00:02:43.010> if<00:02:43.040> let's<00:02:43.940> just<00:02:44.120> try<00:02:44.330> this<00:02:45.080> little

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
I wonder if let's just try this little

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.630 
I wonder if let's just try this little
light<00:02:45.530> will<00:02:45.739> work<00:02:47.890> let's<00:02:48.890> see

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
light will work let's see

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.300 
light will work let's see
ground<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.720> side<00:02:51.020> hot<00:02:51.290> warm<00:02:51.530> that<00:02:51.739> Sun<00:02:52.040> I

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
ground that side hot warm that Sun I

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.199 
ground that side hot warm that Sun I
don't<00:02:52.730> think<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.590> that's<00:02:54.590> okay<00:02:54.860> though<00:02:55.209> that's

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
don't think so that's okay though that's

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.490 
don't think so that's okay though that's
good<00:02:56.450> because<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:57.320> tried<00:02:58.070> to<00:02:58.220> get<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.700> light<00:02:59.150> bulb
