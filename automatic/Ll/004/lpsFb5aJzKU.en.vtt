00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.960
 We are showing you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.139
 there is the process of automatic irrigation 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.269
 by people from one of the stalls in 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.330
 production 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.690
 as we have said the process starts up 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.529
 with the deposit of bovine manure already 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.800
 tanned inside the bays together 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.740
 with the Californian earthworms 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.349
 from that moment and in accordance with the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.399
 ambient temperature 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:40.829
 this program but the links to 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.700
 keeping the worms properly is my 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.059
 descents 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.399
 Let's just say that with the amount of 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.579
 minimum humidity they need to 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.360
 survive and to produce 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.070
 evidently that this process requires 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.859
 drains 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.859
 We'll be showing you here. 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:13.189
 the kind of a workout to avoid even more 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.189
 of 1 to avoid waterlogging 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.090
 substrate that would also be fatal to 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.270
 my orders 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.439
 they would not support the environment in a given 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.590
 huh 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:34.170
 They like running water and running. 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:41.430
 although the humidity is the ideal house in the house 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:45.110
 of 60% of its people can maintain and 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:50.460
 test in a very simple way 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:56.219
 take a handful on the 1111 hand and 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:59.960
 open to drain by the arm 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.820
 the unit is excessive if it does not 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.100
 nothing happens, I totally have 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.110
 water bubbles 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.450
 the unit is small 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.230
 the ideal is that between the fingers arise 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.540
 only a few droplets without 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.430
 they ran down the arm 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.470
 with this you would be in ideal moisture 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.810
 for the survival of earthworms and 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.450
 production of humus 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.670
 production of earthworms and the production of 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.310
 high quality month a 10 j a he 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.640
 is to produce only manure based 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:45.060
 bovine animals do not use any other 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:52.310
 raw material from our 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:52.310
 an excellent level of quality 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.090
 quality and purity 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.260
 we still see a little more of the 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.260
 irrigation process 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:11.840
 We are in summer the temperature in 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:15.030
 house of 30 to 35 or more degrees celsius 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.630
 this time it is necessary to live with 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.630
 abundance
