00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
this question about whether he have

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.810 
this question about whether he have
managed<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.440> I<00:01:04.619> had<00:01:04.890> time<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> on

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
managed that I had time to get the on

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.310 
managed that I had time to get the on
here<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.360> angle<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.900> saw<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> think

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
here on that angle that we saw I think

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.050 
here on that angle that we saw I think
it'd<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.530> too<00:01:07.860> difficult<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.940> his

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
it'd be too difficult to see with his

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.880 
it'd be too difficult to see with his
arms<00:01:09.330> coming<00:01:09.509> round<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.050> so<00:01:10.259> fast<00:01:10.619> but

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
arms coming round as it was so fast but

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.260 
arms coming round as it was so fast but
I<00:01:11.070> think<00:01:11.430> from<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:11.640> other<00:01:11.790> side<00:01:12.030> you'll<00:01:12.240> see

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
I think from the other side you'll see

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.520 
I think from the other side you'll see
whether<00:01:12.570> he<00:01:12.690> led<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.020> head<00:01:13.200> or<00:01:13.350> not<00:01:13.409> this

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
whether he led to this head or not this

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.499 
whether he led to this head or not this
is<00:01:13.649> a<00:01:13.710> good<00:01:13.860> angle<00:01:14.570> just<00:01:15.680> later<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:18.210> nor<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
is a good angle just later to nor to

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.240

thank<00:01:18.690> her<00:01:18.780> most<00:01:18.960> especially<00:01:19.290> his<00:01:19.799> arm<00:01:19.979> goes
