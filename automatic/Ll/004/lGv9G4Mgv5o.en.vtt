I'm you know unbreathing by going in the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.869 
I'm you know unbreathing by going in the
reverse<00:00:53.280> direction<00:00:54.949> but<00:00:55.949> I'm<00:00:56.100> not<00:00:56.250> bothering

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
reverse direction but I'm not bothering

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.340 
reverse direction but I'm not bothering
to<00:00:57.510> remove<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.590> beads<00:00:59.120> that<00:01:00.120> are<00:01:00.350> gathering

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
to remove the beads that are gathering

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.549 
to remove the beads that are gathering
down<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> cluster<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:03.690> that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
down in the cluster can you see that

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.750 
down in the cluster can you see that
there's<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.890> bunch<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.309> beads<00:01:05.580> there<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:07.760> then

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
there's a bunch of beads there and then

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.600 
there's a bunch of beads there and then
when<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:10.229> enough<00:01:12.409> gathered<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.830> then

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
when I do get enough gathered there then

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.140 
when I do get enough gathered there then
I<00:01:15.000> empty<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.049> but<00:01:16.439> using<00:01:17.509> gravity<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:19.409> help

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
I empty it but using gravity to help

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.300 
I empty it but using gravity to help
unload<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.210> strand<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.100> on

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
unload that strand and I just do it on

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.370 
unload that strand and I just do it on
the<00:01:23.340> one<00:01:23.700> that's<00:01:24.509> facing<00:01:25.159> south<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> just

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the one that's facing south so I just

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.330 
the one that's facing south so I just
kind<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.650> tip<00:01:28.970> tip<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.390> remove<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.049> beads<00:01:31.340> and

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
kind of tip tip and remove the beads and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.940 
kind of tip tip and remove the beads and
then<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.390> upward<00:01:33.780> motion<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.650> then

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
then I do the upward motion and then

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.830 
then I do the upward motion and then
when<00:01:35.100> I'm<00:01:35.189> doing<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> downward<00:01:36.060> motion<00:01:36.270> again

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
when I'm doing the downward motion again

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.490 
when I'm doing the downward motion again
I<00:01:37.110> tip<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.310> remove<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.909> beads<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.750> keep

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
I tip it and remove the beads and keep

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.969 
I tip it and remove the beads and keep
going<00:01:43.860> along<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.610> fashion

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.600 

until<00:01:48.979> you're<00:01:49.189> back<00:01:49.399> to<00:01:50.060> having<00:01:51.100> no<00:01:52.100> beads<00:01:53.229> in

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
until you're back to having no beads in

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.999 
until you're back to having no beads in
you<00:01:55.610> know<00:01:55.729> in<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.060> center<00:01:56.539> of<00:01:56.829> the<00:01:57.829> your

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
you know in the center of the your

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:07.450 
you know in the center of the your
cluster

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.450 

see<00:02:08.330> there's<00:02:08.630> just<00:02:08.690> one<00:02:09.080> one<00:02:09.500> cord<00:02:09.890> left<00:02:10.220> that

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
see there's just one one cord left that

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.600 
see there's just one one cord left that
has<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.670> bunch<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.150> beads<00:02:11.360> on<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:13.190> I'll<00:02:13.400> back

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
has a bunch of beads on it so I'll back

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.170 
has a bunch of beads on it so I'll back
those<00:02:13.940> out<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.980> now<00:02:16.400> there's<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:16.970> few

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
those out and now there's just a few

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.900 
those out and now there's just a few
stragglers<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:17.960> you<00:02:18.350> can<00:02:18.620> then<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.670> know<00:02:19.790> if

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
stragglers and you can then you know if

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.850 
stragglers and you can then you know if
you're<00:02:20.060> at<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.330> point<00:02:20.570> where<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:21.740> know

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
you're at the point where you know

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.400 
you're at the point where you know
you've<00:02:22.100> got<00:02:22.430> caught<00:02:22.760> up<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.150> your<00:02:23.330> mistake<00:02:23.780> you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
you've got caught up to your mistake you

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.460 
you've got caught up to your mistake you
could<00:02:24.709> then<00:02:25.040> go<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.890> know<00:02:28.040> do<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.490> normal

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
could then go and you know do the normal

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.160 
could then go and you know do the normal
backing<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.620> out<00:02:30.800> where<00:02:31.130> every<00:02:31.910> turn<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.900> take

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
backing it out where every turn you take

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.570 
backing it out where every turn you take
out<00:02:34.750> your<00:02:35.750> beads<00:02:36.130> but<00:02:37.130> while<00:02:37.340> you're<00:02:37.550> doing

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
out your beads but while you're doing

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.080 
out your beads but while you're doing
that<00:02:37.970> big<00:02:38.420> huge<00:02:38.990> section<00:02:39.860> where<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.940> know

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
that big huge section where you know

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.430 
that big huge section where you know
you're<00:02:41.270> gonna<00:02:41.450> be<00:02:41.570> backing<00:02:42.110> up<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.900> know<00:02:45.050> for

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
you're gonna be backing up you know for

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.400 
you're gonna be backing up you know for
for<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.250> good<00:02:46.580> number<00:02:46.850> of<00:02:47.209> beads<00:02:47.510> it's<00:02:48.200> better

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
for a good number of beads it's better

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.680 
for a good number of beads it's better
just<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.800> let<00:02:48.980> them<00:02:49.070> pile<00:02:49.310> up<00:02:49.580> in<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.300> center

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
just to let them pile up in the center

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.720 
just to let them pile up in the center
and<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.820> then<00:02:53.239> empty<00:02:53.720> em<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:55.130> know<00:02:55.250> empty<00:02:55.459> and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
and and then empty em you know empty and

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.900 
and and then empty em you know empty and
measure<00:02:56.000> go<00:02:56.590> in<00:02:57.590> this<00:02:57.830> particular<00:02:58.220> instance

I'm<00:02:59.120> backing<00:02:59.540> it<00:02:59.660> out<00:02:59.810> because<00:03:03.040> after<00:03:04.040> I

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
I'm backing it out because after I

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
I'm backing it out because after I
started<00:03:04.700> this<00:03:04.970> braid<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.630> woman<00:03:06.020> who<00:03:07.090> wanted

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
the bracelet informed me that she has a

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.050 
the bracelet informed me that she has a
very<00:03:11.300> small<00:03:11.720> wrist<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:12.950> because<00:03:13.489> it's<00:03:13.700> woman

where<00:03:14.390> I<00:03:14.420> have<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:14.900> cluster<00:03:15.230> design<00:03:15.830> in<00:03:16.670> the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
where I have a cluster design in the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.400 
where I have a cluster design in the
center<00:03:17.600> I<00:03:17.840> need<00:03:18.049> to<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:20.480> know<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.690> back<00:03:21.019> it<00:03:21.230> out

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
center I need to you know to back it out

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.220 
center I need to you know to back it out
and<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:23.920> reduce<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.160> number<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.519> beads<00:03:26.230> that

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
and and reduce the number of beads that

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.580 
and and reduce the number of beads that
are<00:03:27.470> in<00:03:27.650> there<00:03:28.450> so<00:03:29.450> again<00:03:29.780> because<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:30.290> still

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
are in there so again because I still

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.560 
are in there so again because I still
have<00:03:30.830> a<00:03:30.860> lot<00:03:31.130> more<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.580> do<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:32.030> get<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.420> end

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
have a lot more to do to get to the end

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.660 
have a lot more to do to get to the end
of<00:03:32.720> this<00:03:32.840> cluster<00:03:33.170> I'm<00:03:34.040> going<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.280> go<00:03:34.400> back<00:03:34.640> to

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
of this cluster I'm going to go back to

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.490 
of this cluster I'm going to go back to
just<00:03:35.709> unbreathing<00:03:37.510> but<00:03:38.510> as<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:38.870> can<00:03:39.019> see<00:03:39.260> I'm

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
just unbreathing but as you can see I'm

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.960 
just unbreathing but as you can see I'm
not<00:03:39.680> bothering<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.519> remove<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:42.470> beads<00:03:42.970> from

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
not bothering to remove the beads from

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.140 
not bothering to remove the beads from
the<00:03:44.360> center<00:03:44.870> until<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:46.310> get<00:03:46.489> a<00:03:46.519> bunch<00:03:46.850> of<00:03:47.000> them

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
the center until it get a bunch of them

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.500 
the center until it get a bunch of them
piled<00:03:47.570> up<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:49.400> anyway<00:03:49.700> if<00:03:49.910> you<00:03:50.060> do<00:03:50.269> find

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
piled up so anyway if you do find

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.750 
piled up so anyway if you do find
yourself<00:03:50.690> in<00:03:51.170> this<00:03:51.380> predicament<00:03:51.950> where<00:03:52.549> you

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
yourself in this predicament where you

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.630 
yourself in this predicament where you
need<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:54.489> unbraid<00:03:55.489> something<00:03:57.579> try<00:03:58.579> this

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
need to unbraid something try this

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.720 
need to unbraid something try this
method<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.450> see<00:03:59.660> if<00:03:59.780> you<00:03:59.900> like<00:04:00.049> it<00:04:00.110> um<00:04:00.799> like<00:04:01.640> I

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
method and see if you like it um like I

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.250 
method and see if you like it um like I
said<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:02.090> beads<00:04:02.269> aren't<00:04:02.480> gonna<00:04:02.570> go<00:04:02.780> anywhere

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
said the beads aren't gonna go anywhere

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.380 
said the beads aren't gonna go anywhere
because<00:04:03.650> there's<00:04:04.459> really<00:04:04.640> no<00:04:04.820> place<00:04:05.030> for<00:04:05.239> them

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
because there's really no place for them

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.500 
because there's really no place for them
to<00:04:05.420> go<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:07.220> why<00:04:07.370> not<00:04:07.549> let<00:04:07.760> them<00:04:07.880> accumulate

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
to go so why not let them accumulate

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.229 
to go so why not let them accumulate
until<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:09.019> get<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.230> few<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.739> them<00:04:09.860> there<00:04:10.130> and<00:04:10.489> it

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
until you get a few of them there and it

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.000 
until you get a few of them there and it
just<00:04:11.480> kind<00:04:11.750> of<00:04:11.930> will<00:04:12.500> speed<00:04:12.980> up<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:14.480> process

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
just kind of will speed up the process

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.250 
just kind of will speed up the process
and<00:04:16.370> you<00:04:17.150> know<00:04:17.269> when<00:04:17.419> you<00:04:17.510> get<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.870> point

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
and you know when you get to a point

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.370 
and you know when you get to a point
where<00:04:18.609> there's<00:04:19.609> too<00:04:19.910> many<00:04:20.090> of<00:04:20.389> them<00:04:20.600> piling<00:04:21.260> up

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
where there's too many of them piling up

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.409 
where there's too many of them piling up
there<00:04:21.650> in<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:21.889> center<00:04:22.280> then<00:04:22.760> kind<00:04:23.150> of<00:04:23.270> reach

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
there in the center then kind of reach

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.140 
there in the center then kind of reach
in<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:24.680> grab<00:04:25.550> your<00:04:25.790> beads<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.330> pull<00:04:26.540> them<00:04:26.690> out

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
in and grab your beads and pull them out

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.400 
in and grab your beads and pull them out
and<00:04:29.169> it<00:04:30.220> just<00:04:31.220> kind<00:04:31.430> of<00:04:31.810> saves<00:04:32.810> you<00:04:33.080> a<00:04:33.139> bit<00:04:33.380> of

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
and it just kind of saves you a bit of

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.500 
and it just kind of saves you a bit of
time<00:04:34.990> so<00:04:35.990> that's<00:04:36.410> it<00:04:36.590> for<00:04:36.770> now<00:04:37.510> hopefully

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
time so that's it for now hopefully

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.320 
time so that's it for now hopefully
you'll<00:04:39.050> find<00:04:39.320> this<00:04:39.530> method<00:04:40.460> helpful<00:04:41.150> when

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
you'll find this method helpful when

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.100 
you'll find this method helpful when
you're<00:04:41.510> in<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.110> need<00:04:42.320> of<00:04:42.350> having<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.810> back<00:04:44.810> out

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
you're in the need of having to back out

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.790 
you're in the need of having to back out
which<00:04:45.620> is<00:04:45.830> a<00:04:45.860> pain<00:04:46.520> in<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.699> neck<00:04:46.790> but<00:04:47.270> you<00:04:47.800> know

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
which is a pain in the neck but you know

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.550 
which is a pain in the neck but you know
we<00:04:49.070> all<00:04:49.310> have<00:04:49.789> had<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.180> do<00:04:50.360> it<00:04:50.510> at<00:04:50.690> one<00:04:50.960> point<00:04:51.260> or

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
we all have had to do it at one point or

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.129 
we all have had to do it at one point or
another<00:04:51.800> so<00:04:52.720> that's<00:04:53.720> it

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
another so that's it

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.430 
another so that's it
