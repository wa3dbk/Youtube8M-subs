00:05:52.700 --> 00:06:00.760
 dirty for a dirty job nothing short 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:07.130
 dirtier than turbid water steel 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:11.050
 forged in blood and look at the 14 c 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:15.320
 never dangles a dagger in the hand a 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:18.650
 multi-purpose device a good captain does not 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.910
 has not a blind spot I have all the 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.960
 covered angles 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:29.190
 killing is the only way to survive the 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:31.860
 blood calls the blood sometimes you 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:36.330
 you have to soak your hands with blood 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:39.570

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:43.440
 workshop in my name in your bones this 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:46.890
 edges and who knows how to bite my heart is of 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:50.220
 steel the abyss chokes with its 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:54.840
 corpses you have not seen enough 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:58.530
 blood break the bones throw the 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:02.640
 to sharks in turbid waters to this 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:07.020
 it is called piety, I will keep my name 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:12.030
 your skulls straight to the bone as it should 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:16.380
 be but corpses ready to fall me 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:19.980
 I will take my time with them your tears 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:22.139
 they will make the saltiest ocean they eat 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:25.430
 your own fingers 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:28.610
 Even the dead will tell my legend 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:34.169
 paint the springs with their blood 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:38.490
 pistols and sabers not mourn I do not care 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:42.240
 they will not be served by a single cut of 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:47.360
 ear to ear do not know what is the 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.360
 pain to remove the kidneys
