00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.930 
yeah I think we consciously right for
the<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.380> complete<00:01:21.619> audience<00:01:22.039> there<00:01:22.640> are<00:01:22.729> as

the the complete audience there are as

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.090 
the the complete audience there are as
many<00:01:22.970> themes<00:01:23.600> in<00:01:23.840> there<00:01:23.990> for<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.259> adults<00:01:24.619> as

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
many themes in there for the adults as

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.020 
many themes in there for the adults as
we<00:01:25.280> know<00:01:25.399> that<00:01:25.550> they're<00:01:25.640> gonna<00:01:25.700> be<00:01:25.820> bringing

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
we know that they're gonna be bringing

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.090 
we know that they're gonna be bringing
their<00:01:26.330> kids<00:01:26.450> as<00:01:26.750> there<00:01:27.259> are<00:01:27.380> for<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.619> kids<00:01:27.770> so

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
I think anytime that the the film starts

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.680 
I think anytime that the the film starts
to<00:01:31.280> get<00:01:31.430> a<00:01:31.460> little<00:01:31.520> romantic<00:01:32.270> or<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.450> little

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
to get a little romantic or a little

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.840 
to get a little romantic or a little
more<00:01:32.840> mature<00:01:33.289> and<00:01:33.440> it's<00:01:33.560> themed<00:01:33.830> we<00:01:34.250> try<00:01:34.789> to
