00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.480
 that's it how are you then 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.869
 new at the beginning of the season 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.320
 not much the champions league 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.809
 championship 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.950
 yeah so good to talk a little bit 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.210
 of football and the month of September it is 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.960
 traditionally known for the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.239
 Back to School 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.320
 so there no it happened at school 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.210
 it's just a pleasure I'm going 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.020
 a few sessions even in terminal s ah 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.800
 yeah so decisive year for 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.230
 work you come to conjugate 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.820
 school and then football at the same time 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.500
 it's not too exhausting yeah six 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.609
 episodes as beyond a certain age 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.870
 in champions league the next day she 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.199
 had course at 8 o'clock it was not 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.960
 easy 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.360
 okay so you 're talking about 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.590
 all the time we will come and this beginning of 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.420
 season was not too bad until 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.640
 weekend you lost 3 0 so is this 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.119
 that you can make a brief one 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.020
 brief summary of this beginning of the season 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.880
 overall it's true that was 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.549
 well after maybe so due to fatigue 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.220
 we had a little let go of the foot in front of 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.540
 lens and also launches this deposit so 3-0 I 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.390
 do not think it was deserved one too 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.680
 big defeat but good the dif went 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.509
 there you are still at the top of 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.280
 chart so again the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.800
 ambitions remain titles of 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.150
 it does not say on how do you kill 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.940
 and you find the motivation for 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.229
 precisely stay focused and the fact of 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.220
 play the top of the board every 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.760
 seasons for did you draw 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.350
 your motivation still frozen phase 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.000
 final it's always a pleasure to 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.479
 be part of the group for the phases 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.220
 finals and play at other clubs too 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.360
 okay and the league of champions it's 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.000
 brand new this season 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.500
 this trip to olympiakos so at 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.909
 worse and how did it go 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.070
 a good little draw we can say 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.509
 yeah draw I think we deserved 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.399
 better we could have done it and then 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.780
 here is a good experience with two 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.209
 champions we left two days is 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.160
 true that it happened quickly but also 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.310
 ok football 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.330
 school so recreation is to fifa 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.910
 out is what you also have a 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.340
 bitten of consoles like everything and pose 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.570
 it is that it's a game you 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.680
 plays often it's as much as my 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.680
 I played a little French 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.720
 so there are players you know 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.860
 in who are your teammates 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.150
 habitually 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.310
 what does it look like to see 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.739
 on it and does it give you too 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.209
 envious one day then your world from below 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.530
 yes that's sure it makes you want to see 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.209
 people we played with 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.959
 knows well and it makes you want to be 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.700
 to be like them and to be in the game 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.100
 we are going on a sidewalk that leads the 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.810
 training center to camp 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.940
 training that was attended by 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.160
 lots of no players who are 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.370
 become great players like chantom 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.260
 sakho anelka benachour or other for 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.100
 more nostalgic 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.709
 what does it mean to take this 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.049
 pavement every day what is it to 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.880
 what do we think when we go 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.250
 now it's been three years since Gilad 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.510
 we usually good but it's nice 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.380
 to say that there are so many big 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.380
 players who have been there 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.810
 okay what is the program there for 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.010
 this week this weekend 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.010
 this weekend there is match in avranches 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.420
 match at camp lodges tomorrow 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.270
 what is a workout the 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.980
 eve of the competition we work on 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:46.269
 is working on setting up and 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:47.709
 speed ok so we will wish you good 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.200
 training but just before getting 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.390
 to leave there to impose the famous 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.120
 question that kills you are the player who has 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.580
 the most afraid of the ball on the weekend 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.019
 Wednesday so against olympiakos especially 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.600
 the first round of the league 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.019
 champions 1-1 on that caused the 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.340
 more faults the show faults 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.670
 how do you explain that you 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.900
 usually a rather poor game is 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.790
 the coach who made me notice to 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.040
 the training fun but hey it's 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.540
 a little my post a man indeed 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.040
 I believe some football after being 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:24.070
 that it was unnecessary mistakes was 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:25.900
 some good wishes a good 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.039
 training and then thank you for having passed 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.039
