00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
Moon scrapbooking and so it was just a

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.370 
Moon scrapbooking and so it was just a
very<00:05:54.560> plain<00:05:55.400> gold<00:05:55.820> piece<00:05:56.180> of<00:05:56.389> cardstock<00:05:57.110> that

this<00:06:11.539> one's<00:06:11.810> autumn<00:06:12.380> night<00:06:12.620> a<00:06:12.889> pomegranate

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.550 

and<00:06:18.830> this<00:06:19.789> one<00:06:20.090> I<00:06:20.120> think<00:06:20.300> is<00:06:20.720> it's<00:06:21.080> not<00:06:21.319> one<00:06:21.530> of

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
and this one I think is it's not one of

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:31.540 
and this one I think is it's not one of
the<00:06:21.710> new<00:06:21.830> colors<00:06:22.190> it's<00:06:22.430> frozen<00:06:22.729> lake<00:06:30.550> so

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
the new colors it's frozen lake so

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.189 
the new colors it's frozen lake so
anyway<00:06:32.240> I<00:06:32.270> thought<00:06:32.539> they<00:06:32.690> came<00:06:32.900> out<00:06:33.050> pretty

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 
anyway I thought they came out pretty

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:37.510 
anyway I thought they came out pretty
good<00:06:33.349> but<00:06:33.710> i'm<00:06:33.860> curious<00:06:34.190> now<00:06:34.460> to<00:06:34.699> see<00:06:36.250> what<00:06:37.250> the

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
good but i'm curious now to see what the

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.990 
good but i'm curious now to see what the
actual<00:06:38.180> border<00:06:39.169> die<00:06:39.349> does<00:06:39.710> too<00:06:40.160> or<00:06:40.490> the<00:06:40.699> flower

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
actual border die does too or the flower

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.700 
actual border die does too or the flower
die<00:06:41.300> does<00:06:41.860> to<00:06:42.860> make<00:06:42.979> it<00:06:43.160> easier<00:06:43.520> or<00:06:43.610> not<00:06:43.940> easier

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
die does to make it easier or not easier

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.379 
die does to make it easier or not easier
to<00:06:45.710> make<00:06:45.889> these<00:06:46.069> flowers<00:06:46.520> and<00:06:46.849> I<00:06:46.940> backed<00:06:47.210> it
