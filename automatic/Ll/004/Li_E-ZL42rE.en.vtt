3d<00:00:46.170> printing<00:00:46.470> is<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.710> guess<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.760> if<00:00:48.030> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
3d printing is I guess if you if you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.670 
3d printing is I guess if you if you
want<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> call<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.540> a<00:00:48.660> revolution<00:00:49.140> we've<00:00:49.470> said

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
want to call it a revolution we've said

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.830 
want to call it a revolution we've said
many<00:00:49.890> people<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.399> setting<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.910> revolution

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
many people of setting is the revolution

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.420 
many people of setting is the revolution
of<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.960> digital<00:00:52.410> age<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.980> new<00:00:53.250> way<00:00:53.400> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
of the digital age it is a new way of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.990 
of the digital age it is a new way of
making<00:00:53.989> products<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.320> who<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> revolution

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
making products and who is a revolution

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.460 
making products and who is a revolution
to<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.210> think<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> revolution<00:00:58.290> to

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
to I think it is a revolution to

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.590 
to I think it is a revolution to
manufacturing<00:00:59.280> companies<00:00:59.790> people<00:01:00.300> who<00:01:00.390> make

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
manufacturing companies people who make

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.810 
manufacturing companies people who make
products<00:01:01.080> traditionally<00:01:01.589> make<00:01:01.769> products<00:01:02.190> but

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
products traditionally make products but

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:12.420 
products traditionally make products but
it<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.059> also<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.330> revolution<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:03.989> consumer

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:29.890 

you

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.600 

so<00:01:30.900> traditionally<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.860> I'm<00:01:32.070> involved<00:01:32.400> in

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
so traditionally if I'm involved in

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.730 
so traditionally if I'm involved in
manufacturing<00:01:32.760> I<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.870> must<00:01:34.320> consider<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
manufacturing I I must consider the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.290 
manufacturing I I must consider the
investments<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.460> must<00:01:35.670> make<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.120> must

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
investments that I must make and I must

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.150 
investments that I must make and I must
make<00:01:36.420> tooling<00:01:36.930> many<00:01:37.620> things<00:01:37.830> are<00:01:37.950> made<00:01:38.070> in

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
make tooling many things are made in

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.970 
make tooling many things are made in
China<00:01:38.460> because<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.910> is<00:01:39.060> cheaper<00:01:39.860> well<00:01:40.860> this

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
China because it is cheaper well this

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.110 
China because it is cheaper well this
technology<00:01:41.460> allows<00:01:41.490> me<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.970> think

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
technology allows me to think

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.490 
technology allows me to think
differently<00:01:42.510> about<00:01:42.600> where<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> make<00:01:43.470> my

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
differently about where I make my

00:01:43.500 --> 00:02:01.560 
differently about where I make my
products<00:01:44.010> and<00:01:44.130> how<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> make<00:01:44.610> my<00:01:44.820> products

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.300 

if<00:02:02.570> I'm<00:02:02.780> at<00:02:02.960> home<00:02:03.079> maybe<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:03.979> want<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.219> make

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
if I'm at home maybe I want to make

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.490 
if I'm at home maybe I want to make
things<00:02:04.460> at<00:02:04.640> home<00:02:04.789> it's<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.719> revolution<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.320> me<00:02:06.469> I

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
things at home it's a revolution to me I

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.589 
things at home it's a revolution to me I
don't<00:02:06.799> have<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:06.979> go<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.280> shop<00:02:07.549> maybe<00:02:08.330> I<00:02:08.420> can

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
don't have to go to the shop maybe I can

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.199 
don't have to go to the shop maybe I can
print<00:02:08.780> things<00:02:08.959> in<00:02:09.170> my<00:02:09.319> own<00:02:09.470> my<00:02:10.009> own<00:02:10.039> house<00:02:10.310> so<00:02:10.849> I

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
print things in my own my own house so I

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.430 
print things in my own my own house so I
think<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.630> is<00:02:11.810> what<00:02:11.930> makes<00:02:12.050> this<00:02:12.230> a

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
think that is what makes this a

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:26.980 
think that is what makes this a
revolutionary<00:02:13.340> technology

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.050
