strong link to get full chemistry which
is<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> problem<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.070> pays<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:54.329> good

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
is a problem and it pays a really good

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.780 
is a problem and it pays a really good
right<00:01:54.810> mid<00:01:55.049> if<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.920> was<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> bit<00:01:56.189> taller<00:01:56.430> maybe

off<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.620> think<00:03:20.190> he's<00:03:20.400> got<00:03:20.609> like<00:03:20.900> 79<00:03:21.900> strength<00:03:22.470> so

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
off I think he's got like 79 strength so

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.610 
off I think he's got like 79 strength so
genuinely<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.849> really<00:03:24.030> really<00:03:24.780> good<00:03:25.079> card<00:03:25.349> and

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
genuinely a really really good card and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.819 
genuinely a really really good card and
I<00:03:25.680> wanted<00:03:26.129> to<00:03:26.639> partner<00:03:27.000> him<00:03:27.209> up<00:03:27.359> with<00:03:27.989> lacina

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
and he's an absolute machine he is so so

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.809 
and he's an absolute machine he is so so
good<00:03:34.349> probably<00:03:35.010> one<00:03:35.159> of<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.310> best<00:03:35.519> things

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
good probably one of the best things

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.969 
good probably one of the best things
about<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.239> weirdly<00:03:36.629> it<00:03:37.379> actually<00:03:37.799> has

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:37.979 
about and weirdly it actually has

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.069 
about and weirdly it actually has
finessed<00:03:38.430> sure<00:03:38.699> like<00:03:38.879> it's<00:03:39.150> it's<00:03:39.599> pretty

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
finessed sure like it's it's pretty

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.390 
finessed sure like it's it's pretty
accurate<00:03:40.260> it's<00:03:40.620> really<00:03:40.859> really<00:03:41.069> good<00:03:41.099> so

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
accurate it's really really good so

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.460 
accurate it's really really good so
that's<00:03:42.000> why<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.269> wanted<00:03:42.659> to<00:03:42.720> have<00:03:42.930> this

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
that's why I wanted to have this

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.259 
that's why I wanted to have this
formation<00:03:43.859> again<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:44.669> i<00:03:44.699> could<00:03:44.909> use<00:03:45.090> two

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
formation again so i could use two

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.969 
formation again so i could use two
strikers<00:03:45.540> up<00:03:45.780> front<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.680> gives<00:03:46.829> its

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:46.979 
strikers up front and it gives its

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:48.589 
strikers up front and it gives its
little<00:03:47.220> combination<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:47.790> you've<00:03:48.209> got<00:03:48.239> the

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
little combination so you've got the

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.710 
little combination so you've got the
extreme<00:03:49.199> pace<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.739> zambia<00:03:50.159> but<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:51.030> insane
