the elements of that you get a
drawstring

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.590 

and<00:05:13.160> they're<00:05:14.110> so<00:05:15.190> compared<00:05:16.190> against<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:16.759> the

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
and they're so compared against the the

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.680 
and they're so compared against the the
other<00:05:17.750> gaming<00:05:17.990> bag<00:05:18.410> you<00:05:19.310> know<00:05:19.430> that's<00:05:19.850> that's

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
I know that would be a medium size as

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.510 
I know that would be a medium size as
suppose<00:05:23.750> there<00:05:24.020> are<00:05:24.050> you<00:05:24.440> get<00:05:24.650> bigger<00:05:24.979> game

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
suppose there are you get bigger game

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.400 
suppose there are you get bigger game
bags<00:05:25.850> so<00:05:26.750> compared<00:05:27.380> to<00:05:27.470> that<00:05:28.120> you<00:05:29.120> know<00:05:29.410> the
