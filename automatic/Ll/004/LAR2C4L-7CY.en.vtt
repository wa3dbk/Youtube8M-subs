00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.870
 i 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.550
 welcome to one more of my videos 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.559
 instructional in case you do not know them 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.620
 You do not know I'm choosing this video 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.820
 is basically focused for some 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.920
 people who have asked me about 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.350
 how to have independence or that some 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.020
 advice on the battery I give you this 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.250
 council do not need to know how to read 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.380
 They need to know a lot about music 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.820
 just that exactly what I want 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.980
 achieve is that with something that we have 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.170
 every day we can practice the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.910
 battery to a level beyond that 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.350
 we were practicing normally the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.449
 independence that I will explain the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.289
 today is simply focused on 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:43.469
 issues of basic rhythmic patterns 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:46.530
 that is to say usable almost in any 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.749
 popular song that you can 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.370
 found on the radio or on TV the 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:54.210
 exercise involves touching 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.060
 carola in two and four that is 1 2 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.030
 3 4 1 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.400
 that would be the first step second step 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.240
 they should be able to touch any pattern already 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:14.510
 be on the hyatt they might touch 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:16.340
 eighth notes 6 black 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.500
 what you want from the bosses 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.470
 that you and the interesting part is 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.470
 that with the right foot that is the hype if 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.870
 You are left-handed, because left is touching the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.210
 melodies of the songs that you want 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.120
 which you can think of in which they you 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.360
 want but I'm focused on doing 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:39.730
 songs of certain popular form and 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.730
 basic below some examples 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.760
 just like him 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.850
 there is no way to change the government of 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.850
 our country 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.390
 ah 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.110
 yes 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.099
 Y 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.410
 yes 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.560
 they can also touch the raid with their hands 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:44.390
 right and bring the tempo with a hi hat 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.390
 to black rooms 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.530
 do not 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.940
 remember the goal is to touch the 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.639
 melody as such in the drum do not touch 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.889
 nothing of the rhythm you simply make your base 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:14.030
 with one makes clear how it has been 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:16.190
 explained the dgt and the hype that if one 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.500
 is aware of the melody all the 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.330
 time one is opening more ears 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.490
 and when interacting with 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.270
 musicians or with the language of the piece 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.949
 song are going to be much better 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.020
 they will be able to integrate better into that 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:33.050
 language to be aware of that 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.389
 language and when they make fils they are going to touch 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.520
 to doc say they will play in a way 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.430
 congruent the fact of making films 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.949
 basic or quiet does not represent that 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.810
 you are bad drummers do not have 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.529
 all the time you play 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.929
 many notes in one order 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.549
 Well, to have more musical awareness 

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:54.849
 more than what is happening around 

00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:57.039
 we part of awakening that 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:59.429
 conscience is doing a little bit of 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.429
 those exercises 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:13.780
 are based on the books of esther and 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.780
 I liked to share it 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.060
 Y 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.440
