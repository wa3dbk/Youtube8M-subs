00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
probably the toughest one because it's

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.910 
probably the toughest one because it's
the<00:00:39.239> longest<00:00:39.480> jump<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.320> what<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.649> think<00:00:40.860> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.010 
the longest jump and what I think you
got<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.550> either<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:42.030> your<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.899> know

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
got to do is either do your you know

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.540 
got to do is either do your you know
you're<00:00:43.230> running<00:00:43.590> slide<00:00:43.920> people<00:00:44.280> were<00:00:44.370> saying

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.720 
you're running slide people were saying
running<00:00:44.879> slide<00:00:45.210> jump<00:00:45.989> boots<00:00:46.320> jump<00:00:46.710> boost<00:00:47.010> but

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
running slide jump boots jump boost but

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.420 
running slide jump boots jump boost but
you<00:00:48.510> know<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.840> some<00:00:49.050> form<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.920> think<00:00:50.039> I

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
you know it's some form of I think I

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.000 
you know it's some form of I think I
don't<00:00:50.670> even<00:00:50.760> think<00:00:50.879> hyper<00:00:51.320> actually<00:00:52.320> slid<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
don't even think hyper actually slid to

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.369 
don't even think hyper actually slid to
finish<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.730> think<00:00:54.030> he<00:00:54.149> did<00:00:54.300> his<00:00:54.449> double<00:00:55.079> jump

finish it I think he did his double jump
and<00:00:55.739> possibly<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.340> double<00:00:56.670> boost<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.090> he

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
and possibly a double boost and he

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.700

hasn't<00:01:49.350> been<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.770> very<00:01:49.799> well<00:01:50.040> there's<00:01:50.399> a

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
hasn't been going very well there's a

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.010 
hasn't been going very well there's a
lot<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.700> leg<00:01:50.970> i'm<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:51.329> sure<00:01:51.390> how<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.780> vaad

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
lot of leg i'm not sure how the vaad

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.520 
lot of leg i'm not sure how the vaad
looks<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.799> today's

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
looks for today's

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.700 
looks for today's
live<00:01:54.250> stream<00:01:54.670> but<00:01:54.970> regardless<00:01:55.630> there<00:01:56.260> if<00:01:56.500> you

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
live stream but regardless there if you

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.469 
live stream but regardless there if you
would<00:01:56.830> like<00:01:57.040> it<00:01:57.070> or<00:01:57.369> you<00:01:57.490> can<00:01:57.610> wait<00:01:57.760> probably

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
would like it or you can wait probably

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.450 
would like it or you can wait probably
until<00:01:58.570> tomorrow<00:01:59.080> and<00:01:59.560> I'll<00:01:59.799> have<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.190> lot<00:02:00.430> of

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
until tomorrow and I'll have a lot of

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.520 
until tomorrow and I'll have a lot of
the<00:02:00.610> other<00:02:00.729> stuff<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.299> even<00:02:01.479> tonight<00:02:01.900> alright

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
the other stuff and even tonight alright

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.920 
the other stuff and even tonight alright
so<00:02:02.710> we<00:02:02.830> have<00:02:02.979> this<00:02:03.400> challenge<00:02:03.940> you've<00:02:04.540> got<00:02:04.780> to

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
so we have this challenge you've got to

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.100 
so we have this challenge you've got to
jump<00:02:05.170> up<00:02:05.380> now<00:02:06.070> those<00:02:06.729> three<00:02:07.180> small<00:02:07.509> platforms

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
jump up now those three small platforms

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.540 
jump up now those three small platforms
are<00:02:08.259> located<00:02:08.679> directly<00:02:08.890> on<00:02:09.069> top<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.459> each

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
are located directly on top of each

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.190 
are located directly on top of each
other<00:02:09.759> so<00:02:09.910> you<00:02:10.509> know<00:02:10.630> you<00:02:10.690> kind<00:02:10.959> of<00:02:11.020> have<00:02:11.170> to

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
other so you know you kind of have to

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.070 
other so you know you kind of have to
move<00:02:11.830> back<00:02:12.130> jump<00:02:12.850> in<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.239> kind<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.600> boost<00:02:13.810> back

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
move back jump in and kind of boost back

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.680 
move back jump in and kind of boost back
a<00:02:14.110> little<00:02:14.440> bit<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.770> then<00:02:15.250> boost<00:02:15.580> forward<00:02:16.090> okay

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
a little bit and then boost forward okay

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.270 
a little bit and then boost forward okay
so<00:02:17.260> yeah<00:02:17.709> like<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.730> said<00:02:18.760> not<00:02:19.660> for<00:02:19.690> me<00:02:20.280> what

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
so yeah like I said not for me what

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.760 
so yeah like I said not for me what
hyper<00:02:21.550> do<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.239> I<00:02:23.020> mean<00:02:23.319> he<00:02:23.440> had<00:02:23.530> some

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
hyper do it and I mean he had some

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.680 
hyper do it and I mean he had some
trouble<00:02:24.100> with<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.250> few<00:02:24.489> of<00:02:24.580> them<00:02:24.700> but<00:02:24.910> he<00:02:25.570> was

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
trouble with a few of them but he was

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.110 
trouble with a few of them but he was
glad<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.110> get<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:27.070> long<00:02:27.340> jump<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.940> we

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
glad to get that that long jump and we

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.030 
glad to get that that long jump and we
actually<00:02:28.450> have<00:02:28.600> another<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.380> another<00:02:29.860> one

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
actually have another is another one

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.410 
actually have another is another one
that<00:02:30.070> comes<00:02:30.310> up<00:02:30.489> with<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.640> long<00:02:30.850> jump<00:02:31.120> but<00:02:31.300> it's

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
that comes up with a long jump but it's

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.509 
that comes up with a long jump but it's
even<00:02:31.540> more<00:02:31.690> difficult<00:02:32.019> because<00:02:32.950> there<00:02:33.310> are

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
even more difficult because there are

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.670 
even more difficult because there are
two<00:02:33.760> parallel<00:02:34.360> platforms<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:35.290> have<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.470> jump

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
two parallel platforms you have to jump

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.470 
two parallel platforms you have to jump
through<00:02:35.769> right<00:02:36.130> here<00:02:36.160> actually<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.300> it

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
through right here actually this is it

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.470 
through right here actually this is it
so<00:02:38.410> this<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.160> almost<00:02:39.310> identical<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.269> long

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
so this is almost identical to the long

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.809 
so this is almost identical to the long
jump<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.959> we<00:02:41.080> had<00:02:41.230> before<00:02:41.380> only<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.340> have<00:02:42.550> to

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
jump that we had before only you have to

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.080 
jump that we had before only you have to
aim<00:02:43.720> perfectly<00:02:44.530> in<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.040> middle<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.489> those<00:02:46.030> two

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
aim perfectly in the middle of those two

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.330 
aim perfectly in the middle of those two
vertical<00:02:46.840> platforms<00:02:47.350> if<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.620> hit<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:48.040> side

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
vertical platforms if you hit the side

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.580 
vertical platforms if you hit the side
it<00:02:48.880> slows<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.360> down<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.230> won't<00:02:50.410> be<00:02:50.470> able

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
it slows you down and you won't be able

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.559 
it slows you down and you won't be able
to<00:02:50.739> do<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.190> you<00:02:51.220> have<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.730> hit<00:02:51.880> perfectly<00:02:52.209> in

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
to do it so you have to hit perfectly in

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.540 
to do it so you have to hit perfectly in
the<00:02:52.810> middle<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.470> do<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.800> here's<00:02:54.100> where<00:02:54.340> hyper

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
the middle to do it here's where hyper

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.120 
the middle to do it here's where hyper
actually<00:02:55.060> does<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.660> he<00:02:56.380> makes<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.769> jump

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
actually does it and he makes the jump

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.819 
actually does it and he makes the jump
right<00:02:57.519> here<00:02:57.970> now<00:02:58.390> this<00:02:58.630> is<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:59.470> know<00:02:59.560> across

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
right here now this is a you know across

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.400 
right here now this is a you know across
a<00:03:00.370> couple<00:03:00.549> of<00:03:00.790> rounds<00:03:01.120> at<00:03:01.239> least<00:03:01.480> here<00:03:01.870> because

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
a couple of rounds at least here because

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.600 
a couple of rounds at least here because
we<00:03:02.530> didn't<00:03:02.739> have<00:03:02.829> enough<00:03:02.890> time<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.370> can't

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
we didn't have enough time you can't

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.000 
we didn't have enough time you can't
keep<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.910> crawler<00:03:04.180> on<00:03:04.480> this<00:03:04.989> map<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:05.709> one's

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
keep a crawler on this map this one's

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.130 
keep a crawler on this map this one's
not<00:03:06.220> too<00:03:06.280> bad<00:03:06.640> I<00:03:06.880> mean<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.900> know<00:03:07.989> the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
not too bad I mean you know the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.069 
not too bad I mean you know the
platforms<00:03:08.680> are<00:03:08.799> vertical<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:09.910> have<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.600> lot

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
platforms are vertical so you have a lot

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.890 
platforms are vertical so you have a lot
less<00:03:11.290> space<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:12.400> know<00:03:12.459> jump<00:03:12.790> on<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.209> but

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
less space to you know jump on to but

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.990 
less space to you know jump on to but
you<00:03:14.590> know<00:03:14.620> it's<00:03:14.920> it's<00:03:15.130> not<00:03:15.370> really<00:03:15.670> you<00:03:15.850> don't

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
you know it's it's not really you don't

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.270 
you know it's it's not really you don't
have<00:03:16.060> distance<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.200> travel<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:18.100> don't

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
have distance to travel and you don't

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.370 
have distance to travel and you don't
really<00:03:18.430> have<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.700> go<00:03:19.000> around<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.750> platforms

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
really have to go around the platforms

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.319 
really have to go around the platforms
using<00:03:20.799> your<00:03:21.010> your<00:03:21.459> double<00:03:21.760> jump<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.209> you're

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
using your your double jump and you're

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.000 
using your your double jump and you're
boosting<00:03:22.510> around<00:03:22.989> platforms<00:03:23.590> so<00:03:23.709> that<00:03:23.739> one

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
boosting around platforms so that one

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.190 
boosting around platforms so that one
looked<00:03:24.220> kind<00:03:24.640> of<00:03:24.760> easy<00:03:24.970> as<00:03:25.329> long<00:03:25.810> as<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.019> just

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
looked kind of easy as long as you just

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.890 
looked kind of easy as long as you just
sort<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.500> state<00:03:26.769> aligned<00:03:27.310> with<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.390> those

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
sort of state aligned with the those

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.970 
sort of state aligned with the those
platforms<00:03:29.200> okay<00:03:29.799> so<00:03:30.609> we<00:03:30.940> have<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.859> next<00:03:32.859> trip

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
platforms okay so we have the next trip

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.370 
platforms okay so we have the next trip
this<00:03:33.130> is<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.459> last<00:03:33.640> one<00:03:33.940> this<00:03:34.840> one<00:03:35.140> is<00:03:35.170> a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
this is the last one this one is a

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.080 
this is the last one this one is a
little<00:03:35.650> bit<00:03:35.739> more<00:03:35.859> difficult<00:03:36.040> because<00:03:36.790> it's

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
little bit more difficult because it's

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.670 
little bit more difficult because it's
got<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.269> larger<00:03:37.660> platform<00:03:37.840> above<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.560> you

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
got a larger platform above and you

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.610 
got a larger platform above and you
really<00:03:39.100> have<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.549> boost<00:03:39.870> like<00:03:40.870> outside<00:03:41.380> the

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
really have to boost like outside the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.920 
really have to boost like outside the
soon<00:03:41.799> as<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:41.980> know<00:03:42.730> you<00:03:42.790> come<00:03:43.090> off<00:03:43.269> that<00:03:43.299> small

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
soon as you know you come off that small

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.199 
soon as you know you come off that small
one<00:03:44.140> you<00:03:44.590> kind<00:03:44.799> of<00:03:44.829> have<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.040> boost<00:03:45.459> outside

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
one you kind of have to boost outside

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.840 
one you kind of have to boost outside
and<00:03:46.450> then<00:03:46.570> boost<00:03:46.810> back<00:03:47.109> to<00:03:47.799> get<00:03:48.250> onto<00:03:48.700> the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
and then boost back to get onto the

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.960 
and then boost back to get onto the
ledge<00:03:49.060> above<00:03:49.359> and<00:03:49.900> there's<00:03:50.079> another<00:03:50.440> one<00:03:50.970> even

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
ledge above and there's another one even

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.699 
ledge above and there's another one even
a<00:03:52.090> little<00:03:52.390> bit<00:03:52.480> higher<00:03:52.810> up<00:03:53.109> that<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:53.380> have<00:03:53.560> to

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
a little bit higher up that you have to

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.069 
a little bit higher up that you have to
do<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.310> like<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:54.850> said<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:55.060> do<00:03:55.180> apologize<00:03:55.810> for

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
do and like I said I do apologize for

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.590 
do and like I said I do apologize for
not<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:56.859> know<00:03:56.980> not<00:03:57.010> doing<00:03:57.459> this<00:03:57.609> myself<00:03:58.030> and

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
not you know not doing this myself and

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.330 
not you know not doing this myself and
showing<00:03:58.870> you<00:03:58.989> in<00:03:59.170> you<00:03:59.530> know<00:03:59.650> first<00:03:59.950> person

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
showing you in you know first person

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.809 
showing you in you know first person
doing<00:04:00.489> this

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
doing this

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.020 
doing this
but<00:04:00.969> you<00:04:01.749> probably<00:04:01.959> get<00:04:02.170> maybe<00:04:02.890> a<00:04:03.010> better<00:04:03.549> view

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
but you probably get maybe a better view

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.809 
but you probably get maybe a better view
just<00:04:04.989> spectating<00:04:05.709> hyper<00:04:06.040> he's<00:04:06.340> much<00:04:06.639> better

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
just spectating hyper he's much better

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.390 
just spectating hyper he's much better
at<00:04:06.969> cork<00:04:07.329> hardcore<00:04:07.840> than<00:04:07.989> I<00:04:08.109> am<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:08.590> let<00:04:09.069> him<00:04:09.219> do

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
at cork hardcore than I am so let him do

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.539 
at cork hardcore than I am so let him do
it<00:04:09.430> so<00:04:09.939> yeah<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.150> can<00:04:10.359> see<00:04:10.569> that<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:11.549> top

it so yeah you can see that the top

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.940 
it so yeah you can see that the top
platform<00:04:12.939> which<00:04:13.840> looks<00:04:14.139> a<00:04:14.290> lot<00:04:14.409> bigger<00:04:14.620> than

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
platform which looks a lot bigger than

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.539 
platform which looks a lot bigger than
even<00:04:15.370> that<00:04:15.700> middle<00:04:16.180> platform<00:04:16.419> so<00:04:17.320> yeah<00:04:18.250> kind

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549

even that middle platform so yeah kind
of<00:04:18.579> a<00:04:18.669> difficult<00:04:19.060> challenge<00:04:19.239> it's<00:04:19.930> good
