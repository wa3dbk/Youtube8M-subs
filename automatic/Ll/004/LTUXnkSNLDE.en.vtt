best<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.679> beginner<00:00:11.400> when<00:00:12.059> you're<00:00:12.269> just

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
extinction mode you're going to unlock

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.220 
extinction mode you're going to unlock
one<00:00:17.460> relic<00:00:17.820> slot<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.300> what<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.930> is

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
one relic slot and what this is is

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.290 
one relic slot and what this is is
basically<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:20.100> challenge<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.150> can

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
present to yourself in-game to make

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.429 
present to yourself in-game to make
things<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.029> little<00:00:24.210> bit<00:00:24.510> more<00:00:24.810> difficult<00:00:25.260> and

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
things a little bit more difficult and

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.099 
things a little bit more difficult and
really<00:00:25.590> spice<00:00:26.130> things<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.849> but<00:00:27.119> they<00:00:27.630> really

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
really spice things up but they really

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.410 
really spice things up but they really
affect<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.680> gameplay<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.369> make<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.970> much

affect the gameplay and make it a much
greater<00:00:30.810> challenge<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.560> if<00:00:31.710> you're<00:00:31.890> new<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
greater challenge and if you're new to

be able to turn on one more relic till

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.560 
be able to turn on one more relic till
you<00:01:01.980> reach<00:01:02.190> fifth<00:01:02.460> procedure<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.149> you're

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
you reach fifth procedure and you're

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.960 
you reach fifth procedure and you're
able<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.019> five<00:01:04.260> relics<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:04.979> once<00:01:05.220> but

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
able to have five relics on at once but

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.390 
able to have five relics on at once but
anyway<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:06.960> saying<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.530> easiest<00:01:08.040> relic

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
anyway as I was saying the easiest relic

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.399 
anyway as I was saying the easiest relic
to<00:01:08.520> use<00:01:08.670> an<00:01:08.909> extinction<00:01:09.479> mode<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.869> probably

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
to use an extinction mode is probably

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.500 
to use an extinction mode is probably
the<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.890> less<00:01:11.159> damage<00:01:11.189> relic<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.150> what<00:01:12.330> it'll

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the do less damage relic so what it'll

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.109 
the do less damage relic so what it'll
do<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.750> cut<00:01:13.200> your<00:01:13.350> damage<00:01:13.740> about<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.549> half<00:01:14.939> I'm

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
do is cut your damage about in half I'm

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.640 
do is cut your damage about in half I'm
not<00:01:15.299> quite<00:01:15.509> sure<00:01:15.540> what<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> exact<00:01:16.320> number<00:01:16.619> is

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
not quite sure what the exact number is

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.499 
not quite sure what the exact number is
but<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> find<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:17.970> somewhere<00:01:18.330> around

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
but I find that it's somewhere around

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.179 
but I find that it's somewhere around
fifty<00:01:18.990> percent<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> would<00:01:19.890> normally

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
fifty percent of what I would normally

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.600 
fifty percent of what I would normally
do<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.869> isn't<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.320> too<00:01:22.740> much<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.310> an

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
do and this isn't really too much of an

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.640 
do and this isn't really too much of an
issue<00:01:23.880> although<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.630> will<00:01:24.840> still<00:01:25.200> affect<00:01:25.500> my

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
issue although it will still affect my

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.469 
issue although it will still affect my
game<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.130> you'll<00:01:26.280> notice<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.700> does<00:01:26.970> take<00:01:27.210> much

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
game so you'll notice it does take much

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.719 
game so you'll notice it does take much
longer<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:28.020> kill<00:01:28.229> an<00:01:28.350> alien<00:01:28.710> I'm<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:29.369> able<00:01:29.640> to

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
longer to kill an alien I'm not able to

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.880 
longer to kill an alien I'm not able to
kill<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.970> seeker<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:30.750> quickly<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.409> you'll

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
kill a seeker as quickly and you'll

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.410 
kill a seeker as quickly and you'll
notice<00:01:32.100> some<00:01:32.490> guys<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:32.970> when<00:01:33.150> they're<00:01:33.270> on

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
notice some guys like when they're on

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.480 
notice some guys like when they're on
the<00:01:33.540> drill<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.079> does<00:01:34.290> take<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.860> much<00:01:35.100> longer

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the drill it does take a much longer

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.890 
the drill it does take a much longer
time<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.820> kill<00:01:36.119> them<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.420> that's<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.720> thing

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
time to kill them and that's one thing

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.270 
time to kill them and that's one thing
you're<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.530> ready<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:37.770> if

you're one of those guys such fires that
an<00:01:40.290> alien<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.920> lets<00:01:41.159> go<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.090> think

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
and what I like about this relic is if

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.410 
and what I like about this relic is if
you're<00:02:24.650> used<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.160> being<00:02:25.550> in<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.910> later<00:02:26.150> rounds

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
you're used to being in the later rounds

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.660 
you're used to being in the later rounds
then<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.260> should<00:02:27.530> have<00:02:27.560> no<00:02:27.800> problem<00:02:28.580> with

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.830 
this one you should be able to get to
the<00:02:31.010> final<00:02:31.489> barrier<00:02:31.879> hive<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.450> I'm<00:02:32.510> sorry<00:02:32.720> not

too<00:02:35.180> much<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.540> an<00:02:35.660> issue<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:36.140> should<00:02:36.349> be<00:02:36.500> used

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
too much of an issue you should be used

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.259 
too much of an issue you should be used
to<00:02:36.830> it<00:02:36.890> typically<00:02:37.250> people<00:02:37.489> who<00:02:37.610> proceeded<00:02:38.090> in

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
to it typically people who proceeded in

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.030 
to it typically people who proceeded in
extinction<00:02:38.870> mode<00:02:38.989> are<00:02:39.170> already<00:02:39.650> used<00:02:39.890> to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
extinction mode are already used to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.800 
extinction mode are already used to
aliens<00:02:40.430> with<00:02:40.580> high<00:02:40.730> health<00:02:40.940> this<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:41.629> why<00:02:41.750> this

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
aliens with high health this is why this

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.809 
aliens with high health this is why this
one<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.410> very<00:02:42.739> good<00:02:42.920> for<00:02:43.220> beginners<00:02:43.340> but

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
one is very good for beginners but

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.030 
one is very good for beginners but
another<00:02:44.540> thing<00:02:44.810> I'd<00:02:45.019> recommend<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:45.590> do<00:02:45.799> is

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
another thing I'd recommend you do is

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.759 
another thing I'd recommend you do is
also<00:02:46.700> use<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.209> regular<00:02:47.420> ammo<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.590> is

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
also use the regular ammo this is

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.170 
also use the regular ammo this is
because<00:02:49.069> you<00:02:49.250> won't<00:02:49.370> have<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.670> upgrade<00:02:49.849> your

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
because you won't have to upgrade your

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.360 
because you won't have to upgrade your
ammo<00:02:50.510> as<00:02:50.690> much<00:02:51.019> to<00:02:51.260> be<00:02:51.380> able<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.769> get<00:02:51.950> more<00:02:52.130> and

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
ammo as much to be able to get more and

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.319 
ammo as much to be able to get more and
you're<00:02:52.459> going<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.610> be<00:02:52.700> running<00:02:52.970> through<00:02:53.120> ammo

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
you're going to be running through ammo

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.630 
you're going to be running through ammo
a<00:02:53.450> lot<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:54.019> got<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.230> make<00:02:54.380> sure<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:55.190> have<00:02:55.459> your

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
a lot you got to make sure you have your

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
weapons that have larger magazines so

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.479
