you<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.909> goes<00:01:57.090> over<00:01:57.439> quite<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> bit<00:01:58.649> of

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
you can see it goes over quite a bit of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.069 
you can see it goes over quite a bit of
the<00:01:58.829> ways<00:01:59.060> the<00:02:00.060> Tang<00:02:00.299> does<00:02:00.509> kind<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
the ways the Tang does kind of have a

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.050 
the ways the Tang does kind of have a
little<00:02:01.259> dramatic<00:02:01.590> drop<00:02:02.189> off<00:02:02.430> at<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.759> point

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
little dramatic drop off at that point

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.149 
little dramatic drop off at that point
so<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.360> don't<00:02:03.570> think<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:03.810> gonna<00:02:03.930> move<00:02:04.200> any

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
so I don't think it's gonna move any

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.510 
so I don't think it's gonna move any

a lot of the other quartermaster knives

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.320 
a lot of the other quartermaster knives
use<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.110> bearings<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:15.550> unfortunately<00:02:16.209> they

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
use the bearings so unfortunately they

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.729 
use the bearings so unfortunately they
didn't<00:02:16.569> do<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.810> on<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:17.080> model<00:02:17.470> maybe<00:02:17.620> you

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
didn't do that on this model maybe you

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.020 
didn't do that on this model maybe you
couldn't<00:02:17.980> work<00:02:18.310> out<00:02:18.459> as<00:02:18.640> well<00:02:18.760> with<00:02:18.910> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
couldn't work out as well with the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.050 
couldn't work out as well with the
titanium<00:02:19.390> frame<00:02:20.190> but<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.220> blade<00:02:21.519> itself<00:02:21.849> is

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
titanium frame but the blade itself is

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.350 
titanium frame but the blade itself is
three<00:02:22.390> inches<00:02:23.250> overall<00:02:24.250> length<00:02:24.640> seven<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.300> a

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
three inches overall length seven and a

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.240 
three inches overall length seven and a
half<00:02:25.390> inches<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.110> it's<00:02:26.260> not<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.470> huge<00:02:26.980> knife

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
half inches so it's not a huge knife

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.540 
half inches so it's not a huge knife
this<00:02:28.000> one's<00:02:28.269> kind<00:02:28.569> of<00:02:28.720> I'm<00:02:29.709> not<00:02:30.130> trying<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.459> say

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
this one's kind of I'm not trying to say

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.309 
this one's kind of I'm not trying to say
for<00:02:30.730> light<00:02:30.940> use<00:02:30.970> but<00:02:31.540> it's<00:02:31.690> definitely<00:02:32.140> more

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
for light use but it's definitely more

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.830 
for light use but it's definitely more
of<00:02:32.349> an<00:02:32.500> EDC<00:02:32.849> nice<00:02:33.849> and<00:02:34.120> lightweight<00:02:34.300> it's<00:02:34.720> only

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
of an EDC nice and lightweight it's only

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.170 
of an EDC nice and lightweight it's only
four<00:02:35.230> ounces<00:02:35.769> which<00:02:36.489> is<00:02:36.700> probably<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.030> most

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
four ounces which is probably the most

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.030 
four ounces which is probably the most
lightweight<00:02:37.510> knife<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.349> a<00:02:38.380> quartermaster

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
lightweight knife that a quartermaster

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.160 
lightweight knife that a quartermaster
has<00:02:39.400> at<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:39.730> point<00:02:40.030> because<00:02:40.720> they're<00:02:40.989> known

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
has at this point because they're known

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.780 
has at this point because they're known
for<00:02:41.440> kind<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.709> their<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:42.160> know<00:02:42.280> overbuilt

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
for kind of their you know overbuilt

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.680 
for kind of their you know overbuilt
designs<00:02:44.580> but<00:02:45.580> this<00:02:45.760> just<00:02:46.000> came<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.420> couple

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
designs but this just came in a couple

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.509 
designs but this just came in a couple
of<00:02:46.750> days<00:02:46.930> ago<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.410> I<00:02:47.500> was<00:02:47.830> literally<00:02:48.130> on<00:02:48.400> my

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
of days ago and I was literally on my

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.490 
of days ago and I was literally on my
way<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.700> work<00:02:48.910> got<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.900> box<00:02:50.110> out<00:02:50.349> of<00:02:50.380> the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
way to work got the box out of the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.319 
way to work got the box out of the
mailbox<00:02:50.829> and<00:02:51.340> I've<00:02:51.579> been<00:02:51.760> carrying<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.120> ever

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
mailbox and I've been carrying it ever

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.650 
mailbox and I've been carrying it ever
since<00:02:52.599> so<00:02:53.049> it's<00:02:53.319> a<00:02:53.349> couple<00:02:53.500> days<00:02:53.739> since<00:02:53.980> then

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
since so it's a couple days since then

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.630 
since so it's a couple days since then
take<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.690> look<00:02:55.870> at<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.049> centering<00:02:56.410> see<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.400> can

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
take a look at the centering see you can

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.309 
take a look at the centering see you can
check<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:57.940> out<00:02:58.060> it's<00:02:58.299> favored<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.870> little<00:02:59.170> bit

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
check that out it's favored a little bit

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.670 
check that out it's favored a little bit
to<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.590> non-locking<00:03:00.069> side<00:03:00.519> not<00:03:01.480> rubbing<00:03:02.140> but

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
to the non-locking side not rubbing but

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.860 
to the non-locking side not rubbing but
not<00:03:02.890> perfectly<00:03:03.370> centered<00:03:03.790> either<00:03:06.870> blade

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
not perfectly centered either blade

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.860 
not perfectly centered either blade
comes<00:03:08.170> out<00:03:08.380> fairly<00:03:09.069> smoothly<00:03:09.599> if<00:03:10.599> you<00:03:10.660> ever

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
comes out fairly smoothly if you ever

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.110 
comes out fairly smoothly if you ever
had<00:03:11.079> a<00:03:11.110> titanium<00:03:11.470> frame<00:03:12.040> lock<00:03:12.069> or<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.670> frame

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
had a titanium frame lock or a frame

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.680 
had a titanium frame lock or a frame
lock<00:03:13.329> for<00:03:13.989> in<00:03:14.260> almost<00:03:14.590> any<00:03:14.769> case<00:03:15.120> if<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.239> hold

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
lock for in almost any case if you hold

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.650 
lock for in almost any case if you hold
it<00:03:16.780> like<00:03:16.840> this<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.139> try<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.560> force<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.430> open

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
it like this and try and force it open

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.970 
it like this and try and force it open
the<00:03:19.660> pressure<00:03:19.959> you're<00:03:20.319> putting<00:03:20.350> up<00:03:20.680> against

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
the pressure you're putting up against

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.740 
the pressure you're putting up against
the<00:03:21.040> lock<00:03:21.250> bar<00:03:21.549> can<00:03:21.700> make<00:03:21.880> it<00:03:22.000> hard<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.299> open<00:03:22.450> it

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
the lock bar can make it hard to open it

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.210 
the lock bar can make it hard to open it
so<00:03:22.900> you<00:03:22.989> kind<00:03:23.170> of<00:03:23.230> have<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.470> lean<00:03:23.739> your<00:03:23.889> finger

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
so you kind of have to lean your finger

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.990 
so you kind of have to lean your finger
back<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.819> just<00:03:25.750> use<00:03:26.319> your<00:03:26.500> thumb<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.950> flip<00:03:27.819> now

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
back and just use your thumb to flip now

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.910 
back and just use your thumb to flip now
so<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.319> very<00:03:29.680> nice<00:03:29.920> little<00:03:30.160> knife<00:03:30.370> here<00:03:30.639> came<00:03:31.630> in

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
so a very nice little knife here came in

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.979 
so a very nice little knife here came in
nice<00:03:32.920> shiny<00:03:33.340> sticker<00:03:33.700> I'm<00:03:34.389> trying<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.720> see<00:03:34.870> me

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
in that reflection but this is the box

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.020 
in that reflection but this is the box
that<00:03:37.930> came<00:03:38.139> in<00:03:38.380> just<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.739> basic<00:03:39.160> certificate<00:03:39.880> in

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
that came in just a basic certificate in

this one is the qtr six so this one you

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.740 
this one is the qtr six so this one you
can<00:04:02.109> see<00:04:02.290> definitely<00:04:02.920> very<00:04:03.400> thick<00:04:03.790> very

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
can see definitely very thick very

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.789 
can see definitely very thick very
overbuilt<00:04:06.840> blade<00:04:07.840> length<00:04:08.109> is<00:04:08.260> virtually<00:04:08.709> the

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
overbuilt blade length is virtually the

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.080 
overbuilt blade length is virtually the
same<00:04:08.829> about<00:04:09.280> three<00:04:09.579> inches<00:04:10.049> but<00:04:11.049> you<00:04:11.230> can<00:04:11.380> see

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
same about three inches but you can see

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.599 
same about three inches but you can see
side-by-side<00:04:13.090> you<00:04:13.560> know<00:04:14.560> overbuilt

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
side-by-side you know overbuilt

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.120 
side-by-side you know overbuilt
you<00:04:16.209> know<00:04:16.299> EDC<00:04:16.870> take<00:04:17.769> a<00:04:17.799> look<00:04:17.979> at<00:04:18.070> the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
you know EDC take a look at the

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.190 
you know EDC take a look at the
thickness<00:04:18.370> there<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.840> know<00:04:19.930> this<00:04:20.079> is

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
thickness there you know this is

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.339 
thickness there you know this is
titanium<00:04:20.560> this<00:04:21.039> is<00:04:21.190> steel

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.839 

so<00:04:25.349> I<00:04:25.379> get<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.740> blade<00:04:25.979> lengthen<00:04:26.400> that's<00:04:26.639> kinda

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
so I get the blade lengthen that's kinda

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.650 
so I get the blade lengthen that's kinda
hard<00:04:26.970> to<00:04:27.000> see<00:04:28.669> the<00:04:29.669> Roper<00:04:30.060> looks<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.360> little<00:04:30.449> bit

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
hard to see the Roper looks a little bit

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.820 
hard to see the Roper looks a little bit
smaller<00:04:30.990> but<00:04:31.199> they're<00:04:31.289> actually<00:04:31.470> very

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
smaller but they're actually very

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.710 
smaller but they're actually very
similar<00:04:32.190> other<00:04:32.970> than<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.270> weight<00:04:33.449> and<00:04:33.629> the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
similar other than the weight and the

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.420 
similar other than the weight and the
thickness<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:36.080> do<00:04:37.080> like<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.620> pocket<00:04:38.039> clip<00:04:38.220> on

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
thickness I do like the pocket clip on

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.790 
thickness I do like the pocket clip on
this<00:04:38.610> knife<00:04:38.930> because<00:04:39.930> it's<00:04:40.139> not<00:04:40.289> a<00:04:40.319> low<00:04:40.530> ride

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
this knife because it's not a low ride

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800 
this knife because it's not a low ride
clip<00:04:41.129> but<00:04:41.400> since<00:04:41.669> it's<00:04:41.849> on<00:04:42.000> this<00:04:42.180> smooth

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
clip but since it's on this smooth

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.260 
clip but since it's on this smooth
titanium<00:04:43.560> side<00:04:43.919> it<00:04:44.430> goes<00:04:44.699> in<00:04:44.909> and<00:04:45.030> out<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.180> the

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
titanium side it goes in and out of the

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.689 
titanium side it goes in and out of the
pocket<00:04:45.690> very<00:04:45.840> easily<00:04:46.340> doesn't<00:04:47.340> catch<00:04:47.520> on

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
pocket very easily doesn't catch on

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.490 
pocket very easily doesn't catch on
anything<00:04:47.729> and<00:04:48.360> that<00:04:48.810> was<00:04:48.960> probably<00:04:49.080> one<00:04:49.259> of<00:04:49.409> my

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
anything and that was probably one of my

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.070 
anything and that was probably one of my
only<00:04:49.650> complaints<00:04:50.280> with<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:50.849> qtr<00:04:51.210> six<00:04:51.629> here<00:04:51.960> is

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
only complaints with a qtr six here is

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.189 
only complaints with a qtr six here is
that<00:04:52.680> this<00:04:52.949> pocket<00:04:53.849> clip<00:04:54.060> would<00:04:54.810> catch<00:04:55.020> on

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
that this pocket clip would catch on

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.040 
that this pocket clip would catch on
these<00:04:55.380> screws<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.240> then<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.360> wouldn't<00:04:57.599> want

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
these screws and then it wouldn't want

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.420 
these screws and then it wouldn't want
to<00:04:58.110> seat<00:04:58.349> itself<00:04:58.800> all<00:04:59.039> the<00:04:59.069> way<00:04:59.159> in<00:04:59.340> your

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
pocket but this one kind of doesn't have

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.659 
pocket but this one kind of doesn't have
that<00:05:03.720> problem<00:05:03.930> but<00:05:04.740> just<00:05:04.800> a<00:05:05.039> really<00:05:05.340> handsome
