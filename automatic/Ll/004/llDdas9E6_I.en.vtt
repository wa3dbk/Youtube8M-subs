00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.959 

the<00:00:08.080> start<00:00:08.350> of<00:00:08.469> our<00:00:08.559> season<00:00:08.830> was<00:00:09.250> really<00:00:09.730> slow

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:09.969 
the start of our season was really slow

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:11.879 
the start of our season was really slow
after<00:00:10.480> the<00:00:10.600> first<00:00:10.780> couple<00:00:11.080> of<00:00:11.139> races<00:00:11.289> I<00:00:11.590> think

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
after the first couple of races I think

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.430 
after the first couple of races I think
we<00:00:12.039> were<00:00:12.510> 48<00:00:13.510> points<00:00:13.900> behind<00:00:14.080> the

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
we were 48 points behind the

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.650 
we were 48 points behind the
championship<00:00:14.949> leader<00:00:15.190> and<00:00:15.490> it<00:00:16.059> looked<00:00:16.299> bad<00:00:16.480> on

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
championship leader and it looked bad on

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.230 
championship leader and it looked bad on
paper<00:00:16.930> and<00:00:17.710> he<00:00:17.860> felt<00:00:18.100> that<00:00:18.310> we<00:00:18.640> all<00:00:18.790> kept<00:00:19.030> our

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
paper and he felt that we all kept our

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.870 
paper and he felt that we all kept our
focus<00:00:19.510> our<00:00:19.960> determination<00:00:20.920> and<00:00:21.070> we<00:00:21.580> started

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
focus our determination and we started

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.150 
focus our determination and we started
getting<00:00:22.030> the<00:00:22.180> results<00:00:22.660> and<00:00:22.810> it<00:00:23.110> was<00:00:23.160> quite

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
getting the results and it was quite

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.070 
getting the results and it was quite
fast<00:00:24.460> we<00:00:24.610> pulled<00:00:24.880> those<00:00:25.030> those<00:00:25.510> points<00:00:25.900> back

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
fast we pulled those those points back

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.720 
fast we pulled those those points back
and<00:00:26.380> then<00:00:26.619> we<00:00:26.740> were<00:00:26.890> able<00:00:27.100> to<00:00:27.310> think<00:00:27.550> more

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
and then we were able to think more

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.840 
and then we were able to think more
about<00:00:27.789> the<00:00:28.060> championship<00:00:28.480> again<00:00:32.700> coming<00:00:33.700> into
