00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.309
 good mates, we are already with a 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.310
 motor a moto gp to the right motorola 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.770
 360 motorcycle on the left and let's see the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.369
 long-awaited Android update 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.539
 wear we get here slide your finger to the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.769
 left to install to open 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.860
 we had it downloaded but not installed 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.670
 we had waited for so that the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:44.399
 I saw everyone here and look 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:47.909
 look restart in 4 3 2 1 and we do not know 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.190
 really how much can this lead to being 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:53.610
 the great unknown usually in the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.470
 mobile phones when they update 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.449
 It usually takes time to carry a 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.090
 quarter hour half hour when it 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.480
 updated 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.519
 and look, look how funny it is 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.280
 as when the rod starts it goes 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.110
 loading but you can tell he's pulling 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.120
 of cpu as god mandates 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.470
 What a lentito that you are, gentlemen, just 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.250
 tear 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.290
 android wear and good as it is typical 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.150
 when the operating system is updated 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.960
 lollipop has to adapt the 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.729
 applications then then this app the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.370
 good by applying changes in the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.460
 applications that I do not know well what 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.880
 applications can have this because 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.410
 store so to speak play store no no 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.820
 it's like that, although we do have a 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.830
 couple of tricks here in tutorials 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.340
 Hector I to get all the 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.410
 match to android web from third parties if not 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.940
 of google but we have it so we do not 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.979
 miss the next videos and while 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.140
 So, we will continue waiting for 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.320
 update are already starting 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.020
 applications and ending the start and 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.369
 finally finally after a quarter of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.160
 hour that has been thrown here our 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.320

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.810

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.650

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.460
