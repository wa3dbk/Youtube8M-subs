these photographs there's a black black

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.930 
these photographs there's a black black
and<00:00:31.650> white<00:00:31.769> version<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.250> color<00:00:32.489> version<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:32.910> I

and white version a color version and I

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.069 
and white version a color version and I
think<00:00:33.090> they<00:00:33.149> both<00:00:33.300> work<00:00:33.540> really<00:00:33.570> well<00:00:33.960> as

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
think they both work really well as

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.350 
think they both work really well as
different<00:00:34.410> ways<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.430> photograph<00:00:35.910> was<00:00:36.329> taken

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
different ways the photograph was taken

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.470 
different ways the photograph was taken
through<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> car<00:00:37.649> window<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:39.059> think<00:00:39.300> that's

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
through a car window and I think that's

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.030 
through a car window and I think that's
really<00:00:39.719> important<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.290> photo<00:00:40.530> because

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
really important with this photo because

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.569 
really important with this photo because
there's<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.550> frame<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> car<00:00:42.390> within<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579

there's the frame of the car within the
photographer<00:00:44.579> aim<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> photograph<00:00:45.360> which

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the frame of the car and what I really

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.139 
the frame of the car and what I really
like<00:01:01.739> about<00:01:01.770> these<00:01:02.070> couple<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.460> photos<00:01:02.879> is

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
like about these couple of photos is

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.299 
like about these couple of photos is
what<00:01:03.899> Mark<00:01:04.140> did<00:01:04.350> before<00:01:04.860> taking<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
what Mark did before taking the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.039 
what Mark did before taking the
photograph<00:01:05.790> was<00:01:06.030> he<00:01:06.150> put<00:01:06.360> water<00:01:06.570> onto<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
photograph was he put water onto the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.130 
photograph was he put water onto the
window<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> car<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:09.180> create<00:01:09.360> an<00:01:09.450> extra

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
window of the car to create an extra

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.740 
window of the car to create an extra
layer<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.710> think<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.070> all<00:01:11.750> photography

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
layer and I think with all photography

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230 
layer and I think with all photography
through<00:01:12.930> windows<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.500> glass<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.790> extra

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
through windows and glass and this extra

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.700 
through windows and glass and this extra
layer<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.780> glass<00:01:15.990> alone<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
layer of just the glass alone and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.550 
layer of just the glass alone and
creates<00:01:17.520> kind<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.030> an<00:01:18.150> added<00:01:18.509> emotion<00:01:19.049> where

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
creates kind of an added emotion where

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.170 
creates kind of an added emotion where
the<00:01:19.799> model<00:01:20.250> feels<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> bit<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:20.790> distant<00:01:21.150> from

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the model feels a bit more distant from

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.390 
the model feels a bit more distant from
the<00:01:21.390> photographer<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.140> next<00:01:23.130> couple<00:01:23.340> of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the photographer the next couple of

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.499

photographs the ones talk to you about

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
both have a really moody and Atmospheric

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.940 
both have a really moody and Atmospheric
Fields<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.270> photos<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:28.320> first<00:01:28.590> ones<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
Fields the photos this first ones of

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.920 
Fields the photos this first ones of
Marianne<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:30.299> really<00:01:30.479> special<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
Marianne and it's really special in a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.569 
Marianne and it's really special in a
way<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> UK<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.250> don't<00:01:32.280> get

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
way because here in the UK we don't get

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.030 
way because here in the UK we don't get
that<00:01:32.729> much<00:01:33.240> snow<00:01:33.450> very<00:01:33.840> often<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:34.920> in

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that much snow very often and here in

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.160 
that much snow very often and here in
the<00:01:35.100> fatality<00:01:35.549> there<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.820> snow<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.990> think

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the fatality there is snow and I think

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.219 
the fatality there is snow and I think
what<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> snow<00:01:37.590> does<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:38.990> changes<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
what the snow does is really changes the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.660 
what the snow does is really changes the
weather<00:01:40.350> colours<00:01:40.770> look<00:01:40.950> because<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> snow<00:01:41.610> is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
weather colours look because the snow is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
weather colours look because the snow is
so<00:01:41.880> pure<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.479> clean<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:42.869> such<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> bright

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
so pure and clean and such a bright

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.410 
so pure and clean and such a bright
white<00:01:44.009> all<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.399> colours<00:01:44.670> behind<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.240> snow

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
white all the colours behind the snow

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.389

these next two photographs were taken
through<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.660> set<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.930> French<00:02:26.200> windows<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.760> just

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
through a set of French windows and just

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.860 
through a set of French windows and just
from<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.540> photographer's<00:02:29.350> note<00:02:29.970> when<00:02:30.970> when<00:02:31.330> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
from a photographer's note when when the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.449 
from a photographer's note when when the
models<00:02:32.200> inside<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.739> French<00:02:32.950> windows<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
models inside the French windows and the

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.430 
models inside the French windows and the
door<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.790> shut<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.360> we<00:02:34.780> can't<00:02:34.959> hear<00:02:35.170> anything

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
door is shut and we can't hear anything

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.320 
door is shut and we can't hear anything

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
and so it's really important to have a

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.750 
and so it's really important to have a
plan<00:02:37.570> in<00:02:37.900> place<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.860> what<00:02:39.070> what<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.489> want<00:02:39.640> them

her hair with her hand this the next
phase<00:03:02.380> graph<00:03:02.680> is<00:03:03.580> again<00:03:03.760> through<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.120> windows

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
phase graph is again through the windows

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.509 
phase graph is again through the windows
but<00:03:04.720> what<00:03:05.410> Mark's<00:03:05.709> chosen<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.070> do<00:03:06.190> is<00:03:06.250> leave

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
but what Mark's chosen to do is leave

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.640 
but what Mark's chosen to do is leave
himself<00:03:06.850> in<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.810> reflection<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.500> window

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
himself in the reflection of the window

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.320 
himself in the reflection of the window
which<00:03:09.220> gives<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.549> a<00:03:09.610> much<00:03:09.730> more<00:03:09.790> voyeuristic

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
which gives it a much more voyeuristic

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.580 
which gives it a much more voyeuristic
style<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:13.180> processing<00:03:13.959> after<00:03:14.290> taking<00:03:14.470> the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
style in the processing after taking the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.979 
style in the processing after taking the
photo<00:03:14.799> Mark's<00:03:15.250> chosen<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:16.000> up<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.450> contrast

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
photo Mark's chosen to up the contrast

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.050 
photo Mark's chosen to up the contrast
which<00:03:17.799> again<00:03:18.070> adds<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.549> voyeuristic

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
which again adds to that voyeuristic

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.500 
which again adds to that voyeuristic
theme<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.950> gives<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.910> more<00:03:22.090> of<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.209> kind<00:03:22.390> of

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
theme and gives a more of a kind of

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.280 
theme and gives a more of a kind of
snapshot<00:03:23.500> feel<00:03:24.570> just<00:03:25.570> come<00:03:25.750> inside<00:03:25.900> because

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130

and there's quite difficult students it
doesn't<00:04:35.290> always<00:04:35.410> work<00:04:35.530> but<00:04:35.919> this<00:04:36.100> time<00:04:36.340> it<00:04:36.490> did

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
doesn't always work but this time it did

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.180 
doesn't always work but this time it did
work<00:04:36.790> and<00:04:37.540> we've<00:04:37.990> actually<00:04:38.110> made<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.590> video<00:04:38.800> on

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
work and we've actually made a video on

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.770 
work and we've actually made a video on
this<00:04:39.340> about<00:04:39.520> this<00:04:39.820> whole<00:04:40.060> particular<00:04:40.540> shoot

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
this about this whole particular shoot

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.390 
this about this whole particular shoot
which<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.050> can<00:04:41.169> find<00:04:41.380> on<00:04:41.650> this<00:04:41.770> channel<00:04:41.830> and

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
which you can find on this channel and

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.240 
which you can find on this channel and
the<00:04:43.360> second<00:04:43.780> photograph<00:04:43.990> is<00:04:44.950> a<00:04:45.010> really

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
the second photograph is a really

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.710 
the second photograph is a really
unusual<00:04:45.370> photograph<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.270> I<00:04:46.300> think<00:04:46.540> it's<00:04:46.630> a

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
unusual photograph and I think it's a

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.110 
unusual photograph and I think it's a
really<00:04:46.870> really<00:04:47.139> good<00:04:47.290> one<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:48.460> window<00:04:48.880> is

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
really really good one the window is

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.270 
really really good one the window is
actually<00:04:49.300> rolled<00:04:50.080> halfway<00:04:50.560> down<00:04:50.800> which<00:04:51.160> I

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
actually rolled halfway down which I

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.320 
actually rolled halfway down which I
think<00:04:51.460> creates<00:04:51.700> its<00:04:51.850> really<00:04:52.180> interesting

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
think creates its really interesting

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.930 
think creates its really interesting
kind<00:04:52.870> of<00:04:52.900> divide<00:04:53.440> in<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:53.830> photo<00:04:54.010> like<00:04:54.190> slicing

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
kind of divide in the photo like slicing

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.129 
kind of divide in the photo like slicing
through<00:04:55.090> straight<00:04:55.450> through<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:55.720> middle<00:04:55.840> and

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
through straight through the middle and

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.260 
through straight through the middle and
which<00:04:56.830> kind<00:04:57.070> of<00:04:57.130> plays<00:04:57.340> with<00:04:57.550> ideas<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.120> like

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
which kind of plays with ideas of like

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.980 
which kind of plays with ideas of like
framing<00:04:58.630> and<00:04:59.050> lines<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.620> the<00:04:59.710> Fate<00:04:59.889> say<00:05:00.990> this

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
framing and lines to the Fate say this

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.210 
framing and lines to the Fate say this
photograph<00:05:02.470> was<00:05:02.680> actually<00:05:03.010> quite<00:05:03.190> a

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
photograph was actually quite a

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.620 
photograph was actually quite a
difficult<00:05:03.400> one<00:05:03.669> to<00:05:03.729> get<00:05:04.000> I<00:05:04.150> mean<00:05:04.330> it<00:05:04.419> took<00:05:04.510> a

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
difficult one to get I mean it took a

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.110 
difficult one to get I mean it took a
lot<00:05:04.810> of<00:05:04.960> a<00:05:05.139> lot<00:05:05.260> of<00:05:05.520> perseverance<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.580> get<00:05:06.790> the

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
lot of a lot of perseverance to get the

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.690 
lot of a lot of perseverance to get the
emotion<00:05:07.840> that<00:05:07.870> Mark<00:05:08.139> was<00:05:08.290> looking<00:05:08.560> for<00:05:08.800> but

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
emotion that Mark was looking for but

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.460
