have it done cosmetically on the
national<00:03:07.810> health<00:03:08.049> so<00:03:08.799> really<00:03:09.099> I<00:03:09.129> haven't<00:03:09.489> had

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
national health so really I haven't had

the opportunity to get rid of some toes

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.830 
the opportunity to get rid of some toes
and<00:03:11.639> have<00:03:12.639> a<00:03:12.669> jolly<00:03:12.969> nice<00:03:13.150> meal<00:03:13.449> into<00:03:13.719> the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
and have a jolly nice meal into the

and have a jolly nice meal into the
bargain<00:03:14.400> how<00:03:15.400> are<00:03:15.519> they<00:03:15.669> cooked<00:03:16.419> to<00:03:16.629> the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
bargain how are they cooked to the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.839 
bargain how are they cooked to the
Thames<00:03:17.019> when<00:03:17.769> we<00:03:17.919> joined<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.459> idea<00:03:18.819> of

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
Thames when we joined to the idea of

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.330 
Thames when we joined to the idea of
comparing<00:03:19.120> them<00:03:19.629> but<00:03:19.930> eventually<00:03:20.349> we<00:03:20.949> settled

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
comparing them but eventually we settled

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.809 
comparing them but eventually we settled
on<00:03:21.430> us<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:21.879> sort<00:03:22.870> of<00:03:22.959> cassoulet<00:03:23.669> seemed<00:03:24.669> to<00:03:24.760> be

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
on us to sort of cassoulet seemed to be

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.159 
on us to sort of cassoulet seemed to be
the<00:03:24.909> best<00:03:24.969> way<00:03:25.239> because<00:03:25.389> it's<00:03:25.750> thinning<00:03:26.079> this

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
the best way because it's thinning this

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.500 
the best way because it's thinning this
being<00:03:26.439> a<00:03:26.590> load<00:03:26.949> of<00:03:27.129> toes<00:03:27.370> on<00:03:27.609> a<00:03:27.639> stick<00:03:28.060> is<00:03:28.269> there

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
being a load of toes on a stick is there

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.500 
being a load of toes on a stick is there
it's<00:03:28.959> enough<00:03:29.169> to<00:03:29.290> put<00:03:29.439> you<00:03:29.530> off<00:03:29.650> your<00:03:29.680> food<00:03:30.510> it

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
it's enough to put you off your food it

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.390 
it's enough to put you off your food it
was<00:03:31.719> discovered<00:03:32.290> later<00:03:32.439> wasn't<00:03:32.949> it<00:03:33.099> by

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
was discovered later wasn't it by

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.580 
was discovered later wasn't it by
Penrose<00:03:33.879> I<00:03:34.060> think<00:03:34.329> who<00:03:34.840> went<00:03:35.049> to<00:03:35.139> your<00:03:35.290> locker

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
Penrose I think who went to your locker

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.800 
Penrose I think who went to your locker
that<00:03:36.219> you'll<00:03:36.400> be<00:03:36.639> eating<00:03:37.120> sandwiches<00:03:37.540> that

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
that you'll be eating sandwiches that

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.979 
that you'll be eating sandwiches that
you<00:03:38.019> kept<00:03:38.439> for<00:03:38.590> yourself

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
you kept for yourself

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.509 
you kept for yourself
yes<00:03:40.989> um<00:03:41.319> tire

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
yes um tire

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.300 
yes um tire
I<00:03:42.959> kept<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.049> whole<00:03:44.199> stock<00:03:44.650> of<00:03:44.799> food<00:03:44.979> at<00:03:45.189> my

I kept the whole stock of food at my

then<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:46.930> was<00:03:47.079> furious<00:03:47.500> but<00:03:47.680> luckily<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.430> was<00:03:48.639> a

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
then it was furious but luckily I was a

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.520 
then it was furious but luckily I was a
lot<00:03:48.849> quicker<00:03:49.060> than<00:03:49.209> him<00:03:49.540> he<00:03:50.229> didn't<00:03:50.439> have

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
enough toes to balance properly and he

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.780 
enough toes to balance properly and he
could<00:03:52.629> scarcely<00:03:52.959> move<00:03:53.199> poor<00:03:53.530> sod<00:03:53.799> so<00:03:54.759> I

could scarcely move poor sod so I

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.059 
could scarcely move poor sod so I
trapped<00:03:55.269> him<00:03:55.389> and<00:03:55.540> ate<00:03:56.079> as<00:03:56.290> much<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.680> him<00:03:56.799> as<00:03:56.979> I

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
trapped him and ate as much of him as I
