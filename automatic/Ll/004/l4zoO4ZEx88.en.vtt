using the top of the Cajon and and I

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.740 
using the top of the Cajon and and I
carry<00:01:12.189> it<00:01:12.280> around<00:01:12.399> it's<00:01:12.729> got<00:01:12.850> you<00:01:13.719> know

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
carry it around it's got you know

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.230 
carry it around it's got you know
reasonably<00:01:14.259> amount<00:01:15.159> of<00:01:15.310> portability<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:19.030> see

reasonably amount of portability you see

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.330 
reasonably amount of portability you see
on<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.810> bottom<00:01:20.170> I<00:01:20.259> just<00:01:20.469> drill<00:01:21.009> holding

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
on the bottom I just drill holding

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.389 
on the bottom I just drill holding
countersunk<00:01:21.850> for<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.600> bolts<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:27.070> you<00:01:27.249> can

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
countersunk for the bolts but you can

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.520 
countersunk for the bolts but you can
easily<00:01:28.469> remove<00:01:29.469> the<00:01:29.740> Cajon<00:01:30.729> Cajon<00:01:31.659> I<00:01:32.049> didn't

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
easily remove the Cajon Cajon I didn't

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.370 
easily remove the Cajon Cajon I didn't
have<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.710> alter<00:01:33.039> in<00:01:33.310> any<00:01:33.490> way<00:01:33.819> it's<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:35.259> the

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
have to alter in any way it's just the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.109 
have to alter in any way it's just the
same<00:01:35.590> way<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:35.829> came<00:01:36.130> off<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.700> shelf

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
same way it came off the shelf

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.160 
same way it came off the shelf
it's<00:01:37.960> just<00:01:38.200> clamped<00:01:38.859> to<00:01:39.609> the<00:01:39.640> base<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.960> these

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
it's just clamped to the base with these

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.630 
it's just clamped to the base with these
wing<00:01:41.649> nuts

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.150 

so<00:01:49.640> I<00:01:49.700> can<00:01:49.880> remove<00:01:50.120> the<00:01:50.330> clamping<00:01:50.720> board<00:01:50.990> I<00:01:51.260> got

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
so I can remove the clamping board I got

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.490 
so I can remove the clamping board I got
this<00:01:52.280> little<00:01:52.490> spacer<00:01:52.790> board<00:01:53.150> here<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:54.350> then

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
this little spacer board here and then

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.910 
this little spacer board here and then
the<00:01:54.650> whole<00:01:54.800> thing<00:01:54.830> can<00:01:55.360> come<00:01:56.360> right<00:01:56.570> off<00:01:56.920> on

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
the whole thing can come right off on

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.970 
the whole thing can come right off on
the<00:01:58.010> bottom<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:58.670> put<00:01:59.660> two<00:02:00.110> pieces<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:00.680> rubber

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
the bottom I put two pieces of rubber

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.060 
the bottom I put two pieces of rubber
one<00:02:01.370> between<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.600> clamp<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.590> cajon

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
one between the clamp and the cajon

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.430 
one between the clamp and the cajon
another<00:02:04.520> one<00:02:04.730> on<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.510> bottom<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:06.050> this<00:02:06.140> just

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
another one on the bottom and this just

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.020 
another one on the bottom and this just
increases<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.280> friction<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.670> little<00:02:07.880> bit

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
increases the friction a little bit

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.110 
increases the friction a little bit
gives<00:02:08.240> you<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.360> little<00:02:09.820> more<00:02:10.820> stable

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
gives you a little more stable

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.990 
gives you a little more stable
connection<00:02:11.750> once<00:02:11.930> it's<00:02:12.140> on<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.370> base<00:02:13.850> I

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
connection once it's on the the base I

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.250 
connection once it's on the the base I
don't<00:02:14.030> know<00:02:14.240> if<00:02:14.330> it's<00:02:14.420> really<00:02:14.660> necessary<00:02:14.840> or

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
don't know if it's really necessary or

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.410 
don't know if it's really necessary or
not<00:02:15.440> but<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.650> thought<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:15.980> was<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:17.270> know<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.390> had

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
not but I thought it was you know I had

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.250 
not but I thought it was you know I had
the<00:02:17.660> rubber<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.140> why<00:02:18.320> not<00:02:18.500> but<00:02:20.020> one<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.050> the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
the rubber so why not but one of the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.990 
the rubber so why not but one of the
things<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.560> can<00:02:21.710> do<00:02:21.860> with<00:02:22.040> this<00:02:22.190> is<00:02:22.430> it's<00:02:22.760> put

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
things you can do with this is it's put

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.530 
things you can do with this is it's put
a<00:02:23.030> little<00:02:23.240> longer<00:02:23.480> drum<00:02:23.840> in<00:02:24.050> I<00:02:25.030> can<00:02:26.030> do<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.330> by

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
a little longer drum in I can do that by

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.050 
a little longer drum in I can do that by
removing<00:02:27.470> one<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.340> three-eighths<00:02:28.730> inch

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
removing one of the three-eighths inch

here is another standard meinl product
just<00:02:34.850> slip<00:02:35.450> on<00:02:35.600> this<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:38.020> it<00:02:39.020> goes<00:02:39.230> on<00:02:39.440> the

just slip on this and it goes on the
same<00:02:39.740> way<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.520> actually<00:02:40.880> it's<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.000> little

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
same way and actually it's a little

longer side to remove that one bolt but

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.840 
longer side to remove that one bolt but
