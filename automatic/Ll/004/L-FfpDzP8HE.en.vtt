00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670 
the main thing with a tire warmer is

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
days maybe not as important because

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.119 
days maybe not as important because
they're<00:00:54.930> always<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> track<00:00:55.739> throughout

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the day but you know as a racer you know

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.500 
the day but you know as a racer you know
he's<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.850> brand<00:01:00.180> new<00:01:00.239> tires

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.540 
he's going out on on brand new tires
usually<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.829> definitely<00:01:01.980> want<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.399> have

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
usually and we definitely want to have

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.640 
usually and we definitely want to have
the<00:01:02.760> rim<00:01:03.000> heated<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.570> much<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> tire<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the rim heated as much as the tire and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.810 
the rim heated as much as the tire and
that's<00:01:04.739> what's<00:01:04.979> important<00:01:05.400> about<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.640> tire

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
that's what's important about the tire

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.980 
that's what's important about the tire
warmers<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:06.479> heating<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> whole

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
warmers because it's heating the whole

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.480 
warmers because it's heating the whole
thing<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.439> it's<00:01:07.530> keeping<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> core<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
thing and it's keeping the core of the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.990 
thing and it's keeping the core of the
tire<00:01:08.869> warm<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.920> idea<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.430> get<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> warmth

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
tire warm the idea is to get the warmth

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.520 
tire warm the idea is to get the warmth
not<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> surface<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.170> through<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
not just on the surface but through the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.740 
not just on the surface but through the
tire<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.010> into<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.340> rim<00:01:14.549> I've<00:01:15.030> heard<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.479> if

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
tire and into the rim I've heard that if

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.359 
tire and into the rim I've heard that if
you<00:01:15.990> don't<00:01:16.140> heat<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.439> rim<00:01:16.710> up<00:01:16.890> then<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.189> rib

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
you don't heat the rim up then the rib

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399 
you don't heat the rim up then the rib
robs<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.299> heat<00:01:18.479> from<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> tire<00:01:18.990> yeah

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.020 
robs the heat from the tire yeah

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.630 
that's what we know when we're at
optimal<00:01:43.229> temperature<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.070> maintain<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
optimal temperature so we maintain a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.789 
optimal temperature so we maintain a
temperature<00:01:45.000> with<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.720> box<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.710> know

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
temperature with this box of you know

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.160 
temperature with this box of you know
that<00:01:46.950> temp<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.520> want<00:01:47.869> we're<00:01:48.869> able<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that temp that we want we're able to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.840 
that temp that we want we're able to
maintain<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.680> with<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.799> box<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.280> once<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.610> gets

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
maintain it with a box so once it gets

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.550 
maintain it with a box so once it gets
the<00:01:51.030> reaching<00:01:51.450> point<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:51.899> know<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.350> set

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
the reaching point we know we can set

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.010 
the reaching point we know we can set
our<00:01:52.680> hot<00:01:52.920> tire<00:01:53.220> pressures<00:01:53.759> because<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.750> roll

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
our hot tire pressures because we roll

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.649 
our hot tire pressures because we roll
on<00:01:55.229> hot<00:01:55.439> pressures<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.369> cold<00:01:57.210> pressures

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
on hot pressures not on cold pressures

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.080 
on hot pressures not on cold pressures
which<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.560> what<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> lot<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.280> street<00:01:59.670> guys<00:01:59.880> are

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
which is what a lot of street guys are

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.090 
which is what a lot of street guys are
attracted<00:02:00.180> guys<00:02:00.869> do<00:02:01.110> they'll<00:02:01.320> roll<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.770> cold

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
attracted guys do they'll roll on cold

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.399 
attracted guys do they'll roll on cold
temperatures<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.090> we<00:02:03.810> need<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.200> more

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
temperatures but we need to be more

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.660 
temperatures but we need to be more
accurate<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.909> get<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.659> an<00:02:06.810> optimal<00:02:07.670> optimal

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
accurate so we get to an optimal optimal

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.850 
accurate so we get to an optimal optimal
temperature<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:10.229> then<00:02:10.349> we'll<00:02:10.500> set<00:02:10.739> our

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
temperature and then we'll set our

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.580 
temperature and then we'll set our
pressures

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
pressures

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.770 
pressures
so<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.400> chicken<00:02:12.790> walked<00:02:12.940> higher<00:02:13.150> boxes<00:02:13.630> are

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
so the chicken walked higher boxes are

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.900 
so the chicken walked higher boxes are
great<00:02:13.959> for<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:15.010> old<00:02:15.160> days<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.580> set<00:02:15.880> a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
great for that in the old days you set a

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.790 
great for that in the old days you set a
cold<00:02:16.270> pressure<00:02:16.599> before<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.290> days<00:02:17.440> of<00:02:17.590> tire

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
cold pressure before the days of tire

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.140 
cold pressure before the days of tire
warmers<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.250> then<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:18.640> looked<00:02:18.910> for<00:02:19.090> a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
warmers and then you looked for a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.210 
warmers and then you looked for a
pressure<00:02:19.480> gain<00:02:19.959> as<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.680> went<00:02:20.860> out<00:02:20.980> on<00:02:21.130> the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
pressure gain as you went out on the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.190 
pressure gain as you went out on the
track<00:02:21.430> am<00:02:21.610> i<00:02:21.700> right<00:02:21.880> yeah<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.599> is<00:02:22.750> right<00:02:22.959> and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
track am i right yeah that is right and

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.080 
track am i right yeah that is right and
you<00:02:23.440> know<00:02:23.530> today<00:02:23.860> with<00:02:24.130> today's<00:02:24.280> technology

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
you know today with today's technology

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.790 
you know today with today's technology
and<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.360> new<00:02:25.540> tech<00:02:25.750> tires<00:02:26.020> from<00:02:26.410> Dunlop

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
and the new tech tires from Dunlop

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.309 
and the new tech tires from Dunlop
especially<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.520> rear<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:28.870> actually<00:02:29.290> very

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
especially the rear it is actually very

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.710 
especially the rear it is actually very
critical<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.069> go<00:02:30.250> out<00:02:30.459> on<00:02:30.819> a<00:02:30.849> lower<00:02:31.300> pressure

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
critical to go out on a lower pressure

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.170 
critical to go out on a lower pressure
and<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.680> correct<00:02:33.069> hot<00:02:33.370> pressure<00:02:33.730> off<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
and a correct hot pressure off the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.170 
and a correct hot pressure off the
warmer<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:35.140> still<00:02:35.739> see<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.010> rise<00:02:36.310> because<00:02:36.849> the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
warmer you still see a rise because the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.420 
warmer you still see a rise because the
temp<00:02:37.390> tires<00:02:37.660> still<00:02:37.989> gonna<00:02:38.110> heat<00:02:38.349> up<00:02:38.530> but<00:02:39.280> it's

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
temp tires still gonna heat up but it's

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.250 
temp tires still gonna heat up but it's
not<00:02:39.580> as<00:02:39.730> large<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.269> rise<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:40.870> it's<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.110> lot

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
not as large of a rise so it's a lot

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.800 
not as large of a rise so it's a lot
more<00:02:41.440> control<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.250> even<00:02:43.209> with<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.569> tire

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
more control so even with the tire

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.750 
more control so even with the tire
warmers<00:02:44.049> you're<00:02:44.440> not<00:02:44.620> gonna<00:02:44.860> get<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.220> tire<00:02:45.459> to

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
warmers you're not gonna get the tire to

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.759 
warmers you're not gonna get the tire to
the<00:02:45.940> operating<00:02:46.600> temperature<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.170> pounding

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
the operating temperature of pounding

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.220 
the operating temperature of pounding
out<00:02:47.920> say<00:02:48.220> five<00:02:48.459> or<00:02:48.580> six<00:02:48.730> laps<00:02:48.970> no<00:02:49.569> no<00:02:49.959> you'll

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
out say five or six laps no no you'll

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.920 
out say five or six laps no no you'll
always<00:02:50.470> see<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:51.519> know<00:02:51.670> on<00:02:52.120> an<00:02:52.299> average<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.840> a

two<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.480> three<00:02:58.690> is<00:02:58.780> what<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.019> look<00:02:59.170> for

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
two to three is what you look for

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.520 
two to three is what you look for
sometimes<00:03:00.880> higher<00:03:01.120> depending<00:03:01.450> on<00:03:01.690> how<00:03:01.900> the

carousel here may generate more heat you

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.160 
carousel here may generate more heat you
know<00:03:06.790> some<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.239> faster<00:03:07.630> tracks<00:03:07.840> like<00:03:07.989> Road

Atlanta<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.680> sometimes<00:03:09.040> with<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.280> back

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
Atlanta is sometimes with the back

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.930 
Atlanta is sometimes with the back
banking<00:03:09.910> or<00:03:10.180> back<00:03:10.420> straightaway<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:12.849> know

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
banking or back straightaway so you know

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.089 
banking or back straightaway so you know
we<00:03:13.060> do<00:03:13.180> monitor<00:03:13.390> rise<00:03:13.870> that's<00:03:14.530> it's<00:03:14.799> just<00:03:14.830> as

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
we do monitor rise that's it's just as

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.250 
we do monitor rise that's it's just as
important<00:03:15.609> that's<00:03:16.209> actually<00:03:16.660> going<00:03:16.959> for<00:03:17.200> the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
important that's actually going for the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
very little you know yeah it's still not

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.940 
very little you know yeah it's still not
the<00:03:19.600> kind<00:03:19.840> of<00:03:19.959> change<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.410> were<00:03:20.500> looking<00:03:20.799> at

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
the kind of change you were looking at

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.620 
the kind of change you were looking at
before<00:03:20.980> tire<00:03:21.489> warmers<00:03:21.730> when<00:03:22.060> you<00:03:22.180> went<00:03:22.329> from<00:03:22.510> a

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630

before tire warmers when you went from a
cold<00:03:22.840> pressure<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.410> -<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.100> guess<00:03:24.910> an<00:03:25.060> operating

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
cold pressure to - I guess an operating

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.800 
cold pressure to - I guess an operating
pressure<00:03:25.750> yeah<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.260> know<00:03:26.350> cold<00:03:26.829> pressures<00:03:27.280> I

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
pressure yeah I know cold pressures I

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.180 
pressure yeah I know cold pressures I
yeah<00:03:28.840> cold<00:03:29.140> pressures<00:03:29.470> you'd<00:03:29.620> see<00:03:29.829> a<00:03:30.010> lot

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
yeah cold pressures you'd see a lot

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.020 
yeah cold pressures you'd see a lot
larger<00:03:30.430> rise<00:03:30.819> for<00:03:31.209> sure<00:03:31.390> yep<00:03:32.370> okay<00:03:33.370> now<00:03:33.640> you've

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
gonna swab all the heat then we don't

you know

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.960 
you know
some<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.560> our<00:03:53.650> riders<00:03:53.890> in<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.220> past<00:03:54.460> do<00:03:54.730> want

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
some of our riders in the past do want

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.840 
some of our riders in the past do want
the<00:03:55.330> tires<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.930> be<00:03:56.050> on<00:03:56.140> warmers<00:03:56.530> for<00:03:56.850> 15-20

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
the tires to be on warmers for 15-20

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.250 
the tires to be on warmers for 15-20
minutes<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.240> I<00:03:58.360> think<00:03:58.390> it's<00:03:58.630> just<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.870> mental

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
minutes and I think it's just a mental

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.690 
minutes and I think it's just a mental
thing<00:03:59.290> at<00:03:59.620> that<00:03:59.770> stage<00:04:00.010> you<00:04:00.250> know<00:04:00.340> don't<00:04:00.550> laugh

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
thing at that stage you know don't laugh

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.310 
thing at that stage you know don't laugh
even<00:04:01.000> says<00:04:01.210> the<00:04:01.240> same<00:04:01.540> thing<00:04:01.750> let<00:04:01.990> the<00:04:02.110> rider

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
even says the same thing let the rider

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.410 
even says the same thing let the rider
decide<00:04:02.740> they<00:04:03.340> say<00:04:03.640> there's<00:04:04.030> no<00:04:04.150> need<00:04:04.390> for

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
decide they say there's no need for

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.050 
decide they say there's no need for
warmers<00:04:05.160> yeah<00:04:06.160> because<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.670> minute<00:04:06.910> he<00:04:06.970> gets

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
warmers yeah because the minute he gets

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.600 
warmers yeah because the minute he gets
out<00:04:07.300> there<00:04:07.510> it's<00:04:07.690> Robin<00:04:08.170> that<00:04:08.560> heat<00:04:08.890> what<00:04:09.310> kind

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
out there it's Robin that heat what kind

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.930 
out there it's Robin that heat what kind
of<00:04:09.730> temperatures<00:04:10.380> do<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.530> rain<00:04:12.100> tires<00:04:12.310> run<00:04:12.730> at

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
of temperatures do the rain tires run at

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.790 
of temperatures do the rain tires run at
mostly<00:04:13.420> what's<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.320> difference<00:04:14.590> between

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
mostly what's the difference between

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.350 
mostly what's the difference between
that<00:04:14.920> and<00:04:14.980> say<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.370> slick<00:04:15.730> on<00:04:15.910> a<00:04:15.940> dry<00:04:16.150> day

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
that and say a slick on a dry day

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.030 
that and say a slick on a dry day
well<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.050> Front's<00:04:17.380> actually<00:04:17.709> are<00:04:17.830> pretty

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
well the Front's actually are pretty

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.150 
well the Front's actually are pretty
much<00:04:18.250> spot-on<00:04:18.610> same<00:04:19.510> temperatures<00:04:20.080> within<00:04:20.950> a

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
much spot-on same temperatures within a

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.650 
much spot-on same temperatures within a
couple<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.489> degrees<00:04:21.610> but<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.210> rear<00:04:22.450> is<00:04:22.630> a

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
couple of degrees but the rear is a

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.800 
couple of degrees but the rear is a
pretty<00:04:23.350> big<00:04:23.590> difference<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:24.250> know<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.520> rears

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
pretty big difference you know the rears

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.080 
pretty big difference you know the rears
arraign<00:04:25.810> we<00:04:25.990> will<00:04:26.290> run<00:04:26.470> about<00:04:26.680> 30<00:04:26.950> to<00:04:27.250> 30<00:04:27.880> psi

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
arraign we will run about 30 to 30 psi

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.410 
arraign we will run about 30 to 30 psi
whether<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:29.740> dry<00:04:30.070> rear<00:04:30.430> will<00:04:30.700> be<00:04:30.910> down<00:04:31.150> around

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
whether the dry rear will be down around

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.070 
whether the dry rear will be down around
21<00:04:31.990> 22<00:04:32.530> hot<00:04:33.160> off<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:33.640> warmer<00:04:34.210> so<00:04:34.840> there's<00:04:34.990> a

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
21 22 hot off the warmer so there's a

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.160 
21 22 hot off the warmer so there's a
pretty<00:04:35.260> big<00:04:35.440> difference

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
pretty big difference

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.320 
pretty big difference
