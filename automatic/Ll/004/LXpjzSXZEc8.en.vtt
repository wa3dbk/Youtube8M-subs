supported<00:06:40.400> is<00:06:40.490> it<00:06:40.610> possible<00:06:40.850> we<00:06:40.970> can<00:06:41.090> we<00:06:41.480> can

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
supported is it possible we can we can

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.260 
supported is it possible we can we can
check<00:06:42.080> out<00:06:42.230> some<00:06:42.800> of<00:06:42.860> your<00:06:43.040> engineers<00:06:43.460> say<00:06:44.210> you

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
check out some of your engineers say you

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.210 
different labs which takes care about
its<00:06:59.990> development<00:07:00.650> one<00:07:00.830> part<00:07:01.100> is

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220 
its development one part is

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.730 
its development one part is
customization<00:07:02.150> of<00:07:02.300> this<00:07:02.720> to<00:07:02.900> bring<00:07:03.110> it<00:07:03.230> in<00:07:03.380> and

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
customization of this to bring it in and

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.670 
customization of this to bring it in and
let's<00:07:03.920> say<00:07:04.070> API<00:07:04.850> apk<00:07:05.630> friendly<00:07:06.110> environment

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
let's say API apk friendly environment

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.320 
let's say API apk friendly environment
the<00:07:06.830> other<00:07:06.980> one<00:07:07.190> is<00:07:07.370> just<00:07:07.400> working<00:07:08.060> on<00:07:08.210> the

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
the other one is just working on the

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.210 
the other one is just working on the
code<00:07:08.600> base<00:07:08.930> to<00:07:09.200> make<00:07:09.530> this<00:07:09.680> picture<00:07:10.100> in

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 
code base to make this picture in

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.700 
code base to make this picture in
picture<00:07:10.370> that<00:07:11.210> installation<00:07:11.840> possible<00:07:12.320> to

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
picture that installation possible to

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.180 
picture that installation possible to
make<00:07:12.950> this<00:07:13.330> decoding<00:07:14.330> possible<00:07:14.900> of<00:07:15.020> h.265<00:07:15.830> and

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.190 
make this decoding possible of h.265 and

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.150 
make this decoding possible of h.265 and
make<00:07:16.700> it<00:07:16.850> possible<00:07:17.390> that<00:07:17.660> we<00:07:18.290> can<00:07:18.500> sheet<00:07:18.860> see

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 
make it possible that we can sheet see

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.970 
make it possible that we can sheet see
and<00:07:19.400> demonstrate<00:07:20.030> it<00:07:20.120> as<00:07:20.300> it<00:07:20.450> here<00:07:20.690> this<00:07:20.930> so<00:07:21.650> so

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:21.980 
and demonstrate it as it here this so so

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.740 
and demonstrate it as it here this so so
yeah<00:07:22.130> the<00:07:22.340> engineers<00:07:22.790> did<00:07:23.030> this<00:07:23.270> the<00:07:23.540> solution

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:23.750 
yeah the engineers did this the solution

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.630 
yeah the engineers did this the solution
there<00:07:24.110> pjip<00:07:25.390> right<00:07:26.390> here<00:07:26.630> yeah<00:07:27.140> the<00:07:27.380> HMI<00:07:27.860> is<00:07:28.340> if

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:28.640 
there pjip right here yeah the HMI is if

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.790 
there pjip right here yeah the HMI is if
I<00:07:28.760> looked<00:07:28.940> here<00:07:31.840> it's<00:07:32.840> just<00:07:32.900> an<00:07:33.080> apk<00:07:33.440> just<00:07:33.710> an

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 
I looked here it's just an apk just an

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.800 
I looked here it's just an apk just an
that<00:07:33.950> is<00:07:34.280> just<00:07:34.550> an<00:07:34.640> app<00:07:34.790> for<00:07:35.030> demonstration

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:35.810 
that is just an app for demonstration

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.900 
that is just an app for demonstration
basically<00:07:36.500> what<00:07:36.800> customers<00:07:37.310> do<00:07:37.460> with<00:07:37.700> this

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:37.910 
basically what customers do with this

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.120 
basically what customers do with this
they<00:07:38.540> can<00:07:38.570> either<00:07:39.260> bring<00:07:39.530> out<00:07:39.770> their<00:07:39.950> own

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.130 
they can either bring out their own

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.450 
they can either bring out their own
solution<00:07:40.790> and<00:07:41.420> a<00:07:41.570> 4k<00:07:42.080> HDMI<00:07:42.650> picture<00:07:43.400> in
