00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
up strips these will be D ships C's will

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.230 
up strips these will be D ships C's will
be<00:01:35.700> B's<00:01:36.649> and<00:01:37.649> I'm<00:01:38.399> sure<00:01:38.580> there's<00:01:38.789> I<00:01:38.970> think

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
be B's and I'm sure there's I think

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.490 
be B's and I'm sure there's I think
there's<00:01:39.390> some<00:01:39.539> tutorials<00:01:40.080> out<00:01:40.200> there<00:01:40.259> where

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500

there's some tutorials out there where
it's<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.830> right<00:01:40.979> key<00:01:41.190> I<00:01:41.399> figured<00:01:42.090> I'd<00:01:42.210> do

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
it's in the right key I figured I'd do

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
them and those are the chords a minor C

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.460 
them and those are the chords a minor C
yes<00:02:21.620> but<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:22.400> this<00:02:22.550> kind<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.910> F<00:02:23.090> so<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.050> minor

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
yes but it's this kind of F so a minor

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.540 
yes but it's this kind of F so a minor
as<00:02:24.680> an<00:02:24.830> ASC<00:02:25.310> unity<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.960> then<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:27.950> jump<00:02:28.190> up<00:02:28.340> and

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
as an ASC unity and then you jump up and

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.280 
as an ASC unity and then you jump up and
put<00:02:28.700> these<00:02:28.910> two<00:02:28.970> fingers<00:02:29.570> on<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:29.870> C<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.200> E

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
put these two fingers on that C and E

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.530 
put these two fingers on that C and E
and<00:02:30.320> add<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.620> G<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.850> make<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.210> C<00:02:32.420> chord

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
and add a G to make the C chord

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.080 
and add a G to make the C chord
then<00:02:35.540> they<00:02:35.750> go<00:02:35.870> up<00:02:35.900> some<00:02:36.320> more<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:37.070> F&amp;A<00:02:37.550> still

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
then they go up some more to F&amp;A still

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.720 
then they go up some more to F&amp;A still
keep<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.450> C<00:02:39.490> right

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
keep the C right

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:55.390 
keep the C right
so<00:02:41.570> we<00:02:51.790> then<00:02:52.790> we're<00:02:53.120> like<00:02:53.590> outside<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.310> that

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
so we then we're like outside and that

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:06.770 
so we then we're like outside and that
has<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.640> name<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:57.880> dead<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:59.150> has<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.960> G

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.479 

so<00:03:07.780> those<00:03:08.110> chords<00:03:08.769> looked<00:03:08.950> like<00:03:09.099> this<00:03:09.280> and

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
so those chords looked like this and

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.949 
so those chords looked like this and
they<00:03:09.670> minor<00:03:09.940> again<00:03:10.239> like<00:03:10.480> we<00:03:10.629> started

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
they minor again like we started

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.490 
they minor again like we started
everything<00:03:11.830> moves<00:03:12.129> down<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.370> key<00:03:12.640> again<00:03:13.500> then

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
everything moves down a key again then

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.580 
everything moves down a key again then
jump<00:03:14.920> up<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.280> your<00:03:15.760> C<00:03:16.030> minor<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.659> there<00:03:17.470> the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
jump up to your C minor and there the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.750 
jump up to your C minor and there the
bass<00:03:17.769> note<00:03:18.330> is<00:03:19.330> C<00:03:19.599> and<00:03:19.780> then<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:19.959> falls<00:03:20.319> down

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
bass note is C and then it falls down

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.820 
bass note is C and then it falls down
right<00:03:21.760> before<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.330> measures<00:03:23.080> start<00:03:23.379> the<00:03:23.590> next

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
right before the measures start the next

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.410 
right before the measures start the next
measure<00:03:24.069> starts<00:03:26.370> then<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.519> starts<00:03:28.060> out<00:03:28.180> really

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
measure starts then it starts out really

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.860 
measure starts then it starts out really
similar<00:03:29.099> except<00:03:30.099> instead<00:03:30.400> of<00:03:30.549> going<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:31.030> minor

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
similar except instead of going a minor

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
then the first note of the melody is

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.830 
then the first note of the melody is
this<00:04:46.160> g<00:04:46.490> which<00:04:46.700> is<00:04:46.730> part<00:04:47.060> of<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.180> C<00:04:47.360> chord<00:04:47.630> so

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
this g which is part of the C chord so

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.890 
this g which is part of the C chord so
you<00:04:47.900> can<00:04:48.080> like<00:04:50.890> so<00:04:51.890> what<00:04:52.040> I<00:04:52.070> did<00:04:52.280> there<00:04:52.430> is<00:04:52.870> Gigi

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
you can like so what I did there is Gigi

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
you can like so what I did there is Gigi
well<00:04:54.890> I<00:04:54.920> still<00:04:55.310> had<00:04:55.490> those<00:04:55.640> hill<00:04:55.910> down<00:04:56.740> then<00:04:57.740> re

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
well I still had those hill down then re

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.700 
well I still had those hill down then re
hit<00:04:58.100> the<00:04:58.280> e<00:04:58.630> now<00:04:59.630> by<00:04:59.780> now<00:04:59.930> you<00:04:59.990> can<00:05:00.260> drop<00:05:00.500> the

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
hit the e now by now you can drop the

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.910 
hit the e now by now you can drop the
rest<00:05:00.860> of<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.100> corner

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:26.100 

so<00:05:05.920> that's<00:05:08.490> GGC<00:05:20.250> that's<00:05:21.250> EG<00:05:22.120> b<00:05:22.390> and<00:05:23.320> e<00:05:23.770> JC<00:05:25.110> in

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
so that's GGC that's EG b and e JC in

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.720 
so that's GGC that's EG b and e JC in
the<00:05:26.350> way<00:05:26.470> the<00:05:26.650> base<00:05:26.830> notes<00:05:27.160> work<00:05:27.370> out<00:05:27.520> as<00:05:27.640> you

you

00:06:12.489 --> 00:06:12.499
