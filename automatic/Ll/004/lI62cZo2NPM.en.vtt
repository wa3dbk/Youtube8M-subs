USB type-c which distinguishes it from
the<00:00:48.890> MacBook<00:00:49.340> which<00:00:49.520> only<00:00:49.730> has<00:00:49.970> one<00:00:50.210> this<00:00:50.450> has

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
the MacBook which only has one this has

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.400 
the MacBook which only has one this has
two<00:00:51.020> and<00:00:52.010> a<00:00:52.310> memory<00:00:52.610> card<00:00:52.820> slot<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:53.900> why<00:00:54.110> are

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
two and a memory card slot so why are

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.820 
two and a memory card slot so why are
the<00:00:54.650> two<00:00:55.220> type<00:00:55.670> C<00:00:55.910> ports<00:00:56.590> important<00:00:57.590> well

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
the two type C ports important well

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.490 
the two type C ports important well
right<00:00:58.280> from<00:00:58.310> the<00:00:58.610> get-go<00:00:58.790> power<00:00:59.390> delivery<00:00:59.990> the

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
right from the get-go power delivery the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.800 
right from the get-go power delivery the
ability<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:01.100> charge<00:01:01.850> and<00:01:02.150> power<00:01:02.240> the<00:01:02.450> laptop

ability to charge and power the laptop

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.620 
ability to charge and power the laptop
is<00:01:03.020> baked<00:01:03.290> right<00:01:03.530> in<00:01:03.740> so<00:01:04.369> here<00:01:04.969> we<00:01:05.089> have<00:01:05.329> the

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
is baked right in so here we have the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.270 
is baked right in so here we have the
power<00:01:06.020> adapter<00:01:06.439> that<00:01:06.619> comes<00:01:06.829> with<00:01:07.070> the

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
power adapter that comes with the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.880 
power adapter that comes with the
Chromebook<00:01:07.640> pixel<00:01:07.840> it's<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:08.990> 60<00:01:09.409> watt<00:01:09.560> power

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
Chromebook pixel it's a 60 watt power

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.219 
Chromebook pixel it's a 60 watt power
adapter<00:01:10.399> and<00:01:10.549> all<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.149> that<00:01:11.299> power<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:11.990> any

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
adapter and all of that power and any

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.810 
adapter and all of that power and any
data<00:01:12.439> connectivity<00:01:12.950> is<00:01:13.219> going<00:01:13.520> through<00:01:13.700> the

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
data connectivity is going through the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.840 
data connectivity is going through the
same<00:01:13.850> USB<00:01:14.810> wire<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:15.530> USB<00:01:15.859> type-c<00:01:16.249> connector

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
same USB wire and USB type-c connector

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.060 
same USB wire and USB type-c connector
and<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:17.689> we<00:01:17.810> just<00:01:17.990> plug<00:01:18.170> that<00:01:18.380> into<00:01:18.619> one<00:01:18.890> of<00:01:19.009> the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
and so we just plug that into one of the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.429 
and so we just plug that into one of the
available<00:01:19.520> ports<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.810> Chromebook<00:01:21.409> pixel

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
available ports and the Chromebook pixel

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.419 
available ports and the Chromebook pixel
starts<00:01:22.130> charging<00:01:22.399> now<00:01:23.179> the<00:01:23.240> cool<00:01:23.509> thing<00:01:23.749> is

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
starts charging now the cool thing is

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.010 
starts charging now the cool thing is
USB<00:01:25.429> type-c<00:01:25.729> like<00:01:26.329> the<00:01:26.509> Apple<00:01:26.869> lightning

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.739 
USB type-c like the Apple lightning
connector<00:01:27.439> we<00:01:28.159> can<00:01:28.369> flip<00:01:28.759> it<00:01:28.909> over<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:29.390> plug

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
connector we can flip it over and plug

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.499 
connector we can flip it over and plug
it<00:01:29.869> in<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.049> other<00:01:30.229> way<00:01:30.439> so<00:01:31.159> no<00:01:31.789> more<00:01:31.999> where<00:01:32.390> you

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
it in the other way so no more where you

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.480 
it in the other way so no more where you
have<00:01:32.689> to<00:01:32.899> flip<00:01:33.259> it<00:01:33.380> once<00:01:33.560> flip<00:01:33.859> it<00:01:33.979> twice<00:01:34.219> and

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
have to flip it once flip it twice and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.770 
have to flip it once flip it twice and
it<00:01:34.579> seems<00:01:34.789> like<00:01:34.999> only<00:01:35.179> on<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.539> third<00:01:35.749> or

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
it seems like only on the third or

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.020 
it seems like only on the third or
fourth<00:01:36.079> try<00:01:36.319> gives<00:01:36.590> in<00:01:36.799> this<00:01:37.490> will<00:01:37.670> go<00:01:37.789> in<00:01:37.939> the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
fourth try gives in this will go in the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.929 
fourth try gives in this will go in the
first<00:01:38.210> time<00:01:38.420> every<00:01:38.719> time<00:01:39.640> because<00:01:40.640> we<00:01:40.759> have<00:01:40.909> a

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.800 
Chromebook pixel only has Wi-Fi built in
so<00:01:54.740> getting<00:01:54.950> wired<00:01:55.310> network<00:01:55.789> will<00:01:56.060> at<00:01:56.689> least

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
so getting wired network will at least

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.989 
so getting wired network will at least
double<00:01:57.079> your<00:01:57.350> performance<00:01:57.499> sometimes<00:01:58.340> triple

00:01:58.989 --> 00:01:58.999 
double your performance sometimes triple

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.090 
double your performance sometimes triple
or<00:01:59.270> quadruple<00:01:59.420> it<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.469> it's<00:02:00.590> really<00:02:00.679> great<00:02:00.950> to

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
or quadruple it so it's really great to

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.239 
or quadruple it so it's really great to
get<00:02:01.219> wired<00:02:01.490> now<00:02:02.060> we<00:02:02.119> could<00:02:02.479> plug<00:02:03.170> this<00:02:03.560> type-a

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249 
get wired now we could plug this type-a

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.999 
get wired now we could plug this type-a
connector<00:02:04.909> into<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.509> type-a<00:02:06.139> ports<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.859> are

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
connector into the type-a ports that are

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.160 
connector into the type-a ports that are
on<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.219> side<00:02:07.429> of<00:02:07.609> the<00:02:07.670> Chromebook<00:02:08.030> pixel<00:02:08.170> but

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
on the side of the Chromebook pixel but

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.020 
on the side of the Chromebook pixel but
for<00:02:09.500> example<00:02:09.560> on<00:02:10.010> the<00:02:10.130> MacBook<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.790> isn't

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
for example on the MacBook that isn't

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.520 
for example on the MacBook that isn't
possible<00:02:11.210> because<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.900> doesn't<00:02:12.140> have<00:02:12.320> those

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
possible because it doesn't have those

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.900 
possible because it doesn't have those
type-a<00:02:12.980> ports<00:02:13.370> so

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
type-a ports so

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.730 
type-a ports so
in<00:02:15.570> addition<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.080> getting<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.320> Chromebook

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
in addition to getting the Chromebook

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.910 
in addition to getting the Chromebook
pixel<00:02:16.770> we<00:02:17.250> ordered<00:02:17.670> Google's<00:02:18.380> female<00:02:19.380> type<00:02:19.680> a

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
pixel we ordered Google's female type a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.150 
pixel we ordered Google's female type a
to<00:02:20.520> type-c<00:02:21.000> connector<00:02:21.510> cable<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.830> we'll<00:02:22.980> just

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
to type-c connector cable so we'll just

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.830 
to type-c connector cable so we'll just
plug<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.580> in<00:02:23.790> here<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:25.010> plug<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.040> into<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
plug that in here and plug that into the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.830 
plug that in here and plug that into the
into<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> Chromebook<00:02:28.350> pixel<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:30.150> what<00:02:30.810> I

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
into the Chromebook pixel and so what I

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.110 
into the Chromebook pixel and so what I
have<00:02:31.020> attached<00:02:31.410> here<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.280> Ethernet<00:02:32.760> cable

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
have attached here is the Ethernet cable

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.030 
have attached here is the Ethernet cable
so<00:02:33.300> now<00:02:33.450> I'm<00:02:33.570> going<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.780> switch<00:02:34.050> from<00:02:34.380> Wi-Fi<00:02:34.770> to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
so now I'm going to switch from Wi-Fi to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.580 
so now I'm going to switch from Wi-Fi to
wired<00:02:35.640> Ethernet<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.720> I've<00:02:36.930> got<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.320> mouse

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
wired Ethernet and I've got a mouse

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.680 
wired Ethernet and I've got a mouse
connected<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.310> now<00:02:38.460> I<00:02:38.490> can<00:02:38.790> drag<00:02:39.300> Windows

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
connected so now I can drag Windows

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.750 
connected so now I can drag Windows
around<00:02:39.990> on<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.230> screen<00:02:40.350> etc<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:41.550> this

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
around on the screen etc with this

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.510 
around on the screen etc with this
standard<00:02:42.270> USB<00:02:42.600> wired<00:02:42.960> mouse<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.370> is

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
standard USB wired mouse so this is

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.790 
standard USB wired mouse so this is
again<00:02:44.850> where<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.690> know<00:02:45.810> USB<00:02:46.230> has<00:02:46.380> just<00:02:46.650> done

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
again where you know USB has just done

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.130 
again where you know USB has just done
such<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.160> great<00:02:47.340> job<00:02:47.460> over<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.060> years<00:02:48.090> I've<00:02:48.900> got

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
such a great job over the years I've got

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.350 
such a great job over the years I've got
these<00:02:49.290> older<00:02:49.800> devices<00:02:50.130> using<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.940> older

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
these older devices using the older

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.810 
these older devices using the older
connector<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:52.050> fact<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.710> USB<00:02:53.370> mouse<00:02:53.550> is

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
connector in fact a USB mouse is

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.360 
connector in fact a USB mouse is
actually<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.270> USB<00:02:54.690> one-one<00:02:55.170> device<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:56.220> you

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
actually a USB one-one device if you

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.640 
actually a USB one-one device if you
look<00:02:56.550> at<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.850> from<00:02:57.120> kind<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.630> electrical<00:02:58.530> or

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
look at it from kind of a electrical or

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.280 
look at it from kind of a electrical or
USB<00:02:58.890> standards<00:02:59.460> level<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.940> yet<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:00.630> USB<00:03:00.960> one

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
USB standards level and yet this USB one

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.470 
USB standards level and yet this USB one
one<00:03:01.470> device<00:03:01.770> basically<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.550> could<00:03:02.820> take<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> USB

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
one device basically I could take a USB

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.300 
one device basically I could take a USB
mouse<00:03:03.660> from<00:03:04.050> 15<00:03:04.560> years<00:03:04.770> ago

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
mouse from 15 years ago

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.360 
mouse from 15 years ago
and<00:03:05.400> plug<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:07.380> will<00:03:07.650> still<00:03:07.920> connect

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
and plug it in and it will still connect

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.640 
and plug it in and it will still connect
through<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.730> work<00:03:08.940> on<00:03:09.270> this<00:03:09.390> USB<00:03:09.840> type-c<00:03:10.110> port

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
through and work on this USB type-c port

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.100 
through and work on this USB type-c port
I<00:03:10.830> just<00:03:11.250> need<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.700> adapt<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.450> connector<00:03:12.870> types

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
I just need to adapt the connector types

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.050 
I just need to adapt the connector types
the<00:03:13.470> same<00:03:13.650> great<00:03:13.830> backward<00:03:14.250> compatibility<00:03:14.760> we

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
the same great backward compatibility we

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.640 
the same great backward compatibility we
we've<00:03:15.480> kind<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.780> have<00:03:15.930> come<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.290> love<00:03:16.500> about

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
we've kind of have come to love about

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.770 
we've kind of have come to love about
USB<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.850> works<00:03:18.480> here<00:03:18.840> with<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.080> type<00:03:19.290> C<00:03:19.500> port

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
USB it works here with the type C port

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.330 
USB it works here with the type C port
so<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:22.080> know<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.290> now<00:03:22.470> have<00:03:22.710> a<00:03:22.980> couple<00:03:23.190> extra

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
so you know I now have a couple extra

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.040 
so you know I now have a couple extra
ports<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:23.880> are<00:03:23.970> available<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.540> could<00:03:24.750> connect

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
ports that are available I could connect

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.900 
ports that are available I could connect
in<00:03:25.170> flash<00:03:25.440> drives<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:26.070> can<00:03:26.250> connect<00:03:26.550> in<00:03:26.670> USB

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
in flash drives I can connect in USB

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.510 
in flash drives I can connect in USB
hard<00:03:27.300> drives<00:03:27.770> you<00:03:28.770> know<00:03:28.830> Google<00:03:29.130> Chrome<00:03:29.370> OS

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.400 
hard drives you know Google Chrome OS
has<00:03:29.880> pretty<00:03:30.180> good<00:03:30.270> support<00:03:30.780> for<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.140> wide<00:03:31.380> range

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
has pretty good support for a wide range

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.760 
has pretty good support for a wide range
of<00:03:32.070> standard<00:03:32.880> type<00:03:33.090> devices<00:03:33.450> like<00:03:33.780> USB<00:03:34.140> HID

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
of standard type devices like USB HID

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.740 
of standard type devices like USB HID
which<00:03:35.160> would<00:03:35.520> be<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.730> mouse<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.420> USB

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
which would be the mouse and USB

which would be the mouse and USB
mass-storage<00:03:37.080> which<00:03:37.620> would<00:03:37.740> be<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.980> flash

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
mass-storage which would be the flash

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.600 
mass-storage which would be the flash
drive<00:03:39.080> it<00:03:40.080> also<00:03:40.230> has<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> built-in<00:03:40.980> support<00:03:41.220> for

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
Chromebook none of those adapters will

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.080 
Chromebook none of those adapters will
allow<00:04:38.629> you<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:39.050> connect<00:04:39.409> to<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.680> VGA<00:04:40.310> monitor<00:04:40.940> or

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
allow you to connect to a VGA monitor or

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.659 
allow you to connect to a VGA monitor or
projector<00:04:41.530> but<00:04:42.530> we<00:04:42.620> actually<00:04:42.770> have<00:04:43.129> a<00:04:43.159> VGA<00:04:43.610> to

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.689 
projector but we actually have a VGA to
HDMI<00:04:44.240> cable<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:44.930> here<00:04:45.620> it<00:04:45.680> is<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.490> can

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
HDMI cable and here it is and I can

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.899 
HDMI cable and here it is and I can
actually<00:04:46.879> unplug<00:04:47.629> this<00:04:48.169> HDMI<00:04:49.129> display<00:04:49.340> and

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909 
actually unplug this HDMI display and

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.990 
actually unplug this HDMI display and
then<00:04:50.210> plug<00:04:50.509> that<00:04:50.780> HDMI<00:04:51.740> adapter<00:04:52.550> in<00:04:52.669> there<00:04:52.849> and

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
then plug that HDMI adapter in there and

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.820 
then plug that HDMI adapter in there and
so<00:04:53.120> this<00:04:53.240> is<00:04:53.389> a<00:04:53.419> pluggable<00:04:53.810> brand<00:04:54.169> cable<00:04:54.590> it's

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
so this is a pluggable brand cable it's

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.420 
so this is a pluggable brand cable it's
basically<00:04:55.430> doing<00:04:55.840> digital<00:04:57.069> which<00:04:58.069> is<00:04:58.099> this

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
basically doing digital which is this

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.149 
basically doing digital which is this
HDMI<00:04:59.060> side<00:04:59.330> to<00:04:59.990> analog<00:05:00.500> which<00:05:00.830> is<00:05:00.979> that

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:01.159 
HDMI side to analog which is that

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:04.510 
HDMI side to analog which is that
monitor<00:05:01.639> side<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:03.050> that<00:05:03.289> will<00:05:03.530> pop<00:05:04.039> up<00:05:04.069> in<00:05:04.430> a

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
monitor side and that will pop up in a

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.809 
monitor side and that will pop up in a
second<00:05:04.940> and<00:05:05.240> in<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:06.020> Chrome<00:05:06.860> OS<00:05:07.009> desktop<00:05:07.610> will

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
second and in the Chrome OS desktop will

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:10.659 
second and in the Chrome OS desktop will
extend<00:05:08.150> over<00:05:08.479> to<00:05:08.659> this<00:05:08.780> other<00:05:08.930> monitor<00:05:09.669> let's

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
extend over to this other monitor let's

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.350 
extend over to this other monitor let's
actually<00:05:11.150> grab<00:05:11.870> a<00:05:11.900> different<00:05:12.500> type<00:05:12.889> of<00:05:12.919> hub<00:05:13.360> so

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
actually grab a different type of hub so

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.029 
actually grab a different type of hub so
here<00:05:14.599> we<00:05:14.719> have<00:05:14.990> a<00:05:15.789> seven<00:05:16.789> port<00:05:17.090> USB<00:05:18.050> 3<00:05:18.349> hub<00:05:18.590> we

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
here we have a seven port USB 3 hub we

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.839 
here we have a seven port USB 3 hub we
can<00:05:19.190> connect<00:05:19.550> it<00:05:19.639> either<00:05:19.940> directly<00:05:20.710> to<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:22.009> to

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
can connect it either directly to the to

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.580 
can connect it either directly to the to
the<00:05:22.969> type<00:05:23.150> 8<00:05:23.360> ports<00:05:23.690> here<00:05:23.840> on<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:24.050> side<00:05:24.289> or

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
the type 8 ports here on the side or

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.200 
the type 8 ports here on the side or
again<00:05:25.460> connect<00:05:25.940> it<00:05:26.060> through<00:05:26.240> to<00:05:26.659> the<00:05:27.969> type<00:05:28.969> C

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
again connect it through to the type C

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.689 
again connect it through to the type C
here<00:05:29.629> through<00:05:30.199> the<00:05:30.409> the<00:05:31.039> Google<00:05:31.310> adapter

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
here through the the Google adapter

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.370 
here through the the Google adapter
which<00:05:31.849> by<00:05:32.000> the<00:05:32.060> way<00:05:32.150> is<00:05:32.360> an<00:05:32.509> option<00:05:32.930> it<00:05:33.080> doesn't

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
which by the way is an option it doesn't

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.779 
which by the way is an option it doesn't
come<00:05:33.500> with<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:33.800> Chromebook<00:05:34.159> pixel<00:05:34.190> but<00:05:34.669> it's

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
come with the Chromebook pixel but it's

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.480 
come with the Chromebook pixel but it's
only<00:05:34.940> 13<00:05:35.419> dollars<00:05:35.779> and<00:05:36.080> we've<00:05:36.560> got<00:05:36.770> a<00:05:36.800> separate

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
USB Ethernet adapter attached to that

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.209 
USB Ethernet adapter attached to that
again<00:05:40.130> one<00:05:40.400> of<00:05:40.490> ours<00:05:40.699> and<00:05:41.259> so<00:05:42.259> now<00:05:42.440> I'll<00:05:42.830> take

again one of ours and so now I'll take

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:45.790 
again one of ours and so now I'll take
my<00:05:43.400> mouse<00:05:43.699> and<00:05:44.210> take<00:05:44.840> it<00:05:44.960> from<00:05:45.169> this<00:05:45.289> other<00:05:45.469> hub

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
my mouse and take it from this other hub

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.620 
my mouse and take it from this other hub
and<00:05:46.610> plug<00:05:46.909> that<00:05:47.120> in<00:05:47.330> over<00:05:47.599> here<00:05:48.849> and<00:05:49.849> I<00:05:50.509> already

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
and plug that in over here and I already

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.990 
and plug that in over here and I already
have<00:05:50.900> that<00:05:51.050> network<00:05:51.469> adapter<00:05:51.949> plugged<00:05:52.219> in<00:05:52.430> so

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
have that network adapter plugged in so

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.719 
have that network adapter plugged in so
now<00:05:53.180> I'm<00:05:53.360> able<00:05:53.599> to<00:05:54.009> connect<00:05:55.009> up<00:05:55.250> to<00:05:55.400> seven

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
now I'm able to connect up to seven

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.519 
now I'm able to connect up to seven
devices<00:05:56.029> and<00:05:56.569> with<00:05:56.750> this<00:05:56.930> hub<00:05:57.169> they're<00:05:57.409> all

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:57.529 
devices and with this hub they're all

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:00.100 
devices and with this hub they're all
powered<00:05:58.210> with<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.360> smaller<00:05:59.629> one<00:05:59.870> I<00:05:59.900> was

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
powered with the smaller one I was

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.499 
powered with the smaller one I was
showing<00:06:00.289> you<00:06:00.440> earlier<00:06:00.819> it's<00:06:01.819> relying<00:06:02.210> on<00:06:02.389> the

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
showing you earlier it's relying on the

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.019 
showing you earlier it's relying on the
power<00:06:02.719> off<00:06:02.990> type<00:06:03.289> C<00:06:03.560> which<00:06:03.830> is<00:06:04.009> usually<00:06:04.729> plenty

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:05.029 
power off type C which is usually plenty

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:06.969 
power off type C which is usually plenty
for<00:06:05.449> most<00:06:05.629> devices<00:06:05.870> but<00:06:06.319> as<00:06:06.440> you<00:06:06.590> get<00:06:06.740> up<00:06:06.770> to

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
for most devices but as you get up to

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.640 
for most devices but as you get up to
seven<00:06:07.400> attached<00:06:08.180> USB<00:06:08.479> devices<00:06:08.990> you<00:06:09.289> want<00:06:09.469> that

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
seven attached USB devices you want that

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.619 
seven attached USB devices you want that
to<00:06:09.800> be<00:06:09.919> externally<00:06:10.400> powered<00:06:10.580> and<00:06:11.029> that's<00:06:11.300> what

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629 
to be externally powered and that's what

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:13.480 
to be externally powered and that's what
that<00:06:11.900> hub<00:06:12.199> does<00:06:12.500> there<00:06:12.830> you<00:06:13.099> know<00:06:13.190> what's<00:06:13.370> the

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
that hub does there you know what's the

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.010 
that hub does there you know what's the
performance<00:06:14.029> like<00:06:14.240> on<00:06:14.509> the<00:06:14.599> Chromebook<00:06:14.990> pixel

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020
