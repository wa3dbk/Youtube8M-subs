was<00:01:15.330> really<00:01:15.630> surprised<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.229> thought<00:01:16.500> I

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
was really surprised I thought I

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.640 
was really surprised I thought I
actually<00:01:19.229> thought<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.630> optically<00:01:21.650> not

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
actually thought that optically not

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.600 
actually thought that optically not
destroy<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> complicity<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:26.400> nest

destroy a complicity in it in a nest

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.070 
destroy a complicity in it in a nest
indeed<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.210> thought<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.540> would<00:01:27.720> be<00:01:27.750> them

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
indeed but I thought they would be them

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.690 
indeed but I thought they would be them
handily<00:01:28.619> probably<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.430> 623<00:01:30.150> or<00:01:30.720> 62

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
handily probably like a 623 or 62

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.770 
handily probably like a 623 or 62
something<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.950> but<00:01:34.950> instead<00:01:35.369> they

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
something like that but instead they

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.030 
something like that but instead they
they<00:01:36.780> got<00:01:36.990> destroyed<00:01:37.439> bad<00:01:37.799> they<00:01:38.009> got

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
they got destroyed bad they got

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
believe that complexity is the best

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.380 
believe that complexity is the best
blitzing<00:02:32.700> in<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.630> world<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.030> say<00:02:36.240> they

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
blitzing in the world and I say they

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.900 
blitzing in the world and I say they
would<00:02:36.510> have<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.630> beat<00:02:36.870> them<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.710> bliss<00:02:37.980> which

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
would have to beat them in a bliss which

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.550 
would have to beat them in a bliss which
they<00:02:39.120> did<00:02:39.390> beat<00:02:39.750> him<00:02:39.840> in<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.020> blitz<00:02:40.350> blue<00:02:40.710> I

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
they did beat him in a blitz blue I

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.890 
they did beat him in a blitz blue I
guess<00:02:43.560> if<00:02:43.770> it's<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.790> Noel<00:02:45.180> ashlyn<00:02:45.570> best<00:02:45.780> out

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
guess if it's the Noel ashlyn best out

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.180 
guess if it's the Noel ashlyn best out
of<00:02:45.930> Friday<00:02:46.200> beat<00:02:46.500> him<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.770> blizzard<00:02:46.950> a

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
of Friday beat him in the blizzard a

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.120 
of Friday beat him in the blizzard a

going<00:03:41.700> against<00:03:42.030> complexity<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:44.489> then<00:03:44.610> we<00:03:44.730> get

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
going against complexity and then we get

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.320 
going against complexity and then we get
down<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.360> around<00:03:45.600> get<00:03:46.050> down<00:03:46.230> in<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.530> game<00:03:47.330> he

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
there I think so how bad how early in

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.730 
there I think so how bad how early in
Viet<00:04:44.630> got<00:04:44.930> put<00:04:45.200> out<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:46.460> it<00:04:46.580> was<00:04:46.640> like<00:04:46.910> hey
