which<00:02:07.890> i<00:02:08.190> think<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.580> Michael's<00:02:08.940> brand<00:02:09.209> anyway

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
which i think is Michael's brand anyway

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.680 
which i think is Michael's brand anyway
isn't<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.899> loops<00:02:10.200> &amp;<00:02:10.379> threads<00:02:10.430> and<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:12.360> mean<00:02:12.510> it's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
isn't it loops &amp; threads and I mean it's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.530 
isn't it loops &amp; threads and I mean it's
actually<00:02:12.989> really<00:02:13.379> nice

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
actually really nice

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.890 
actually really nice
yarn<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:15.900> super<00:02:16.290> bulky<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:20.900> 50%

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
yarn it is super bulky and it is 50%

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.990 
yarn it is super bulky and it is 50%
wool<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:23.040> 50%<00:02:23.730> acrylic<00:02:24.019> so<00:02:25.019> it<00:02:25.500> has<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.580> similar

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
wool in 50% acrylic so it has a similar

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.030 
wool in 50% acrylic so it has a similar
consistency<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.930> wool<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.379> you're<00:02:28.560> used

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
consistency to the wool that you're used

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.309 
consistency to the wool that you're used
to<00:02:29.159> seeing<00:02:29.400> but<00:02:29.640> then<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.879> also<00:02:30.000> has<00:02:30.239> an<00:02:30.599> extra

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
to seeing but then it also has an extra

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.289 
to seeing but then it also has an extra
softness<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:32.099> those<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.670> who<00:02:32.940> are<00:02:33.090> like

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
hives so that's really it's nice it was

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.550 
hives so that's really it's nice it was
like<00:02:39.900> around<00:02:40.079> the<00:02:40.379> $7<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> ball<00:02:41.510> um<00:02:42.569> despite<00:02:43.440> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
like around the $7 a ball um despite the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.220 
like around the $7 a ball um despite the
fact<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:43.980> did<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.459> coupon<00:02:44.930> whatever<00:02:45.930> I

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
fact that I did have a coupon whatever I

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.080 
fact that I did have a coupon whatever I
mean<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.040> not<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.220> most<00:02:47.250> expensive<00:02:47.610> yarn<00:02:48.000> I

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
mean it's not the most expensive yarn I

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.180 
mean it's not the most expensive yarn I
purchased<00:02:48.569> so<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:49.230> guess<00:02:49.440> I've<00:02:49.590> got<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.890> going

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
purchased so I guess I've got that going

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.440 
purchased so I guess I've got that going
for<00:02:50.220> me<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:51.410> if<00:02:52.410> there's<00:02:52.920> 90<00:02:53.430> yards<00:02:53.640> per<00:02:54.239> ball

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
for me and if there's 90 yards per ball

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
for me and if there's 90 yards per ball
the<00:02:55.440> pattern<00:02:55.799> calls<00:02:56.310> for<00:02:56.549> like<00:02:57.150> between<00:02:57.900> 400

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
the pattern calls for like between 400

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.050 
the pattern calls for like between 400
and<00:02:58.530> 430<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.250> just<00:02:59.459> got<00:02:59.609> five<00:02:59.849> of<00:03:00.060> these<00:03:00.180> so

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
and 430 so I just got five of these so

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.610 
and 430 so I just got five of these so
yeah<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.090> hope<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.660> like<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.989> thing<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.440> it's

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
yeah I hope I like this thing this it's

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.770 
yeah I hope I like this thing this it's
kind<00:03:04.829> of<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.980> financial<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.730> time<00:03:06.269> investment

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
kind of a financial and time investment

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.110 
kind of a financial and time investment
um<00:03:07.459> we'll<00:03:08.459> see<00:03:08.670> how<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:08.940> goes

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
um we'll see how it goes

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.690 
um we'll see how it goes

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.740 

something<00:03:18.690> interesting<00:03:20.120> do<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.209> think<00:03:21.480> you

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
something interesting do you think you

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
clearly but I mean there's some case

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.690 
clearly but I mean there's some case
they<00:03:27.000> have<00:03:27.209> other<00:03:27.599> colors<00:03:27.810> of<00:03:27.959> grey<00:03:30.680> pewter<00:03:31.700> so

you're<00:06:15.600> looking<00:06:15.720> for<00:06:16.020> something<00:06:16.230> specific

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
you're looking for something specific

you're looking for something specific
they<00:06:17.340> kind<00:06:17.700> of<00:06:17.880> cut<00:06:18.330> themselves<00:06:18.930> out<00:06:19.080> of<00:06:19.320> the

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
they kind of cut themselves out of the

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.210 
they kind of cut themselves out of the
out<00:06:20.730> of<00:06:20.790> the<00:06:20.970> loops<00:06:21.300> I<00:06:21.810> don't<00:06:22.500> know<00:06:22.880> and<00:06:23.880> then

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
out of the loops I don't know and then

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.300 
out of the loops I don't know and then
my<00:06:26.390> friend<00:06:27.390> of<00:06:27.510> mine<00:06:27.660> saw<00:06:28.170> those<00:06:28.620> mitts<00:06:29.010> that<00:06:29.220> I

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
my friend of mine saw those mitts that I

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.040 
my friend of mine saw those mitts that I
made<00:06:29.640> and<00:06:30.000> so<00:06:30.150> she<00:06:30.210> asked<00:06:30.570> if<00:06:30.630> I<00:06:30.690> could<00:06:30.750> make<00:06:31.020> a

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
made and so she asked if I could make a

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.040 
made and so she asked if I could make a
set<00:06:31.320> for<00:06:31.530> her<00:06:31.620> daughter<00:06:31.950> and<00:06:32.570> in<00:06:33.570> either

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
set for her daughter and in either

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.660 
set for her daughter and in either
purple<00:06:34.410> or<00:06:34.500> pink<00:06:34.530> and<00:06:34.890> I<00:06:34.980> found<00:06:35.190> this<00:06:35.370> color

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
purple or pink and I found this color

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:36.430 
purple or pink and I found this color
and<00:06:35.880> it<00:06:35.970> was<00:06:36.090> on

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
and it was on

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.020 
and it was on
for<00:06:36.920> like<00:06:37.600> 250<00:06:38.600> and<00:06:39.430> it's<00:06:40.430> the<00:06:40.670> loops<00:06:40.880> &amp;

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
for like 250 and it's the loops &amp;

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.040 
for like 250 and it's the loops &amp;
threads<00:06:41.060> will<00:06:41.900> like<00:06:42.170> and<00:06:42.740> it<00:06:42.860> is<00:06:42.980> so<00:06:43.280> soft<00:06:44.050> like

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
threads will like and it is so soft like

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.360 
threads will like and it is so soft like
I<00:06:45.170> don't<00:06:45.230> even<00:06:45.380> know<00:06:45.470> how<00:06:45.740> to<00:06:45.770> describe<00:06:45.950> it

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
I don't even know how to describe it

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.310 
I don't even know how to describe it
it's<00:06:46.490> just<00:06:46.610> it's<00:06:46.850> so<00:06:47.090> soft<00:06:47.390> and<00:06:47.690> it's<00:06:47.810> like<00:06:48.170> the

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.320 
it's just it's so soft and it's like the

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.880 
it's just it's so soft and it's like the
right

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
right

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.450 
right
I<00:06:48.920> think<00:06:49.580> it's<00:06:49.730> fingering<00:06:50.680> which<00:06:51.680> is<00:06:51.890> what<00:06:52.160> the

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460 
I think it's fingering which is what the

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.560 
I think it's fingering which is what the
m<00:06:53.260> superfine<00:06:54.820> which<00:06:55.820> is<00:06:56.000> what<00:06:56.240> the<00:06:56.360> myths

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.570 
m superfine which is what the myths

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.570 
m superfine which is what the myths
called<00:06:56.870> for<00:06:57.170> and<00:06:57.560> especially<00:06:58.220> since<00:06:58.430> it's

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:58.580 
called for and especially since it's

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.660 
called for and especially since it's
like<00:06:58.790> a<00:06:59.030> kids<00:06:59.410> sized<00:07:00.410> one<00:07:00.800> I<00:07:00.830> feel<00:07:01.520> like

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:01.670 
like a kids sized one I feel like

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.710 
like a kids sized one I feel like
thinners<00:07:01.970> fine

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 
thinners fine

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.220 
thinners fine
um<00:07:04.060> so<00:07:05.060> let's<00:07:05.240> see<00:07:05.330> how<00:07:05.480> that<00:07:05.540> goes

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.230 
um so let's see how that goes

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.230 
um so let's see how that goes
she's<00:07:06.620> going<00:07:06.980> to<00:07:07.130> trace<00:07:07.490> me<00:07:07.700> her<00:07:07.910> daughter's

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 
she's going to trace me her daughter's

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.980 
she's going to trace me her daughter's
hand<00:07:08.510> so<00:07:08.930> I<00:07:08.960> can<00:07:09.940> try<00:07:10.940> and<00:07:11.000> make<00:07:11.210> it<00:07:11.330> fit<00:07:11.690> I

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
hand so I can try and make it fit I

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.050 
hand so I can try and make it fit I
don't<00:07:12.500> really<00:07:12.680> know<00:07:12.890> what<00:07:13.100> I'm<00:07:13.220> doing<00:07:13.850> but

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
don't really know what I'm doing but

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.810 
don't really know what I'm doing but
we'll<00:07:14.690> see<00:07:14.900> we'll<00:07:15.320> see<00:07:15.350> what<00:07:15.590> happens<00:07:15.890> so<00:07:16.220> yeah

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:16.820

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550 
nylon so I don't know it just feels so

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:38.770 
nylon so I don't know it just feels so
nice<00:07:32.830> and<00:07:34.690> that's<00:07:36.910> that's<00:07:37.910> it<00:07:38.210> for<00:07:38.450> my<00:07:38.540> yarn

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:38.780 
nice and that's that's it for my yarn
