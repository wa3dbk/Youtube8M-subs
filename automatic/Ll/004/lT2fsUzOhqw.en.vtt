00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.530
 tell me about the children 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.770
 the actor hal c 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.700
 you know about everything 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:36.020
 you took them out of the minds of 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.379
 children is more permeable to the doctrine 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.309
 to the record the record stands much better 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.129
 transformations 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:47.530
 we created the supreme soldier 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.640
 and thanks to our success 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.330
 we were ready during the invasion 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.330
 covenants 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.420
 doctoral is changing the story 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.980
 in your favor and you know you 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.510
 have created the spartan to crush the 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.750
 human rebellion not to fight 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.750
 the covenants 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.190
 when the world starts to fall the 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.450
 rival like tablecloth and spartan was the 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.510
 only thing that can prevent 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.250
 the extinction of the same person then 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.820
 did not really care 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:26.120
 why it was created you estimate 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:30.520
 therefore the choice is justified my work 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.520
 to save the human race 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.549
 do you think that the lack of humanity of 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.549
 spartan ago contributed 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:47.560
 what are you looking for I've seen spies from 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.439
 the navy before you but you are 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.869
 different the spartan had some 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.909
 slightly sociopathic tendencies side 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.729
 socialization and verbalize they have 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.299
 demonstrates absolute efficiency is 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.159
 in danger 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.880
 it's me who provided the tools that 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.190
 have allowed so much efficiency but is it 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.790
 that you think the major has succeeded 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.019
 because basically they were broken and 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.019
 do well john in this story 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.800
 you want to replace it 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:28.210
 the major died without a record told him 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.000
 that he is missing 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.900
 catherine 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.760
 the spartan remains whose arm 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.870
 your mistake is to consider 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.209
 Spain like military equipment 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:47.100
 but spartan according to the evolution of 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:51.560
 humans our destiny as a species 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:57.770
 do not underestimate them and especially 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.770
 especially do not underestimate them
