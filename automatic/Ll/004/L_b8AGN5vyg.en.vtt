00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.650
 Now I'm the babe runs in the category 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.849
 85 I have 14 years practical motocross ago 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.879
 two years 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.919
 but I like it a long time ago and 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.420
 We are training hard to do good 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.860
 role at departmental level as 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.650
 national and the year continue to the side it 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.420
 finds in this circuit more than anything 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.010
 It has been an initiative of the family 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.040
 from no one 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:32.930
 that at the initiative of having friends here 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.580
 training sharing there is like a 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.120
 complex actually we what 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.000
 we call like that 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.149
 already when we met him the layout and 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.290
 it was really a big part of the circuit 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.940
 very very defined and we have a group 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.640
 called apart from the group of the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.839
 association that the time of this group 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.750
 cynthia cas bolivia that with that friends 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.730
 we have come to 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.920
 Give a little grain of sand to 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.970
 can do it as a science lung 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.670
 wheelbarrow and hoes for rake 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.340
 pilots among them a lot have been 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.560
 sacrificed and good after the dad don 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.780
 Javier Javier promoted everything we 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.520
 it was the machinery to be able to do all 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.340
 what are the structural changes 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.740
 for this circuit the idea of ​​this 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.300
 circuit of making a modern circuit 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:34.170
 because on a large scale you want to take out and 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.960
 project the pilot of the scuderia diego 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.050
 nor to be able to have in competitions 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.530
 international and soon there will be 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.649
 maybe a tip in ecuador and it's the base 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.870
 of training to be able to take it to 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.940
 good government 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.710
 of the circuit this is very technical 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.040
 I imagine that of what little there is in 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.320
 Bolivia because it has so many jumps 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.230
 as motocross it seems more super 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.290
 chrome is very technical and it brings you out more 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.770
 resistance and it's much better that way for ya 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.620
 the others jump the easiest 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.050
 the idea of making the circuit is born 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.720
 because of the need we had because 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.480
 this place is a place of 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.130
 training was always like that from 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.790
 his participations in bicycles 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.310
 brother of unida 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.099
 come here to train a little bit 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.540
 physical did makes trot bicycle 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.010
 swimming pool and the only thing that was missing 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.030
 it was the circuit it was really a 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:45.980
 simple tracing and we saw the needs 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.400
 to improve his technique in the engine 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.560
 and that's why we started doing 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.310
 little by little first a table after a 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.750
 double the curves we started to fix and 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.349
 thank god now we have a nice 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.940
 circuit where where we are sure that 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.490
 will improve the level of diego 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.460
 my people this circuit we liked 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.760
 very much first it began was a path 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.920
 of a motorcycle later and to us 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.300
 We talk to friends as Sandra wishes 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.730
 we have a group of friends that we say 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.610
 the jackass and we started to come to 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.070
 work to fight to make him and the 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.650
 attitude has already begun to take shape 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.290
 circuit 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.819
 and already my dad saw that he was very 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.640
 excited us to have the 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.790
 circuit there apart from love and contract 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.299
 some machines we take land 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.489
 we stopped when he joined the group of 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.109
 friends that are really pilots is not 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.170
 true the same as the transition 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.180
 friends of ourselves 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:51.220
 we called for example we came here 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.530
 8 in the morning and we did not go at 6 7 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.819
 at night we were all day at 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.359
 12 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.670
 good rest let's go to the afternoon we had 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:05.379
 like that as it is vulgarly said 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:09.010
 a mason's dinner soda and bread because 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.900
 good as they were pure boys and good 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.500
 we had that predisposition of 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.410
 follow what we had this initiate and 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.449
 the pool was the celebration of this 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.190
 day of work all day we hundred 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.340
 to work all day then like that 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.050
 we went out here there are pilots of 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.080
 popularity of the association they have come 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.870
 to work as they say 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.569
 as I say that a bryant for the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.210
 wheelbarrow and doing some pulses up 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:39.180
 that already good after we had the help of 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.849
 the dads that put us machinery and 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.650
 it's already finished in what's right now and 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.210
 that is not yet a circuit anymore 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.159
 is currently finished because there 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.349
 many things that still think 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:51.650
 implement later but there are already 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:54.650
 old people we were already satisfied so 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.650
 accomplished 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.710
 i
