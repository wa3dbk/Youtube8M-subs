see there so for the first speaker start
off<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.210> your<00:01:24.360> base<00:01:24.480> plate<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:25.050> this

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.130

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.980 

okay<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:35.610> that's<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:36.000> base<00:01:36.180> point<00:01:36.479> for<00:01:36.630> your

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
okay so that's your base point for your

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.490 
okay so that's your base point for your
speaker<00:01:37.430> start<00:01:38.430> by<00:01:38.580> putting<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.240> piece<00:01:39.659> on

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
speaker start by putting this piece on

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.600 
speaker start by putting this piece on
top<00:01:41.750> in<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.050> front<00:01:43.470> right<00:01:43.710> hand<00:01:43.979> corner<00:01:44.340> like

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
top in the front right hand corner like

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.210 
top in the front right hand corner like
that<00:01:46.820> next<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.450> take<00:01:48.479> your<00:01:48.990> 1<00:01:49.440> by<00:01:49.590> 2<00:01:49.650> norm<00:01:50.010> work

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that next you take your 1 by 2 norm work

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.870 
that next you take your 1 by 2 norm work
let's<00:01:50.940> take<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.240> behind<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.869> as<00:01:52.040> so<00:01:54.740> then<00:01:55.880> you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
let's take it behind it as so then you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.140 
let's take it behind it as so then you
take<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:58.280> brick<00:01:59.280> with<00:01:59.460> holes<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.030> like

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
take your brick with holes in it like

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.080 
take your brick with holes in it like
that<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.900> you<00:02:01.050> stick<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.619> top<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.460> your<00:02:02.790> 1

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that and you stick it on top of your 1

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.200 
that and you stick it on top of your 1
by<00:02:03.240> 2<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.159> should<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.759> looking<00:02:06.149> like

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
by 2 so you should get it looking like

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:16.100 
by 2 so you should get it looking like
that<00:02:07.190> then<00:02:10.430> take<00:02:12.050> three<00:02:13.050> pieces<00:02:13.320> here

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.680 

so<00:02:16.650> both<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.070> your<00:02:17.340> two<00:02:17.550> by<00:02:17.790> twos<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.420> your

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
so both of your two by twos and your

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.000 
so both of your two by twos and your
grill<00:02:18.930> piece<00:02:19.110> you're<00:02:19.980> gonna<00:02:20.070> stack<00:02:21.710> these<00:02:22.710> up

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
grill piece you're gonna stack these up

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:32.270 
grill piece you're gonna stack these up
as<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:25.130> they<00:02:26.130> then<00:02:27.920> fit<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.730> piece<00:02:31.280> so

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
as so and they then fit on that piece so

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.320 
as so and they then fit on that piece so
starting<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.030> look<00:02:33.120> like<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.360> speaker<00:02:33.720> already

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
thin so I added that in to make it look

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.400 
thin so I added that in to make it look
like<00:04:31.190> it<00:04:31.370> had<00:04:31.490> more<00:04:31.729> depth<00:04:31.940> to<00:04:32.030> it<00:04:32.380> okay<00:04:33.380> guys

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
speakers are projecting the sound so you

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.000 
speakers are projecting the sound so you
could<00:05:21.760> use<00:05:21.940> that<00:05:22.120> as<00:05:22.270> like<00:05:22.480> a<00:05:22.510> little<00:05:22.800> thing<00:05:23.800> in
