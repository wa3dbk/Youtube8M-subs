controller on top of the battery in the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.350 
controller on top of the battery in the
back<00:00:33.650> of<00:00:33.829> the<00:00:33.920> bike<00:00:34.100> there's<00:00:35.059> a<00:00:35.150> lot<00:00:35.329> of

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
back of the bike there's a lot of

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.500 
back of the bike there's a lot of
different<00:00:35.510> ways<00:00:35.870> to<00:00:35.899> install<00:00:36.470> a<00:00:36.500> controller

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
different ways to install a controller

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.670 
different ways to install a controller
let's<00:00:38.510> have<00:00:38.629> just<00:00:38.809> a<00:00:38.870> little<00:00:39.140> closer<00:00:39.290> look<00:00:39.589> at

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
let's have just a little closer look at

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.040 
let's have just a little closer look at
this<00:00:39.829> I'm<00:00:40.640> just<00:00:40.879> using<00:00:41.089> the<00:00:41.269> same<00:00:41.449> straps<00:00:41.870> that

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
this I'm just using the same straps that

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.869 
this I'm just using the same straps that
are<00:00:42.110> holding<00:00:42.260> down<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.649> battery<00:00:43.070> to<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:43.610> rack

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
are holding down the battery to the rack

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.509 
are holding down the battery to the rack
to<00:00:44.629> hold<00:00:44.839> down<00:00:45.199> the<00:00:45.470> controller<00:00:45.829> to<00:00:46.489> the

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
to hold down the controller to the

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.450 
to hold down the controller to the
battery<00:00:47.530> where<00:00:48.530> you<00:00:48.679> put<00:00:48.859> the<00:00:48.949> controller<00:00:49.219> on

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
battery where you put the controller on

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.910 
battery where you put the controller on
the<00:00:49.579> bike<00:00:49.730> is<00:00:50.000> very<00:00:50.300> much<00:00:50.539> specific<00:00:51.079> to<00:00:51.559> your

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
the bike is very much specific to your

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.799 
the bike is very much specific to your
project<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:52.579> your<00:00:52.640> bike<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.359> size<00:00:53.600> the

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
project and your bike and the size the

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.360 
project and your bike and the size the
controller<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:54.559> many<00:00:54.800> number<00:00:55.129> of<00:00:55.160> other

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
controller and many number of other

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.110 
controller and many number of other
things<00:00:55.629> we<00:00:56.629> use<00:00:56.750> a<00:00:56.780> lot<00:00:57.050> of<00:00:57.100> zip<00:00:58.100> ties<00:00:58.339> to<00:00:58.699> hold

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
things we use a lot of zip ties to hold

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.220 
things we use a lot of zip ties to hold
them<00:00:59.239> down<00:00:59.269> in<00:00:59.629> different<00:00:59.899> parts<00:01:00.019> of<00:01:00.170> the

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
them down in different parts of the

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.819 
them down in different parts of the
frame<00:01:00.469> straps<00:01:01.190> etc<00:01:02.289> sometimes<00:01:03.289> they<00:01:03.589> fit

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
frame straps etc sometimes they fit

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.100 
frame straps etc sometimes they fit
inside<00:01:04.009> of<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:04.399> bag<00:01:04.610> but<00:01:05.179> be<00:01:05.360> aware<00:01:05.449> that<00:01:05.990> the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
inside of a bag but be aware that the

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.930 
inside of a bag but be aware that the
controller<00:01:06.470> does<00:01:06.740> generate<00:01:07.160> heat<00:01:07.399> and<00:01:07.580> that's

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
controller does generate heat and that's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.490 
controller does generate heat and that's
its<00:01:08.119> nature<00:01:08.420> it<00:01:08.539> will<00:01:08.720> always<00:01:08.929> generate<00:01:09.380> heat

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
its nature it will always generate heat

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.660 
its nature it will always generate heat
there's<00:01:09.710> nothing<00:01:10.009> wrong<00:01:10.220> with<00:01:10.280> your

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
there's nothing wrong with your

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.060 
there's nothing wrong with your
controller<00:01:11.000> heating<00:01:11.300> up<00:01:11.500> this<00:01:12.500> black<00:01:12.770> set<00:01:12.979> of

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
controller heating up this black set of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.710 
controller heating up this black set of
ridges<00:01:13.310> on<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.460> top<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:13.940> a<00:01:13.970> heat<00:01:14.210> sink<00:01:14.420> for

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
ridges on the top is a heat sink for

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.749 
ridges on the top is a heat sink for
cooling<00:01:14.990> meant<00:01:15.679> to<00:01:15.770> have<00:01:15.890> air<00:01:16.130> flow<00:01:16.369> over<00:01:16.670> it

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
cooling meant to have air flow over it

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.460 
cooling meant to have air flow over it
and<00:01:16.909> carry<00:01:17.149> heat<00:01:17.450> away<00:01:17.600> from<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.020> controller

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
and carry heat away from the controller

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.800 
and carry heat away from the controller
in<00:01:19.399> this<00:01:19.580> case<00:01:19.789> it's<00:01:20.030> not<00:01:20.179> going<00:01:20.479> to<00:01:20.540> generate

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
in this case it's not going to generate

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.929 
in this case it's not going to generate
enough<00:01:21.079> heat<00:01:21.110> to<00:01:21.320> be<00:01:21.470> melting<00:01:21.860> straps<00:01:22.220> or

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
enough heat to be melting straps or

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.010 
enough heat to be melting straps or
anything<00:01:23.149> like<00:01:23.240> that<00:01:23.329> it's<00:01:23.600> okay<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:23.960> have

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
anything like that it's okay to have

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.840 
anything like that it's okay to have
things<00:01:24.380> come<00:01:24.619> in<00:01:24.740> contact<00:01:25.009> with<00:01:25.399> it<00:01:25.640> because

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
things come in contact with it because

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.730 
things come in contact with it because
it<00:01:26.119> has<00:01:26.240> an<00:01:26.390> internal<00:01:26.780> thermal<00:01:27.200> breaker<00:01:27.470> that

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
it has an internal thermal breaker that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.910 
it has an internal thermal breaker that
will<00:01:27.860> shut<00:01:28.009> it<00:01:28.130> down<00:01:28.250> before<00:01:28.430> it<00:01:28.610> gets<00:01:28.880> too<00:01:29.119> hot

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
will shut it down before it gets too hot

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.319 
will shut it down before it gets too hot
the<00:01:30.920> next<00:01:31.189> step<00:01:31.369> is<00:01:31.579> to<00:01:31.640> wire<00:01:32.000> up<00:01:32.030> the

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
the next step is to wire up the

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.830 
the next step is to wire up the
controller<00:01:33.520> nice<00:01:34.520> thing<00:01:34.759> about<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:35.060> BMC<00:01:35.570> kit

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
controller nice thing about the BMC kit

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.410 
controller nice thing about the BMC kit
is<00:01:36.049> all<00:01:36.439> of<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.649> connectors<00:01:37.130> are<00:01:37.490> unique<00:01:38.149> so

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
is all of the connectors are unique so

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.819 
is all of the connectors are unique so
you're<00:01:38.570> not<00:01:38.689> going<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:38.930> accidentally<00:01:39.409> plug<00:01:39.680> in

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
you're not going to accidentally plug in

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.039 
you're not going to accidentally plug in
anything<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.340> anything<00:01:40.579> else<00:01:40.899> well<00:01:41.899> it's

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
anything to anything else well it's

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.569 
anything to anything else well it's
self-explanatory<00:01:42.380> it's<00:01:42.950> still<00:01:43.130> nice<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.310> go

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
self-explanatory it's still nice to go

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.389 
self-explanatory it's still nice to go
over<00:01:43.909> here<00:01:44.439> this<00:01:45.439> is<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.680> throttle<00:01:46.039> control

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
over here this is the throttle control

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.920 
over here this is the throttle control
to<00:01:47.000> 4-pin<00:01:47.420> connector<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:49.750> you'll<00:01:50.750> see

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
to 4-pin connector and you'll see

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.480 
to 4-pin connector and you'll see
there's<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.170> tab<00:01:51.409> on<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:51.710> top<00:01:51.799> of<00:01:52.189> this<00:01:52.310> one

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
there's a tab on the top of this one
