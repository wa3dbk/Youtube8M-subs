00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 I welcome you for my 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.890
 new route int 1 we start everything 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.750
 first by moisturizing his face with a 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.929
 cream me she is special for them 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.699
 mixed to oily skin followed by cream 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.699
 we put a primeur or a base of complexion 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.160
 as you prefer and we come to the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.570
 put on all the face to mitigate 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.570
 ports and high schools skin texture 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.700
 I chose express aluminÃ© easing 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.700
 because I wanted a complexion 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.050
 then comes the mineral foundation 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.930
 contrary to what we might think 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.510
 it's still pretty sparing then 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.610
 the goal is to turn turn 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.890
 to heat the material that makes that 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.070
 when applied it turns into a 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.940
 a little bit like a cream and she 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.940
 will cover the face 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.000
 So the soap opera is applied with 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.480
 circular movements and we sweep the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.590
 skin we do that until I 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.680
 take it either be adequate and you can 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:39.680
 find his brush if we judge that the 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.900
 Courance is not good enough I 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.840
 prefer to put a thin layer the beginning 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.520
 since after we will put an anti 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.370
 dark circles that will cover the redness so 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.630
 I put a thin layer and then on 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:58.130
 the dark circles and I'm going to add a 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.660
 touch to have a good race I 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.640
 find it really important to good 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.910
 sweep work the material on the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.910
 face 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.640
 as anti dark circles I use the pool 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.250
 cover to try to make it the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.200
 more possible the metro or my tracks 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.630
 acne 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.110
 all you want good scars 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.440
 there are buttons that are formed 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.330
 so I camouflage I know very well that 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.209
 it will be impossible to have a result 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.209
 natural by camouflaging completely 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.220
 as I explained previously 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.530
 I will have a layer of background 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.050
 of complexion or I tap on the concealer 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.120
 and then after I come swept with 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.120
 the prominent circular on my face 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.420
 we know this step a little bit 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.680
 we try to sculpt the visual with a 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.209
 hard tan a little chestnut avoid 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.450
 something orange because that 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:39.230
 could very quickly make a cajon and 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:40.730
 geffray management a pink blush which is a 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.760
 little goes everywhere and that is also 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.859
 mineral so I decided to use the 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.930
 same principle as for the mark by 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.209
 mineral need to turn back turned 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.159
 to sing the project for after the 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.950
 put on my days and I find that 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.530
 it's a pretty natural and very 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:07.189
 young he sees himself not too much in camera but 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:09.379
 in truth he will see more for me the 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.549
 result is pleasant and natural so I 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.970
 leave you to a next video at 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.970
