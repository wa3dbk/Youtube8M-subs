00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hi everybody, Santiago, asking for a doctor. 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.850
 apple.com br br 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.680
 and this video about the layout of 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.630
 numeric keypad if I am doing 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.139
 this video already has in the video of 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.549
 Yes, on my channel, only with the system 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.410
 10.6 how we are with 10 points 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.580
 name was a little different have 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.350
 some people are having some 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.050
 Doubts, so I'm making a video. 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.400
 again on the same subject is when 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.250
 We set up the machine then 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.109
 generally puts the Brazilian layout is 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.000
 which is most obvious when we make the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.529
 that initial configuration 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.510
 but that does not allow us to do 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.219
 the seats correctly if you have 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.540
 than using some weird shortcuts to 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.040
 to be able to seat 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.930
 We can use the keyboard of the way 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.100
 that is painted when the keyboard is 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.800
 International 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.200
 or on the right side of the letter l you 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.059
 has the colon and semicolon the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.600
 What are you going to do? Go there in the menu. 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.879
 apple zin in system preferences 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.829
 and then we go into a man that region 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.949
 here in the guild at the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.989
 first line of icons clicked here 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.699
 sit on this screen and not on this button here 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.549
 below you have the preferences of the 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.770
 Keyboard keyboard clicked preferably 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.530
 here you have text keyboard tab 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.869
 shortcuts and keyboard layout 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.540
 click on keyboard lessons and then you go 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.939
 have a bar to the left here with the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.790
 layouts and on the right you already have a 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.500
 to see the snow keyboard already has the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.530
 how this layout is viewed 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.270
 how does he work on the case as we 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.950
 chose the Brazilian here initially 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.229
 It seems like everything is ok but if you 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.170
 try to put the acute accent that is this 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.630
 here the circumflex that I do not know you 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.070
 will not be going to go wrong that the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.320
 people have to do here then we 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.540
 you can click the button here more 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.799
 to open the layout options 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.140
 that we have 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.079
 and here we have the layouts everyone is 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.360
 separated by what language and in the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.740
 the top of this line is the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.990
 layouts we used 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.180
 recently in my case I'm going 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.950
 I 'll go there in Portuguese only to 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.140
 show you how it works 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.119
 so let's go there until the Portuguese letter p 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.680
 Only you entered Portuguese. 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.420
 we have these three options the Brazilian 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.929
 which is what we are using here 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.000
 Now the Brazilian bnt two 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.830
 difference in brazilian brazilian to pnt 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.500
 two is that you have 16 idyll 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.230
 next to him then so are you 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.540
 configure this option instead of you 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.250
 press the semicolon the colon 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.160
 when you hit you will leave will 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.780
 go out on your mac then not 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.250
 is most appropriate because it is different from 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.200
 what are you seeing, the ideal is you? 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.030
 see the keyboard and know exactly what 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.740
 you need to tighten 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.430
 so what I'm going to do back there for 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.140
 the top I will choose English and here I 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.000
 I'm going to put the United States 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.100
 international pc 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.680
 I selected state in wool and international 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.050
 pc click add add it 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.420
 put the layout here 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.660
 I have two layouts right when I'm 26 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.060
 October celi active in the menu bar at the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.220
 is that this option that the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.850
 show the keyboard blessed in the 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.010
 menu 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.320
 here you can hide the real or 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.930
 show again and you have option 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.000
 easy to change the keyboard lÃ©o 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.680
 any time around here 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.350
 if I do not want Brazilian layout because 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.709
 It does not suit me, I'll select it and click on it. 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.200
 - soon it erases and automatically it 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.320
 take the option here because there is no other 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.510
 layout for people to switch and now 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.750
 You're working just fine if I 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.720
 I came here for example spotlight and tighten 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.350
 eg shift OA or 6 and only then 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.700
 tighten the sharp accent and the ones I get 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.650
 the cecid island 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.330
 Okay, so now it's the way it is 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.209
 painted it's just you look at the keyboard 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.140
 that you can type perfectly 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.030
 OK 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.030
 A big hug until the next
