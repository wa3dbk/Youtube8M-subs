00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
circles together with two lines that

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.930 
circles together with two lines that
have<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> slight<00:00:37.380> curve<00:00:37.650> in<00:00:37.770> them<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.700> next

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
have a slight curve in them the next

have a slight curve in them the next
thing<00:00:39.090> we<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.630> draw<00:00:39.810> two<00:00:40.110> guide<00:00:40.380> lines

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
thing we can do is draw two guide lines

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.200 
thing we can do is draw two guide lines
but<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.070> want<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.399> guys<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> press<00:00:41.880> very

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
lightly the first guide line is going to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.400 
lightly the first guide line is going to
go<00:00:44.370> across<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.700> first<00:00:45.180> circle<00:00:45.630> and<00:00:45.810> the<00:00:46.140> next

the side like this on both sides we can

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:40.339 
the side like this on both sides we can
draw<00:01:39.029> a<00:01:39.060> little<00:01:39.270> line<00:01:39.389> that<00:01:39.689> comes<00:01:39.840> down<00:01:40.079> both

00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:40.349 
draw a little line that comes down both

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:42.559 
draw a little line that comes down both
those<00:01:40.590> lines<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.219> a<00:01:41.880> line<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.240> comes<00:01:42.359> all

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
those lines and a line that comes all

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.599 
those lines and a line that comes all
the<00:01:42.689> way<00:01:42.719> in<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.799> time<00:01:44.039> to<00:01:44.189> connect<00:01:44.429> those

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
the way in it's time to connect those

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.519 
the way in it's time to connect those
feet<00:01:44.789> together<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.299> an<00:01:45.420> upside-down<00:01:45.719> Y<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:46.529 
feet together with an upside-down Y and

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:48.889 
feet together with an upside-down Y and
then<00:01:47.039> we<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.279> add<00:01:47.399> some<00:01:47.429> details<00:01:47.999> a<00:01:48.270> line<00:01:48.749> that

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
then we can add some details a line that

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.389 
then we can add some details a line that
goes<00:01:48.959> across<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.380> front<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.859> his<00:01:49.950> foot<00:01:50.219> a

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
goes across the front of his foot a

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.459 
goes across the front of his foot a
little<00:01:51.029> line<00:01:51.179> that<00:01:51.359> comes<00:01:51.509> down<00:01:51.719> and<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.200> little

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
little line that comes down and a little

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.230 
little line that comes down and a little
line<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.799> goes<00:01:52.919> in<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.639> helps<00:01:53.969> make<00:01:54.119> his

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
line that goes in this helps make his

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.069 
line that goes in this helps make his
feet<00:01:54.450> look<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.749> little<00:01:54.869> more

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
feet look a little more

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.139 
feet look a little more
three-dimensional<00:01:55.889> now<00:01:56.459> the<00:01:56.520> last<00:01:56.789> thing<00:01:56.939> we

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
three-dimensional now the last thing we

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.179 
three-dimensional now the last thing we
need<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.389> draw<00:01:57.599> is<00:01:57.840> his<00:01:58.109> belly<00:01:58.349> so<00:01:58.950> I'm<00:01:59.069> going

need to draw is his belly so I'm going
to<00:01:59.249> draw<00:01:59.399> one<00:01:59.429> line<00:01:59.669> that<00:01:59.880> comes<00:02:00.239> out

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:00.389 
to draw one line that comes out

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:02.539 
to draw one line that comes out
underneath<00:02:00.840> his<00:02:00.989> beak<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.439> slowly<00:02:02.009> curves<00:02:02.369> out

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
underneath his beak it slowly curves out

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.399 
underneath his beak it slowly curves out
and<00:02:02.849> curves<00:02:03.119> right

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
and curves right

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.200 
and curves right
back<00:02:03.499> in<00:02:03.679> at<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:03.829> bottom<00:02:04.009> you<00:02:04.609> can<00:02:04.640> do<00:02:04.909> that<00:02:05.060> on

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
back in at the bottom you can do that on

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.809 
back in at the bottom you can do that on
both<00:02:05.390> sides<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:06.189> there<00:02:07.189> you<00:02:07.280> have<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.520> a

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
both sides and there you have it a

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.719 
both sides and there you have it a
finished<00:02:08.360> penguin<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.860> now<00:02:09.979> grab<00:02:10.129> your<00:02:10.369> pencil
