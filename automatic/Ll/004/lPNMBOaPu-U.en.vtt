00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:11.400
 Welcome to the technology 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.070
 youtube who does not know that one flies 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.660
 with his phantom two somewhere nice 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.429
 in the area around and suddenly it will 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.300
 dimly outside and then continue to fly 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.909
 it dark 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.429
 you land one looks at his recordings 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:29.489
 and thinks there, I thought so 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.890
 funny red dot on the top left and 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.329
 top right 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.280
 the lights are on there 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.680
 position lights of the quadrocopter it 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.390
 which radiate so much light and at 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.730
 twilight will be natural then 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.530
 sucked up by the lens and then go 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.480
 this weird refraction at the top left 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.150
 and top right in the picture and I thought 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.280
 me hey there must be something 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.440
 and I bought the gopro a lot 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.380
 the silver edition and that is already one 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.400
 very horny I have to say quite honestly 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.650
 there is a fat thumb up 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.960
 from me 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.100
 and that had this low light function 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.949
 that means I can also change both 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.090
 or almost darkness still really cool 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.039
 Take pictures when I go over the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.020
 city ​​over fly over or outshine 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:11.819
 that's really nice, cleverly dusky 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.020
 and dim and you can do it right 

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:15.240
 just take pictures 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.249
 with the go pro but the problem is yes 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.389
 These position lights are one 

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:20.389
 big problem and I thought so 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.579
 well mandate out there this is the key 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.530
 luck or the key to 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:34.319
 So make night video easily 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:40.130
 estate tank tape here strip up 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:43.639
 make sure you stick under the left side 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.639
 pass on the right 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.450
 and now it can already go to 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.130
 Although the red lights are on now 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.240
 still visible but essential 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.159
 weaker than before 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.159
 if now a black gazer used 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.460
 if a black body is used now 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.259
 then that is not completely gone and you 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.240
 can really sensational with it 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.380
 produce recordings i hope i could 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.520
