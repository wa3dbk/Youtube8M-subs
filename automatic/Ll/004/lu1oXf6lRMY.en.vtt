watch we try really to design something

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.759 
watch we try really to design something
which<00:00:27.150> comes<00:00:27.359> from<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.840> roots<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.349> your

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769

there is the octagonal element is going
back<00:00:37.580> to<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:37.940> lariato<00:00:38.240> which<00:00:38.600> was<00:00:38.780> introduced

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
back to the lariato which was introduced

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.420 
back to the lariato which was introduced
as<00:00:39.770> a<00:00:39.800> first<00:00:40.100> octagonal<00:00:40.670> watch<00:00:40.910> in<00:00:41.510> 75<00:00:42.250> on<00:00:43.250> the

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
diver we keep the crown at 20 because it

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.630 
diver we keep the crown at 20 because it
is<00:00:46.970> has<00:00:47.150> been<00:00:47.180> like<00:00:47.630> a<00:00:48.050> Markland<00:00:48.830> for<00:00:49.310> a<00:00:49.340> dis

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
and then you realize that it's quite a

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.270 
and then you realize that it's quite a
well<00:01:08.119> balanced<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.920> construction<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.100> then

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
well balanced the construction and then

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:19.870 
well balanced the construction and then
watch

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.450 

we<00:01:20.720> are<00:01:20.810> making<00:01:21.020> right<00:01:21.439> now<00:01:21.470> I<00:01:21.650> would<00:01:22.130> say<00:01:22.280> an

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
we are making right now I would say an

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.550 
we are making right now I would say an
evolution<00:01:23.030> for<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.420> company<00:01:23.810> bringing<00:01:24.170> I
