00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.680
 if you hold my hands the Xperia Neo from Sony Ericsson and we now 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.139
 let's see how the camera works 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.500
 Stefan Mann Lockscreen the stars 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.190
 and then I have the option on the side in the camera shots too 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.820
 to press 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.300
 and then the chamber is already on 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.670
 This is the mobile phone to a mindful 1-megapixel camera 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.809
 Feeling to give in addition I have a nice idea meat 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.699
 yes, of course, a front camera 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.610
 they would have a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.130
 the AMI NDR 8 Tor 1 megapixel camera has a 2x digital zoom 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.810
 and an autofocus 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.180
 So the king or Lechtal or smile recognition 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.070
 Switch 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.070
 a family 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.900
 and then I came here to adjust the resolution 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.480
 Witnesses will be following CERN 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.539
 and if b 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.600
 go out here 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.600
 then we have this stuff a bit 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.400
 because not always fall here in full mode 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.640
 Kenner Jeker did not miss and switch between a front camera 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.520
 the chamberlain the back on ice 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.520
 Here I can put it here he exhibited his 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.260
 and here I can think now 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.030
 I now see my dear with this camera 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.760
 a photo shoots 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.570
 and indeed, just here Dominik had to tap on the screen and 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.570
 the shutter button is pressed immediately 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.470
 then I can here again the squares of the set so always very 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.470
 looks much better place 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.880
 and if I go to my Gaddafi 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.450
 then I can get the photos that was now with places 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.190
 and 100 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.210
 I still have some photos around 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.130
 Apron made 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.790
 Kiss to Mainz 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.300
 and this Mainz with lightning 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.820
 and again a little bit the other year I try to zoom in «It is 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.149
 still a bit out of focus 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.329
 the learning aids sometimes read into the room its structure 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.179
 breathes Glatz and 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:16.059
 without a flash 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:18.289
 and again outside 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:21.399
 Zeiner with places once without places 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:24.639
 Now you do not see the big difference as a layman 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.959
 Cornelia normal a few movies food stalls 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.130
 People may name photographed again with lightning and the Herrmann 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.309
 with no lightning thunder and lightning 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.040
 then he took on 3 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.779
 at kicker figures 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:40.809
 Jena 14 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:44.119
 with the latter without lightning 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:47.119
 children 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.069
 he is dedicated to a video camera 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.050
 and this is a hardware 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.689
 Four comrades for the season can mean a HD resolution 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:57.669
 half-time 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.669
 82 million 20 pixels 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:04.489
 Therefore, I can show me Nvidia again, which I already have 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.989
 previously recorded 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.989
 the draw here 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.330
 yes 30 year old once 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.849
 filmed this character 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.870
 and I'm always according to the alarm clock by percent 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.770
 to look 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.219
 how the automatic Suma sets 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.760
 if it still really works under test runs smoothly though 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.449
 the TC now look like I'm pretty close 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:29.709
 that it still works 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.619
 alternatively sharp 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:35.629
 and also relatively fast so you have to own the boss inner city 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.119
 Set interest rates that does it all by itself 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:42.059
 Theme we have here the peculiarities 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:46.799
 Peculiarity sausage Sony Ericsson does not put much emphasis on it and what 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.009
 is the Exmor 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:49.469
 Dr then to 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.089
 who ensures that they are in the face of an improved and that is if 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:54.719
 it is dark and meaning 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.719
 step outside or when I'm in the dark room of Berne 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.480
 and manages the phone anyway, the sensor felt 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.169
 to represent reasonably good lighting conditions 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.619
 and not bad once Jens Kötz 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:10.709
 try to show her a bit so I have this box 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.599
 and in the box is dark a tick more or less 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.659
 and there's an object in there 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:19.789
 in ten countries 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.759
 I like the camera no longer makes sense 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.759
 it is dark others 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.550
 but if I am with that now 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.430
 in the sea or front gardens 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.470
 one percent Exmor r sensor then percent i see 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.150
 those were 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.590
 our little figure is hidden 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.800
 if I want to boost less then I can jump out of the chambers mode 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.800
 Hereupon one of these pictures on the right side 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:48.300
 and 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.300
 you can go in here where you can see my pictures here 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.900
 just to say the sweating so i am here in photo mode now if i am now 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.669
 also want to record a video 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.699
 I just have to go here 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.370
 pushing all this little Rieger over to say so now I'm in video mode 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.969
 then I can set different modes here 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.009
 tens of billions of beach and snow party sports night creates just such a 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.379
 portrait 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.389
 and here I can adjust the resolution again 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.069
 so our parents should have ours 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.460
 Resolution before 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.370
 furthermore, find different 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.930
 QVGA and Konya 3 percent 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.180
 then I have war again between VRR camera 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.819
 and around 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:35.460
 towards the camera 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.460
 and switch over 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.080
 Here I can set my focus mode so here stand the 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.849
 Face recognition then 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.849
 an infinite or single focus 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.589
 and a flash of a show 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.589
 if I want to start a video now so that would have 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:58.719
 on the 5th 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.719
 and then you look at her and start counting 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:08.269
 Mertes ideal Czech umbrellas temporarily researched for the 

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:10.089
 Betterment Mr. Meyer in 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:12.430
 Nolle reality screen with the 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.740
 with the lawyer threw her a nice 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.980
 that means 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.440
 that has that contrast with the moon contrast 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:21.520
 done and 4 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.570
 thus a sharp picture differently does not lead any longer to the photos 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.980
 but also for Hanna just use the complete tent client of his 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.819
 all the money really this one 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:35.370
 just because people just do not quite agree 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.169
 No, it's okay 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.310
 then I should be Thailand as you can make quite good pictures with it 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.369
 and around 

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:44.669
 through this finally this exmor 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.139
 he has sensor is that 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.740
 Ideal if you want to take some photos in a dark room
