parachutes on the back that's the best
way<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.160> explain<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:18.090> close<00:00:18.270> quarter<00:00:18.600> mile

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
way to explain it we close quarter mile

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.750 
way to explain it we close quarter mile
in<00:00:19.109> less<00:00:19.770> than<00:00:19.890> four<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.250> half<00:00:20.279> seconds

over<00:00:20.939> 330<00:00:21.539> miles<00:00:21.720> an<00:00:21.930> hour<00:00:22.020> where<00:00:22.590> my

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
over 330 miles an hour where my

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.830 
over 330 miles an hour where my
competitor<00:00:23.519> Gary<00:00:23.760> Scelzi<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.300> out<00:00:24.480> here<00:00:24.660> he

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
competitor Gary Scelzi is out here he

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.810 
competitor Gary Scelzi is out here he
goes<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> funny<00:00:25.350> car<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.830> there<00:00:26.279> they<00:00:26.310> look

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
goes a funny car and there they look

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.599 
goes a funny car and there they look
more<00:00:27.029> like<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.300> Mopar<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.949> know<00:00:29.070> Chevy<00:00:29.369> they'll

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
more like a Mopar you know Chevy they'll

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.980 
more like a Mopar you know Chevy they'll
have<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.970> body<00:00:30.240> cars<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.869> they're<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
have to be body cars and they're a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.630 
have to be body cars and they're a
little<00:00:31.109> bit<00:00:31.260> shorter<00:00:31.560> wheelbase<00:00:31.740> but<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
little bit shorter wheelbase but the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.840 
little bit shorter wheelbase but the
same<00:00:32.820> horsepower<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.750> they're<00:00:34.290> running<00:00:34.620> about

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
same horsepower so they're running about

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.170 
same horsepower so they're running about
44<00:00:35.870> 4.60<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.890> quarter<00:00:38.190> mile<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.730> they<00:00:39.030> also

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
44 4.60 in a quarter mile and they also

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.240 
44 4.60 in a quarter mile and they also
run<00:00:39.420> about<00:00:39.629> 330<00:00:40.290> miles<00:00:40.469> an<00:00:40.710> hour<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
run about 330 miles an hour so the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.369 
run about 330 miles an hour so the
speeds<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:41.969> really<00:00:42.390> close<00:00:42.629> then<00:00:43.290> we

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
speeds are really really close then we

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.080 
speeds are really really close then we
have<00:00:43.469> pro<00:00:43.770> stock<00:00:44.040> which<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.430> basically<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:45.059> a

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
have pro stock which is basically like a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.080 
have pro stock which is basically like a
gutted<00:00:45.390> car<00:00:45.890> probably<00:00:46.890> 13<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.520> 14<00:00:47.910> hundred

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
gutted car probably 13 to 14 hundred

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
gutted car probably 13 to 14 hundred
horsepower<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.870> they<00:00:49.230> run<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> set<00:00:49.800> six

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
horsepower and they run in the set six

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.610 
horsepower and they run in the set six
seconds<00:00:50.550> own<00:00:50.700> at<00:00:51.090> 200<00:00:51.629> miles<00:00:51.780> an<00:00:51.960> hour<00:00:52.110> so

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
seconds own at 200 miles an hour so
