00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
we got that so when you look at in the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.799 
we got that so when you look at in the
plane<00:00:11.580> like<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.790> died<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.030> it's<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.450> big<00:00:12.599> three

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
plane like I died so it's a big three

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.530 
plane like I died so it's a big three
points<00:00:13.759> obviously<00:00:14.759> didn't<00:00:15.000> need<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.240> be<00:00:15.330> quite

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
points obviously didn't need to be quite

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.439 
points obviously didn't need to be quite
as<00:00:15.630> hard<00:00:15.809> as<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:15.990> made<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.379> but<00:00:16.740> as<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.730> say<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
as hard as we made it but as I say the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.080 
as hard as we made it but as I say the
MPN<00:00:18.930> was<00:00:19.080> always<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.619> what<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:19.859> out<00:00:20.070> for<00:00:20.279> Alex

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
MPN was always is what was out for Alex

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.759 
MPN was always is what was out for Alex
Neal's<00:00:21.390> just<00:00:21.869> said<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.140> he<00:00:22.199> felt<00:00:22.380> perhaps

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
Neal's just said that he felt perhaps

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.769 
Neal's just said that he felt perhaps
some<00:00:23.250> doubts<00:00:23.460> crept<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:24.269> because<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.600> some<00:00:24.750> of

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
some doubts crept in because of some of

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.089 
some doubts crept in because of some of
the<00:00:24.869> results<00:00:24.960> you've<00:00:25.289> had<00:00:25.410> here<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.769> season

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
the results you've had here this season

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.670 
the results you've had here this season
is<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.670> fair<00:00:26.820> point<00:00:26.990> I<00:00:27.990> don't<00:00:28.410> think<00:00:28.470> you

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
is that a fair point I don't think you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.479 
is that a fair point I don't think you
feel<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.070> when<00:00:29.310> when<00:00:29.640> you're<00:00:29.789> out<00:00:29.880> there<00:00:29.910> I

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
feel that when when you're out there I

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.130 
feel that when when you're out there I
didn't<00:00:32.489> feel<00:00:32.610> like<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.570> sort<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.840> changed

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
didn't feel like we we sort of changed

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.530 
didn't feel like we we sort of changed
out<00:00:34.320> our<00:00:34.559> approach<00:00:34.860> mentally<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.610> sometimes

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
out our approach mentally but sometimes

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.020 
out our approach mentally but sometimes
you<00:00:36.690> know<00:00:36.780> Cardiff<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.790> kick<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
you know Cardiff of a kick up the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.360 
you know Cardiff of a kick up the
backside<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.600> another<00:00:40.559> 15<00:00:40.920> minute<00:00:41.160> break<00:00:41.340> and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
backside in another 15 minute break and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.979 
backside in another 15 minute break and
they<00:00:41.820> change<00:00:42.090> their<00:00:42.270> system<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.660> little<00:00:42.690> bit

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
they change their system a little bit

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.290 
they change their system a little bit
and<00:00:43.140> they<00:00:44.100> get<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> first<00:00:44.610> goal<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:44.969> their

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
and they get the first goal and their

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.840 
and they get the first goal and their
towels<00:00:45.539> are<00:00:45.719> up<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.200> I'm<00:00:46.440> probably<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.640> end

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
towels are up so I'm probably in the end

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.850 
towels are up so I'm probably in the end
when<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.239> gone<00:00:48.390> 32<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:49.020> half<00:00:49.200> an<00:00:49.350> hour<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.739> go

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
when it's gone 32 of half an hour to go

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.529 
when it's gone 32 of half an hour to go
with<00:00:50.129> we've<00:00:50.820> done<00:00:51.000> well<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.300> win<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> game

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
with we've done well to win the game

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.049 
with we've done well to win the game
because<00:00:51.899> they<00:00:52.020> had<00:00:52.140> all<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> momentum<00:00:53.059> we

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
because they had all the momentum we

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.189 
because they had all the momentum we
shoulda<00:00:54.270> took<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.510> couple<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.809> our<00:00:54.899> challenge

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
shoulda took a couple of our challenge

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.869 
shoulda took a couple of our challenge
is<00:00:55.289> really<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> break<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.160> put<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> bed

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
is really on a break and put it to bed

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.049 
is really on a break and put it to bed
but<00:00:58.010> obviously<00:00:59.010> we're<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.609> we're<00:00:59.850> not<00:00:59.879> happy

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
but obviously we're not we're not happy

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.910 
but obviously we're not we're not happy
with<00:01:00.270> two<00:01:00.420> girls<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:00.809> conceded<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.770> need

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
with two girls have conceded and we need

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.229 
with two girls have conceded and we need
to<00:01:02.010> improve<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.609> know<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.820> can't<00:01:03.030> we

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
to improve that you know we can't we

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.729 
to improve that you know we can't we
can't<00:01:03.449> need<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.690> score<00:01:03.870> free<00:01:04.140> every<00:01:04.379> game<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
can't need to score free every game to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.820 
can't need to score free every game to
win<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.689> but<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.110> gaffer<00:01:07.380> said<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.619> think

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
win so but as the gaffer said I think

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.410 
win so but as the gaffer said I think
the<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> first<00:01:08.400> 60<00:01:08.670> minutes<00:01:08.970> were<00:01:09.150> all

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the for the first 60 minutes were all

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.050 
the for the first 60 minutes were all
good<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:10.920> need<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.130> build<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.460> when

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
good so we need to build on that when

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.429 
good so we need to build on that when
you<00:01:12.150> come<00:01:12.299> out<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.600> second<00:01:12.900> half<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.260> you

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
you come out for a second half and you

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.810 
you come out for a second half and you
already<00:01:13.680> three<00:01:14.010> they'll<00:01:14.189> out<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.520> mean<00:01:14.640> you

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
already three they'll out I mean you

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.249 
already three they'll out I mean you
shouldn't<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.180> complacent<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.930> how

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
shouldn't be complacent but how

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.630 
shouldn't be complacent but how
difficult<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.770> not<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.159> think<00:01:17.310> well<00:01:17.520> this

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
difficult is it not to think well this

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.149 
difficult is it not to think well this

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.700 
mean the away game at Cardiff showed
what<00:01:30.240> could<00:01:30.390> happen<00:01:30.509> we<00:01:30.780> were<00:01:31.170> terrible<00:01:31.530> first

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
what could happen we were terrible first

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.410 
what could happen we were terrible first
half<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.159> Cardiff<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.790> kneel<00:01:33.000> down<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.180> one

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
half a Cardiff and to kneel down and one

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.219 
half a Cardiff and to kneel down and one
for<00:01:33.630> two<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:35.210> yeah<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.659> could<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.140> done

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
for two so yeah we we could have done

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.660 
for two so yeah we we could have done
better<00:01:37.380> second<00:01:37.770> office<00:01:38.070> there's<00:01:38.310> no<00:01:38.460> doubt

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
better second office there's no doubt

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.240 
better second office there's no doubt
but<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.299> think<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.990> general<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> lads<00:01:40.710> took

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
but I think in in general the lads took

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.859 
but I think in in general the lads took
what<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> gaffer<00:01:41.970> had<00:01:42.240> told<00:01:42.450> him<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
what the gaffer had told him to do and

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.590 
what the gaffer had told him to do and
did<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.500> quite<00:01:43.649> well<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:44.070> long<00:01:44.430> periods<00:01:44.600> so

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
did it quite well for long periods so

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.910 
did it quite well for long periods so
you<00:01:45.750> going<00:01:45.990> across<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.439> dugout<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.799> get

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
you going across to the dugout to get

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.899 
you going across to the dugout to get
messages<00:01:47.280> from<00:01:47.310> him<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.610> couple<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.850> times

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
messages from him a couple of times

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.340 
messages from him a couple of times
doing<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.360> first<00:01:48.570> half<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:49.140> you've<00:01:49.259> been

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.730 
ideas a new to us you know that they're
different<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.049> what<00:01:58.140> we've<00:01:58.290> what<00:01:58.500> we've<00:01:58.560> been

different to what we've what we've been

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.209 
different to what we've what we've been
doing<00:01:58.920> and<00:02:00.170> sometimes<00:02:01.170> things<00:02:01.469> happen<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
pitch that you're not sure about so

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.420 
pitch that you're not sure about so
whenever<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.259> got<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.710> chance<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.100> just<00:02:05.250> tried

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
whenever I got the chance I just tried

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.010 
whenever I got the chance I just tried
to<00:02:05.549> find<00:02:05.729> out<00:02:05.880> what<00:02:06.090> were<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.479> I'd<00:02:06.630> us<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.869> do

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
to find out what were you I'd us to do

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.170 
to find out what were you I'd us to do
but<00:02:08.830> all<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.190> it<00:02:09.340> was<00:02:09.490> fairly<00:02:09.760> well<00:02:09.970> laid<00:02:10.150> out

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
but all of it was fairly well laid out

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.850 
but all of it was fairly well laid out
to<00:02:10.480> start<00:02:10.690> with<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:10.930> fair<00:02:11.200> but<00:02:11.320> Cardiff<00:02:11.650> just

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
to start with to fair but Cardiff just

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.020 
to start with to fair but Cardiff just
did<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.010> couple<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.340> little<00:02:12.430> things<00:02:12.550> that<00:02:12.880> will

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
did a couple of little things that will

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.630 
did a couple of little things that will
you<00:02:13.150> weren't<00:02:13.330> expected<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.250> if<00:02:15.250> there's<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.520> lil

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
you weren't expected so if there's a lil

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.790 
you weren't expected so if there's a lil
break<00:02:15.820> in<00:02:16.030> place<00:02:16.240> was<00:02:16.510> helpful<00:02:16.960> we<00:02:17.590> look<00:02:17.710> at

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
break in place was helpful we look at

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.260 
break in place was helpful we look at
the<00:02:17.920> championship<00:02:18.460> table<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.850> think<00:02:19.060> other

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
the championship table I think other

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.240 
the championship table I think other
than<00:02:19.420> Darby<00:02:19.870> all<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.680> top<00:02:20.860> eight<00:02:21.010> one

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
than Darby all of the top eight one

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.460 
than Darby all of the top eight one
today<00:02:21.490> which<00:02:21.790> makes<00:02:22.600> keeping<00:02:22.810> pace<00:02:23.110> with<00:02:23.140> them

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
today which makes keeping pace with them

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.500 
today which makes keeping pace with them
all<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.860> more<00:02:23.980> important<00:02:24.340> doesn't<00:02:24.460> it<00:02:24.610> yeah<00:02:25.330> I

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
all the more important doesn't it yeah I

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.560 
all the more important doesn't it yeah I
think<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.190> look<00:02:27.340> at<00:02:27.550> our<00:02:27.730> last<00:02:28.060> seven

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
think if you look at our last seven

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.720 
think if you look at our last seven
games<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:29.050> believe<00:02:29.320> that's<00:02:29.590> now<00:02:29.830> 16<00:02:30.340> points

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
games I believe that's now 16 points

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.500 
games I believe that's now 16 points
from<00:02:31.020> 70<00:02:32.020> games<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.880> if<00:02:33.880> we<00:02:33.940> keep<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.360> between

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
from 70 games so if we keep that between

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.000 
from 70 games so if we keep that between
now<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.900> end<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.200> season<00:02:35.350> then<00:02:35.650> we're

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
now the end of the season then we're

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.640 
now the end of the season then we're
going<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.160> be<00:02:36.280> right<00:02:36.460> there<00:02:36.640> with<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:37.000> chance

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
going to be right there with a chance

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.960 
going to be right there with a chance
we'll<00:02:38.650> see<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.830> big<00:02:38.890> big<00:02:39.190> game<00:02:39.370> next<00:02:39.520> week<00:02:39.790> with

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
we'll see a big big game next week with

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.410 
we'll see a big big game next week with
with<00:02:40.390> Brentford<00:02:41.940> there<00:02:42.940> above<00:02:43.180> us<00:02:43.330> and

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
with Brentford there above us and

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.290 
with Brentford there above us and
they're<00:02:43.600> one<00:02:43.690> of<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.840> ones<00:02:43.990> we<00:02:44.140> need<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.380> catch

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
they're one of the ones we need to catch

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.040 
they're one of the ones we need to catch
so<00:02:46.300> that<00:02:46.450> there's<00:02:46.600> going<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.780> be<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.900> lot<00:02:47.020> more

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
so that there's going to be a lot more

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.630 
so that there's going to be a lot more
changes<00:02:47.530> yet<00:02:47.710> you<00:02:47.860> know<00:02:47.950> I've<00:02:48.010> been<00:02:48.070> been<00:02:48.550> at

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
changes yet you know I've been been at

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.010 
changes yet you know I've been been at
the<00:02:48.760> top<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.090> championship<00:02:49.210> a<00:02:49.630> few<00:02:49.660> times

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
the top of the championship a few times

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.230 
the top of the championship a few times
and<00:02:50.380> it's<00:02:51.220> not<00:02:51.340> easy<00:02:51.490> to<00:02:51.670> get<00:02:51.790> over<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.090> line

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
and it's not easy to get over the line

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.540 
and it's not easy to get over the line
so<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:53.260> teams<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.590> are<00:02:53.740> up<00:02:53.860> in<00:02:53.980> them<00:02:54.160> into

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
so the teams that are up in them into

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.220 
so the teams that are up in them into
positions<00:02:55.030> now<00:02:55.240> we'll<00:02:55.450> have<00:02:55.690> people<00:02:55.960> coming

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
positions now we'll have people coming

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.080 
positions now we'll have people coming
from<00:02:56.410> definitely<00:02:56.920> but<00:02:57.400> certainly<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.730> we
