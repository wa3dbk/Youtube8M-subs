the treatment we're going to describe

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.880 
the treatment we're going to describe
today<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.980> sanitizing<00:00:59.640> water<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.649> if<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
today is for sanitizing water and if the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.070 
today is for sanitizing water and if the
water<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.309> unsafe<00:01:02.520> due<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.329> bacteria<00:01:03.870> or

that if you suspect that there is

this<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> safety<00:01:18.750> explanation<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.920> water

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
this is a safety explanation of water

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.390 
this is a safety explanation of water
that<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.560> basically<00:01:22.560> safe<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.630> I'll<00:01:24.630> explain

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that is basically safe and I'll explain

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.030 
that is basically safe and I'll explain
there<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.360> two<00:01:27.540> primary<00:01:28.080> ways<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.710> treating

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
there is two primary ways of treating

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.080 
there is two primary ways of treating
water<00:01:29.370> one<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.940> boiling<00:01:30.240> or<00:01:30.600> adding<00:01:31.230> bleach<00:01:32.090> in

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
water one is boiling or adding bleach in

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.330 
water one is boiling or adding bleach in
my<00:01:33.270> opinion<00:01:33.870> boiling<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.530> always<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:35.010> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
my opinion boiling is always the the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.820 
my opinion boiling is always the the
most<00:01:35.550> safest<00:01:36.000> method<00:01:36.300> but<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> understand<00:01:37.500> that

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
most safest method but I understand that

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.970 
most safest method but I understand that
in<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.190> disaster<00:01:38.910> situation<00:01:39.230> you<00:01:40.230> might<00:01:40.530> not<00:01:40.770> be

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
in a disaster situation you might not be

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.120 
in a disaster situation you might not be
able<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.280> boil<00:01:42.270> your<00:01:42.540> water<00:01:42.600> if<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.710> water<00:01:43.920> is

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
able to boil your water if the water is

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.870 
able to boil your water if the water is
cloudy<00:01:44.490> try<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> filter<00:01:45.870> it<00:01:45.990> before<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:47.460> boil

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
cloudy try to filter it before you boil

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.420 
cloudy try to filter it before you boil
or<00:01:48.270> add<00:01:48.570> bleach<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.650> can<00:01:49.800> do<00:01:49.980> that<00:01:50.160> by<00:01:50.400> a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
or add bleach and you can do that by a

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
want one quart which is one liter you

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.780 
want one quart which is one liter you
would<00:02:35.250> add<00:02:35.459> three<00:02:36.000> drops<00:02:37.190> if<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.340> water<00:02:38.580> you

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
would add three drops if the water you

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.199 
would add three drops if the water you
for<00:02:39.120> instance<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.660> very<00:02:39.900> cloudy<00:02:40.820> then<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:42.000> add

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
for instance is very cloudy then you add

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.949 
for instance is very cloudy then you add
five<00:02:42.690> drops<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:44.850> let<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.090> sit<00:02:45.570> in<00:02:45.720> there

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
five drops and you let that sit in there

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.509 
five drops and you let that sit in there
for<00:02:45.989> approximately<00:02:48.260> thirty<00:02:49.260> minutes<00:02:49.709> if<00:02:50.010> it's

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
for approximately thirty minutes if it's

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.910 
for approximately thirty minutes if it's
cloudy<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:51.060> course<00:02:51.360> double<00:02:51.900> at<00:02:52.019> sixty<00:02:52.470> minutes

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
cloudy of course double at sixty minutes

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.699 
cloudy of course double at sixty minutes
so<00:02:53.340> everything<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.030> doubled<00:02:54.420> here<00:02:54.690> one<00:02:55.440> half

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
so everything is doubled here one half

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.370 
so everything is doubled here one half
gallon<00:02:56.190> which<00:02:56.519> is<00:02:56.550> two<00:02:56.940> quarts<00:02:57.420> which<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.140> two

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
gallon which is two quarts which is two

the lid off and let it air and you do

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.060 
the lid off and let it air and you do
that<00:04:27.390> for<00:04:27.600> approximately<00:04:28.169> two<00:04:28.380> hours<00:04:28.410> and

by<00:04:35.070> this<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.640> off<00:04:35.970> gasses<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.990> chlorine<00:04:37.530> if

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
by this it off gasses the chlorine if

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.330 
by this it off gasses the chlorine if
you<00:04:39.030> do<00:04:39.210> this<00:04:39.450> several<00:04:39.690> times<00:04:40.140> until<00:04:40.710> there<00:04:41.220> is

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
you do this several times until there is

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.480 
you do this several times until there is
a<00:04:41.370> very<00:04:41.760> light<00:04:42.090> chlorine<00:04:42.660> smell<00:04:43.280> then<00:04:44.280> you

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
a very light chlorine smell then you

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.490 
a very light chlorine smell then you
know<00:04:44.610> it's<00:04:44.820> safe<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.210> drink

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500
