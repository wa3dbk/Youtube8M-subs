00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.720 
3.com or oh my god there's a lot of 4
and<00:04:52.900> there's<00:04:53.900> four<00:04:54.110> of<00:04:54.170> them<00:04:54.260> so<00:04:55.250> those<00:04:55.700> are

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
and there's four of them so those are

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.090 
and there's four of them so those are
their<00:04:56.270> own<00:04:56.450> servers<00:04:57.050> I<00:04:57.320> think<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:57.800> can<00:04:57.920> go<00:04:58.040> to

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
their own servers I think you can go to

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.700 
their own servers I think you can go to
the<00:04:58.280> hub<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:58.910> join<00:04:59.210> them<00:04:59.330> because<00:04:59.750> I<00:05:00.020> don't

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
the hub and join them because I don't

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.140 
the hub and join them because I don't
think<00:05:00.920> you<00:05:01.010> can<00:05:01.220> actually<00:05:01.580> because<00:05:02.420> these<00:05:02.690> are

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
think you can actually because these are

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.030 
think you can actually because these are
1.5<00:05:05.150> so<00:05:05.720> we<00:05:05.840> need<00:05:05.990> to<00:05:06.140> go<00:05:06.380> down<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.710> version

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
1.5 so we need to go down the version

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.020 
1.5 so we need to go down the version
but<00:05:07.160> that's<00:05:07.340> pretty<00:05:07.550> easily<00:05:07.760> and<00:05:09.850> yes<00:05:10.850> i<00:05:10.970> will

but that's pretty easily and yes i will

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.050 
but that's pretty easily and yes i will
