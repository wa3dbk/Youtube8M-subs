my<00:00:12.800> first<00:00:13.130> thought<00:00:13.310> was<00:00:13.460> wow<00:00:13.730> this<00:00:13.760> is<00:00:14.150> really

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
when the students first walk into this

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.060 
when the students first walk into this
classroom<00:00:20.080> it<00:00:21.080> sends<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:21.590> message<00:00:21.619> right

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
classroom it sends the message right

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.800 
classroom it sends the message right
away<00:00:22.130> that<00:00:22.430> this<00:00:22.550> is<00:00:22.700> not<00:00:22.849> business<00:00:23.060> as<00:00:23.390> usual

at<00:00:41.030> each<00:00:41.120> table<00:00:41.449> that<00:00:41.809> allow<00:00:42.019> you<00:00:42.080> to<00:00:42.320> have

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
at each table that allow you to have

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.119 
at each table that allow you to have
three<00:00:43.610> computers<00:00:44.180> at<00:00:44.449> the<00:00:44.510> large<00:00:45.019> table<00:00:45.290> these

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
three computers at the large table these

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.860 
three computers at the large table these
computers<00:00:46.760> are<00:00:46.909> connected<00:00:47.089> to<00:00:47.570> a<00:00:47.600> monitor

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
computers are connected to a monitor

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.460 
computers are connected to a monitor
that<00:00:48.080> the<00:00:48.470> table<00:00:48.890> owns<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:49.870> with<00:00:50.870> just<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.260> tap

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
that the table owns and with just a tap

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.380 
that the table owns and with just a tap
of<00:00:51.650> the<00:00:51.680> button<00:00:51.769> one<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:52.790> the<00:00:52.879> three<00:00:53.089> different

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
of the button one of the three different

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.390 
of the button one of the three different
computers<00:00:53.839> can<00:00:54.080> be<00:00:54.110> displayed<00:00:54.680> on<00:00:54.860> that<00:00:55.040> this

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
computers can be displayed on that this

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.630 
computers can be displayed on that this
is<00:00:55.580> the<00:00:55.790> first<00:00:56.059> class<00:00:56.299> of<00:00:56.659> the<00:00:56.720> semester<00:00:57.049> and<00:00:57.680> I

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
is the first class of the semester and I

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.189 
is the first class of the semester and I
was<00:00:58.790> just<00:00:59.000> blown<00:00:59.210> away<00:00:59.479> at<00:00:59.600> this<00:00:59.809> is<00:01:00.019> what<00:01:00.170> a

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
was just blown away at this is what a

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.439 
was just blown away at this is what a
college<00:01:00.650> classroom<00:01:00.949> could<00:01:01.339> look<00:01:01.460> like<00:01:01.519> the

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
college classroom could look like the

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.869 
college classroom could look like the
technology<00:01:03.260> really<00:01:03.530> enhanced<00:01:04.400> it<00:01:04.519> I<00:01:04.610> think

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
technology really enhanced it I think

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.090 
technology really enhanced it I think
for<00:01:05.089> me<00:01:05.210> because<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:05.960> could<00:01:06.170> see<00:01:06.890> what

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
for me because you could see what

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.380 
for me because you could see what
they're<00:01:07.250> talking<00:01:07.400> about<00:01:07.670> up<00:01:08.000> on<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.270> big

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
they're talking about up on the big

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.330 
they're talking about up on the big
screen<00:01:08.420> if<00:01:09.080> you<00:01:09.380> found<00:01:09.650> something<00:01:09.979> you<00:01:10.220> could

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
screen if you found something you could

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.460 
screen if you found something you could
show<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.549> to<00:01:10.670> everyone<00:01:11.000> else<00:01:11.060> in<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:11.390> class<00:01:11.600> if

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
show it to everyone else in the class if

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.230 
show it to everyone else in the class if
I<00:01:12.710> see<00:01:12.950> something<00:01:13.220> interesting<00:01:13.549> on<00:01:14.030> one<00:01:14.210> of

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
I see something interesting on one of

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.550 
I see something interesting on one of
these<00:01:14.479> screens<00:01:14.840> I<00:01:15.049> can<00:01:15.229> send<00:01:15.440> it<00:01:15.530> to

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
these screens I can send it to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.980 
these screens I can send it to
everybody's<00:01:16.159> screen<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:16.969> we're<00:01:17.539> able<00:01:17.659> to

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
everybody's screen and so we're able to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.469 
everybody's screen and so we're able to
do<00:01:18.140> peer<00:01:18.500> evaluation<00:01:19.219> of<00:01:19.880> one<00:01:20.090> another's<00:01:20.450> work

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
do peer evaluation of one another's work

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.660 
do peer evaluation of one another's work
right<00:01:21.049> on<00:01:21.079> the<00:01:21.350> fly<00:01:21.590> there<00:01:22.070> was<00:01:22.219> eight<00:01:22.399> of<00:01:22.430> us

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
right on the fly there was eight of us

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.029 
right on the fly there was eight of us
at<00:01:22.909> a<00:01:22.969> table<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:24.289> were<00:01:24.380> with<00:01:24.560> them<00:01:24.710> every

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
at a table and you were with them every

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.249 
at a table and you were with them every
day<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:25.850> by<00:01:26.329> the<00:01:26.390> end<00:01:26.509> of<00:01:26.689> the<00:01:26.780> semester

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
day and so by the end of the semester

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:28.599 
day and so by the end of the semester
you<00:01:27.350> know<00:01:27.409> you<00:01:27.530> were<00:01:27.740> really<00:01:28.130> close<00:01:28.340> with

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
you know you were really close with

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.730 
you know you were really close with
those<00:01:28.789> eight<00:01:29.119> people<00:01:29.359> and<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:30.079> was<00:01:30.259> great<00:01:30.530> for

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
those eight people and it was great for

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.319 
those eight people and it was great for
interacting<00:01:31.369> with<00:01:31.520> them<00:01:31.759> I<00:01:31.909> think<00:01:32.179> the

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
interacting with them I think the

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.209 
interacting with them I think the
coursework<00:01:32.899> we<00:01:33.140> covered<00:01:33.469> in<00:01:33.590> this<00:01:33.679> class<00:01:33.890> was

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
coursework we covered in this class was

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:35.830 
coursework we covered in this class was
probably<00:01:34.609> a<00:01:34.700> little<00:01:35.119> more<00:01:35.299> challenging<00:01:35.359> than

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
probably a little more challenging than

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.660 
probably a little more challenging than
in<00:01:36.079> most<00:01:36.200> classes<00:01:36.710> but<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.189> classroom

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
in most classes but the classroom

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.669 
in most classes but the classroom
definitely<00:01:38.119> facilitated<00:01:38.869> a<00:01:38.960> much<00:01:39.140> easier<00:01:39.170> way

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
definitely facilitated a much easier way

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.410 
definitely facilitated a much easier way
to<00:01:39.710> get<00:01:40.039> everything<00:01:40.219> done<00:01:40.369> we<00:01:40.939> call<00:01:41.149> this<00:01:41.359> a

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
to get everything done we call this a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.389 
to get everything done we call this a
concept<00:01:41.990> laboratory<00:01:42.560> instead<00:01:42.829> of<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:43.039> lecture

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
concept laboratory instead of a lecture

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.880 
concept laboratory instead of a lecture
and<00:01:43.609> I<00:01:43.789> look<00:01:43.999> at<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.149> as<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:44.810> place<00:01:45.530> where

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
and I look at it as a place where

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.739 
and I look at it as a place where
students<00:01:46.460> bring<00:01:46.759> what<00:01:46.939> they<00:01:47.090> know<00:01:47.299> what<00:01:47.630> they

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
students bring what they know what they

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.209 
students bring what they know what they
already<00:01:47.990> know<00:01:48.320> what<00:01:48.679> they've<00:01:48.859> learned<00:01:49.130> from

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
already know what they've learned from

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.550 
already know what they've learned from
the<00:01:49.429> textbook<00:01:49.789> and<00:01:50.090> they<00:01:50.689> learn<00:01:50.929> how<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.170> use

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
the textbook and they learn how to use

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.889 
the textbook and they learn how to use
that<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:52.429> build<00:01:52.670> new<00:01:52.909> ideas<00:01:53.329> build<00:01:53.689> new

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
that to build new ideas build new

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.260 
that to build new ideas build new
connections<00:01:54.439> build<00:01:54.799> applications<00:01:55.549> one<00:01:56.179> of

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
connections build applications one of

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.999 
connections build applications one of
the<00:01:56.329> biggest<00:01:56.659> aspects<00:01:57.109> of<00:01:57.289> this<00:01:57.409> course<00:01:57.740> was

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
the biggest aspects of this course was

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.010 
the biggest aspects of this course was
teamwork<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.090> I<00:01:59.179> think<00:01:59.390> I<00:01:59.479> probably<00:01:59.659> learned

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
teamwork and I think I probably learned

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.380 
teamwork and I think I probably learned
the<00:02:00.200> most<00:02:00.380> from<00:02:00.679> my<00:02:01.159> peers<00:02:01.490> just<00:02:01.850> like

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
the most from my peers just like

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.170 
the most from my peers just like
bouncing<00:02:03.170> ideas<00:02:03.319> off<00:02:03.770> of<00:02:03.829> each<00:02:04.159> other<00:02:04.429> and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
bouncing ideas off of each other and

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.750 
bouncing ideas off of each other and
giving<00:02:06.020> each<00:02:06.080> other<00:02:06.230> feedback<00:02:06.430> if<00:02:07.430> you<00:02:07.610> ever

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
giving each other feedback if you ever

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.490 
giving each other feedback if you ever
had<00:02:07.910> a<00:02:07.970> question<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.570> was<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:08.899> easy<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.229> just

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
had a question it was so easy to just

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.440 
had a question it was so easy to just
turn<00:02:09.680> and<00:02:09.950> ask<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.520> person<00:02:10.880> sitting<00:02:11.060> next<00:02:11.150> to

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
turn and ask the person sitting next to

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.690 
turn and ask the person sitting next to
you<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.900> was<00:02:12.350> a<00:02:12.380> lot<00:02:12.590> more<00:02:12.620> friendly<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.280> open

you it was a lot more friendly and open
in<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:13.940> classroom<00:02:14.210> than<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.570> normal

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
in this classroom than a normal

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.990 
in this classroom than a normal
classroom<00:02:15.320> so<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.650> was<00:02:15.740> a<00:02:15.800> lot<00:02:15.920> easier<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.820> ask
