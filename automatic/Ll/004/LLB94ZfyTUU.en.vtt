because that is scary the slender the
eight<00:00:46.559> pages<00:00:46.730> actually<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.969> scary<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.629> me

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
eight pages actually is scary for me

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.720 
eight pages actually is scary for me
maybe<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.489> scary
