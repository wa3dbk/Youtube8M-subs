00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.830 
and play it again so that's like
definitely<00:01:46.890> my<00:01:47.280> favorite<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.420> hope<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.810> lot

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
definitely my favorite and I hope a lot

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.929 
definitely my favorite and I hope a lot
of<00:01:48.990> people<00:01:49.110> pick<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.070> know<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.700> being

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
of people pick that I know it's being

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.600 
of people pick that I know it's being
done<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.299> past<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:52.049> couple<00:01:52.470> times<00:01:52.740> by<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.310> lot

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
done in the past a couple times by a lot

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.359 
done in the past a couple times by a lot
of<00:01:53.700> different<00:01:54.030> commentators<00:01:54.659> but<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.170> think<00:01:55.829> I

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
of different commentators but I think I

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.609 
of different commentators but I think I
can<00:01:56.460> bring<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.299> bit<00:01:57.750> differently<00:01:58.200> because<00:01:58.439> I

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
can bring it a bit differently because I

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.530 
can bring it a bit differently because I
know<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.070> game<00:01:59.280> inside<00:01:59.640> know<00:01:59.850> like<00:02:00.090> I'll<00:02:00.240> pop

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
on there and I bet I'll know every

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.580 
on there and I bet I'll know every
single<00:02:02.909> Street<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.659> how<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> get<00:02:04.079> everywhere

and clank actually but I'm not leaving
ratchet<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.770> clank<00:02:28.800> on<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.460> list<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:30.270> i

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
ratchet and clank on this list because i

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.940 
ratchet and clank on this list because i

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
don't think i'll like it anymore but

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.520 
don't think i'll like it anymore but
anyways<00:02:32.250> ah<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:33.180> second<00:02:33.660> one<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.380> is

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
anyways ah the second one and this is

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.170 
anyways ah the second one and this is
another<00:02:34.710> one<00:02:34.860> which<00:02:35.310> i<00:02:35.430> think<00:02:35.490> would<00:02:36.000> be

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
another one which i think would be

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.800 
another one which i think would be
pretty<00:02:36.360> fun<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.840> do<00:02:37.020> pretty<00:02:37.830> much<00:02:38.480> any<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.630> the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
pretty fun to do pretty much any of the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.900 
pretty fun to do pretty much any of the
civilization<00:02:40.260> games<00:02:40.950> those<00:02:41.370> would<00:02:41.550> be<00:02:41.640> pretty

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
civilization games those would be pretty

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.320 
civilization games those would be pretty
fun<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.330> do<00:02:43.100> probably<00:02:44.100> five<00:02:44.370> because<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.150> is

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
fun to do probably five because that is

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.910 
fun to do probably five because that is
the<00:02:45.510> newest<00:02:45.810> one<00:02:45.870> even<00:02:46.290> though<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.410> think<00:02:46.740> it's

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
the newest one even though I think it's

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.520 
the newest one even though I think it's
a<00:02:46.980> couple<00:02:47.280> years<00:02:47.430> old<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.690> could<00:02:48.900> do<00:02:49.020> for<00:02:49.050> if

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
a couple years old but I could do for if

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.200 
a couple years old but I could do for if
that<00:02:49.710> one's<00:02:49.890> better<00:02:50.070> but<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.370> think<00:02:50.580> five<00:02:50.820> must

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
that one's better but I think five must

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.680 
that one's better but I think five must
be<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.540> best<00:02:51.750> it's<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.200> newest<00:02:53.690> so

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
be the best it's the newest so

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.380 
be the best it's the newest so
definitely<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:56.160> would<00:02:56.610> do<00:02:56.880> that<00:02:57.000> one<00:02:57.210> as<00:02:57.360> well

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
definitely I would do that one as well

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.230 
definitely I would do that one as well
if<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:58.020> got<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.470> vote<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:58.890> put<00:02:59.100> down<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.640> if<00:03:00.150> you

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
if it got the vote so put down to if you

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.150 
if it got the vote so put down to if you
want<00:03:00.420> civilization<00:03:01.230> 5<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.470> would<00:03:01.740> really<00:03:01.920> like

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
want civilization 5 I would really like

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.250 
want civilization 5 I would really like
to<00:03:02.340> do<00:03:02.460> that<00:03:02.490> one<00:03:02.820> as<00:03:02.910> well<00:03:02.940> plus<00:03:03.570> there<00:03:04.170> would

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
to do that one as well plus there would

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.170 
to do that one as well plus there would
be<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.410> lot<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.650> viewership<00:03:05.130> involvement<00:03:06.000> there

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
be a lot of viewership involvement there

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.230 
be a lot of viewership involvement there
in<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.140> let's<00:03:07.440> play<00:03:07.710> um<00:03:09.170> 43<00:03:10.170> put<00:03:10.890> i<00:03:11.250> bought

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
in that let's play um 43 put i bought

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.300 
in that let's play um 43 put i bought
this<00:03:12.420> game<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:12.900> i<00:03:12.990> play<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.440> bit<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:13.890> don't

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
this game and i play it a bit I don't

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.530 
this game and i play it a bit I don't
think<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.640> would<00:03:14.730> really<00:03:14.850> work<00:03:15.120> for<00:03:15.180> let's

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
think it would really work for let's

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.360 
think it would really work for let's
plays<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.990> much<00:03:16.170> but<00:03:16.380> if<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.770> lot<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.100> people

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
plays that much but if a lot of people

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.650 
plays that much but if a lot of people
want<00:03:17.610> it<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.820> course<00:03:18.030> I'm<00:03:18.180> going<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.390> bring<00:03:18.510> it

want it of course I'm going to bring it
I<00:03:18.810> don't<00:03:19.170> think<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.440> lot<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.590> people<00:03:19.710> want<00:03:20.160> it

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
I don't think a lot of people want it

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.860 
I don't think a lot of people want it
but<00:03:20.400> I'm<00:03:20.490> putting<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.940> on<00:03:21.030> list<00:03:21.330> just<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.660> case

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
but I'm putting it on list just in case

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.380

but I think now it's gotten to the point

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.720 
but I think now it's gotten to the point
where<00:04:53.639> you<00:04:53.910> only<00:04:54.090> watch<00:04:55.160> one<00:04:56.160> person<00:04:56.580> if<00:04:56.700> they

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
where you only watch one person if they

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.370 
where you only watch one person if they
