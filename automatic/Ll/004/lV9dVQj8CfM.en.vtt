done<00:03:40.019> just<00:03:40.049> like<00:03:40.470> they<00:03:40.590> did<00:03:40.650> Cinderella<00:03:41.069> and

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
done just like they did Cinderella and

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.150 
done just like they did Cinderella and
stuff<00:03:41.849> you<00:03:42.030> know<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.299> painted<00:03:43.290> cells<00:03:43.709> and

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
stuff you know and painted cells and

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.229 
stuff you know and painted cells and
stuff<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:45.859> so<00:03:46.859> we<00:03:47.010> had<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.250> look<00:03:47.400> at<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.790> at<00:03:48.150> the

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
stuff so so we had to look at the at the

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.449 
stuff so so we had to look at the at the
Dozen<00:03:49.019> scene<00:03:49.290> just<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:49.650> torn<00:03:49.799> in<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.160> movie

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
Dozen scene just so torn in the movie

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.030 
Dozen scene just so torn in the movie
and<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:51.389> are<00:03:51.510> already<00:03:51.660> filmed<00:03:52.169> and<00:03:52.739> trying

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
and that are already filmed and trying

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.950 
and that are already filmed and trying
to<00:03:53.130> figure<00:03:53.310> out

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
to figure out

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.280 
to figure out
the<00:03:55.500> exact<00:03:55.920> moment<00:03:56.130> when<00:03:56.640> a<00:03:57.480> pop-up<00:03:57.930> would

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
the exact moment when a pop-up would

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.080 
the exact moment when a pop-up would
happen<00:03:58.680> when<00:03:59.070> you<00:03:59.190> want<00:03:59.460> that<00:03:59.520> scene<00:03:59.910> to

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
happen when you want that scene to

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.140 
happen when you want that scene to
finish<00:04:00.450> or<00:04:00.630> deform<00:04:01.320> where<00:04:02.070> we<00:04:02.280> come<00:04:02.520> from<00:04:05.150> like

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
finish or deform where we come from like

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.670 
finish or deform where we come from like
the<00:04:06.300> slipper<00:04:06.600> that<00:04:06.840> comes<00:04:06.990> down<00:04:07.110> for<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.590> the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
the slipper that comes down for is the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.290 
the slipper that comes down for is the
glass<00:04:07.860> slipper<00:04:08.100> toward<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.760> end<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:09.030> comes

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
glass slipper toward the end that comes

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.810 
glass slipper toward the end that comes
out<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.600> floor<00:04:09.870> actually<00:04:10.710> I<00:04:10.860> designed<00:04:11.370> the

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
out of the floor actually I designed the

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.000 
out of the floor actually I designed the
slipper<00:04:12.210> out<00:04:12.600> of<00:04:12.720> plastic<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.470> everything<00:04:13.590> is

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
slipper out of plastic and everything is

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.590 
slipper out of plastic and everything is
sending<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.400> them<00:04:14.460> so<00:04:14.730> they<00:04:14.760> could<00:04:15.030> study<00:04:15.300> that

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
sending to them so they could study that

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.810 
sending to them so they could study that
and<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:16.470> comes<00:04:16.770> in<00:04:16.860> power<00:04:17.100> floor<00:04:17.460> and<00:04:17.700> it's

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
and it comes in power floor and it's

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.479 
and it comes in power floor and it's
there<00:04:18.090> or<00:04:18.390> there's<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.440> scene<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:20.160> very<00:04:20.340> first

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
there or there's a scene the very first

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.470 
there or there's a scene the very first
time<00:04:20.640> toward<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.000> end<00:04:21.120> when<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:21.270> see<00:04:21.450> a

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
time toward the end when you see a

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.570 
time toward the end when you see a
pop-up<00:04:21.720> is<00:04:22.080> when<00:04:22.230> they're<00:04:22.410> on<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.680> skyscraper

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
pop-up is when they're on the skyscraper

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.790 
pop-up is when they're on the skyscraper
in<00:04:23.850> there<00:04:24.000> kissing<00:04:24.420> in<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.780> rain<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.230> then<00:04:25.710> it

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
in there kissing in the rain and then it

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.990 
in there kissing in the rain and then it
just<00:04:25.920> freezes<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.670> whole<00:04:26.790> thing

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
just freezes and the whole thing

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.360 
just freezes and the whole thing
collapses<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.990> you<00:04:28.620> could<00:04:28.770> suddenly<00:04:29.070> have<00:04:29.280> to

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
collapses and you could suddenly have to

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.160 
collapses and you could suddenly have to
pop<00:04:29.550> up<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:29.910> it's<00:04:30.030> collapsing<00:04:30.630> as<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:30.900> pay<00:04:31.110> to

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
pop up and it's collapsing as you pay to

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.560 
pop up and it's collapsing as you pay to
turn<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.590> page<00:04:31.800> so<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:32.700> make<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:32.910> decisions<00:04:33.450> is

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
turn the page so you make a decisions is

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.020 
turn the page so you make a decisions is
it's<00:04:34.110> entering<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.620> pop-up<00:04:34.860> is<00:04:35.130> it<00:04:35.490> leaving<00:04:35.760> a

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
it's entering a pop-up is it leaving a

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.790 
it's entering a pop-up is it leaving a
pop-up<00:04:36.420> see<00:04:36.930> make<00:04:37.200> those<00:04:37.410> kind<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:37.740> decisions

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
pop-up see make those kind of decisions

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.860 
pop-up see make those kind of decisions
and<00:04:38.370> then<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.000> lot<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.300> times<00:04:39.450> was<00:04:39.660> very

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
and then a lot of times was very

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.630 
and then a lot of times was very
difficult<00:04:40.020> about<00:04:40.470> this<00:04:40.710> is<00:04:40.950> that<00:04:40.980> is<00:04:41.370> that

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
difficult about this is that is that

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.330 
difficult about this is that is that
sometimes<00:04:42.630> in<00:04:42.750> pop-ups<00:04:43.170> you<00:04:43.860> have<00:04:44.040> to<00:04:44.160> have

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
sometimes in pop-ups you have to have

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.480 
sometimes in pop-ups you have to have
things<00:04:44.670> that<00:04:45.060> are<00:04:45.650> bigger<00:04:46.650> than<00:04:46.800> your<00:04:47.160> screen

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
things that are bigger than your screen

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.390 
things that are bigger than your screen
how<00:04:48.450> do<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:48.690> contain<00:04:49.170> all<00:04:49.440> that<00:04:49.710> does<00:04:50.190> that

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
how do you contain all that does that

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.670 
how do you contain all that does that
finite<00:04:50.880> screen<00:04:51.300> you're<00:04:51.480> looking<00:04:51.780> at<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.200> it's

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
finite screen you're looking at and it's

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.430 
finite screen you're looking at and it's
already<00:04:53.010> filmed<00:04:53.750> so<00:04:54.750> how<00:04:54.870> do<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.110> get<00:04:55.260> these

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
already filmed so how do you get these

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.340 
already filmed so how do you get these
things<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.800> stay<00:04:56.130> inside<00:04:56.430> or<00:04:57.270> come<00:04:57.870> out<00:04:58.080> of

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
things to stay inside or come out of

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.600 
things to stay inside or come out of
nothing<00:04:58.710> when<00:04:58.890> there<00:04:59.010> hasn't<00:04:59.190> been<00:04:59.340> anything

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
nothing when there hasn't been anything

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.430 
nothing when there hasn't been anything
made<00:04:59.940> but<00:05:00.300> they<00:05:00.420> didn't<00:05:00.690> film<00:05:00.900> it<00:05:01.020> that<00:05:01.230> way

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
made but they didn't film it that way

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.870 
made but they didn't film it that way
and<00:05:01.680> then<00:05:01.770> where<00:05:01.920> did<00:05:02.010> it<00:05:02.100> come<00:05:02.280> from<00:05:02.310> so<00:05:02.790> they

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
and then where did it come from so they

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.150 
and then where did it come from so they
had<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.150> figure<00:05:03.330> out<00:05:03.600> we<00:05:04.020> had<00:05:04.110> we<00:05:04.500> had<00:05:04.530> to<00:05:04.740> go

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
had to figure out we had we had to go

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.530 
had to figure out we had we had to go
through<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.520> find<00:05:05.580> that<00:05:05.850> sweet<00:05:05.970> moment<00:05:06.420> and

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
through and find that sweet moment and

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.680 
through and find that sweet moment and
figure<00:05:07.050> out<00:05:07.110> exactly<00:05:07.830> how<00:05:08.190> they<00:05:08.580> could<00:05:08.850> make

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
figure out exactly how they could make

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.800 
figure out exactly how they could make
it<00:05:09.900> happen<00:05:10.320> and<00:05:10.590> they<00:05:11.100> did<00:05:11.310> but<00:05:11.910> that<00:05:12.120> this

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
it happen and they did but that this

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.560 
it happen and they did but that this
case<00:05:12.990> they<00:05:13.170> worked<00:05:13.380> with<00:05:13.560> real<00:05:13.800> effects<00:05:14.570> in

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
case they worked with real effects in

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.610 
case they worked with real effects in
Los<00:05:16.230> Angeles<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:16.860> Dallas<00:05:16.890> and<00:05:18.350> real<00:05:19.350> effects

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
Los Angeles and Dallas and real effects

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.530 
Los Angeles and Dallas and real effects
is<00:05:19.710> a<00:05:19.770> great<00:05:20.040> job<00:05:20.250> putting<00:05:20.820> that<00:05:21.030> together<00:05:21.240> as

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
is a great job putting that together as

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.470 
is a great job putting that together as
well<00:05:22.040> which<00:05:23.040> I<00:05:23.130> got<00:05:23.310> to<00:05:23.430> meet<00:05:23.610> real<00:05:24.150> effects

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
well which I got to meet real effects
