00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.480
 that there has been recite men begin 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.329
 I am bad capon and welcome a new 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.570
 a boxing welcome to the jet microphone and 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:32.660
 usb and I believe race that if there is any 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.000
 microphone used by mother by the 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.089
 youtube community is this microphone 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.320
 this race microphone is from usb you 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:41.269
 established what was seen in the usual 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.159
 and it's good with the one I'm recording 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.800
 this video this is a microphone 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.079
 professional for record car and not that 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.030
 to auto record and is let's say the 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.570
 most famous microphone because it 's the one that 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.229
 closer to that diffuser radio voice 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.670
 that one wants to achieve a penetrating voice 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.729
 a voice that is heard clearly a 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.159
 high quality recording because it depends 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.530
 of what you want, not if you want 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.020
 sing if you want to do you want to record 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.390
 videos you want to make a podcast this is 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.369
 the closest thing to a microphone really 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.400
 professional its price if more or less 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.159
 between 250 dollars and here we will see 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.689
 all the components that come inside 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.930
 of this package 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.490
 the first is a usb cable for 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.480
 connect it connects by cable 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.790
 usb two points 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.220
 and it's a pretty long cable which 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.980
 It helps a lot that you have not have 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.670
 a stand and you can put usb cable for 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.560
 some other side is not complicated to 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.420
 install absolutely for nothing 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.880
 you just go basically disconnect 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.100
 css like that already brings a small manual 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.840
 it's not very long so it's not going to give you 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.340
 the laziness of a is that I have to read it 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.550
 everything is not the truth is that it is very simple 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.350
 and what's next is the race microphone 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.360
 This is one of the most interesting microphones 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.240
 full market is worth more or less 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:04.280
 between 148 and 155 dollars approximately 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.170
 but believe me it's really worth it 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.119
 many ask me in the camp what 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.510
 I can do to have a very good 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.940
 audio quality in my videos and always 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.920
 things stop both people and 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.720
 microphones is the most recommended if 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.250
 you want a quality here but 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.320
 but there is one that those who can play 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.510
 this microphone brings a base a base 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.940
 entrance is a base where you 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.560
 you can move and direct a bit of 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.960
 according to where you want you can 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.330
 press the base so that it is 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.319
 exactly to your measure but if you do not 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.909
 you want that base 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.519
 or more or less to put it as I have it 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.469
 do you have another desk stand or maybe 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.379
 a standing stand also the microphone 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:44.540
 have for you to move it ok of the 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.939
 microphone buttons is very important 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.099
 has the button for me or for that 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:52.879
 listen to the voice has the volume button 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:55.549
 in case you want to connect about 17 are 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.709
 some and blogs in the down part can be 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.129
 to hear you in the back 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.019
 brings to control the gain that the 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.209
 gain practically if you have a lot 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.099
 noise what you want is that you do not 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.209
 detect a lot is the gain how low do not 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.340
 then depending on the noise that is 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.290
 they have in your room is how you move 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.389
 the profit and we also have another 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.579
 little button that is very for wars that 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:19.639
 gm I tell them that they are going to help us 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.889
 the microphone choose which side you want 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.750
 record for example if you want that 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.340
 record for all directions is 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.780
 maybe if you want me to record for mode 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.400
 stereo can also be done if you want 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.349
 catch your voice just forward 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.939
 you can also or if you want that is not 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.290
 stereo mode but that is recording in 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.719
 two directions can also be 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.239
 then it's a very very microphone 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.440
 dynamic and includes three account 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.350
 that in the part 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.660
 up what is being part of 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.840
 what is the microphone the top 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.210
 has three microphones to go 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.360
 isolated among the different ones as a 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.780
 triangle and based on that is how you go 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.670
 choosing where you want to go 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.650
 catch the sound one of the doubts nothing 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.630
 more is the field not that if I have a 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.580
 round table and I want to use a microphone 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.830
 I can do it with this if yes you can 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.940
 do if you have someone aside and 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.710
 you want the two to be heard 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.450
 clearly without any problem without 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.160
 need microphone tip 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.630
 If you are alone and you want nothing more 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.030
 I listen to you but you do not want 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.220
 I heard a lot of background noise or your voice 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.260
 nothing else is yours microphone and you 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.150
 ended podcast type you can also 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.420
 do this is good that's one of the 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.430
 strong qualities of the microphone the 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.190
 truth is that it's very good reasons for 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.980
 much quality and good unused I think 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.800
