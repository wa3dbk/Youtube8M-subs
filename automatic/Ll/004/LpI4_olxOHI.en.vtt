00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.990
 unboxing the brand new nexus new 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.990
 stay tuned after the intro starts 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.310
 So that's the latest tablet 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.900
 the nexus series the nexus 9 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.830
 a zwischending from the previous one 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.390
 Examples of nexus 7 and nexus 10 google 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.870
 seems a good middle way here 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:36.500
 Have that found out when we do 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.239
 welcomed directly from the tray 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.410
 Let's see what else we do 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:53.489
 still in there 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:56.070
 there is the one with the htc logo htc 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.710
 This time, the manufacturer of the nexus 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:05.489
 tablet and what else would we have 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.810
 expected that usb micro usb charger 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.810
 we'll see pure 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.420
 that is already side by side 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.549
 it is a review 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.390
 This is why they are a pre-release version 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.890
 also no instructions below 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.430
 same in it 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.820
 So there it is the beautiful tablet we 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.289
 have 8 9 inches in the diagonal on the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.110
 Display top and bottom 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:43.619
 stereo speaker the trademark of 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.000
 htc a front camera can be seen here 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.100
 and that was already a page 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.330
 are beautiful metal frame that me 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.429
 pulls around the device and only here 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.740
 is interrupted once above 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:03.000
 next to it we see the socket for 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.630
 the headphones down the micro usb 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.500
 input and this page completely free 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.560
 and this page in a microphone 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.060
 power button and the volume rocker like that 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.000
 I must say this I had the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.859
 ever unpacked around the current 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.440
 So the final version of android 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.579
 lollipop to install and the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.109
 basic facility already 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:28.470
 so we can do it here 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:33.870
 start the system with a double top 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:36.200
 and here we are in android 5.0 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.900
 to the technical specifications of the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:44.160
 tablet is the first nexus with a 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:47.819
 nvidia tegra k1 processor of the 64 bit 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.730
 So it can handle all the functions of 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:55.470
 android 5.0 access that too 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.519
 known to support 64 bit clocks 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:06.959
 with 2 3 gigahertz two gigabytes of ram and 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:11.639
 the resolution is 1500 36 x 2048 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:16.859
 So fix gea in 4 3 format it also 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:20.940
 novum here but android 5.0 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:25.170
 it is really nice and fluid here 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.870
 everything does not slip so far 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:32.250
 no performance problems 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.410
 60 fps are constant in the system 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.700
 I've been promised to see if 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:42.090
 that also prove in the long-term test 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.480
 will maybe even briefly to the 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.940
 criticism that has been so far to the device 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.520
 one has read there was light courtyards 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.410
 especially in the corners 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.239
 this is so far in our review 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.650
 unit to see nothing 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:01.910
 the display is actually wonderful 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.910
 gaudily sharp and also the back 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.680
 has little game so they know so and 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.769
 makes it something reminiscent of the white 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:18.060
 nexus 5 is but umpteen I have 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.700
 but the feeling actually feels 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.260
 wonderful to 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:28.470
 Nothing there, a little bit so, yes 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.880
 So far , I can the criticism that there loud 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.900
 was not yet understand one 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.280
 look how that over time 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:40.260
 there is only a short time to the camera we 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:47.240
 have an 8 megapixel sensor here 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:52.380
 a flash on the tablet it plays 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:58.500
 a minor role so small 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:05:01.650
 point of criticism these buttons, these are the 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:05.250
 have that relatively little play but so 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.640
 do not feel rubbery or what 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.810
 since so far otherwise so was claimed 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.430
 Let's take a look at a few in peace 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.490
 weeks she leaves the detailed text 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.350
 on android max.de so stay true to us 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.190
 subscribe to the channel and see you 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.190
