 things that you have everything you have before 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.850
 to buy it so you can see if you 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.050
 want it or not

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:03.420
 you can improve even more 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.809
 dudek and well let's open this for 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.809
 start explaining 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.150
 here 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.330
 with candel comes with a 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.330
 makeup 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.549
 that this then we are going to see the video of 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.570
 how to play all the cards in deactivated 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.570
 how the phases go 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.860
 do 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:02:00.530
 buying a maximum of 40 letters 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.530
 or even 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.600
 look for it 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:20.970
 as it is about two men 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.770
 and the decks 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.750
 they include magic monsters and traps 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.730
 normal wildcard 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.730
 with us 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.069
 we 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.069
 this is a deck rather like archetype 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.780
 our magic 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.810
 traps 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.170
 chooses to open strike because it's more 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.170
 complete and for some cases 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.840
 Darwin 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.510
 with returning is one of those where they are magic 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.200
 traps 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.400
 Y 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.459
 normal with his former blues fasts 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.660
 old the first two come then 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.510
 just one of almost simple simple is that 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.790
 well confusion those rituals as is the 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:39.990
 case of yogi there is a decline in the 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.660
 soldier of the black glare with his ritual 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.620
 where they come without cross when it comes 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:53.100
 5 and that is the ex of the exist must 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:55.560
 utopia the main one but it's to begin with 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.960
 it's okay you can buy this from or 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.760
 any other of X and forming it 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.790
 You can go by adding letters 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.600
 taking away buying a deck 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.720
 is for you to buy the most 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.820
 cards that you occupy if you are going to have more 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.670
 economically and already little by little 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.650
 to be seeing more letters or like you 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.780
 you know, you choose because this one has 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.259
 the envelopes that good will help you improve 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.259
 your day 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.310
 he says that every envelope he comes with 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.590
 utopian rave and that is also being 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.860
 part of this law that is among your 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.689
 own that is based on that 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.099
 you can improve it with this country 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.099
 Well, better with these letters 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.089
 in the hat 

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:59.390
 app 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:02.030
 rise in rank so you can invoke 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:06.110
 to this guy so in the full 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.050
 tells you what to do good I do not know what to do 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.590
 but it comes to you complete 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.540
 magic cylinders very good so that 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:18.940
 which one you keep playing 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:21.140
 more letters to say come can be is 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.310
 mainly for that from that 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:30.080
 it works well and can continue 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:32.390
 with normal you can say and I 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.570
 I recommend a lot that includes an indec 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.900
 already done or if you have a friend that she 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:42.380
 has a right understands what you open 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.120
 continues to improve or good yes so what 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.620
 you can go improving add things 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.540
 things to your liking 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.260
 can investigate the charge segregate what 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.660
 what letter is to take away 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.220
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.800
 is the first part of a miniseries of 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.560
 which rose in the second part of 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.580
 explain different types of monsters 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.010
 then different types of cartoon 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.650
 magic and then type of trap cards 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:09.140
 how they work and everything solved 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.140
