hey guys welcome back to part two of the
few<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.720> nine<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.710> seven<00:00:04.740> combo<00:00:05.609> so<00:00:06.180> just<00:00:06.450> now

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
few a nine and a seven combo so just now

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.960 
few a nine and a seven combo so just now
I<00:00:06.600> talked<00:00:06.899> about<00:00:06.990> how<00:00:07.350> you<00:00:07.410> can<00:00:07.830> actually<00:00:08.040> dock

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
I talked about how you can actually dock

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.270 
I talked about how you can actually dock
the<00:00:09.269> East<00:00:09.480> seven<00:00:09.900> on<00:00:10.080> tier<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:10.980> I'll<00:00:11.070> just

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
the East seven on tier and I'll just

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.830 
the East seven on tier and I'll just
explain<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.000> little<00:00:12.030> bit<00:00:12.360> but<00:00:12.630> first

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
explain that in a little bit but first

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.279 
explain that in a little bit but first
of<00:00:13.019> all<00:00:13.139> let<00:00:13.769> me<00:00:13.799> explain<00:00:14.030> or<00:00:15.080> tell<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.199> about

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
of all let me explain or tell you about

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.220 
of all let me explain or tell you about
the<00:00:16.590> few<00:00:16.830> e7<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.460> few<00:00:17.730> e7<00:00:18.359> what<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.869> it's

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the few e7 so a few e7 what it is it's

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.609 
the few e7 so a few e7 what it is it's
you<00:00:19.949> can<00:00:20.220> read<00:00:20.430> there<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.109> USB<00:00:22.109> DAC

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
you can read there is a USB DAC

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.970 
you can read there is a USB DAC
headphone<00:00:23.580> amp<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.810> what<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.529> actually

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
headphone amp so what it is it actually

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.000 
headphone amp so what it is it actually
is<00:00:26.189> both<00:00:26.699> USB<00:00:27.570> DAC<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.740> headphone

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
is both USB DAC and a headphone

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.189 
is both USB DAC and a headphone
amplifier<00:00:29.760> at<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> same<00:00:30.179> time<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.689> this

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
amplifier at the same time so this

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:31.999 
amplifier at the same time so this
little<00:00:31.529> baby

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
little baby

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.250 
little baby
damn<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.730> seems<00:00:33.000> more<00:00:33.180> powerful<00:00:33.600> than<00:00:33.690> this

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
damn it seems more powerful than this

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.540 
damn it seems more powerful than this
you<00:00:34.440> know<00:00:34.649> an<00:00:34.710> amplifier

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
you know an amplifier

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.139 
you know an amplifier
well<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.239> an<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.600> sense<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.020> because<00:00:37.559> um

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
well in an in a sense it is because um

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.729 
well in an in a sense it is because um
first<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.270> all<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.719> use<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.020> as<00:00:40.110> USB<00:00:40.379> tax

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
first of all you can use it as USB tax

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.819 
first of all you can use it as USB tax
over<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.070> decades<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.059> DAC<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:43.020> digital

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
over the decades is DAC is a digital

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.319 
over the decades is DAC is a digital
audio<00:00:44.510> digital<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.809> analog<00:00:46.320> converter<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.820> any

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
audio digital to analog converter so any

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.590 
audio digital to analog converter so any
kind<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.020> laptop<00:00:49.260> desktop<00:00:50.180> anything<00:00:51.180> would

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
kind of laptop desktop anything would

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.340 
kind of laptop desktop anything would
have<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> DAC<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.620> transfer<00:00:53.899> transform<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
have a DAC to transfer transform the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.680 
have a DAC to transfer transform the
digital<00:00:55.890> signal<00:00:56.399> into<00:00:56.760> an<00:00:56.850> ml<00:00:57.120> signal<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.600> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
digital signal into an ml signal so you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.060 
digital signal into an ml signal so you
can<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.020> listen<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.680> with<00:00:58.890> your

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
can like listen to it with your

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.760 
can like listen to it with your
headphones<00:00:59.399> or<00:00:59.640> speakers<00:01:00.079> so<00:01:01.079> basically<00:01:01.469> what

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
headphones or speakers so basically what

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.570 
headphones or speakers so basically what
this<00:01:01.920> does<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:04.250> it's<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.369> better

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
this does is this is a it's a better

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.899 
this does is this is a it's a better
quality<00:01:05.850> deck<00:01:06.530> than<00:01:07.530> your<00:01:07.619> laptop<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.549> uses

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
quality deck than your laptop this uses

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
quality deck than your laptop this uses
like<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> Wolfson<00:01:09.600> deck<00:01:09.810> which<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.250> apparently

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
like a Wolfson deck which is apparently

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.880 
like a Wolfson deck which is apparently
it's<00:01:11.400> quite<00:01:11.610> good<00:01:11.640> quality<00:01:12.260> so<00:01:13.260> comparable<00:01:13.710> to

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
it's quite good quality so comparable to

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.160 
it's quite good quality so comparable to
your<00:01:14.040> laptop<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.640> definitely<00:01:15.119> an<00:01:15.570> upgrade<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
your laptop is definitely an upgrade and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.550 
your laptop is definitely an upgrade and
improves<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> sound<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.159> guess<00:01:17.490> by<00:01:17.700> will<00:01:18.350> not<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
improves the sound I guess by will not a

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.590 
improves the sound I guess by will not a
significant<00:01:20.430> amount<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:20.790> does<00:01:21.000> improve<00:01:21.390> it

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
significant amount but does improve it

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.289 
significant amount but does improve it
if<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.290> read<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> sound<00:01:23.220> card<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:24.000> your

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
if you read have a sound card for your

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.270 
if you read have a sound card for your
desktop<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.049> probably<00:01:25.380> don't<00:01:25.650> need<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.979> get<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
desktop you probably don't need to get a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.010 
desktop you probably don't need to get a
deck<00:01:26.580> or<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.390> these<00:01:27.570> stacks<00:01:27.840> right

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
deck or like one of these stacks right

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.719 
deck or like one of these stacks right
here<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.350> because<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.920> actually<00:01:29.250> just

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
here so because this is actually just

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.929 
here so because this is actually just
quite<00:01:29.970> cheap<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:31.049> retails<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.560> about<00:01:31.939> $100

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
quite cheap this retails for about $100

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.590 
quite cheap this retails for about $100
which<00:01:33.329> no<00:01:34.140> stars<00:01:34.470> over<00:01:34.740> my<00:01:34.979> bed

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
which no stars over my bed

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.280 
which no stars over my bed
$80<00:01:36.600> $80<00:01:37.200> 70<00:01:37.680> 70<00:01:38.189> $80<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.479> costs<00:01:39.869> because<00:01:40.140> it

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
$80 $80 70 70 $80 so it costs because it

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.210 
$80 $80 70 70 $80 so it costs because it
cost<00:01:40.470> about<00:01:40.650> like<00:01:40.799> 700<00:01:41.430> Hong<00:01:41.579> Kong<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:43.799> you

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
cost about like 700 Hong Kong so but you

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.310 
cost about like 700 Hong Kong so but you
do<00:01:44.430> get<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> lot<00:01:45.000> out<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.420> other<00:01:45.960> than<00:01:46.259> just

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
do get a lot out of it other than just

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.200 
do get a lot out of it other than just
be<00:01:46.680> deck<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.130> also<00:01:47.250> functions<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
be deck it also functions that as a

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.120 
be deck it also functions that as a
headphone<00:01:48.689> amplifier<00:01:49.409> Bowl<00:01:49.649> headphone

here<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.680> should<00:01:58.860> plug<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.250> plug<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.119> in

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
here you should plug it in plug it in

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.990 
here you should plug it in plug it in
and<00:02:00.869> then<00:02:01.079> fit<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.280> use<00:02:02.460> kind<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.759> just

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
and then fit up and I use kind of just

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.030 
and then fit up and I use kind of just
two<00:02:03.240> outputs<00:02:03.810> for<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> headphones<00:02:04.860> or

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
two outputs for a headphones or

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.510 
two outputs for a headphones or
earphones

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
earphones

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.910 
earphones
so<00:02:06.030> that's<00:02:06.240> really<00:02:06.390> dandy<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.350> bring<00:02:07.799> it

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
so that's really dandy you can bring it

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.720 
so that's really dandy you can bring it
out<00:02:08.209> use<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.239> as<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.709> headphone<00:02:10.709> amplifier<00:02:11.220> or

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
out use it as a headphone amplifier or

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.700 
out use it as a headphone amplifier or
you<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.060> just<00:02:12.239> directly<00:02:12.660> plug<00:02:12.989> this

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
you can just directly plug this

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.600 
you can just directly plug this
to<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.070> computer<00:02:14.250> by<00:02:14.790> USB<00:02:15.350> access<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.650> USB<00:02:17.280> DAC

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
to the computer by USB access a USB DAC

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.730 
to the computer by USB access a USB DAC
and<00:02:18.150> headphone<00:02:18.720> amplifier<00:02:19.140> at<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.350> same<00:02:19.530> time

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
and headphone amplifier at the same time

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.880 
and headphone amplifier at the same time
so<00:02:20.430> very<00:02:20.460> very<00:02:20.790> nifty<00:02:21.030> I'm<00:02:21.390> also<00:02:21.710> but<00:02:22.710> I'll

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
so very very nifty I'm also but I'll

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.160 
so very very nifty I'm also but I'll
just<00:02:23.040> turn<00:02:23.280> on<00:02:23.490> for<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:24.030> basically<00:02:24.900> a

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
just turn on for you is basically a

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.150 
just turn on for you is basically a
service<00:02:27.080> as<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.350> see<00:02:28.470> this<00:02:28.590> volume<00:02:29.040> just

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
service as you can see this volume just

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.820 
service as you can see this volume just
like<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> little<00:02:29.580> like<00:02:29.790> LCD<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.570> think<00:02:30.930> it's<00:02:31.080> LCD

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
like a little like LCD I think it's LCD

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.000 
like a little like LCD I think it's LCD
I'm<00:02:32.190> not<00:02:32.970> quite<00:02:33.180> sure<00:02:33.210> about<00:02:33.360> LCD<00:02:33.870> screen<00:02:34.200> you

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
I'm not quite sure about LCD screen you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.650 
I'm not quite sure about LCD screen you
can<00:02:35.130> kind<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.370> adjust<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.730> phone<00:02:35.940> just<00:02:36.420> the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
can kind of adjust the phone just the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.110 
can kind of adjust the phone just the
stuff<00:02:37.200> here<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.950> go<00:02:38.400> into<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.700> menu

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
stuff here you can go into the menu

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.440 
stuff here you can go into the menu
there's<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.110> lot<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.380> other<00:02:40.500> stuff<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.450> overall

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
there's a lot of other stuff so overall

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.660 
there's a lot of other stuff so overall
just<00:02:42.540> very<00:02:43.260> very<00:02:43.320> nifty<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:44.280> can<00:02:44.430> use<00:02:44.550> a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
just very very nifty you can use a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.610 
just very very nifty you can use a
campfire<00:02:45.360> for<00:02:45.720> your<00:02:45.810> computer<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.560> can

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
campfire for your computer and you can

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.780 
campfire for your computer and you can
use<00:02:46.830> as<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.070> portable<00:02:47.700> on<00:02:48.060> amplify<00:02:48.810> for<00:02:49.800> your

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
use as a portable on amplify for your

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.790 
use as a portable on amplify for your
headphones<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:52.050> now<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:53.010> let<00:02:53.160> me<00:02:53.310> Oh

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
headphones so now just let me Oh

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.350 
headphones so now just let me Oh
furthermore<00:02:55.800> they<00:02:56.430> sound<00:02:56.880> quality<00:02:57.180> obviously

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
furthermore they sound quality obviously

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.260 
furthermore they sound quality obviously
the<00:02:57.840> sound<00:02:58.080> quality<00:02:58.550> for<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.640> DAC<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.120> does

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
the sound quality for the DAC it does

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.780 
the sound quality for the DAC it does
improved<00:03:00.600> by<00:03:00.780> little<00:03:01.050> for<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.560> USB<00:03:01.950> amplifier

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
improved by little for the USB amplifier

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.490 
improved by little for the USB amplifier
it's<00:03:03.210> definitely<00:03:03.600> not<00:03:03.690> as<00:03:03.870> powerful<00:03:04.110> as<00:03:04.440> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
it's definitely not as powerful as the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.800 
it's definitely not as powerful as the
Ignite<00:03:04.830> but<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.430> still<00:03:05.820> serves<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.390> job<00:03:06.600> well

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
Ignite but it still serves the job well

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.680 
Ignite but it still serves the job well
for<00:03:07.140> portable<00:03:08.010> devices<00:03:08.310> support<00:03:09.120> p.m.<00:03:09.480> and

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
for portable devices support p.m. and

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.300 
for portable devices support p.m. and
im's<00:03:10.640> easier<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:12.080> power<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.620> headphones<00:03:13.830> with

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
im's easier to power to headphones with

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.030 
im's easier to power to headphones with
lower<00:03:14.610> impedance<00:03:15.590> definitely<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:17.010> a

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
lower impedance definitely this is a

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.160 
lower impedance definitely this is a
good<00:03:17.310> buy<00:03:17.460> so<00:03:18.240> let<00:03:18.480> me<00:03:18.570> now<00:03:18.720> tell<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:19.140> about

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
good buy so let me now tell you about

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.580 
good buy so let me now tell you about
this<00:03:19.710> in<00:03:20.460> a<00:03:20.730> nice<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.270> combo<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.080> how<00:03:22.380> this

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
this in a nice and combo and how this

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.250 
this in a nice and combo and how this
works<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:23.160> when<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.090> plug<00:03:24.300> this<00:03:24.390> in<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.900> you

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
works so when you plug this in and you

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.500 
works so when you plug this in and you
basically<00:03:25.890> connected<00:03:26.400> by<00:03:26.550> USB

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
basically connected by USB

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.620 
basically connected by USB
if<00:03:27.780> usually<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.710> normally<00:03:29.070> connected<00:03:29.430> by<00:03:29.520> USB

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
if usually you normally connected by USB

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.300 
if usually you normally connected by USB
this<00:03:30.630> headphone<00:03:31.020> amplifier<00:03:31.440> won't<00:03:31.740> work<00:03:31.980> so

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
this headphone amplifier won't work so

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.250 
this headphone amplifier won't work so
you<00:03:32.370> have<00:03:32.460> to<00:03:32.700> have<00:03:33.000> at<00:03:33.180> least<00:03:33.210> seven<00:03:33.720> to

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
you have to have at least seven to

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.080 
you have to have at least seven to
either<00:03:34.650> use<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.100> USB<00:03:35.370> function<00:03:35.850> otherwise

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
either use the USB function otherwise

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.080 
either use the USB function otherwise
you<00:03:36.390> just<00:03:36.570> use<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.900> normal<00:03:37.340> oxygen<00:03:38.340> so

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
you just use the normal oxygen so

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.450 
you just use the normal oxygen so
basically<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.750> plug<00:03:39.960> it<00:03:40.110> by<00:03:40.200> USB<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.860> when

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
basically you plug it by USB and when

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.610 
basically you plug it by USB and when
you<00:03:41.520> do<00:03:41.670> get<00:03:42.000> home<00:03:42.150> from<00:03:42.570> work<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:43.110> use<00:03:43.440> this

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
you do get home from work and use this

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.500 
you do get home from work and use this
as<00:03:43.770> your<00:03:43.860> program<00:03:44.310> then<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.060> get<00:03:45.270> home<00:03:45.360> from

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
as your program then you get home from

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.360 
as your program then you get home from
work<00:03:45.570> you<00:03:45.960> just<00:03:46.110> slide<00:03:46.800> this<00:03:46.980> in

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
work you just slide this in

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.200 
work you just slide this in
basically<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.600> becomes<00:03:48.990> a<00:03:49.280> powerful<00:03:50.280> USB

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
basically this becomes a powerful USB

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
basically this becomes a powerful USB
DAC<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:52.070> headphone<00:03:53.210> amplifier<00:03:54.210> so<00:03:54.900> once<00:03:55.110> you

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
DAC and headphone amplifier so once you

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.100 
DAC and headphone amplifier so once you
slide<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.710> in<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.430> this<00:03:57.270> thing<00:03:57.330> basically

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
slide it in the this thing basically

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.810 
slide it in the this thing basically
becomes<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.650> DAC<00:03:58.890> for<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.310> entire<00:03:59.550> system

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
becomes a DAC for the entire system

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.240 
becomes a DAC for the entire system
however<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:00.870> will<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.500> amplifier<00:04:01.980> is

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
however it will the amplifier is

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.700 
however it will the amplifier is
bypassed<00:04:02.730> in<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.480> e7<00:04:04.050> and<00:04:04.230> it'll<00:04:04.560> basically

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
bypassed in the e7 and it'll basically

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.760 
bypassed in the e7 and it'll basically
use<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.280> amplifier<00:04:05.550> in<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.300> Fiori<00:04:06.930> night<00:04:07.200> so

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
use the amplifier in the Fiori night so

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.640 
use the amplifier in the Fiori night so
you<00:04:07.860> have<00:04:07.980> quite<00:04:08.550> a<00:04:08.580> decent<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:09.440> amplifier<00:04:10.440> and

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
you have quite a decent of amplifier and

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.820 
you have quite a decent of amplifier and
plus<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.670> very<00:04:12.000> decent<00:04:12.270> DAC<00:04:13.110> which<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.680> can

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
plus a very decent DAC which you can

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.880 
plus a very decent DAC which you can
plug<00:04:14.010> into<00:04:14.160> your<00:04:14.340> laptop<00:04:14.760> desktop<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:16.260> it

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
plug into your laptop desktop and it

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.979 
plug into your laptop desktop and it
becomes<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.400> basically<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:18.000> very<00:04:18.510> very<00:04:18.750> cheap

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
becomes it basically a very very cheap

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.620 
becomes it basically a very very cheap
high<00:04:19.440> five<00:04:19.650> sister<00:04:19.880> combined<00:04:20.880> like<00:04:21.270> I<00:04:21.299> said

high five sister combined like I said
before<00:04:21.900> this<00:04:22.260> is<00:04:22.440> like<00:04:22.590> 130<00:04:23.490> this<00:04:23.760> is<00:04:23.850> like

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
before this is like 130 this is like

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.790 
before this is like 130 this is like

better it kind of makes the highs a

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.520 
better it kind of makes the highs a
little<00:05:48.460> bit<00:05:48.550> clearer<00:05:48.790> increased<00:05:49.570> improves

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
little bit clearer increased improves

the<00:05:50.710> bass<00:05:50.919> a<00:05:50.950> little<00:05:51.220> bit<00:05:51.430> better<00:05:51.610> but

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
the bass a little bit better but

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.750 
the bass a little bit better but
definitely<00:05:52.870> not<00:05:53.050> anything<00:05:53.500> spectacular<00:05:54.280> or

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
definitely not anything spectacular or
