00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.210 
patterns so we can play chords all over

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.910 
patterns so we can play chords all over
the<00:00:10.299> neck<00:00:10.480> now<00:00:10.690> major<00:00:11.139> chords<00:00:11.590> minor<00:00:11.799> chords

learned five different Barre chords and

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.040 
learned five different Barre chords and
we<00:00:17.050> learn<00:00:17.199> the<00:00:17.619> the<00:00:18.250> one<00:00:18.400> seventh<00:00:19.050> chord

we learn the the one seventh chord

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.870 
we learn the the one seventh chord
position<00:00:20.529> which<00:00:21.009> is<00:00:21.160> basically<00:00:21.490> the<00:00:21.699> C

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
position which is basically the C

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.790 
position which is basically the C
seventh<00:00:22.300> and<00:00:22.449> open<00:00:22.720> position<00:00:23.080> that<00:00:23.679> we<00:00:23.769> can

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
seventh and open position that we can

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.960 
seventh and open position that we can
play<00:00:25.140> up<00:00:26.140> and<00:00:26.320> down<00:00:26.470> the<00:00:26.560> neck<00:00:26.589> so<00:00:27.460> with<00:00:27.820> those

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
play up and down the neck so with those

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.880 
play up and down the neck so with those
six<00:00:28.269> different<00:00:28.419> patterns<00:00:28.960> we<00:00:29.259> have<00:00:29.619> now

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
six different patterns we have now

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.220 
six different patterns we have now
opened<00:00:30.460> a<00:00:30.820> whole<00:00:31.210> bunch<00:00:31.419> a<00:00:31.749> whole<00:00:31.900> world<00:00:32.079> of

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
opened a whole bunch a whole world of

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.860 
opened a whole bunch a whole world of
possibilities<00:00:32.380> for<00:00:32.950> for<00:00:33.640> creating<00:00:34.030> chords<00:00:34.420> up

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
possibilities for for creating chords up

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.590 
possibilities for for creating chords up
and<00:00:35.290> down<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:36.040> neck<00:00:36.220> of<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.400> guitar<00:00:36.489> and<00:00:37.420> what

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
and down the neck of the guitar and what

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.930 
and down the neck of the guitar and what
I'm<00:00:37.690> gonna<00:00:37.809> do<00:00:38.050> now<00:00:38.230> is<00:00:38.489> we're<00:00:39.489> gonna<00:00:39.550> go<00:00:39.789> back

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
Barre chords so we're not going to be

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:55.080 
Barre chords so we're not going to be
playing<00:00:54.129> it<00:00:54.280> down<00:00:54.399> in<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.699> open<00:00:54.789> position

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090

this one so you can see exactly even
though<00:01:06.370> we've<00:01:06.520> learned<00:01:06.730> the<00:01:06.910> patterns<00:01:07.360> the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
though we've learned the patterns the

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.890

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
know how to make those chords but

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.910 
know how to make those chords but
they're<00:01:13.330> all<00:01:13.450> gonna<00:01:13.630> every<00:01:14.560> chord<00:01:14.800> you're

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
into one of those six patterns that

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.200 
into one of those six patterns that
we've<00:01:18.190> learned<00:01:18.430> so<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.340> you<00:01:21.460> make<00:01:21.910> sure<00:01:22.060> you

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
kind of glance over the other thing to

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.990 
kind of glance over the other thing to
do<00:01:28.270> is<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:29.380> if<00:01:29.980> you<00:01:30.130> look<00:01:30.280> on<00:01:30.400> your<00:01:30.490> screen<00:01:30.670> and

well<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:46.380> we're<00:01:47.380> gonna<00:01:47.470> start<00:01:47.830> with<00:01:47.980> this<00:01:48.070> at

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
well so we're gonna start with this at

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.140 
well so we're gonna start with this at
the<00:01:48.340> slower<00:01:48.640> tempo<00:01:49.180> by<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.570> way<00:01:50.040> and

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
the slower tempo by the way and

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.550 
the slower tempo by the way and
hopefully<00:01:52.150> at<00:01:52.480> some<00:01:52.540> point<00:01:52.990> you'll<00:01:53.200> be<00:01:53.260> able

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
hopefully at some point you'll be able

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.180 
hopefully at some point you'll be able
to<00:01:53.800> do<00:01:53.950> these<00:01:54.240> play<00:01:55.240> this<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:56.260> know<00:01:56.350> at<00:01:56.500> the

you're<00:03:34.550> playing<00:03:34.730> this<00:03:34.940> song<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.269> think<00:03:35.300> the

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
you're playing this song I think the

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.240 
you're playing this song I think the
proper<00:03:36.290> way<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.440> play<00:03:36.709> something<00:03:37.010> like<00:03:37.100> this

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
proper way to play something like this

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.830 
proper way to play something like this
is<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.459> way<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:37.790> we<00:03:37.880> learned<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.269> was<00:03:38.300> down

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
is the way that we learned it was down

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.770 
is the way that we learned it was down
in<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.019> open<00:03:39.230> position<00:03:39.290> but<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.430> do<00:03:40.489> think<00:03:40.880> for

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
in the open position but I do think for

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.330 
in the open position but I do think for
the<00:03:41.840> sake<00:03:42.019> of<00:03:42.050> learning<00:03:42.709> how<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:42.920> play<00:03:43.190> these

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
the sake of learning how to play these
