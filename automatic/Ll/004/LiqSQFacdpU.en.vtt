 That's why I show you my top today 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.820
 6 felix nail polishes I do not have now 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.529
 special shades such as pink or something 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.439
 I like to wear spring 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.689
 but I wear pink tones on both 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.039
 blue tones so my colors are the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.800
 mixed I do not have so in now 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.220
 certain frame where I say I wear 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.230
 in the spring would like pink tones because of it 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.149
 not to senate spring but yes 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.290
 I really have to mix colors and 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.969
 I'll just show you now 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.620
 maybe a few are driving 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.600
 you look great on that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.879
 Spring likes to and sometimes likes to 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.610
 I want to wear your nails 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.370
 now simply put on the color 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.079
 I also wear my nails today and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.199
 partly in green tours 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.079
 I have the help supporter and it is 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.809
 Now I'd like to say spray 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.680
 I do not know if we can recognize it 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.640
 I think so it is really so 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.140
 Well, I'll show you too 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.939
 right now the other color I too 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.310
 I really like to have them with me 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.280
 really like today but not otherwise 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.100
 always rich here on the ring finger 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.750
 But today I thought I just stay 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.710
 That's why I have everyone for a question 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.710
 right here 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.659
 but those are my favorite tom 1 favorite 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.189
 nail polishes the german men like 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.640
 I think I have at the moment too 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.540
 A green day is enough, too 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.390
 really like green 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.760
 At the moment you can see that I'm wearing 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.130
 green pullover and low 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.960
 In any case , be2 are my top 1 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.880
 favorite nail polishes for spring 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.040
 I do not know if you like it too 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.530
 find spring but I think 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.869
 even though it's so dark, it's easy 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.460
 for me super springlike I know 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.440
 not now if it's just me 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.890
 lies or if I just flatten this 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.009
 yes I have green but I love the two 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.770
 and I carry you super happy and 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.420
 then next i do a pink 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.820
 namely of s- e- and the color means 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.940
 Wick sven there and yes it is true you have to 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.600
 Really spend a lot to 1 sc nail polish too 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.550
 to buy 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.520
 I think the cost is eight euros or so 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.470
 So 78 euro and I think for nail polish 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.780
 It is really expensive because I am also enough 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.470
 those of countries that somehow 23 euros 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.170
 costs 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.269
 because I have never had a nail polish 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.340
 used empty but they are with me 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:34.330
 always dried up because I had the bag 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.769
 write away write away because 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.519
 who were somehow not good 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.590
 but really muddy was on 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.860
 in any case, the color did not exist 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.660
 at patrice or it was because of that 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.450
 I am sorry that she is leaving to buy her 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.870
 but once you treat yes and if 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.079
 her the color so beautiful it then 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:01.600
 So you understand the color is such a 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:03.880
 little pink fuchsia nina do you and 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.510
 I like to build the color on the 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.360
 nails 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.510
 they do not really look like this 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.579
 the bottle but sees on the nails 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.650
 it just pink out so started 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.930
 a bit like la stich and for the 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.820
 spring I like the color very much too 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:24.380
 that just makes you so fresh yes and 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.680
 then we come to the next color 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.260
 black and bright blue just like mine 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.960
 background I'm really no 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.080
 blue actually but so in the 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.960
 spring time I'm so bright blue 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.570
 tones or bright pink tones very nice 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.500
 but because halo pink tones are not really that 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.630
 on my skin tone fit then I grab 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.450
 over blue sound and running outside 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.400
 but at 1 on my skin a bit 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.140
 nice then I focus you too 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.650
 see the color again now 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.620
 so it looks like the color and it is 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.880
 really like the blue and the number 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.830
 It's 96s though I'm not 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.390
 sure if that's the number 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.060
 because I believe in Manhattan 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.950
 they do not really have numbers 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.410
 In any case, it is as bright as blue 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:20.540
 and I believe I have 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:23.150
 just a bright baby blue and the rest 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.550
 I think I duck blue and come here 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:30.140
 we go to the next color and my next 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.960
 blue and dark blue 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.900
 it is not really dark it is rather 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.720
 such a bright royal blue 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.150
 So it looks like that and it is 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.420
 again from before because I was in 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:49.010
 china there was no patrice or the 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:52.250
 2 or it the but funny driver and 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.200
 Grandpa or something but I always found well 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.950
 That's why I bought the thora 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:01.610
 and it's just such a bright blue 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.830
 Sound really such a royal blue and on 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.720
 the nails flash that easy and me 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.730
 find for the spring 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.310
 it also always nice pair of flat colors 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.500
 on the nails to wear then that is 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.840
 are real eyecatcher and that's why 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.610
 I have then for such a blue tone 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.910
 decided what I also sometimes nice 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.920
 think on darker skin that is if 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.260
 her also after the rad inside and me 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.160
 would know which color you think I believe 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:31.250
 blue is really so in the sound at the 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.350
 Asiaten really what that makes no German 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.350
 Then we come to the last nail polish 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.800
 and two do his light thing already 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:43.010
 almost as much as my skin tone but 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:47.300
 on spring I love german nude 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.700
 sounds for nail because sometimes you want 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.440
 just not that the nails so blatant 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.020
 stand out but also want to 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.990
 Wear normal colors like for example 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.260
 french nails just became such a brown 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.580
 sound nude tones and that's why I have 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.040
 you now in my spring 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.590
 collection done for spring wear 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.870
 I really like brownish brown things 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.700
 clothes and I think if you can 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.310
 brand wears clothes and not 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.370

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.280
 stand out loud then I wear myself 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.070
 always and pellets brown on it 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.650
 just do not stand out 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.020
