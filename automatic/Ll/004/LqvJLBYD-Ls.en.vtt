00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.719
 hello friends my name is 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.280
 Konstantin Genich we continue our 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.469
 video forecasts on the site rating 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.650
 bookmakers second round Russian prime 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.550
 leagues and of course a super match awaits us in 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.420
 Khimki Dynamo vs Spartak Classic 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.670
 Soviet well, you can say 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.500
 Russian football Moscow derby 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.630
 team which keep on top 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.599
 convincing to tell 1 to tour first 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.550
 tour financially still had time 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.000
 go to cyprus i would spend hapoel and 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.290
 reach the playoff round of european league 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.710
 of course, the sole hard in this 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.890
 the schedule to be a game with Spartak 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.360
 will be 4 in 10 days at Spartak in 9 days 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.370
 there will be only 2 game 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.840
 therefore functional sense probably 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.000
 Spartak should look like 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.460
 it is preferable to tolerate the Iranians late 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.860
 on thursday night and played in cyprus 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.020
 there stayed overnight flight that is 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.449
 little preparation how much plus 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.840
 match day at 13:30 Moscow time 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.030
 what match the account indicators and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.790
 As a result, I think that pushing off 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:17.189
 from this ikking should build tactics 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.080
 for this match we saw as Spartak 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.150
 great started in kazan with active 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.130
 high pressure and very high pressure 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.860
 aggressive playing guarantors 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.110
 and I now think that there probably will be 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.119
 the same Spartak will try to suppress 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.799
 in the first half the dynamo and the plan a 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.350
 will try to score first so me 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.060
 it seems in terms of predictions worth 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.939
 pay attention to very good 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.579
 Spartak offer to score in the first 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.439
 time with a factor of 2 and 1 as further 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.540
 I honestly don't know, but here 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.530
 Spartak scored by giants for 21 very 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.680
 interesting offer 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.079
 if you look at the net statistics they 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.619
 Dynamo and Spartacus for 1 person plays 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.630
 for a draw 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.760
 but for the last six matches on top 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.740
 Super activity there is not total punches 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.990
 more than two plug-in to total more than three 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.440
 boldly sometimes even total more than four with 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.740
 by half 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.690
 so the option is that both score and total 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.360
 more than two and a half in this meeting 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.780
 also viewed 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.930
 very interesting offer and with 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.330
 factor 2 0 5 why not 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.520
 try to play in the villa mosses second 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.709
 match cadre I wanted to take from this tour 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.570
 This meeting Tula Arsenal and 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.120
 locomotives here rant not 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.810
 I'll be here the motive is just stronger, or not 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.550
 lucky start take a look there and 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.950
 locomotive locomotive proved not 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.989
 pilaf with Krasnodar in the open space summed up 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.250
 implementation summed up Andrei Dikan who 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.709
 spent a delightful match 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.060
 composition of Krasnodar noticing 000 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.580
 the locomotive stood very pleasant 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.160
 impression if at the same level of drive 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.680
 and the locomotive movement will play in tula then I 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.420
 I think that tulaks don't have much chance 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.520
 that is why I would suggest playing 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.620
 pure locomotive victory for the motherland 7 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.000
 either consider the option of lacquer itself 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.239
 make individual total more 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.160
 one and a half with odds of 1 from the team 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.489
 rubber is just elementary class of it 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.590
 qualifying than arsenal here such 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.519
 predictions second round champion of Russia 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.200
 accelerates watch out for new predictions 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.769
