going to point out are going to be

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.649 
going to point out are going to be
mainly<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.200> all<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.579> kobes<00:01:48.950> palm<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
mainly on all of the kobes palm of the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.889 
mainly on all of the kobes palm of the
grade<00:01:52.049> school<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:53.899> one<00:01:54.899> main<00:01:55.170> thing<00:01:55.549> is<00:01:56.899> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
grade school so one main thing is the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.069 
grade school so one main thing is the
underneath<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.430> scales<00:01:59.790> it's<00:02:00.600> supposed<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
underneath the scales it's supposed to

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.740 
underneath the scales it's supposed to
be<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> Flywire<00:02:01.710> material<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.390> see<00:02:03.719> right

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
be a Flywire material you can see right

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.950 
be a Flywire material you can see right
there<00:02:04.259> there's<00:02:04.530> no<00:02:04.799> fly<00:02:05.130> wire<00:02:05.369> at<00:02:05.610> all<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.840> in

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
there there's no fly wire at all so in

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.400 
there there's no fly wire at all so in
all<00:02:07.140> kobe<00:02:07.560> 6<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:08.009> there<00:02:08.970> will<00:02:09.179> never<00:02:09.479> be<00:02:09.690> any

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
all kobe 6 is there will never be any

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.720 
all kobe 6 is there will never be any
wire<00:02:11.190> because<00:02:12.120> that's<00:02:12.330> how<00:02:12.480> they<00:02:12.690> cut<00:02:12.930> costs

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
wire because that's how they cut costs

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.050 
wire because that's how they cut costs
on<00:02:14.300> these<00:02:15.970> gsi<00:02:16.970> this<00:02:17.739> so<00:02:18.739> that's<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.700> you

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
on these gsi this so that's that you

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.479 
on these gsi this so that's that you
can't<00:02:20.330> really<00:02:20.450> tell<00:02:20.959> from<00:02:20.989> afar<00:02:21.530> well<00:02:22.370> when

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489

you get close up you can see figure out

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.820 
you get close up you can see figure out

this one the next thing that I've
noticed<00:02:55.760> was<00:02:56.530> right<00:02:57.530> here<00:02:57.859> on<00:02:58.819> all<00:02:59.060> shoes<00:02:59.810> that

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
noticed was right here on all shoes that

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.630 
noticed was right here on all shoes that
have<00:03:00.200> carbon<00:03:00.620> fiber<00:03:00.799> hits<00:03:01.040> on<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.280> bottom

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
have carbon fiber hits on the bottom

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.800 
have carbon fiber hits on the bottom
this<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:04.700> never<00:03:05.090> carbon<00:03:05.569> fiber

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810

this this and this is never carbon fiber
it's<00:03:06.470> just<00:03:06.799> some<00:03:07.040> rubber<00:03:07.730> material<00:03:08.329> you<00:03:08.629> see

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
it's just some rubber material you see

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.339 
it's just some rubber material you see
that<00:03:08.989> shine<00:03:09.519> and<00:03:10.519> over<00:03:10.879> underneath<00:03:11.629> it's<00:03:12.109> just

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
that shine and over underneath it's just

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.430 
that shine and over underneath it's just
a<00:03:12.440> carbon<00:03:12.799> fiber<00:03:12.950> looking<00:03:13.609> material<00:03:14.440> probably

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
a carbon fiber looking material probably

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.039 
a carbon fiber looking material probably
like<00:03:15.590> some<00:03:15.799> weed<00:03:15.980> cloth<00:03:16.510> but<00:03:17.510> that's<00:03:17.720> that

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
like some weed cloth but that's that

jordans<00:03:29.810> as<00:03:29.900> well<00:03:32.620> but<00:03:33.620> some<00:03:33.980> GS<00:03:34.310> do<00:03:34.579> have

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
jordans as well but some GS do have

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.580

carbon<00:03:35.090> fiber<00:03:35.269> on<00:03:35.569> them<00:03:35.720> like<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.109> Elevens

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
carbon fiber on them like the Elevens

carbon fiber on them like the Elevens
they<00:03:37.310> do<00:03:37.370> have<00:03:37.639> carbon<00:03:37.970> fiber<00:03:38.180> but<00:03:38.480> it's<00:03:38.739> just

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
they do have carbon fiber but it's just

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.120 
they do have carbon fiber but it's just
smaller<00:03:40.359> size<00:03:41.359> carbon<00:03:42.319> it's<00:03:42.680> really

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
smaller size carbon it's really

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.259 
smaller size carbon it's really
different<00:03:43.340> yet<00:03:43.669> check<00:03:44.239> it<00:03:44.359> out<00:03:45.310> um<00:03:46.310> the

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
different yet check it out um the

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.550 
different yet check it out um the
insoles<00:03:47.750> they're<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.410> same<00:03:48.620> as<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:50.090> adult

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
insoles they're the same as the adult

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.800 
insoles they're the same as the adult
but<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.769> padding<00:03:52.130> is<00:03:52.250> not<00:03:52.459> there<00:03:53.209> really<00:03:53.510> thin

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
but the padding is not there really thin

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.830 
but the padding is not there really thin
that's<00:03:54.799> why<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.069> got<00:03:55.340> 6.5<00:03:56.030> because<00:03:56.599> I<00:03:56.690> actually

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
that's why I got 6.5 because I actually

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.009 
that's why I got 6.5 because I actually
own<00:03:57.319> the<00:03:57.620> Grinch's<00:03:58.310> they<00:03:59.150> would<00:03:59.359> really<00:03:59.720> big

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019
