wrist

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.640 
wrist
key<00:00:18.460> thing<00:00:18.640> of<00:00:18.730> pitching<00:00:19.089> is<00:00:19.990> that<00:00:20.259> you<00:00:20.499> have

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
key thing of pitching is that you have

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.800 
key thing of pitching is that you have
to<00:00:20.769> be<00:00:20.859> able<00:00:20.949> to<00:00:21.160> use<00:00:21.310> the<00:00:21.429> wrist<00:00:21.669> and<00:00:22.509> use<00:00:22.689> your

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
to be able to use the wrist and use your

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.200 
to be able to use the wrist and use your
arm<00:00:22.990> all<00:00:23.529> in<00:00:23.710> one<00:00:23.890> motion<00:00:24.070> so<00:00:24.849> you<00:00:24.909> leave<00:00:25.089> the

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
arm all in one motion so you leave the

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.710 
arm all in one motion so you leave the
bait<00:00:25.329> out<00:00:25.359> there<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.730> lifting<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:31.300> rod<00:00:31.480> tip

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
bait out there and lifting the rod tip

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.599 
bait out there and lifting the rod tip
up<00:00:31.869> it's<00:00:32.050> also<00:00:32.200> key<00:00:32.529> to<00:00:33.010> keeping<00:00:33.310> the<00:00:33.430> bait

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:33.609 
up it's also key to keeping the bait

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:36.360 
up it's also key to keeping the bait
sliding<00:00:34.510> along<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.750> water<00:00:35.050> above<00:00:36.010> the<00:00:36.070> water

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
sliding along the water above the water

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.860 
sliding along the water above the water
so<00:00:36.609> it<00:00:36.699> doesn't<00:00:36.730> fall<00:00:37.180> in<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:37.449> water<00:00:37.629> make<00:00:37.840> a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
so it doesn't fall in the water make a

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.189 
so it doesn't fall in the water make a
big<00:00:38.050> splash<00:00:38.230> and<00:00:38.500> scare<00:00:38.710> fish<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.989> the<00:00:41.050> key

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
big splash and scare fish so the key

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.770 
big splash and scare fish so the key
thing<00:00:41.350> is<00:00:41.469> is<00:00:41.649> to<00:00:41.769> have<00:00:41.800> enough<00:00:42.670> line<00:00:42.879> where<00:00:43.750> a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
thing is is to have enough line where a

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.560 
thing is is to have enough line where a
line<00:00:44.019> pretty<00:00:44.289> much<00:00:44.350> meets<00:00:44.649> real<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:46.329> that<00:00:46.390> way

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
line pretty much meets real so that way

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.689 
line pretty much meets real so that way
you<00:00:46.660> can<00:00:46.719> get<00:00:46.809> a<00:00:46.870> good<00:00:47.050> pendulum<00:00:47.530> motion<00:00:47.699> be

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
you can get a good pendulum motion be

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.360 
you can get a good pendulum motion be
able<00:00:48.910> to<00:00:48.969> flip<00:00:49.149> the<00:00:49.269> bait<00:00:49.390> out<00:00:49.420> there<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.250> with

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
able to flip the bait out there so with

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.860 
able to flip the bait out there so with
using<00:00:51.550> your<00:00:51.730> wrists<00:00:52.530> enough<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.679> the<00:00:53.769> reel<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
using your wrists enough to the reel and

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.040 
using your wrists enough to the reel and
then<00:00:55.989> I'm<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:57.370> right<00:00:57.609> in<00:00:57.789> person<00:00:58.120> but<00:00:58.719> I<00:00:58.899> like

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
then I'm I'm right in person but I like

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.860 
then I'm I'm right in person but I like
using<00:00:59.230> left<00:00:59.469> hand<00:00:59.620> reel<00:00:59.829> so<00:01:00.690> everything<00:01:01.690> is

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
using left hand reel so everything is

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
using left hand reel so everything is
one<00:01:02.019> my<00:01:02.260> right<00:01:02.469> hand<00:01:04.590> think<00:01:05.590> about<00:01:05.740> flipping

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
one my right hand think about flipping

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.679 
one my right hand think about flipping
so<00:01:06.520> you<00:01:06.610> take<00:01:06.729> your<00:01:06.759> line<00:01:07.000> out<00:01:07.030> it's<00:01:07.509> a<00:01:07.540> little

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
so you take your line out it's a little

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:08.940 
so you take your line out it's a little
bit<00:01:07.780> different<00:01:07.990> from<00:01:08.079> pitching<00:01:08.470> take<00:01:08.829> your

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
bit different from pitching take your

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.899 
bit different from pitching take your
line<00:01:09.100> out<00:01:09.130> I<00:01:09.930> prefer<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:10.990> put<00:01:11.140> it<00:01:11.259> between

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
line out I prefer to put it between

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.190 
line out I prefer to put it between
thumb<00:01:12.909> in<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:14.290> next<00:01:14.530> finger<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.930> just<00:01:16.960> pin

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
thumb in the next finger you just pin

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.300 
thumb in the next finger you just pin
the<00:01:17.290> limit<00:01:17.500> out<00:01:17.619> there<00:01:17.770> it's<00:01:17.890> all<00:01:17.979> I<00:01:18.040> mean

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
the limit out there it's all I mean

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.499 
the limit out there it's all I mean
using<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:18.670> wrist<00:01:18.820> it's<00:01:19.000> more<00:01:19.119> of<00:01:19.180> a<00:01:19.240> straight

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
using the wrist it's more of a straight

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.300 
using the wrist it's more of a straight
on<00:01:19.659> you<00:01:20.290> can't<00:01:20.470> really<00:01:20.590> put<00:01:20.770> your<00:01:20.799> rod<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.250> the

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
on you can't really put your rod to the

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.710 
on you can't really put your rod to the
side<00:01:21.549> you<00:01:22.479> kind<00:01:22.600> of<00:01:22.689> just<00:01:23.009> straight<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.630> you

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
side you kind of just straight and you

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.889 
side you kind of just straight and you
let<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.960> line<00:01:26.110> flow<00:01:26.680> through<00:01:26.950> your<00:01:27.040> hands<00:01:29.280> a

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
let the line flow through your hands a

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.240 
let the line flow through your hands a
little<00:01:31.899> vegetation<00:01:32.469> there<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:33.100> then<00:01:33.189> you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
little vegetation there so then you

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.870 
little vegetation there so then you
pendulum<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:33.759> back<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:36.340> drop<00:01:36.549> it<00:01:36.670> in

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
pendulum it back you drop it in

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.460 
pendulum it back you drop it in
pretty<00:01:38.880> simple<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.990> only<00:01:40.170> thing<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.439> got

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
pretty simple the only thing is you got

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.780 
pretty simple the only thing is you got
to<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.649> able<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.890> get<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> nice<00:01:41.250> fluid<00:01:41.579> motion

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
to be able to get a nice fluid motion

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.039 
to be able to get a nice fluid motion
though<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.360> whole<00:01:42.479> thing<00:01:42.659> about<00:01:42.750> pitching

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
though the whole thing about pitching

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:43.940 
though the whole thing about pitching
and<00:01:43.140> flipping<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.560> need<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> nice

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and flipping is you need to have a nice

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.380 
and flipping is you need to have a nice
fluid<00:01:44.189> motion<00:01:44.430> rod<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.909> almost<00:01:45.119> staying

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
fluid motion rod is almost staying

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.600 
fluid motion rod is almost staying
exactly<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> same<00:01:46.380> position<00:01:46.470> I'm<00:01:47.100> using<00:01:47.399> my

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
exactly the same position I'm using my

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.880 
exactly the same position I'm using my
hand<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.030> control<00:01:48.270> line<00:01:48.659> coming<00:01:48.930> out<00:01:49.020> when<00:01:49.830> I

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
hand to control line coming out when I

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.550 
hand to control line coming out when I
drop<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.369> there<00:01:51.140> soft<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.880> I'm<00:01:54.030> using<00:01:54.560> this

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
drop it in there soft and I'm using this

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.710 
drop it in there soft and I'm using this
my<00:01:56.039> rod<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.399> almost<00:01:56.610> staying<00:01:56.880> exactly<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.659> the
