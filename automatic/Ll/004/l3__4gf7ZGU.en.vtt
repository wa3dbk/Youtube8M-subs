tired<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:01.620> then<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.730> next<00:01:02.969> thing<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.359> I

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
tired so then the next thing that I

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.070 
tired so then the next thing that I
would<00:01:03.629> do<00:01:03.930> after<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.700> would<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:09.080> concealer

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
would do after that would be a concealer

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.140 
would do after that would be a concealer
because<00:01:10.439> concealer<00:01:11.159> really<00:01:11.580> helps<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:12.090> the

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
all right so then the next step would be

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.860 
all right so then the next step would be
to<00:03:03.030> use<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.720> highlight<00:03:04.349> and<00:03:04.590> I'm<00:03:05.220> using<00:03:05.870> high

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
beam by benefit and first you just want

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:28.059 
beam by benefit and first you just want
to<00:03:14.690> highlight<00:03:15.920> your<00:03:16.920> brow<00:03:16.980> bone

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.910 

and<00:03:28.189> then<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:30.170> want<00:03:30.469> to<00:03:30.920> actually<00:03:32.499> put<00:03:33.499> a<00:03:33.530> dot

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.780 
and then you want to actually put a dot
on<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:36.370> inner<00:03:37.370> corner<00:03:37.849> of<00:03:37.879> your<00:03:38.030> eye<00:03:38.299> and<00:03:39.790> just

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
on the inner corner of your eye and just

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.459 
on the inner corner of your eye and just
kind<00:03:41.030> of<00:03:41.090> blend<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.659> into<00:03:42.349> there<00:03:43.389> to<00:03:44.389> give<00:03:45.290> the

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:45.469 
kind of blend it into there to give the

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:46.899 
kind of blend it into there to give the
corner<00:03:45.769> of<00:03:45.829> your<00:03:45.889> eye<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.340> more<00:03:46.549> glowing

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
corner of your eye and more glowing

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.580 
corner of your eye and more glowing
appearance<00:03:47.510> which<00:03:47.689> actually<00:03:47.870> draws<00:03:48.349> the

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
appearance which actually draws the

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.679 
appearance which actually draws the
light<00:03:48.799> in<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.310> makes<00:03:50.060> your<00:03:50.269> eyes<00:03:50.420> look<00:03:50.450> wider

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:50.689 
light in and makes your eyes look wider

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.789 
light in and makes your eyes look wider
also<00:03:51.670> so<00:03:52.989> just<00:03:53.989> going<00:03:54.169> to<00:03:54.230> do<00:03:54.319> that<00:03:54.469> to<00:03:54.650> this

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
also so just going to do that to this

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:08.709 
also so just going to do that to this
side<00:03:55.040> too<00:03:55.430> and<00:04:02.169> then<00:04:04.329> dot<00:04:05.329> right<00:04:05.599> here<00:04:07.719> blend

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:08.719 
side too and then dot right here blend

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:15.039 
side too and then dot right here blend
it<00:04:08.900> out<00:04:11.199> and<00:04:12.199> then<00:04:12.849> it<00:04:13.849> makes<00:04:14.120> it<00:04:14.359> shiny<00:04:14.689> in<00:04:14.930> the

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
it out and then it makes it shiny in the

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.509 
it out and then it makes it shiny in the
corners<00:04:16.959> so<00:04:17.959> then<00:04:18.139> the<00:04:18.709> last<00:04:18.889> step<00:04:19.070> is<00:04:19.370> your

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
corners so then the last step is your

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.189 
corners so then the last step is your
mascara<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:23.419> first<00:04:23.660> thing<00:04:23.870> you<00:04:23.990> want<00:04:24.169> to
