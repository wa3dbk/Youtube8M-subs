00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
many of you probably recognize this this

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.350 
many of you probably recognize this this
is<00:00:26.599> the<00:00:26.989> modified<00:00:27.919> Pringle<00:00:28.610> speaker<00:00:29.119> that<00:00:29.329> I

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
is the modified Pringle speaker that I

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.130 
is the modified Pringle speaker that I
made<00:00:29.689> about<00:00:30.439> a<00:00:30.559> year<00:00:30.829> ago<00:00:31.070> and<00:00:31.899> I've<00:00:32.899> been

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
made about a year ago and I've been

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.340 
made about a year ago and I've been
asked<00:00:33.710> several<00:00:34.010> questions<00:00:34.780> about<00:00:35.780> how<00:00:36.020> I<00:00:36.050> did

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
asked several questions about how I did

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.040 
asked several questions about how I did
it<00:00:36.500> and<00:00:36.860> how<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:37.850> whole<00:00:38.060> thing<00:00:38.090> works<00:00:38.420> out<00:00:38.630> so

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
it and how the whole thing works out so

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.500 
it and how the whole thing works out so
I<00:00:39.320> decided<00:00:39.950> I<00:00:40.280> would<00:00:40.310> finally<00:00:40.940> make<00:00:41.090> a<00:00:41.150> video

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
I decided I would finally make a video

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.170 
I decided I would finally make a video
showing<00:00:41.810> you<00:00:42.230> what's<00:00:43.070> inside<00:00:43.430> so<00:00:44.950> start<00:00:45.950> out

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
showing you what's inside so start out

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:54.930 
showing you what's inside so start out
the<00:00:47.180> batteries<00:00:47.630> up

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.390 

so<00:00:55.480> as<00:00:55.840> you<00:00:56.050> can<00:00:56.200> see<00:00:56.380> before<00:00:56.950> I<00:00:57.100> take<00:00:57.310> the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
so as you can see before I take the

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.180 
so as you can see before I take the
whole<00:00:57.550> thing<00:00:57.579> apart<00:00:57.730> there<00:00:58.540> is<00:00:59.080> a<00:00:59.190> 3.5

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
whole thing apart there is a 3.5

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.880 
whole thing apart there is a 3.5
millimeter<00:01:00.460> jack<00:01:00.760> right<00:01:01.300> there<00:01:01.510> that<00:01:02.410> I<00:01:02.440> put

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
millimeter jack right there that I put

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.270 
millimeter jack right there that I put
in<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.489> back<00:01:03.700> of<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.059> oil<00:01:04.300> speaker<00:01:04.830> holes<00:01:05.830> I

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
in the back of the oil speaker holes I

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.380 
in the back of the oil speaker holes I
think<00:01:06.490> for<00:01:06.610> bass<00:01:06.760> or<00:01:07.030> something<00:01:07.240> like<00:01:07.300> that

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
think for bass or something like that

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.050 
think for bass or something like that
but<00:01:07.630> didn't<00:01:07.870> really<00:01:07.960> do<00:01:08.110> anything<00:01:08.370> this<00:01:09.370> is<00:01:09.580> so

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
but didn't really do anything this is so

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.820 
but didn't really do anything this is so
that<00:01:10.240> I<00:01:10.270> can<00:01:10.360> connect<00:01:10.780> an<00:01:10.900> external<00:01:10.990> speaker

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
that I can connect an external speaker

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.609 
that I can connect an external speaker
it<00:01:11.950> cuts<00:01:12.160> out<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.369> front<00:01:12.700> speaker

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.980 

all<00:01:19.399> right<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:23.090> then<00:01:23.210> came<00:01:23.390> part<00:01:23.630> easier

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
all right so and then came part easier

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.999 
all right so and then came part easier
than<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.200> remember

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:35.070 

let's<00:01:28.009> see<00:01:28.399> if<00:01:28.549> I<00:01:28.729> can<00:01:31.149> alright

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.340 

so<00:01:35.740> I<00:01:36.160> have<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.940> jeweler's<00:01:37.690> loupe<00:01:37.810> here<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:39.330> I

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
so I have a jeweler's loupe here and I

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:49.680 
so I have a jeweler's loupe here and I
use<00:01:41.350> this<00:01:41.650> it<00:01:42.130> works<00:01:42.580> as<00:01:42.940> a<00:01:43.150> macro<00:01:43.720> lens<00:01:48.690> so

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
use this it works as a macro lens so

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:57.580 
use this it works as a macro lens so
there<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:49.930> go<00:01:50.110> one<00:01:50.500> watt<00:01:50.710> amplifier<00:01:51.010> chip

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.740 

speaker<00:01:59.619> all<00:02:00.619> that<00:02:02.380> so<00:02:03.380> here<00:02:04.340> is<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:05.299> audio

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
speaker all that so here is the audio

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.190 
speaker all that so here is the audio
jack<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.829> I<00:02:06.859> use<00:02:07.100> that's<00:02:07.460> on<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.509> computer<00:02:09.170> I

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
jack that I use that's on a computer I

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.550 
jack that I use that's on a computer I
believe<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:10.629> pretty<00:02:11.629> comment<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:12.260> don't<00:02:12.319> know<00:02:12.470> if

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
believe a pretty comment I don't know if

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.830 
believe a pretty comment I don't know if
you<00:02:12.650> can<00:02:12.769> buy<00:02:12.920> this<00:02:12.980> exact<00:02:13.700> specific<00:02:14.180> one<00:02:14.540> but

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
you can buy this exact specific one but

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.119 
you can buy this exact specific one but
and<00:02:17.840> see<00:02:18.200> what<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:18.950> did<00:02:19.069> here<00:02:19.489> so<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.890> white

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
and see what I did here so the white

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.119 
and see what I did here so the white
wire<00:02:22.400> here<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.420> gray<00:02:23.750> wire<00:02:23.959> there<00:02:24.470> those

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
wire here and the gray wire there those

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.759 
wire here and the gray wire there those
both<00:02:25.340> go<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.849> ground<00:02:26.480> order<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.349> negative

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
both go to the ground order the negative

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.069 
both go to the ground order the negative
terminal<00:02:28.190> on<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.430> speaker<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:29.209> left<00:02:29.810> those

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
terminal on the speaker I left those

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.900 
terminal on the speaker I left those
alone<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:31.040> gray<00:02:31.220> one<00:02:31.430> was<00:02:31.579> there<00:02:31.730> originally

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
alone the gray one was there originally

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.199 
alone the gray one was there originally
I<00:02:32.269> added<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.930> white<00:02:33.290> wire<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:33.980> this<00:02:34.430> one<00:02:34.640> the

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
I added a white wire to this one the

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.080 
I added a white wire to this one the
color<00:02:35.420> does<00:02:35.690> not<00:02:35.720> matter<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:36.489> attach<00:02:37.489> that<00:02:37.790> to

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
color does not matter I attach that to

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.460 
color does not matter I attach that to
the<00:02:38.269> ground<00:02:38.900> pin<00:02:39.709> on<00:02:40.040> this<00:02:40.970> audio<00:02:41.299> jack<00:02:41.750> you

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
the ground pin on this audio jack you

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.319 
the ground pin on this audio jack you
can<00:02:42.650> actually<00:02:42.829> use<00:02:43.069> any<00:02:43.250> audio<00:02:43.640> jack<00:02:43.910> you<00:02:44.090> want

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
can actually use any audio jack you want

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.380 
can actually use any audio jack you want
as<00:02:44.540> long<00:02:44.569> as<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:45.049> has<00:02:45.200> an<00:02:45.440> internal<00:02:45.890> switch<00:02:46.400> now

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
as long as it has an internal switch now

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.869 
as long as it has an internal switch now
I<00:02:47.420> wired<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:48.019> up<00:02:48.230> in<00:02:48.379> a<00:02:48.500> mono<00:02:48.879> configuration

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
I wired this up in a mono configuration

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.190 
I wired this up in a mono configuration
I<00:02:50.000> believe<00:02:50.269> this<00:02:50.989> wire<00:02:51.290> here<00:02:51.920> is<00:02:53.049> more<00:02:54.049> of<00:02:54.110> a

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
I believe this wire here is more of a

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.240 
I believe this wire here is more of a
white<00:02:54.470> wire<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.160> that<00:02:55.849> goes<00:02:56.390> from<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.530> output

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
white wire and that goes from the output

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.240 
white wire and that goes from the output
of<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.459> amp<00:02:59.799> originally<00:03:00.799> I<00:03:00.829> went<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.129> the

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
of the amp originally I went to the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.379 
of the amp originally I went to the
speaker<00:03:01.639> here<00:03:01.910> but<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.359> put<00:03:02.660> that<00:03:02.989> on<00:03:03.380> the

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
speaker here but I put that on the

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:10.240 
speaker here but I put that on the
output

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.630 

okay<00:03:10.880> I<00:03:10.910> do<00:03:11.210> Jack<00:03:11.480> as<00:03:11.750> those<00:03:12.170> pins<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.980> top<00:03:13.250> pin

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
okay I do Jack as those pins the top pin

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.750 
okay I do Jack as those pins the top pin
goes<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:14.090> ground<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.960> second<00:03:15.500> pin<00:03:15.830> down<00:03:16.100> that

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
goes to ground the second pin down that

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.740 
goes to ground the second pin down that
is<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.390> output<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.290> amplifier<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:19.750> that

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
is the output of the amplifier and that

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.100 
is the output of the amplifier and that
very<00:03:21.230> last<00:03:21.590> pin<00:03:22.010> there<00:03:22.310> goes<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.600> positive

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
very last pin there goes to the positive

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.610 
very last pin there goes to the positive
pin<00:03:24.350> on<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.740> speaker<00:03:28.720> okay<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.780> show<00:03:30.050> you<00:03:30.110> how

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
pin on the speaker okay to show you how

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.080 
pin on the speaker okay to show you how
this<00:03:30.770> all<00:03:30.920> works<00:03:31.250> when<00:03:31.790> it's<00:03:31.910> all<00:03:32.060> put

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
this all works when it's all put

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.750 
this all works when it's all put
together<00:03:32.390> I<00:03:32.840> have<00:03:33.500> this<00:03:34.070> running<00:03:34.430> into<00:03:34.640> my

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
together I have this running into my

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.930 
together I have this running into my
laptop<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.590> it's<00:03:36.590> not<00:03:36.800> not<00:03:37.100> your<00:03:37.370> player

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
laptop and it's not not your player

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.930 
laptop and it's not not your player
hold<00:03:38.150> up<00:03:38.330> so<00:03:39.170> when<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.010> hit<00:03:40.640> play<00:03:42.940> because

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
hold up so when I hit play because

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.020 
hold up so when I hit play because
nothing<00:03:44.300> is<00:03:44.420> plugged<00:03:44.630> in<00:03:45.430> it's<00:03:46.430> going<00:03:46.820> through

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
nothing is plugged in it's going through

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.990 
nothing is plugged in it's going through
that<00:03:47.180> speaker<00:03:47.510> because<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.560> switch<00:03:48.890> is<00:03:49.700> still

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
that speaker because the switch is still

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.430 
that speaker because the switch is still
in<00:03:50.090> place<00:03:50.330> there<00:03:51.970> now<00:03:52.970> when<00:03:53.600> I<00:03:53.720> take<00:03:53.900> an<00:03:54.080> audio

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
in place there now when I take an audio

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.790 
in place there now when I take an audio
jack<00:03:54.880> connected<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:55.970> another<00:03:56.150> feature<00:03:56.540> here

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
jack connected to another feature here

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.770 
jack connected to another feature here
and<00:03:57.800> I<00:03:57.920> plug<00:03:58.220> that<00:03:58.250> in<00:03:58.640> it<00:03:58.970> breaks<00:03:59.239> the

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
and I plug that in it breaks the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.890 
and I plug that in it breaks the
connection<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.800> it<00:04:01.700> cuts<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.150> from<00:04:02.330> that<00:04:02.540> it

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
connection and it cuts it from that it

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.960 
connection and it cuts it from that it
cuts<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.500> power<00:04:03.680> from<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.250> speaker<00:04:04.520> and

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
cuts the power from that speaker and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:19.779 
cuts the power from that speaker and
sends<00:04:05.239> it<00:04:05.360> into<00:04:05.540> this<00:04:05.840> one<00:04:06.050> in<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.290> static

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.490 

you<00:04:20.789> can<00:04:20.940> see<00:04:21.090> plug<00:04:21.359> in<00:04:21.569> switch<00:04:22.169> is<00:04:22.319> broken

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
you can see plug in switch is broken

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.159 
you can see plug in switch is broken
inside<00:04:23.090> so<00:04:24.090> then<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.419> audio<00:04:24.660> signal<00:04:25.020> goes

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
inside so then the audio signal goes

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.939 
inside so then the audio signal goes
through<00:04:25.199> those<00:04:25.560> two<00:04:25.770> pins<00:04:26.599> into<00:04:27.599> there<00:04:27.949> unplug

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
through those two pins into there unplug

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.600 
through those two pins into there unplug
it<00:04:29.630> switch<00:04:30.630> contact<00:04:31.199> goes<00:04:31.770> back<00:04:32.039> together<00:04:32.190> and

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
it switch contact goes back together and

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.670 
it switch contact goes back together and
go<00:04:33.300> see<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:33.599> first<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.199> third<00:04:34.229> pin

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
go see the first and the third pin

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.920 
go see the first and the third pin
instead<00:04:35.130> so<00:04:36.120> it's<00:04:36.330> really<00:04:36.630> really<00:04:37.169> simple<00:04:38.930> I'm

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
instead so it's really really simple I'm

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.360 
instead so it's really really simple I'm
gonna<00:04:40.110> put<00:04:40.289> this<00:04:40.380> thing<00:04:40.560> back<00:04:40.710> together<00:04:40.889> now<00:04:41.190> I

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
gonna put this thing back together now I

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.570 
gonna put this thing back together now I
drilled<00:04:41.849> the<00:04:42.030> hole<00:04:42.270> right<00:04:42.750> there<00:04:42.810> as<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:44.340> can

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
drilled the hole right there as you can

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.850 
drilled the hole right there as you can
see<00:04:44.810> your<00:04:45.810> drilled<00:04:46.139> a<00:04:46.259> hole<00:04:46.289> big<00:04:46.620> enough<00:04:46.680> for

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
see your drilled a hole big enough for

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.420 
see your drilled a hole big enough for
that<00:04:47.069> to<00:04:47.130> fit<00:04:47.430> through<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.919> hole<00:04:50.400> just

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
that to fit through and the hole just

00:04:50.430 --> 00:05:14.510 
that to fit through and the hole just
fit<00:04:50.880> together

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.969 

in<00:05:15.030> there<00:05:15.240> is<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.720> pressure<00:05:16.229> against<00:05:16.800> the

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
in there is the pressure against the

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.550 
in there is the pressure against the
back<00:05:17.400> plate<00:05:17.759> there<00:05:18.090> that's<00:05:18.990> enough<00:05:19.289> to<00:05:19.410> keep

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
back plate there that's enough to keep

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.400 
back plate there that's enough to keep
the<00:05:20.250> jack<00:05:20.729> from<00:05:21.030> coming<00:05:21.360> out<00:05:21.740> so<00:05:22.740> you<00:05:22.889> know

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
the jack from coming out so you know

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.839 
the jack from coming out so you know
plug<00:05:25.410> it<00:05:25.530> in<00:05:25.650> take<00:05:26.190> it<00:05:26.220> out<00:05:26.569> it<00:05:27.569> doesn't<00:05:28.849> come

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
plug it in take it out it doesn't come

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:35.390 
plug it in take it out it doesn't come
on<00:05:31.550> so<00:05:32.550> there<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.150> have<00:05:33.180> it<00:05:33.569> very<00:05:34.400> simple
