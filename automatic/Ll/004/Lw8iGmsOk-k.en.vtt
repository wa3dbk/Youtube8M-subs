00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
now I haven't tried this before so it

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.630 
now I haven't tried this before so it
should<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.660> very<00:00:54.750> interesting<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
should be very interesting and the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.400 
should be very interesting and the
choice<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.969> biscuit<00:00:57.360> about<00:00:57.510> gum<00:00:57.690> today<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
choice of biscuit about gum today is a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.439 
choice of biscuit about gum today is a
classic<00:00:58.890> richer<00:00:59.489> tea<00:00:59.670> because<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.090> thought<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
classic richer tea because I thought the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.910 
classic richer tea because I thought the
take<00:01:00.660> should<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.050> very<00:01:01.260> smooth<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.890> little

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
take should be very smooth a little

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.680 
take should be very smooth a little
slice<00:01:02.399> right<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.000> put<00:01:03.210> some<00:01:03.449> thought<00:01:03.480> into

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
slice right so you put some thought into

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.500
