00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
with this because I've actually done

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.030 
with this because I've actually done
this<00:02:19.850> before<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.959> worked<00:02:21.140> just<00:02:21.260> fine<00:02:21.530> but

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
this before and it worked just fine but

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.030 
this before and it worked just fine but
I'm<00:02:22.819> not<00:02:23.000> sure<00:02:23.300> why<00:02:23.540> it's<00:02:23.720> not<00:02:23.840> working<00:02:24.680> at<00:02:24.890> the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
I'm not sure why it's not working at the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.590 
I'm not sure why it's not working at the
moment<00:02:25.190> right<00:02:25.700> now<00:02:26.590> but<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:28.700> should<00:02:28.760> if<00:02:29.480> we

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
moment right now but it should if we

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.690 
moment right now but it should if we
just<00:02:29.810> take<00:02:30.500> your<00:02:30.560> time<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:30.830> wait<00:02:31.069> okay<00:02:31.400> four

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
just take your time and wait okay four

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.180 
just take your time and wait okay four
three<00:02:32.500> two<00:02:33.500> one

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
three two one

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.180 
three two one
hopefully<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.150> works<00:02:35.300> this<00:02:35.510> time<00:02:36.160> before<00:02:37.160> I

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
hopefully it works this time before I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.710 
hopefully it works this time before I
click<00:02:37.430> skip<00:02:37.730> I'm<00:02:37.850> gonna<00:02:38.000> let<00:02:38.150> everything<00:02:38.330> load

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
click skip I'm gonna let everything load

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.830 
click skip I'm gonna let everything load
up<00:02:38.900> but<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.709> this<00:02:39.800> is<00:02:40.130> finished<00:02:40.480> but<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.569> can't

up but I this is finished but you can't

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.620 
up but I this is finished but you can't
really<00:02:42.020> do<00:02:42.170> anything<00:02:42.380> without<00:02:42.680> without<00:02:43.340> this

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
really do anything without without this

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.940 
really do anything without without this
because<00:02:44.630> there's<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.900> actual<00:02:45.290> texture<00:02:45.680> for

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
because there's the actual texture for

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.920 
because there's the actual texture for
everything<00:02:46.280> in<00:02:46.370> Minecraft<00:02:46.850> this<00:02:47.480> is<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.780> add

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
everything in Minecraft this is to add

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.920 
everything in Minecraft this is to add
the<00:02:48.140> textures<00:02:48.530> for<00:02:48.709> everything<00:02:49.190> in<00:02:49.670> techie<00:02:50.090> so

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
the textures for everything in techie so

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.449 
the textures for everything in techie so
it's<00:02:51.200> gonna<00:02:51.320> wait<00:02:51.560> all<00:02:51.800> right<00:02:51.980> now<00:02:52.250> we<00:02:52.310> have

those<00:03:01.750> up<00:03:03.069> let's<00:03:04.069> make<00:03:04.610> this<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.850> little

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
those up let's make this a little

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.559 
those up let's make this a little
smaller<00:03:06.430> okay<00:03:07.480> drag<00:03:08.480> out<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.750> SMP<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:10.569> drag

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
smaller okay drag out the SMP and drag

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.290 
smaller okay drag out the SMP and drag
out<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.930> regular<00:03:12.380> texture<00:03:12.680> peg<00:03:12.980> okay

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
out the regular texture peg okay

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.229 
out the regular texture peg okay
and<00:03:14.420> now<00:03:15.079> you're<00:03:15.230> gonna<00:03:15.320> need<00:03:15.560> some<00:03:15.769> kind<00:03:15.950> of

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
and now you're gonna need some kind of

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.410 
and now you're gonna need some kind of
odd<00:03:17.239> sip<00:03:17.630> downloading<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:18.560> use<00:03:18.799> one<00:03:19.070> Rai<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.239> we

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
odd sip downloading I use one Rai so we

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.479 
odd sip downloading I use one Rai so we
open<00:03:20.750> up<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.959> regular<00:03:21.290> texture<00:03:21.560> pack<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.130> we

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
open up the regular texture pack and we

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.810 
open up the regular texture pack and we
have<00:03:22.610> all<00:03:22.850> of<00:03:22.880> these<00:03:23.329> things<00:03:23.920> close<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:27.820> here

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
have all of these things close and here

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.970 
have all of these things close and here
we<00:03:28.910> go

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
so we have all of this so we'll take

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.960 
so we have all of this so we'll take
this<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:32.870> move<00:03:33.019> that<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.500> side<00:03:35.500> okay<00:03:36.970> make

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
this and move that to the side okay make

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.349 
this and move that to the side okay make
this<00:03:38.150> bigger<00:03:38.630> that's<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.920> too<00:03:40.160> big<00:03:40.400> it's<00:03:41.269> a

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
little bit bigger and now here's the

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.680 
little bit bigger and now here's the
important<00:03:46.459> part<00:03:46.549> you<00:03:47.209> need<00:03:47.359> to<00:03:47.510> take

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
important part you need to take

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.410 
important part you need to take
everything<00:03:47.989> from<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.410> SMP<00:03:49.070> and<00:03:49.250> drag<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.209> into

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
everything from the SMP and drag it into

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.610 
everything from the SMP and drag it into
the<00:03:50.989> regularly<00:03:51.410> so<00:03:52.130> here<00:03:52.310> we<00:03:52.400> go<00:03:52.609> go<00:03:53.299> up<00:03:53.620> drag

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
the regularly so here we go go up drag

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.830 
the regularly so here we go go up drag
it<00:03:54.769> all<00:03:54.859> in<00:03:55.209> across<00:03:56.209> and<00:03:56.480> that'll<00:03:56.660> add

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
it all in across and that'll add

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.160 
it all in across and that'll add
although<00:03:57.290> our<00:03:57.410> your<00:03:57.560> texture<00:03:58.130> packs<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.579> that

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
although our your texture packs to that

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.530 
although our your texture packs to that
okay<00:04:00.430> all<00:04:01.430> right

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540
