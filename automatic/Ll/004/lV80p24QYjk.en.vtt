00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.950 
of our own that could filter some dirty
water<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:24.689> made<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.830> water<00:00:26.189> has<00:00:26.490> dirt

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
water that we made this water has dirt

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.140 
water that we made this water has dirt
cooking<00:00:27.960> oil<00:00:28.170> food<00:00:28.859> coloring<00:00:29.460> pieces<00:00:30.029> of

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
cooking oil food coloring pieces of

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.020 
cooking oil food coloring pieces of
paper<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.720> tiny<00:00:31.199> styrofoam<00:00:31.769> pieces<00:00:32.070> all<00:00:32.880> right

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
paper in tiny styrofoam pieces all right

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.560 
paper in tiny styrofoam pieces all right
let's<00:00:33.210> try<00:00:33.360> it

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
let's try it

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.560 
let's try it
ready<00:00:34.790> all<00:00:35.790> right<00:00:35.940> what<00:00:36.090> should<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.300> do<00:00:36.390> first

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
ready all right what should we do first

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.850 
ready all right what should we do first
I<00:00:36.960> think<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.820> little<00:00:39.180> piece<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.860> we

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
I think that this little piece of you we

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:54.139 
I think that this little piece of you we
can<00:00:40.890> put<00:00:41.219> something<00:00:41.700> over<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:52.730> okay<00:00:53.730> we

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
can put something over this okay we

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.750 
can put something over this okay we
should<00:00:54.360> use<00:00:54.570> these<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:54.989> something<00:00:55.760> yeah

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
should use these for something yeah

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.260 
should use these for something yeah
maybe<00:00:57.170> if<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.289> put<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.710> top<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.270> it

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
maybe if we put it on top of that it

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.590 
maybe if we put it on top of that it
would<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.660> hold<00:01:01.020> some<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> big<00:01:02.520> junk<00:01:03.300> and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
would like hold some of the big junk and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.390 
would like hold some of the big junk and
then<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.290> would<00:01:04.409> absorb<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> food

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
then that would absorb like the food

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.000 
then that would absorb like the food
coloring<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> cooking<00:01:12.680> we<00:01:13.680> push<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
coloring and the cooking we push the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.649 
coloring and the cooking we push the
napkin<00:01:14.400> all<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> way<00:01:14.820> down<00:01:15.030> then<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.420> put

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
