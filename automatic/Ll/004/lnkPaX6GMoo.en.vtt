00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:11.610
 Hello to all friends today decided to shoot 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:27.570
 how do i glue the film phone for much 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:48.750
 protective grams well not use the q 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:53.340
 film nillkin this thing you need here 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.120
 already this for removing dust from the screen after 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:02.730
 rubbing 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:05.960
 remnants of dust now show all summer 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.680
 need a card 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.650
 film phone such things for 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:19.680
 detailed film from phones for 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:22.100
 dust removal if they will certainly not 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.100
 liquid 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.390
 for cleaning 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.210
 wipe rag tours included 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.899
 Happiness wolterom especially in corners on 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.899
 hull edge 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.200
 at 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.200
 take the film and measure you and 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:33.960
 advise sense to advise myself 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.960
 glue here dynamics 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.240
 Well, that's about it, imagine yourself 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:47.850
 will look like when you glue 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.850
 the very beginning of what gaps should be 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.230
 measure can be determined slightly 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.810
 and most stickers take this rack 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:18.730
 so we divide the remnants 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:04.760
 we carry the film open where written 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.760
 number 1 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:23.430
 and how to pretend to fold 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.690
 nearly 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.690
 no bubbles 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:03.409
 that's all pretty easy in principle and 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.409
 it's just done 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.970
 what kind of Beka now we and 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:38.310
 introduced for this you first need to paste 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:38.310
 second layer only feta 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.170
 mally here here here here's a little 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:52.550
 left . 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:55.000
 here you see no sheer my now 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.000
 remove 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:14.969
 so on this slip under it 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:36.020
 and 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:36.020
 everything turned out great to sister vine 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:51.590
 peel off this thing the tape is stuck 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.590
 without a single bubble, everything is easy and simple 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:07:00.620
 in this way these are the things 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:09.450
 do not go to all the film in the set 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:12.240
 here how so more expensive is it here though 

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:19.320
 also not cheap film 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:23.610
 but thereâ€™s no such thing in it 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:26.060
 Only a rag in a set such even 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:31.590
 Now that's not a kind of quality of such 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:33.600
 rude so good 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.980
