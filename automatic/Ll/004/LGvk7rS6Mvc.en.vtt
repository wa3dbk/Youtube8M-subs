hydraulic mining what they had as large

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.620 
hydraulic mining what they had as large
water<00:04:46.040> cannons<00:04:46.580> and<00:04:47.030> they<00:04:47.240> would<00:04:47.360> literally

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
water cannons and they would literally

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.320

wash<00:04:47.960> mountains<00:04:48.470> down<00:04:48.710> in<00:04:49.580> what's<00:04:50.000> known<00:04:50.120> as<00:04:50.240> a

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
wash mountains down in what's known as a

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.090 
wash mountains down in what's known as a
sluice<00:04:50.540> box<00:04:50.840> run<00:04:51.200> that<00:04:51.380> material<00:04:51.830> through<00:04:51.980> the

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
sluice box run that material through the

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.980 
sluice box run that material through the
sluice<00:04:52.310> box<00:04:52.670> had<00:04:52.940> a<00:04:52.970> little<00:04:53.150> riffle<00:04:53.510> system<00:04:53.870> in

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
sluice box had a little riffle system in

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.230 
sluice box had a little riffle system in
it<00:04:54.130> and<00:04:55.130> that<00:04:55.550> would<00:04:55.670> wash<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.090> light

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
it and that would wash the light

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.880 
it and that would wash the light
material<00:04:56.750> in<00:04:56.810> the<00:04:56.870> mud<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.110> silt<00:04:57.500> not<00:04:57.710> all

material in the mud and silt not all

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.410 
material in the mud and silt not all
went<00:04:58.070> down<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.400> river<00:04:58.610> but<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:58.940> heavy<00:04:59.090> gold

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
went down the river but the heavy gold

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.330 
went down the river but the heavy gold
would<00:05:00.200> get<00:05:00.350> trapped<00:05:00.590> down<00:05:00.860> behind<00:05:01.040> that

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
would get trapped down behind that

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.180 
would get trapped down behind that
little<00:05:01.610> riffle<00:05:01.940> system<00:05:02.710> well<00:05:03.710> they<00:05:03.890> did<00:05:04.040> such

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
little riffle system well they did such

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.950 
little riffle system well they did such
a<00:05:04.220> good<00:05:04.430> job<00:05:04.490> doing<00:05:04.940> that<00:05:05.180> that<00:05:05.450> lasted<00:05:05.870> about
