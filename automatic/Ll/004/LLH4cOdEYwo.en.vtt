00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.120
 When a car was started, a pump was activated, usually located inside the 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.160
 fuel tank the electrical system send fuel out of 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.480
 distance are chector exception in the fuel and they take it to the cylinders 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.829
 the motor 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:17.039
 namÃºs without a panthat to take on the fuel the car would be 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.449
 normally round 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.599
 after contacting 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.349
 however, they may think that Endesa's electric world was exhibited and not 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:28.770
 It could be dangerous 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.290
 but the liquid fuel can not explode that's why it's a very 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.290
 safe 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.070
 production starts with the pumping mechanism a gear is compressed and 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.750
 several warlords between two metal plates the ankles and will turn to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.750
 take the fuel to the pump before removing it from this entity 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.570
 by the district of san blas and splurge and ostentation of the cyber from below 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.650
 p 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.650
 then a robot was ours and it moves to the next station 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.440
 here is added an electric motor the pumping mechanism with knives and 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.440
 then a magnetic sleeve and a plastic lid are added 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.370
 all the participants in the pumping mechanism have been set on fire 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.950
 then he devoted himself to dealing with this subject with a filter made of a mesh 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.270
 metallic 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.050
 the fundamentalists got rid over the bomb and all that attached to prison 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.910
 inside this very large chamber mission was a powerful force field 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.160
 this causes the collapse of the metal tape that bends at one end 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.159
 keeping all the parts together 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.080
 ja 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.840
 then add years of child retention from the pump cover 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 gas 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.079
 metal supports are placed on the pump 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.819
 they keep Julian and they serve meals while you install 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.819
 useless studies that will provide electricity to the pump motor 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.459
 a bronze terminal was undone at the end of each bovine assembly and 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.459
 brushes for easy electrical connection 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.159
 then terminal buildings the assembly 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.279
 at the end of the work a robot promotes the support 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.699
 This fuel pump has been manufactured from the inside out and 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.699
 now the mechanisms are finished 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.729
 inspectors connect each pump to a power source and their son applies 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:00.599
 to check the pumping 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.829
 then check the flow and pressure 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.540
 afp so the bomb phase of instruction a robot moves it to the line of 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.069
 assembly where a pipe system was installed 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.069
 you have to take the fuel to the engine 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:21.249
 follow the paintings with solder paste 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.819
 then and it takes a gas oven where the pastes to each other merges the 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.819
 pipes 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.949
 the tubes are removed from the oven and if they remove the pieces of metal and hardened paste 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.949
 leftovers 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.929
 na 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:54.649
 the ends of the appliance are covered to prevent accumulation of dust and debris 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:57.649
 during its distribution 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:04.569
 a rubber pipe is added to the ishige pump with the phrase of the metals 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.359
 then there are the rubber pipes metal pipes system 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.340
 pump cables are added then made a device that will be 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.340
 connected the motor wiring 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.580
 this is the only transmission 2 next to a metal arm connected a 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.030
 electronic sensor the sex of an information about the expense of 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.030
 fuels and automobile dashboard 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.870
 a computerized system checks the accuracy of the transmission unit 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.870
 while moving sensors and up and down 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.210
 once everything is past it's time to fill up the tank and drive
