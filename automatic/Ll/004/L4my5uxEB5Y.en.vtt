00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.820
 it's more of world clash of land in this 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.710
 nation we are going to see attacks in which 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.260
 and we are going to find many many 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.869
 looks many abandoned villages in what 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.490
 that would be the gold league good is quite 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.610
 peculiar to find these villages because 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.410
 they do not always appear 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.060
 you have to be pretty lucky to 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.180
 that seem like a string of villages 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.880
 sometimes you think a daily one each 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.890
 two days once a week but a 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.790
 sometimes they touch gusts that touch you 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.980
 five daily or more good that's already thing 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.800
 to be lucky because no no not always 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.860
 you leave villages so abandoned and a lot 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.050
 unless they are well exposed 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.030
 the mines and they are full as how 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.200
 in these cases we will see in this case 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.830
 it was the dream attack 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.280
 quite pretty good the booty that 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.950
 took say what for 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.710
 more or less to the level that many 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.970
 sometimes it is handled in this case if I do not know 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.799
 I think that having level nine 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.299
 city ​​councils at day level but by 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.020
 example you find this village with a 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:21.229
 increase to level 7 or level 8 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.090
 imagine how much will increase how much 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.830
 will increase practically what you 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.930
 you're going to steal if in this case they were 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.330
 200,000 if in front of level 7 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.630
 practically be carrying like 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.909
 350,000 who knows 400,000 maybe 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.610
 200,000 each and practically nothing 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.410
 of dark elixir but good for 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.340
 Spending few resources was quite 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:47.060
 well in this case 400 thousand gold with 200 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.759
 250 thousand of elixir you can practically 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.220
 easily recover your investment from what 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.619
 that would be the archers when you do 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.899
 farming in these leagues down let's say 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.100
 gold league and some that do in league 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.960
 silver 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.960
 the most recommended to do in league 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.820
 Gold really I recommend you better 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.680
 all archers or yes they can barbarians and 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.050
 archers are the ones who do go they see 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.360
 a boom 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.120
 it's a little easier to do it with 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.130
 all archers because in these leagues there 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.820
 you will find villages too strong 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.580
 in my work or new three maybe if 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.260
 let's tie silver contradictory thing 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.780
 because if you go down to silver league there's 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.510
 enough people who have villages 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.890
 pretty strong that are there then 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.320
 if it's a little bit more complicated sometimes 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.780
 they steal that online or what they would have to 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.790
 do upside down that the more it goes up is 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.440
 harder to be and sometimes you do not know is 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.170
 the more they go up the easier they are 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.940
 because people say with better 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.860
 villages likes to be always down 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.960
 because it's quieter everything really 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.210
 not so easy they will steal you if you have 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.390
 a good village 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.910
 then there are people with leagues with villages 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.760
 pretty easy to steal pretty low 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.310
 for the leagues that move 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.220
 and they are practically going up their village to 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.049
 base of bonuses and things like that for example 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.500
 there are intermediate level 7 increase to 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.250
 level 8 is going up to bonus base and I 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.040
 I 've run into villages up in 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.079
 teacher more or less that they give you part 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.690
 The bonus is that you're leaving is to go to 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.940
 up to 200 250 thousand to me 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.250
 I'm 20 level 9 level that's what I 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.079
 have these villages and practically they 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.970
 they go up there to breaking 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.480
 municipalities based on bonuses pass there 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.050
 practically kept there then it 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.750
 they realize 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.400
 there are quite a few contradictions in that of 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.099
 the leagues but what it is that 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.939
 for example in league now you are going to steal 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.680
 pretty good no matter your level of 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.450
 City Hall really steals enough 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.129
 well there 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.569
 it's a matter of luck as I say it's 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.560
 question of luck against these 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:02.849
 villages because there is not a rule 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.209
 established in which you are going to have is 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.819
 true now certain good there are people 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.440
 that if they believe that and at least I do 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.690
 I think that from certain times it is that it comes out 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.160
 the villages like that but there's also no 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.530
 rule that for example good I'm going to 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.479
 Connect today at 2 pm and mode 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.370
 find villages like that no no it's not like that or 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.710
 be as I say it's a matter of luck 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.270
 many times find them because you can 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.950
 to make you connect with the 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.030
 tomorrow and they will see and the next of your 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.470
 you connect again to any of the 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.960
 tomorrow at the same time that you connect 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.430
 the day before and they are not going to see can 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.410
 make the next day you connect 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.960
 you at three in the afternoon and you go to 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.740
 find and possibly the next day 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.389
 you will not find anything then 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.580
 it really is a matter of matter 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.169
 I do not know what it will be like at the time 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.760
 that your present take out villages like these 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.620
 but good for me 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.900
 the report of thinking has always been 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.710
 Scottish luck that you leave villages like 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:59.430
 these at the time of for example I had 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.320
 be forming and I do not know some think 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.960
 which is also a question of the troops 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.390
 that you come from something that I really do not 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.340
 I think that but, but good that I do every 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.080
 who and his way of analyzing the 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.000
 things in this case because I do not know 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.760
 It is very easy to steal with a 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.250
 He counted barqueras I think that there is 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.400
 enough videos so much here on the channel 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.920
 to to see this kind of tactics in 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.960
 which explains how this is done 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.270
 type of attacks to work for you 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.610
 a better way in this case leads 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.830
 four rage is something that I normally 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.230
 in the attacks always vote of all 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.050
 spells are lightning 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.400
 because because you imagine that dark that 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.969
 is in the center you will not be able to 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.789
 Steal 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.969
 and with lightning at least you're going to prey 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:48.189
 although it is the milestone that is that I say to you 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:49.569
 about five hundred our 500 of liquid 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:52.089
 dark can make you take it that way 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.379
 with lightning and who knows maybe you 

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:57.479
 can take our thousand or a little 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:06:00.099
 more when rays that 's a matter of seeing 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:03.129
 then nothing more or less that's how 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:06.999
 how are these attacks going on or in 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:10.539
 gold league move steals us pretty well in 

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:11.880
 this case is practically a theft of a 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.120
 million 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.940
 a hundred thousand out there pretty good enough 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.700
 to be able to find you he has given 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.130
 really gifted if our mayo I think 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.530
 that the city council neither of the 8 nor we raised 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.860
 against the increase to level 10 good 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.840
 that's why the big booty is that 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.460
 leads then it really is more than everything 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.910
 a recommendation for you 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.770
 they charge me and tell me more or less how much 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.060
 stolen and in what league they usually pass 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.860
 farm and before but they liked this 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.540
 video I hope you liked the 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.730
 booties because they really were pretty 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:49.340
 good and good to comment in which leagues 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.340
 form you see us next chau
