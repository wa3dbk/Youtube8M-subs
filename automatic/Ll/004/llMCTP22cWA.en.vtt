that it is very sensitive and picks up a

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.960 
that it is very sensitive and picks up a
lot<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:57.990> noise<00:02:58.200> but<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.070> shock<00:02:59.310> mount<00:02:59.580> helps

now<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.070> downsides<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:07.030> this<00:04:07.180> microphone<00:04:07.540> are

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
now the downsides of this microphone are

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.560 
now the downsides of this microphone are
mainly<00:04:08.740> that<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:08.980> is<00:04:09.280> discontinued<00:04:10.180> so

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
mainly that it is discontinued so

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.850 
mainly that it is discontinued so
eventually<00:04:10.900> it's<00:04:11.380> going<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.680> become

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
eventually it's going to become

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
eventually it's going to become
unavailable

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880

it<00:04:13.690> also<00:04:13.870> doesn't<00:04:14.170> come<00:04:14.470> with<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.650> shock<00:04:14.920> mount

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
it also doesn't come with a shock mount

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.240 
it also doesn't come with a shock mount
and<00:04:15.400> like<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.270> other<00:04:16.480> MSL<00:04:17.140> microphone<00:04:17.709> this

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
and like the other MSL microphone this

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.160 
and like the other MSL microphone this
also<00:04:18.670> picks<00:04:18.880> up<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.150> lot<00:04:19.270> of<00:04:19.330> external<00:04:19.989> noise

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
also picks up a lot of external noise

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.350 
also picks up a lot of external noise
which<00:04:20.650> can<00:04:20.830> be<00:04:20.950> fixed<00:04:21.190> with<00:04:21.370> EQ<00:04:21.820> during<00:04:22.150> mixing

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
which can be fixed with EQ during mixing

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.260 
which can be fixed with EQ during mixing
and<00:04:22.660> mastering<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.400> that<00:04:24.400> wraps<00:04:24.640> up<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:25.000> top

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270
