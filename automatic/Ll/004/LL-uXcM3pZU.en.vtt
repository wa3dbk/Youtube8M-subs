turning on all these lanterns in here so
we<00:02:04.170> go<00:02:04.290> through<00:02:04.469> another<00:02:04.619> one<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.040> tried<00:02:05.399> to

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
we go through another one I tried to

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.270 
we go through another one I tried to
replicate<00:02:06.920> something<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.099> was<00:02:08.220> very

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
replicate something that was very

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.360 
replicate something that was very
similar<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.929> way<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.470> bridges<00:02:11.009> are<00:02:11.039> done

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
similar to the way the bridges are done

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.550 
similar to the way the bridges are done
on<00:02:11.400> Star<00:02:11.790> Destroyers<00:02:12.470> so

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
on Star Destroyers so

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.229 
on Star Destroyers so
just<00:02:13.830> saw<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.069> little<00:02:14.250> pattern<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:14.970> it's

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
just saw this little pattern it's it's

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.000 
just saw this little pattern it's it's
meant<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.540> be<00:02:15.569> like<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.780> V<00:02:16.050> shape<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.650> obviously

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
meant to be like a V shape and obviously

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.040 
meant to be like a V shape and obviously
in<00:02:17.160> Minecraft<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.670> can't<00:02:17.849> make<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> V<00:02:18.300> shape<00:02:18.330> so

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
in Minecraft you can't make a V shape so

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.680 
in Minecraft you can't make a V shape so
just<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.349> 12<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.830> one<00:02:20.090> combination<00:02:21.090> instead

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
just the 12 to one combination instead

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.020 
just the 12 to one combination instead
and<00:02:22.190> then<00:02:23.190> we<00:02:23.250> flying<00:02:23.520> on<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.640> card<00:02:23.849> or<00:02:24.000> a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
and then we flying on the card or a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.240 
and then we flying on the card or a
little<00:02:24.180> bit<00:02:24.270> further<00:02:24.830> still<00:02:25.830> wasn't<00:02:26.040> really

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
little bit further still wasn't really

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.410 
little bit further still wasn't really
sure<00:02:26.280> about<00:02:26.580> putting<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:26.940> another<00:02:27.000> set<00:02:27.330> of

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
sure about putting it another set of

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.410 
sure about putting it another set of
stones<00:02:27.660> like<00:02:28.290> glowing<00:02:28.620> stones<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.069> here<00:02:29.550> sided

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
stones like glowing stones in here sided

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.150 
stones like glowing stones in here sided
against<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.870> because<00:02:31.019> I<00:02:31.200> just<00:02:31.500> leveled<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.010> all

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
against it because I just leveled it all

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.970 
against it because I just leveled it all
up<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:33.420> went<00:02:33.690> with<00:02:33.720> what<00:02:33.900> we<00:02:34.019> had<00:02:34.170> but

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.420 
area like hangar bay area not here this
will<00:02:52.230> probably<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:52.709> come<00:02:52.920> straight<00:02:53.310> down

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
will probably just come straight down

corridor area and go from there this
will<00:03:19.290> also<00:03:19.380> go<00:03:19.650> up<00:03:19.680> another<00:03:19.980> level<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.489> want<00:03:21.480> to

yeah well we'll play around with that a
little<00:03:37.739> bit<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:38.010> build<00:03:38.910> up<00:03:39.030> over<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.390> top<00:03:39.540> I

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
little bit and build up over the top I

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.960 
little bit and build up over the top I
wanna<00:03:40.109> have<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.230> little<00:03:40.319> bit<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.709> region<00:03:41.459> down

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
wanna have a little bit of a region down

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.309 
wanna have a little bit of a region down
here<00:03:42.209> we'll<00:03:42.329> get<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.480> level<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.840> floor<00:03:43.019> out<00:03:43.200> as

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
here we'll get a level the floor out as

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.039 
here we'll get a level the floor out as
well<00:03:43.549> but<00:03:44.549> this<00:03:44.609> would<00:03:44.819> be<00:03:44.880> like<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:45.060> three-tier

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
well but this would be like a three-tier

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.229 
well but this would be like a three-tier
area<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:47.280> law<00:03:47.489> will<00:03:47.639> come<00:03:47.850> out<00:03:48.060> and

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
area this this law will come out and

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.580 
area this this law will come out and
this<00:03:48.299> would<00:03:48.420> be<00:03:48.480> like<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.660> main<00:03:48.959> command<00:03:49.319> area

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
this would be like the main command area

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.800 
this would be like the main command area
i<00:03:49.829> think<00:03:50.190> as<00:03:51.060> opposed<00:03:51.329> to<00:03:51.389> just<00:03:51.420> having<00:03:51.569> this

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
i think as opposed to just having this

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.250 
i think as opposed to just having this
big<00:03:52.019> ass<00:03:52.230> walkway<00:03:52.799> between<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.280> all<00:03:53.660> yeah<00:03:54.660> so

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
big ass walkway between it all yeah so

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.949 
big ass walkway between it all yeah so
that'll<00:03:55.530> fill<00:03:55.680> in<00:03:55.829> that<00:03:56.190> direction<00:03:56.639> and<00:03:56.959> up

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
that'll fill in that direction and up

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.449 
that'll fill in that direction and up
from<00:03:58.200> there<00:03:58.410> looks<00:03:58.980> like<00:03:59.069> we<00:03:59.160> actually<00:03:59.400> hit

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
from there looks like we actually hit

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.759 
from there looks like we actually hit
night<00:03:59.639> time<00:03:59.850> as<00:04:00.000> well<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:00.450> yeah<00:04:00.840> working<00:04:01.680> on

stuff is run in the box to hold it all

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.040 
stuff is run in the box to hold it all
in<00:05:55.800> there's<00:05:56.400> better<00:05:56.520> be<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.699> Jedi<00:05:56.969> archives<00:05:57.449> I

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819 
really filled in a lot of the top areas

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:22.370 
really filled in a lot of the top areas
in<00:06:21.000> fact<00:06:21.180> now<00:06:21.389> you<00:06:21.449> are<00:06:21.659> you<00:06:21.750> see<00:06:21.900> him<00:06:22.020> working
