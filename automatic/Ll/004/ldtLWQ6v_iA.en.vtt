welcome back last we left it showed you
how<00:00:09.610> to<00:00:09.640> make<00:00:09.760> a<00:00:09.880> mute<00:00:10.150> switch<00:00:10.920> again<00:00:11.920> the

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
how to make a mute switch again the

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.270 
how to make a mute switch again the
battery<00:00:12.400> this<00:00:12.790> is<00:00:12.969> a<00:00:13.290> battery<00:00:14.290> switch<00:00:14.740> for<00:00:15.099> the

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
battery this is a battery switch for the

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.110 
battery this is a battery switch for the
LED<00:00:15.870> green<00:00:16.870> means<00:00:17.110> it's<00:00:17.320> not<00:00:17.500> muted<00:00:18.040> red<00:00:18.850> means

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.120 
LED green means it's not muted red means

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
LED green means it's not muted red means
it's<00:00:19.390> muted<00:00:21.119> mute<00:00:22.119> switch<00:00:22.330> is<00:00:22.510> important<00:00:23.080> to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
it's muted mute switch is important to

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.640 
it's muted mute switch is important to
have<00:00:23.320> as<00:00:23.680> we<00:00:24.490> discussed<00:00:24.880> last<00:00:25.000> time<00:00:25.650> very

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
have as we discussed last time very

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.679 
have as we discussed last time very
simple<00:00:27.039> design<00:00:27.340> it<00:00:27.760> will<00:00:27.880> kill<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.210> signal

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
simple design it will kill the signal

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.779 
simple design it will kill the signal
anything<00:00:29.410> above<00:00:29.619> 1<00:00:29.830> Hertz<00:00:30.099> will<00:00:30.340> be<00:00:30.460> clipped

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
anything above 1 Hertz will be clipped

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.480 
anything above 1 Hertz will be clipped
off<00:00:31.090> and<00:00:31.449> not<00:00:32.349> passed<00:00:32.710> through<00:00:33.070> the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:33.490 
off and not passed through the

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.139 
off and not passed through the
pedalboard<00:00:33.790> onto<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.630> amps<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:36.760> what<00:00:36.940> if<00:00:37.030> you

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
pedalboard onto the amps but what if you

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.080 
pedalboard onto the amps but what if you
have<00:00:37.329> two<00:00:37.809> or<00:00:37.840> more<00:00:38.219> amps<00:00:39.219> or<00:00:39.340> two<00:00:39.820> more

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
have two or more amps or two more

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.389 
have two or more amps or two more
microphones<00:00:40.920> let's<00:00:41.920> say<00:00:42.039> you<00:00:42.190> want<00:00:42.370> to

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
microphones let's say you want to

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.190 
microphones let's say you want to
getting<00:00:42.700> these<00:00:42.850> together<00:00:43.059> well<00:00:43.539> it's<00:00:43.690> simple

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
getting these together well it's simple

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.520 
getting these together well it's simple
the<00:00:44.980> whole<00:00:45.340> idea<00:00:45.940> there<00:00:46.180> is<00:00:46.239> you<00:00:46.989> take<00:00:47.320> the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
the whole idea there is you take the

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.290 
the whole idea there is you take the
output<00:00:48.600> from<00:00:49.600> either<00:00:49.809> might<00:00:50.110> mute<00:00:50.920> switch

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
output from either might mute switch

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.830 
output from either might mute switch
gang<00:00:52.300> them<00:00:52.570> together<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:55.180> is<00:00:55.329> a<00:00:55.359> simple

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
gang them together this is a simple

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.819 
gang them together this is a simple
patch<00:00:56.320> cord<00:00:56.739> that<00:00:56.949> you<00:00:57.160> would<00:00:57.280> have<00:00:57.789> from<00:00:57.969> a

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
patch cord that you would have from a

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.959 
patch cord that you would have from a
pebble<00:01:00.660> cord<00:01:02.430> they're<00:01:03.430> ganging<00:01:03.640> together

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
pebble cord they're ganging together

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.120 
pebble cord they're ganging together
there's<00:01:04.780> a<00:01:04.870> slight<00:01:05.110> modification<00:01:05.350> we'll<00:01:05.950> get

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
there's a slight modification we'll get

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.310 
there's a slight modification we'll get
into<00:01:06.250> this<00:01:06.730> a<00:01:06.790> little<00:01:06.970> bit<00:01:07.120> later<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.840> hold<00:01:08.260> a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
into this a little bit later and hold a

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.860 
into this a little bit later and hold a
nice<00:01:08.530> idea<00:01:08.950> about<00:01:09.160> this<00:01:09.460> I<00:01:09.700> can<00:01:09.850> either<00:01:10.000> play

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
nice idea about this I can either play

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.430 
nice idea about this I can either play
through<00:01:11.140> here<00:01:11.440> I<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.880> play<00:01:13.060> through<00:01:13.440> the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
through here I can play through the

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.690 
through here I can play through the
green<00:01:14.650> bullet<00:01:15.040> or<00:01:15.880> quickly<00:01:16.780> switch<00:01:17.080> over<00:01:17.700> play

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
green bullet or quickly switch over play

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.770 
green bullet or quickly switch over play
through<00:01:19.150> my<00:01:19.420> mad<00:01:20.260> cat<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:22.420> really

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
through my mad cat but you really

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.850 
through my mad cat but you really
wouldn't<00:01:23.140> want<00:01:23.410> to<00:01:24.120> play<00:01:25.120> both<00:01:25.480> them<00:01:25.810> this<00:01:26.590> is

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
wouldn't want to play both them this is

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.250 
wouldn't want to play both them this is
a<00:01:26.890> low<00:01:27.250> impedance<00:01:27.690> microphone<00:01:29.070> 600<00:01:30.070> ohm<00:01:31.260> 10

wouldn't<00:01:34.360> make<00:01:34.540> sense<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:35.500> match<00:01:35.710> these

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
wouldn't make sense to match these

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.240 
wouldn't make sense to match these
together<00:01:36.430> this<00:01:37.420> will<00:01:37.780> win<00:01:38.020> every<00:01:38.410> time<00:01:38.650> it'll

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
together this will win every time it'll

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.290 
together this will win every time it'll
beat<00:01:39.550> this<00:01:39.820> one<00:01:40.060> out<00:01:40.270> for<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.140> same<00:01:41.350> reason

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
beat this one out for the same reason

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.240 
beat this one out for the same reason
it's<00:01:43.300> okay<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.750> probably<00:01:44.170> play<00:01:44.380> both<00:01:44.920> of<00:01:44.950> these

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
it's okay to probably play both of these

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.060 
it's okay to probably play both of these
together<00:01:45.760> through<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.900> amp<00:01:47.080> I<00:01:47.470> don't<00:01:47.770> really

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
together through the amp I don't really

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.860 
together through the amp I don't really
know<00:01:48.250> why<00:01:48.460> you<00:01:48.520> would<00:01:48.760> want<00:01:48.970> to<00:01:49.180> but<00:01:49.510> they<00:01:49.630> have

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
know why you would want to but they have

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.110 
know why you would want to but they have
to<00:01:50.080> be<00:01:50.200> matched<00:01:50.530> they're<00:01:51.310> still<00:01:51.670> gonna<00:01:51.880> be<00:01:52.090> a

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
to be matched they're still gonna be a

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.880 
to be matched they're still gonna be a
little<00:01:52.360> play<00:01:52.690> between<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.410> two<00:01:53.590> of<00:01:53.740> these

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
little play between the two of these

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.770 
little play between the two of these
even<00:01:54.400> though<00:01:54.520> these<00:01:54.790> are<00:01:55.000> both<00:01:55.150> low<00:01:55.450> impedance

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
even though these are both low impedance

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.280 
even though these are both low impedance
mics<00:01:56.370> but<00:01:57.370> if<00:01:57.760> you<00:01:58.000> need<00:01:58.210> to<00:01:58.420> if<00:01:58.750> you're<00:01:59.170> gonna

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
mics but if you need to if you're gonna

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.170 
mics but if you need to if you're gonna
gang<00:01:59.590> them<00:01:59.800> together<00:01:59.980> and<00:02:00.520> then<00:02:00.820> go<00:02:00.970> to<00:02:01.030> a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
gang them together and then go to a

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.780 
gang them together and then go to a
single<00:02:01.570> source<00:02:01.840> they<00:02:02.470> need<00:02:02.680> to<00:02:02.770> be<00:02:02.860> matched

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.219 

will<00:02:06.790> go<00:02:06.970> talked<00:02:07.210> about<00:02:07.480> the<00:02:07.600> circuit<00:02:07.930> here<00:02:08.140> in

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
will go talked about the circuit here in

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.660 
will go talked about the circuit here in
just<00:02:08.379> a<00:02:08.500> minute<00:02:08.649> so<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:09.009> can<00:02:09.129> see<00:02:09.280> what<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:09.550> did

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
just a minute so you can see what I did

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.720 
just a minute so you can see what I did
to<00:02:09.970> modify<00:02:10.420> in<00:02:10.840> order<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:11.860> do<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.250> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
to modify in order to do that the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.230 
to modify in order to do that the
circuit<00:02:13.120> as<00:02:13.270> it<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:13.600> if<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:13.900> don't<00:02:14.050> modify<00:02:14.470> the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
circuit as it is if you don't modify the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.460 
circuit as it is if you don't modify the
schematic<00:02:16.240> any<00:02:16.480> at<00:02:16.570> all

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
schematic any at all

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.190 
schematic any at all
when<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:18.310> mute<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:18.850> one<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.390> cuts<00:02:19.630> both<00:02:19.900> them

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
when you mute this one it cuts both them

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.620 
when you mute this one it cuts both them
off<00:02:20.710> because<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.760> circuit<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.420> fact

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
off because of the circuit and the fact

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.720 
off because of the circuit and the fact
that<00:02:22.720> you're<00:02:22.930> matched<00:02:23.140> here<00:02:23.590> but<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.520> this

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
that you're matched here but in this

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.030 
that you're matched here but in this
configuration<00:02:25.720> which<00:02:26.380> we'll<00:02:26.560> show<00:02:26.740> you<00:02:26.770> in<00:02:26.890> a

configuration which we'll show you in a

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.370 
configuration which we'll show you in a
few<00:02:27.250> minutes<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:28.240> can<00:02:28.390> take<00:02:28.420> multiple<00:02:29.290> of

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
few minutes you can take multiple of

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.160 
few minutes you can take multiple of
these<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.860> can<00:02:29.920> put<00:02:29.980> three<00:02:30.460> four<00:02:30.970> five<00:02:31.360> turn

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
these you can put three four five turn

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.640 
these you can put three four five turn
them<00:02:32.320> on<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:32.650> on<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.370> off<00:02:33.460> separately<00:02:33.850> just

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
them on on on and off separately just

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.630 
them on on on and off separately just
pick<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.830> choose<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.250> sort<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.460> like<00:02:36.580> a

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
pick and choose it's sort of like a

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.410 
pick and choose it's sort of like a
smorgasbord<00:02:37.300> of<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.230> b<00:02:38.500> c<00:02:39.070> d<00:02:39.100> yeah

switches<00:02:40.990> let's<00:02:41.830> go<00:02:41.950> talk<00:02:42.160> about<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.490> a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
switches let's go talk about that a

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.060 
switches let's go talk about that a
little<00:02:42.850> bit<00:02:46.200> remember<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.380> this<00:02:47.920> is

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
little bit remember this this is

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.430 
little bit remember this this is
original<00:02:48.460> circuit<00:02:49.080> originally<00:02:50.080> he<00:02:50.140> just<00:02:50.320> had

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
original circuit originally he just had

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.760 
original circuit originally he just had
one<00:02:50.680> switch<00:02:51.010> in<00:02:52.000> theory<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.050> operation<00:02:53.620> is

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
one switch in theory the operation is

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.360 
one switch in theory the operation is
when<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.250> shuts<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:56.080> decoupling<00:02:56.560> capacitor

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
when the shuts this decoupling capacitor

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.900 
when the shuts this decoupling capacitor
and<00:02:57.520> resistor<00:02:58.120> fire<00:02:58.510> off<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:59.530> dampen<00:03:00.100> any<00:03:00.340> sing

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
and resistor fire off to dampen any sing

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.120 
and resistor fire off to dampen any sing
or<00:03:01.090> pop<00:03:01.480> across<00:03:01.959> that<00:03:02.440> may<00:03:02.680> be<00:03:02.740> coming<00:03:03.040> from

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
or pop across that may be coming from

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.260 
or pop across that may be coming from
pin<00:03:03.700> two<00:03:04.060> from<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.990> input<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.770> output

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
pin two from the input to the output

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.730 
pin two from the input to the output
we're<00:03:07.270> going<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.450> modify<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.140> little<00:03:08.290> bit

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
we're going to modify this a little bit

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.590 
we're going to modify this a little bit
while<00:03:09.310> this<00:03:09.520> clamp<00:03:09.880> sit<00:03:10.120> down<00:03:10.330> when<00:03:10.570> you

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
while this clamp sit down when you

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.949 
while this clamp sit down when you
connect<00:03:11.050> this<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:12.160> output<00:03:12.370> from<00:03:13.209> one<00:03:13.270> to<00:03:13.840> the

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
connect this the output from one to the

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:14.940 
connect this the output from one to the
next<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.470> next

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
next to the next

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.170 
next to the next
this<00:03:15.550> clamping<00:03:16.270> will<00:03:17.550> effectively<00:03:18.550> keep<00:03:18.970> all

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
this clamping will effectively keep all

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.670 
this clamping will effectively keep all
switches<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:19.840> are<00:03:19.930> connected<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.470> one

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
switches that are connected to one

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.250 
switches that are connected to one
another<00:03:21.239> muted<00:03:22.239> so<00:03:22.630> we're<00:03:22.780> going<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:22.959> modify

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
another muted so we're going to modify

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.250 
another muted so we're going to modify
this<00:03:23.440> just<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:24.100> bit<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.920> whole<00:03:27.130> idea<00:03:27.519> is<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:28.260> add

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
this just a bit the whole idea is to add

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.220 
this just a bit the whole idea is to add
a<00:03:29.850> switch<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:32.470> there's<00:03:32.739> an<00:03:32.890> unmuted<00:03:33.400> position

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
a switch so there's an unmuted position

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.080 
a switch so there's an unmuted position
here's<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.320> muted<00:03:37.080> when<00:03:38.080> it's<00:03:38.260> muted<00:03:38.650> it's<00:03:38.830> shut

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
here's a muted when it's muted it's shut

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.780 
here's a muted when it's muted it's shut
this<00:03:40.090> opens<00:03:40.600> up<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.260> roof<00:03:41.620> because<00:03:42.370> this

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
this opens up the roof because this

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.280 
this opens up the roof because this
circuit<00:03:43.180> here<00:03:43.480> is<00:03:43.510> keeping<00:03:43.930> this<00:03:44.080> from

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
circuit here is keeping this from

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.590 
circuit here is keeping this from
popping<00:03:44.800> it<00:03:44.950> also<00:03:45.160> keeps<00:03:45.580> this<00:03:45.820> from<00:03:45.880> making<00:03:46.510> a

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
popping it also keeps this from making a

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.870 
popping it also keeps this from making a
popping<00:03:47.049> noise<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.799> output<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.610> wherever

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
popping noise to the output to wherever

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.780 
popping noise to the output to wherever
the<00:03:49.030> downstream<00:03:49.510> circuit<00:03:50.080> is<00:03:50.459> if<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.640> have<00:03:51.730> a

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
the downstream circuit is if you have a

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.170 
the downstream circuit is if you have a
three<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.299> three<00:03:53.190> pole<00:03:54.190> double<00:03:54.760> throw<00:03:54.910> switch

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
three a three pole double throw switch

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.570 
three a three pole double throw switch
like<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.900> stomp<00:03:56.260> switch<00:03:56.560> that's<00:03:57.190> just<00:03:57.430> the

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
like a stomp switch that's just the

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.610 
like a stomp switch that's just the
third<00:03:57.880> pole<00:03:58.299> that<00:03:58.510> you<00:03:58.660> need<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.989> add<00:03:59.140> to<00:03:59.470> the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
third pole that you need to add to the

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.660 
third pole that you need to add to the
circuit<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:01.090> then<00:04:01.360> when<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:01.930> clamps<00:04:02.290> down<00:04:02.670> you

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
circuit and then when it clamps down you

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.580 
circuit and then when it clamps down you
open<00:04:03.790> up<00:04:04.060> it's<00:04:04.299> unmuted<00:04:04.959> it's<00:04:05.110> connected

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
open up it's unmuted it's connected

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.530 
open up it's unmuted it's connected
again<00:04:05.709> again<00:04:06.340> it's<00:04:06.489> not<00:04:06.640> going<00:04:06.820> to<00:04:06.880> pop<00:04:07.060> this

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
again again it's not going to pop this

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.080 
again again it's not going to pop this
this<00:04:08.019> circuit<00:04:08.380> will<00:04:08.530> not<00:04:08.680> pop<00:04:08.980> but<00:04:09.549> just

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
this circuit will not pop but just

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.820 
this circuit will not pop but just
adding<00:04:10.330> that<00:04:10.510> last<00:04:10.840> pole<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.440> circuit

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
adding that last pole to the circuit

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.039 
adding that last pole to the circuit
makes<00:04:12.400> this<00:04:12.640> allows<00:04:13.209> this<00:04:13.570> to<00:04:16.049> continually

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
makes this allows this to continually

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.150 
makes this allows this to continually
make<00:04:17.890> and<00:04:18.070> break<00:04:18.250> allows<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.419> gang<00:04:19.660> a<00:04:19.959> B<00:04:20.560> C
