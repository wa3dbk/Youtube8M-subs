started<00:00:23.850> working<00:00:24.240> with<00:00:24.300> polymer<00:00:24.720> clay<00:00:25.010> what

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
started working with polymer clay what

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.320 
started working with polymer clay what
you<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.310> here<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.609> some<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.939> different

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
you see here are some of the different

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.640 
you see here are some of the different
things<00:00:27.510> we've<00:00:27.750> made<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.140> polymer<00:00:28.619> clay

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
things we've made with polymer clay

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.919 
things we've made with polymer clay
there's<00:00:29.550> not<00:00:30.119> much<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.449> can't<00:00:30.660> make<00:00:30.779> with

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
there's not much you can't make with

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.590 
there's not much you can't make with
polymer<00:00:31.260> clay<00:00:31.289> because<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.859> versatile

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
polymer clay because it's so versatile

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.389 
polymer clay because it's so versatile
here<00:00:33.600> we've<00:00:33.930> made<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.410> light<00:00:34.620> switch<00:00:34.800> cover<00:00:35.130> and

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
here we've made a light switch cover and

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.530 
here we've made a light switch cover and
we've<00:00:36.090> used<00:00:36.300> some<00:00:36.480> ink<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:37.170> decorate<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.649> and

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
we've used some ink to decorate it and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.290 
we've used some ink to decorate it and
here<00:00:39.540> we've<00:00:39.719> made<00:00:39.750> some<00:00:40.110> magnets<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.239> do

can also make some jewelry this is a
necklace<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.729> made<00:01:20.939> where<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> actually<00:01:22.049> stamped

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
necklace I made where I actually stamped

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.300 
necklace I made where I actually stamped
on<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> clay<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.939> then<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.720> strung<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.140> up

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
on to the clay and then I strung it up

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.620 
on to the clay and then I strung it up
this<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.430> another<00:01:26.610> necklace<00:01:26.909> I've<00:01:27.210> made<00:01:27.390> where

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
this is another necklace I've made where

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.990 
this is another necklace I've made where
I<00:01:27.689> where<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.439> took<00:01:28.560> different<00:01:29.250> colors<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.820> clay

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
I where I took different colors of clay

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.640 
I where I took different colors of clay
and<00:01:30.030> form<00:01:30.450> them<00:01:30.600> into<00:01:30.630> these<00:01:30.930> designs<00:01:31.380> that

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and form them into these designs that

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.830 
and form them into these designs that
are<00:01:31.710> called<00:01:31.950> canes<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.479> actually<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
are called canes and this is actually a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.260 
are called canes and this is actually a
cane<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.460> with<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> cane<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.970> form<00:01:36.210> your

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
cane and with the cane you form your

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.910 
cane and with the cane you form your
design<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:36.990> cut<00:01:37.140> slices<00:01:37.409> off<00:01:37.710> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
design and you can cut slices off and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.590 
design and you can cut slices off and
the<00:01:38.250> pattern<00:01:38.520> runs<00:01:38.700> from<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.180> front<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the pattern runs from the front to the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.260 
the pattern runs from the front to the
back<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.110> wherever<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.770> cut<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> slice<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.670> has

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
back so wherever you cut a slice it has

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.350 
back so wherever you cut a slice it has
the<00:01:42.450> design<00:01:43.430> there<00:01:44.430> are<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.729> many<00:01:44.850> tools<00:01:45.149> you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the design there are so many tools you

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.170 
the design there are so many tools you
can<00:01:45.479> use<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.990> work<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.290> polymer<00:01:46.740> clay<00:01:46.770> so

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
can use to work with polymer clay so

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.700 
can use to work with polymer clay so
basically<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.689> matter<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.930> finding

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
basically it's just a matter of finding

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.639 
basically it's just a matter of finding
what<00:01:49.979> works<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.610> going<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.649> we
