00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.330
 people who are so educated but so 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.480
 educated in some situations can be 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.670
 even considered false how to deal with 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.320
 this kind of judgment 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.109
 the reporter in that voice began with the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.990
 psychologist lygia war education and 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.849
 respect are fundamental values now 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.460
 when they are accompanied by a dose 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.660
 of sympathy does not hurt anyone else 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.860
 Let's talk to the psychologist now. 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.920
 justice war 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.149
 good morning, lisa looks at the doubt that 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.730
 arrived by email 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.610
 call education for me something I care about 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.500
 too but some friends are being told 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.289
 that I look fake because it treats well the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.690
 people I do not like gets confused 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.910
 when they play it in the face can give 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.750
 any hint in the women's chart at 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.829
 backwards 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.879
 and there and this conflict when education 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.890
 respect to sympathy and become 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.660
 falsehood 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.060
 they become false when you do not 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.580
 likes a person but stays in the landu 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.189
 people praising her characteristics 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.710
 that you really do not have the money to 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.350
 the education she sent because why 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.820
 This is a sign of maturity that 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 we can deal with the differences 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.240
 we respect their differences and still 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.369
 to establish links with these 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.860
 people with time we are obliged 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.320
 to live together and that education is really 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.079
 boring but it's a person trying 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.850
 so the fact that you do not like a 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.790
 person does not mean that you have to 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.720
 be rude or crude or dour 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.630
 with her 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.310
 of course not and I think the bad 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.979
 education of the other may be inclusive of 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.810
 self-enhancement for ourselves because 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.509
 learn and give often with the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.710
 rudeness with people who invade 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.770
 our life is a process of 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.049
 self-awareness and self- awareness 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.869
 self-construction of you also know by 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.610
 limits and you even have to search 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.250
 understand why this person is 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.030
 can also be with those eyes on 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.979
 you 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.110
 Of course the question is hers but it 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.010
 as a self-reflection our 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.230
 viewer has reached this 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.810
 it is precisely in this conflict that 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.900
 for her it is not falsehood but the friends 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.370
 interpreted as falsehood and how to deal 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.099
 with this because not happening 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.590
 only educated the big question is why 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.840
 that her friends are uncomfortable with 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.459
 her attitude is that her friends do not 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.680
 are immature 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.349
 is that friends are friends as well 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.810
 because if this is your way of being yours 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.480
 friend see that this is your way of acting 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.120
 She also has to respect you then. 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.549
 we realize it is some two 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.540
 Important questions I always say 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:53.150
 so antipathy can be generated 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.430
 by two strands being a mirror 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.870
 what bothers you about the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.670
 another who is his own mayor 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.200
 It's also that it bothers you because you 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.109
 I also could not improve that 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.250
 So you talk too much, you too. 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.560
 talks a lot 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.930
 The ECC of annoyance can then be a 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.030
 mirroring for you to realize this is the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.700
 quality mirror that is what it is 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.200
 what the person has exactly in the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.060
 same proportion of its qualities 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.010
 also sometimes for example an environment 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.919
 and only when the team gives 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.180
 can be a factor of competitiveness 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:25.849
 so understand what might be 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.129
 causing this malaise among people 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.139
 now you realize that someone does not like 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.959
 of you that you have tried to captivate 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:35.389
 people that the person insists on being 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.160
 A little kind to you. 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.049
 she insists on making it clear that 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.720
 like you there do not force the bar 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.599
 because it really will generate more until 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.359
 conflict sometimes causes you to 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.980
 lose the respect of the group is in your 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.410
 it's playing well 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.609
 day to day with this training with 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.349
 your way of being that you finish 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.780
 captivating even sometimes admiration 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.970
 even the person really dislikes 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.669
 continuous car otherwise because 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.650
 has this issue of declared antipathy 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.180
 that we can back down but when the 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.970
 people realize that someone has been 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.579
 Aunt for us but still stays 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.979
 pleasing the issue of 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.620
 falsity as the person who realizes that 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:17.479
 is being treated with falsehood 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.699
 also have to behave in this case 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.560
 very important your question because 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.680
 I think it's one of the hardest things 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.430
 of dealing with a flatterer because the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.620
 flatterer is someone in the background 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.139
 He who is something of you uses only does not know 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.100
 yet what else it will roll you will 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:37.860
 for some reason then there the relationship she 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.110
 really is not a two-way relationship 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.509
 is an expectation relationship in some 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.009
 situation that sometimes I can even 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.320
 if you realize that the 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.389
 people do not like you so the best 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.680
 What do you have to do is keep 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:54.509
 discreet to be guarded to take care of the 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.639
 projects that you share with this 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.530
 person because you realize that the person 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.910
 does not like noise does not make the slightest 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.190
 right direction 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.270
 And now for us to close today 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.910
 people live in a world where people 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.520
 much authenticity still has 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.710
 space for education has yes 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.830
 authenticity that is not confused 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.660
 with rudeness because authenticity is 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.610
 you express your point of view that 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.430
 sometimes it may even be contrary to your 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.050
 friend to his co- worker but who 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.340
 it should be placed in a 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.889
 educated 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.630
 It's different from you being rude where 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.400
 You did not understand that there are 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.740
 people on this planet who thinks a lot 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.840
 different from you so do not confuse 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.970
 authenticity with an education there 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.440
 thing goes naturally worked it 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.750
 already thank you very much once again that 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.120
 Threw to Brazil and now the people 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.510
 back the information with the good day 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.510
 parana
