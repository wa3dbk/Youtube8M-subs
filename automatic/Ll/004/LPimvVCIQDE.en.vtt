let's<00:00:02.639> keep<00:00:03.230> multiplying<00:00:06.290> three<00:00:07.290> minus<00:00:07.649> I

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
let's keep multiplying three minus I

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.700 
let's keep multiplying three minus I
times<00:00:08.130> five<00:00:08.490> minus<00:00:08.760> four<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:12.080> what<00:00:13.080> am<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.410> going

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.019 
times five minus four I what am I going
to<00:00:13.860> do<00:00:13.980> here<00:00:15.770> let's<00:00:16.770> foil<00:00:17.369> you're<00:00:17.760> multiplying

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
to do here let's foil you're multiplying

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.670 
to do here let's foil you're multiplying
two<00:00:18.300> binomials<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.199> course<00:00:19.380> we're<00:00:19.590> going

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
two binomials so of course we're going

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.800 
two binomials so of course we're going
to<00:00:19.800> foil<00:00:20.039> laughs<00:00:20.880> foil<00:00:21.270> was<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.570> product

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
to foil laughs foil was the product

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.250 
to foil laughs foil was the product
during<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.050> first<00:00:22.230> terms<00:00:23.990> fifteen<00:00:24.990> how<00:00:25.140> about

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
during the first terms fifteen how about

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.179 
during the first terms fifteen how about
outside<00:00:27.410> minus<00:00:28.410> 12i<00:00:28.830> inside<00:00:30.500> minus<00:00:31.500> 5i<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
outside minus 12i inside minus 5i and

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.490 
outside minus 12i inside minus 5i and
the<00:00:32.250> product<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> last<00:00:32.850> term's<00:00:34.130> plus<00:00:35.239> 4i

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
the product of the last term's plus 4i

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.170 
the product of the last term's plus 4i
squared<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.920> where<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.340> saw<00:00:38.910> monsters

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
squared now this is where I saw monsters

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.160 
squared now this is where I saw monsters
having<00:00:39.750> trouble<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:41.120> times<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.480> will<00:00:42.840> give<00:00:43.050> you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
having trouble I times I will give you

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.060 
having trouble I times I will give you
the<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> squared<00:00:44.690> just<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.809> x<00:00:46.140> times<00:00:46.469> X<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.890> x

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the I squared just like x times X is x

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.700 
the I squared just like x times X is x
squared<00:00:47.719> then<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.110> combine<00:00:49.289> like

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
squared then you have to combine like

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.380 
squared then you have to combine like
terms<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.520> happens<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.090> guy<00:00:51.270> right

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
terms but what happens to this guy right

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.040 
terms but what happens to this guy right
here<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> squared<00:00:53.629> it<00:00:54.629> becomes<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
here with the I squared it becomes a

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.959 
here with the I squared it becomes a
negative<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.820> convert<00:00:56.820> things

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
negative for convert things

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.090 
negative for convert things
appropriately<00:00:57.469> combine<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.680> terms<00:00:58.710> and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
appropriately combine like terms and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.210 
appropriately combine like terms and
what<00:00:59.190> do<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.340> have

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.300 

11-17<00:01:06.220> i<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:12.040> that<00:01:12.220> good

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
11-17 i is that good

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.499 
11-17 i is that good
all<00:01:15.310> right<00:01:15.460> now<00:01:15.850> when<00:01:16.000> you<00:01:16.090> take<00:01:16.240> a<00:01:16.299> little

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
all right now when you take a little

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.109 
all right now when you take a little
pause<00:01:16.780> in<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.229> action<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:18.610> remind<00:01:18.940> you<00:01:19.090> of

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
pause in the action to remind you of

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:27.330 
pause in the action to remind you of
this

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.060 

just<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.430> remind<00:01:28.729> you<00:01:28.939> guys<00:01:28.969> of<00:01:29.329> this<00:01:30.070> these

just to remind you guys of this these

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:40.060 
just to remind you guys of this these
guys<00:01:31.460> are<00:01:35.289> complex<00:01:36.399> conjugates<00:01:38.770> now<00:01:39.770> what<00:01:39.979> we

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
guys are complex conjugates now what we

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.850 
guys are complex conjugates now what we
talked<00:01:40.310> about<00:01:40.450> yesterday<00:01:41.450> was<00:01:42.350> regular

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
talked about yesterday was regular

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.080 
talked about yesterday was regular
conjugates<00:01:43.340> will<00:01:43.490> give<00:01:43.610> you<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.820> difference

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
conjugates will give you the difference

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.419 
conjugates will give you the difference
of<00:01:44.210> squares<00:01:44.590> complex<00:01:45.590> conjugates<00:01:46.130> however

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
of squares complex conjugates however

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.460 
of squares complex conjugates however
give<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.759> this<00:01:49.539> they<00:01:50.539> give<00:01:50.689> you<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:51.049> squared

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
give you this they give you a squared

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.510 
give you this they give you a squared
plus<00:01:51.740> B<00:01:52.039> squared<00:01:53.110> okay<00:01:54.110> if<00:01:54.409> you<00:01:54.860> had<00:01:55.159> done<00:01:55.340> the

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
plus B squared okay if you had done the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.550 
plus B squared okay if you had done the
difference<00:01:55.789> of<00:01:55.909> squares<00:01:56.210> here<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:57.439> would

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
difference of squares here you would

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.630 
difference of squares here you would
have<00:01:57.649> had<00:01:57.860> a<00:01:58.990> squared<00:01:59.990> minus<00:02:00.500> B<00:02:00.890> squared<00:02:00.920> I

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
have had a squared minus B squared I

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.020 
have had a squared minus B squared I
squared<00:02:02.799> but<00:02:03.799> what<00:02:03.920> happens<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.459> minus<00:02:04.880> B

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
squared but what happens to minus B

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.930 
squared but what happens to minus B
squared<00:02:05.330> I<00:02:05.450> squared<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:10.009> becomes<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.399> positive

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
squared I squared it becomes a positive

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.850 
squared I squared it becomes a positive
B<00:02:11.120> squared<00:02:11.480> so<00:02:11.599> what<00:02:11.750> happens<00:02:12.110> here<00:02:12.170> is<00:02:12.560> that

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
B squared so what happens here is that

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.670 
B squared so what happens here is that
when<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.340> multiply<00:02:13.610> complex<00:02:14.480> conjugates<00:02:15.110> you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
when you multiply complex conjugates you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.940 
when you multiply complex conjugates you
don't<00:02:15.860> get<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.069> complex<00:02:16.580> number<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.950> get

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
don't get a complex number you get

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.220 
don't get a complex number you get
something<00:02:19.579> that's<00:02:19.730> real<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.299> guess<00:02:21.110> I

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
something that's real I guess I

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.650 
something that's real I guess I
shouldn't<00:02:21.410> say<00:02:21.530> it's<00:02:21.650> not<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:21.769> complex<00:02:22.220> number

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
shouldn't say it's not a complex number

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.850 
shouldn't say it's not a complex number
but<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.750> get<00:02:23.870> something<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.170> doesn't<00:02:24.410> have

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
but you get something that doesn't have

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.650 
but you get something that doesn't have
an<00:02:25.010> imaginary<00:02:25.370> part<00:02:25.640> all<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.450> numbers

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
an imaginary part all of the numbers

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.940 
an imaginary part all of the numbers
that<00:02:26.690> we<00:02:26.810> talked<00:02:27.049> about<00:02:27.230> all<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.680> real

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
that we talked about all the real

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.699 
that we talked about all the real
numbers<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.209> subset<00:02:30.079> of<00:02:30.110> complex

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
numbers that is a subset of complex

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.140 
numbers that is a subset of complex
numbers<00:02:32.890> like<00:02:33.890> if<00:02:34.069> I<00:02:34.220> were<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.430> say<00:02:34.640> there<00:02:34.940> are

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
numbers like if I were to say there are

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.979 
numbers like if I were to say there are

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
how many imaginary zero imaginary so we

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.440 
how many imaginary zero imaginary so we
don't<00:02:46.010> write<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.340> zero<00:02:46.609> on<00:02:46.880> these<00:02:47.180> things

what<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.150> B<00:03:30.240> are<00:03:30.450> that's<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.380> real<00:03:31.650> part

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
what a and B are that's the real part

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
the I know so that means what I'd work

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.170 
the I know so that means what I'd work
this<00:03:40.020> it<00:03:40.200> should<00:03:40.380> be<00:03:40.500> seven<00:03:41.250> squared<00:03:41.630> plus

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
this it should be seven squared plus

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.890 
this it should be seven squared plus
five<00:03:45.180> squared

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
five squared

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.720

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
what started out as a difference of

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.510 
what started out as a difference of
squares<00:03:48.140> becomes<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.410> sum<00:03:49.740> because<00:03:50.070> in<00:03:50.280> that

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
squares becomes the sum because in that

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.880 
squares becomes the sum because in that
original<00:03:50.910> difference<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.570> squares<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.710> would

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
original difference of squares you would

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.950 
original difference of squares you would
have<00:03:53.010> had<00:03:53.220> an<00:03:53.550> I<00:03:54.150> squared<00:03:54.210> if<00:03:54.810> you're

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
have had an I squared if you're

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.870 
have had an I squared if you're
subtracting<00:03:55.530> with<00:03:55.650> an<00:03:55.770> I<00:03:55.890> squared<00:03:55.950> what<00:03:56.760> would

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
subtracting with an I squared what would

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.280 
subtracting with an I squared what would
that<00:03:56.910> become<00:03:59.570> they're<00:04:00.570> subtracted<00:04:01.140> with<00:04:01.230> the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
that become they're subtracted with the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.470 
that become they're subtracted with the
I<00:04:01.320> squared<00:04:01.830> negative<00:04:02.790> negative<00:04:03.000> will<00:04:03.300> turn

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
I squared negative negative will turn

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.970 
I squared negative negative will turn
that<00:04:03.570> into<00:04:03.750> positive<00:04:04.320> that's<00:04:04.500> why<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:04.710> get<00:04:04.890> to

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
that into positive that's why I get to

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.790 
that into positive that's why I get to
the<00:04:05.100> shortcut<00:04:05.550> here<00:04:05.820> so<00:04:06.600> this<00:04:06.810> is<00:04:06.990> 49<00:04:07.650> plus<00:04:09.800> 25

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
the shortcut here so this is 49 plus 25

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.740 
the shortcut here so this is 49 plus 25
and<00:04:11.100> all<00:04:11.160> of<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.370> is<00:04:11.670> equal<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:14.180> 74<00:04:15.180> yell

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750
