these<00:00:55.079> problems<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.949> picked<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> best

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
these problems we picked out the best

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.119 
these problems we picked out the best
one<00:00:56.940> by<00:00:57.390> design<00:00:57.750> either<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.559> paper<00:00:58.770> or

one by design either on paper or
inventor<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.820> then<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.090> made<00:01:00.270> prototypes<00:01:00.510> to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
inventor and then we made prototypes to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.290 
inventor and then we made prototypes to
test<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.800> finally<00:01:02.219> discussed<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> prototypes

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

as<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> team<00:01:03.840> then<00:01:04.350> chose<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.650> best<00:01:04.949> mechanisms

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
as a team then chose the best mechanisms

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.670 
as a team then chose the best mechanisms
that<00:01:05.760> performed<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.420> figured<00:01:07.080> out<00:01:07.200> how<00:01:07.439> they

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that performed and figured out how they

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.679 
that performed and figured out how they
would<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.920> implemented<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.549> robot<00:01:08.909> our

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
would be implemented on the robot our

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.600 
would be implemented on the robot our
design<00:01:10.170> was<00:01:10.470> made<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.130> would<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.430> easy

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
design was made so that it would be easy

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.399

for<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.060> drivers<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.450> score<00:01:12.840> flawlessly

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
for the drivers to score flawlessly

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.420

one<00:01:15.060> thing<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.540> added<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.259> that

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
one thing that we added this here that

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.440 
one thing that we added this here that
helps<00:01:16.740> control<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> robot<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.700> reactive<00:01:18.330> and

to<00:01:21.090> score<00:01:21.360> flawlessly<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.320> knew<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.710> we

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
to score flawlessly we knew that we

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.530 
to score flawlessly we knew that we
needed<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.280> gold<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.970> same<00:01:24.180> spot

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
needed the gold to be in the same spot

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.140 
needed the gold to be in the same spot
every<00:01:24.990> time<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.400> would<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.700> easier<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
every time so that it would be easier to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.600 
every time so that it would be easier to
score<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:28.200> led<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.680> idea<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.070> dragging

score this led to the idea of dragging

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.940 
score this led to the idea of dragging
