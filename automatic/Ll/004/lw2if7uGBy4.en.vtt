thought for this week I would put
together<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.220> tutorial<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.940> how<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.150> make<00:00:18.270> your

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
together a tutorial on how to make your

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.269 
together a tutorial on how to make your
own<00:00:18.539> from<00:00:18.869> scratch<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.740> took<00:00:19.890> me<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> while<00:00:20.160> to

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
own from scratch it took me a while to

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.620 
own from scratch it took me a while to
figure<00:00:20.369> out<00:00:20.580> how<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.730> wanted<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.150> tackle<00:00:21.330> this

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
figure out how I wanted to tackle this

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.420 
figure out how I wanted to tackle this
but<00:00:22.050> eventually<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.470> decided<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.130> would<00:00:23.340> do

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
but eventually I decided that I would do

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.519 
but eventually I decided that I would do
it<00:00:23.519> similar<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.420> tricky<00:00:24.869> candles<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.439> I

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
it similar to the tricky candles that I

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.589 
it similar to the tricky candles that I
made<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.279> rendered<00:00:26.580> up<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.789> deer<00:00:26.970> head<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.359> a

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
made and I rendered up a deer head in a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.630 
made and I rendered up a deer head in a
3d<00:00:27.900> program<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.560> throw<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.039> into<00:00:29.160> another

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
3d program and throw it into another

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.310 
3d program and throw it into another
program<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.060> would<00:00:30.330> flatten<00:00:30.750> out<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> image

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
program that would flatten out the image

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.380 
program that would flatten out the image
so<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.650> print<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.040> out<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.430> then<00:00:33.030> cut<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
so you can print it out and then cut the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.750 
so you can print it out and then cut the
pieces<00:00:33.600> out<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.870> reassemble<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.520> then<00:00:35.670> you

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
pieces out and reassemble it so then you

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.790 
pieces out and reassemble it so then you
have<00:00:35.910> your<00:00:36.030> own<00:00:36.149> 3d<00:00:36.630> object<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.500> using

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
have your own 3d object and then using

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.260 
have your own 3d object and then using
that<00:00:37.829> as<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.040> base<00:00:38.309> if<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.670> want<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.000> put<00:00:39.120> more

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
that as a base if you want to put more

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.910 
that as a base if you want to put more
detail<00:00:39.600> into<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.440> use<00:00:40.559> some<00:00:40.770> air

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920

head<00:01:14.729> thing<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.360> did<00:01:15.570> before<00:01:15.720> that's<00:01:16.710> why<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
head thing I did before that's why I

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.520 
head thing I did before that's why I
threw<00:01:17.460> those<00:01:17.729> last<00:01:18.000> two<00:01:18.270> into<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> optional

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
threw those last two into the optional

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.240 
threw those last two into the optional
list<00:01:19.740> first<00:01:20.430> cut<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> pattern<00:01:21.689> out<00:01:21.810> and

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
list first cut the pattern out and

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.440 
list first cut the pattern out and
following<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> directions<00:01:23.700> piece<00:01:24.299> it

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
following the directions piece it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.480 
following the directions piece it
together<00:01:24.570> after<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.500> film<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.100> ended<00:01:26.400> up

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
together after I film this I ended up

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.219 
together after I film this I ended up
going<00:01:26.670> back<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.180> numbered<00:01:27.600> all<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.020> pieces

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
going back and numbered all the pieces

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.560 
going back and numbered all the pieces
so<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.130> should<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:29.460> easier<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.060> keep<00:01:30.180> track<00:01:30.420> of

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
so it should be easier to keep track of

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.420 
so it should be easier to keep track of
everything<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.350> took<00:01:31.530> me<00:01:31.680> forever<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.220> put

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
everything it took me forever to put

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.340 
everything it took me forever to put
this<00:01:32.549> thing<00:01:32.729> together<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.689> after<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.079> cut

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
this thing together because after I cut

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.200 
this thing together because after I cut
everything<00:01:34.590> out<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.520> put<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.820> into<00:01:36.030> one

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
everything out I just put it into one

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.760 
everything out I just put it into one
big<00:01:36.240> pile<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.110> had<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.259> go<00:01:37.350> searching<00:01:37.619> for

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
big pile so I had to go searching for

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.289 
big pile so I had to go searching for
all<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> pieces<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.520> needed<00:01:38.850> when<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> needed

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
all the pieces I needed when I needed

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.660 
all the pieces I needed when I needed
them<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.990> would<00:01:40.140> probably<00:01:40.380> be<00:01:40.860> easier<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:41.490> you

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
them it would probably be easier if you

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.940 
them it would probably be easier if you
did<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:42.090> sheet<00:01:42.450> at<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> time<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.259> recommend<00:01:43.860> just

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
did one sheet at a time I recommend just

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.609 
did one sheet at a time I recommend just
taping<00:01:44.579> all<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> pieces<00:01:45.090> together<00:01:45.420> since<00:01:46.290> it

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
taping all the pieces together since it

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.590 
taping all the pieces together since it
will<00:01:46.829> get<00:01:47.009> covered<00:01:47.189> up<00:01:47.430> by<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.759> paper<00:01:48.240> mache

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
will get covered up by the paper mache

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.389 
will get covered up by the paper mache
later<00:01:48.869> there's<00:01:49.350> not<00:01:49.560> really<00:01:49.680> any<00:01:49.920> need<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
later there's not really any need to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:02:09.009 
later there's not really any need to
glue<00:01:50.610> it

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.540 

this<00:02:10.019> head<00:02:10.289> ends<00:02:10.619> up<00:02:10.709> being<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.160> little<00:02:11.310> bit

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
this head ends up being a little bit

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.820 
this head ends up being a little bit
smaller<00:02:11.849> than<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.660> paper<00:02:12.810> mache<00:02:13.260> do<00:02:13.709> your

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
smaller than the paper mache do your

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.680 
smaller than the paper mache do your
head<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.280> had<00:02:14.610> bought<00:02:14.879> from<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.420> store

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
head that I had bought from the store

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.780 
head that I had bought from the store
but<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.379> you<00:02:16.680> want<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.099> be<00:02:17.190> bigger<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.670> can

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
but if you want it to be bigger you can

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.580 
but if you want it to be bigger you can
always<00:02:17.970> scale<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.510> up<00:02:18.629> a<00:02:18.750> little<00:02:18.870> bit<00:02:19.110> when<00:02:19.500> you

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
always scale it up a little bit when you

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:29.000 
always scale it up a little bit when you
print<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:19.860> out<00:02:27.230> now<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.500> have<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.830> deer

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
print it out now that you have the deer

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.680 
print it out now that you have the deer
head<00:02:29.160> put<00:02:29.400> together<00:02:29.519> if<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.239> like<00:02:30.420> this

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
head put together if you like this

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.289 
head put together if you like this
faceted<00:02:31.290> look<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:32.190> could<00:02:32.370> totally<00:02:32.849> just<00:02:32.879> skip

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
faceted look you could totally just skip

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.140 
faceted look you could totally just skip
to<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.510> paper<00:02:33.780> mache<00:02:34.170> steps<00:02:34.730> but<00:02:35.730> if<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:35.940> want

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
to the paper mache steps but if you want

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.550 
to the paper mache steps but if you want
to<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.480> can<00:02:36.629> start<00:02:36.840> putting<00:02:37.290> some<00:02:37.470> more

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
to you can start putting some more

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.289 
to you can start putting some more
detail<00:02:37.950> into<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.250> right<00:02:38.489> now<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.700> make<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.060> look

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
detail into it right now to make it look

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.580 
detail into it right now to make it look
a<00:02:39.420> little<00:02:39.569> bit<00:02:39.780> more<00:02:39.930> realistic

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
a little bit more realistic

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.300 
a little bit more realistic
I<00:02:40.620> used<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.370> mixture<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.819> aluminum<00:02:42.599> foil

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
I used a mixture of aluminum foil

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.789 
I used a mixture of aluminum foil
masking<00:02:44.310> tape<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.760> then<00:02:45.390> finishing<00:02:46.290> with<00:02:46.319> air

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
masking tape and then finishing with air

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.920 
masking tape and then finishing with air
drying<00:02:47.040> clay<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.819> put<00:02:48.000> more<00:02:48.180> detail<00:02:48.510> into<00:02:48.690> this

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
drying clay to put more detail into this

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.869 
drying clay to put more detail into this
I<00:02:49.140> went<00:02:49.620> online<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:49.950> found<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.459> good<00:02:50.579> picture

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
I went online and found a good picture

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.150 
I went online and found a good picture
of<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.540> anatomy<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.290> musculature<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:52.920> a

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
of the anatomy and musculature of a

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.339 
of the anatomy and musculature of a
deer's<00:02:53.370> head<00:02:53.579> and<00:02:54.049> using<00:02:55.049> that<00:02:55.140> as<00:02:55.319> a

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
deer's head and using that as a

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.110 
deer's head and using that as a
reference<00:02:55.829> I<00:02:56.040> started<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.610> rough<00:02:56.790> out<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
reference I started to rough out the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.479 
reference I started to rough out the
shape<00:02:57.329> of<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.660> head<00:02:57.840> by<00:02:58.500> taping<00:02:58.769> crumpled<00:02:59.370> up

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
shape of the head by taping crumpled up

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.860 
shape of the head by taping crumpled up
aluminum<00:03:00.030> foil<00:03:00.269> onto<00:03:00.599> it<00:03:01.019> like<00:03:01.319> so<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:02.870> just

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
aluminum foil onto it like so I just

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.300 
aluminum foil onto it like so I just
learned<00:03:04.049> about<00:03:04.319> this<00:03:04.500> technique<00:03:05.010> it's

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
learned about this technique it's

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.830 
learned about this technique it's
actually<00:03:05.670> pretty<00:03:05.879> nice<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.510> quick<00:03:06.690> way<00:03:06.810> to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
actually pretty nice it's a quick way to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.140 
actually pretty nice it's a quick way to
bulk<00:03:07.230> areas<00:03:07.620> out<00:03:07.860> when<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.400> need<00:03:08.549> to<00:03:08.579> but<00:03:09.060> you

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
bulk areas out when you need to but you

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.910 
bulk areas out when you need to but you
can<00:03:09.269> also<00:03:09.420> get<00:03:09.660> some<00:03:09.720> pretty<00:03:10.079> decent<00:03:10.380> detail

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
can also get some pretty decent detail

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:22.050 
can also get some pretty decent detail
with<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.310> aluminum<00:03:11.670> foil<00:03:11.880> as<00:03:12.060> well

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:42.330 

I<00:03:39.930> use<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.110> bone<00:03:41.290> folder<00:03:41.319> to<00:03:41.860> push<00:03:42.040> in<00:03:42.220> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
I use the bone folder to push in the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.430 
I use the bone folder to push in the
tape<00:03:42.580> into<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.060> areas<00:03:43.420> where<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:43.720> wanted<00:03:44.110> there

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
tape into the areas where I wanted there

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.699 
tape into the areas where I wanted there
to<00:03:44.470> be<00:03:44.650> more<00:03:44.770> detail<00:03:46.080> such<00:03:47.080> as<00:03:47.110> around<00:03:47.590> the

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
to be more detail such as around the

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.830 
to be more detail such as around the
eyes<00:03:47.890> and<00:03:47.920> in<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.580> nostrils<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.360> could<00:03:49.660> just

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
eyes and in the nostrils you could just

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.979 
eyes and in the nostrils you could just
use<00:03:50.050> a<00:03:50.350> pen<00:03:50.680> or<00:03:50.980> a<00:03:51.069> pencil<00:03:51.310> or<00:03:51.760> your<00:03:52.300> fingers<00:03:52.660> or

roughed<00:04:05.620> out<00:04:05.800> with<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.220> aluminum<00:04:06.670> and

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
roughed out with the aluminum and

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.600
