00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
 hi girls I hope you go 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.899
 well today I show you the 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.910
 makeup that I'm doing a little bit 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.170
 every day right now if I have 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.820
 the eye a little bit dirty I'm 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.349
 really sorry actually by automatism 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.790
 I put on my makeup and after a 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.259
 moment I was three-quarters and there 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.670
 I do but I wanted to show them 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.080
 so that's normal if there are 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.060
 little traces me I just 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.300
 cleanse for you show them it's 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.519
 I started to do the basics 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.600
 allow the concealer prolongs or 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.099
 air then I show you how I do 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.660
 to take very little because 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.400
 does the pump is not very I finally 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.140
 is not great if we could normally 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.190
 we have eight times too much so I'm doing 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.630
 very small blows here is after a 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.250
 moment he comes out a little bit even 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.829
 that's it you do what we do 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.059
 can in general I do the basics at 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.469
 moment to put world in pull so I 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.570
 tap my fingers like that to have no 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.950
 not everything I do downstairs and what's left 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.230
 I put it in water so there I put them 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.530
 a lot less than that just a point or 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.620
 two and after I'm going to roll out and I have 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.350
 tried that it's an american buzz eu 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.410
 kathleen lights who always use 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.550
 this this anti-dark circles as a base and and 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.840
 as I bought it a long time ago I 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.100
 fought and that's it too and 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.159
 actually it does not work well 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.990
 but then I took over the lighthouse all 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.150
 that glitters who is here from mac 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.010
 who gives that on the finger and that I 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.290
 rediscover and I re m 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.000
 who really is I wear it barking me 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.570
 he is very discreet on a daily basis he is 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.689
 really top 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.040
 and he is really good to me too 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.650
 as I wear glasses and that the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.720
 mines can make a little shadow on 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.579
 ben afar eyes a little clearer but 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.520
 I do not want white either it's not bad 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.159
 in fact I believe but simple yes is it 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.829
 that I do not see there I put it on any 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.630
 the eyelid and I like it too are 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.850
 so it's not really due to fangs 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.610
 but in fact by applying it alone 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.070
 you see in the hollow it looks like when 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.119
 same as there is a lighthouse a little darker 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.590
 in shades of coral a little or salmon 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.420
 and on the eyelid it is a little 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.560
 brighter and that I think it's cool 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.600
 because in a single gesture 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.460
 well we both have the trick a bit 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.140
 darker in the hollow and the stuff a 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.880
 a little lighter on the eyelid very well 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.259
 perfect time saving for women 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.830
 hurry that we are I put a 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.500
 a little bit under the eye but 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.960
 we do not really have it then I have 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.850
 took a black eye liner this is the lobby 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.770
 neiter eyeliner from urban decay 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.810
 so I love them because he is 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.310
 really very black and they mark very 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.130
 well but I do not find they hold 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.050
 really all day so small 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.100
 but I wanted to change a 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.930
 little black lacquer 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:34.360
 I will lead mucous membranes down and up 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.850
 bazire do not cry then I take 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.170
 black blush corrupt descheemaeker geek 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.240
 but you obviously take the black that 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:46.540
 you have I will go back to the 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:48.310
 mucous membranes over over the liner though 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.420
 you have sensitive eyes that you 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.820
 do not call what's going maybe you 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.020
 hurt me as I told myself 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.690
 makeup starts to see the back a 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.330
 little red by the way and this lighthouse all 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.880
 only I'm going to put on lash too 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.590
 higher but really barely it's 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.100
 just to reinforce the line a little 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.630
 cartoon 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.740
 it feels like it's small in 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.400
 just putting powder it's not 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.780
 very opaque 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.150
 you can put a little alzheimer 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.080
 fat from underneath and put the powder 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.480
 after that you're sure it's 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.830
 well black from black 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.350
 then I take a bit of biten from 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.630
 at mechanical always and on a small 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.030
 brush screaming like that I'll do in 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.400
 do I come it's like if management 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.950
 pay the black in plum for the elite 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.450
 bottom eyelashes I would not have 8 tons 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.580
 but I want it to be in front of a small 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.140
 little that you do not have it right there 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.260
 do not see a lot either you 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.880
 will understand why I will lose it 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.860
 then I take the farouk is the lighthouse 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.090
 the rocade volume mascara from gemey 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.090
 maybelline for upper lashes 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.079
 and this is where you will understand 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.250
 why I loved the close attention 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.280
 alongside elected officials I put mascara 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.340
 Plum is called mega plum home 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.790
 to be it's the guys the different is 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.109
 the collection of colorful mascara which I 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.409
 will talk to you in my Friday video 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:08.359
 and suddenly I just put on the sites 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.639
 at all so I know it's not 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.109
 very obvious that it's plum and that 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.150
 there is no doubt that he will see me 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.920
 but in the sun already it shows a little 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.539
 little and besides putting the 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.940
 plum it brings out the green eyes 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.199
 so I say to myself in fact optical of 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.490
 far even though it is not clear that 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.400
 it's noise maybe it's a 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.020
 little out the mayor of meyzieu 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.539
 then as always good but grenade 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:35.180
 2 at sigma cup with aurelie brush 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:36.949
 technics and finally it's my stroke of 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.500
 heart of the moment it's the lipstick 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.419
 dark so I alternate either I take the 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.849
 meaning is to rim she who at this 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.430
 head there either I take diva of chamakh 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.849
 who has this head there hop I wanted to be 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.860
 in both is not the 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.729
 perfect but then really if you 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.110
 do not have india did not need 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:58.039
 to buy each other they are still 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.289
 very very very very very close then 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.849
 good I had posted on instagram this 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.470
 resemblance and some of you 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.449
 said that theirs were similar 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.030
 not that much so maybe only me 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.979
 I have a meaning is a little darker than 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.090
 the others I do not know but if you 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.360
 go the problem says moinerie 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.330
 comments in any case 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.860
 diva and a darker hair more more 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.539
 burgundy let's say the other is a hair 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.159
 red hair but it's really for 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.129
 to say that today I want to 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:26.500
 go ahead so I'm going to put diva game but 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:35.439
 nothing below I can but I have 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:37.120
 want to spare me a key step mad and 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:38.469
 bank facilitate the outline see I the 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.699
 put in tapping in fact I'm not doing a 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:41.979
 big line because every time I 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:49.930
 I plant so it's easier for 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:51.550
 me to do everything duke and we do not forget 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:56.439
 the last most important step 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:58.529
 bite in a clean is to avoid 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:01.000
 that all that does not put on your teeth 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:02.529
 and balou for this little bit that all 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.509
 seasons all occasions I like 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.409
 many wear it when the weather is nice 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.270
 you admit that I can not always there 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:10.449
 dark lips but this eye makeup 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.849
 I find it great it's pretty fast 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.800
 there are not a thousand products and I 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.659
 find effective what for once this 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.250
 go to all colors god I hope 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.060
 that you like it take good care of 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.060
 you and I make you big kisses
