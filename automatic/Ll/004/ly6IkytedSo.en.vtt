 but subjects live 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:24.029
 unfortunately this is it 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:26.279
 and what you want and why it wasn't 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:30.860

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:30.860
 gesture or train 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.349
 It was hard but I have it but because I was born 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:41.610

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:44.340
