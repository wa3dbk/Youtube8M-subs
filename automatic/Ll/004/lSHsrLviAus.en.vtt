00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
for jumpers as being the defender to not

for jumpers as being the defender to not
walk<00:01:00.600> directly<00:01:00.929> under<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.839> think<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
walk directly under and and I think that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.610 
walk directly under and and I think that
that's<00:01:04.440> the<00:01:04.620> reason<00:01:04.920> why<00:01:04.949> they<00:01:05.870> they<00:01:06.870> took<00:01:07.380> the
