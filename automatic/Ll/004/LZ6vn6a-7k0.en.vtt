your ability to move within a certain

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.830 
your ability to move within a certain
area<00:01:15.520> obviously<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.610> cops<00:01:16.850> think<00:01:17.120> all<00:01:17.360> gang

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
area obviously the cops think all gang

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.500 
area obviously the cops think all gang
members<00:01:18.260> just<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:18.979> certain<00:01:19.310> way<00:01:19.490> look<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.360> have

a<00:01:20.540> certain<00:01:20.930> color<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:21.710> it's

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
a certain color and so it's

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.250 
a certain color and so it's
criminalizing<00:01:22.610> young<00:01:23.270> people<00:01:23.720> of<00:01:23.840> color<00:01:24.050> in
