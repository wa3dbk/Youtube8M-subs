Vista when I installed parallels I put
Windows<00:04:38.069> Vista<00:04:38.250> in<00:04:38.669> and<00:04:39.449> immediately<00:04:40.199> after<00:04:40.560> I

uploaded Windows Vista and installed it

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.689

between a Windows or a Mac and that's

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.200 
between a Windows or a Mac and that's
really<00:06:17.190> good<00:06:17.759> it's<00:06:18.029> really<00:06:18.330> handy<00:06:18.810> and<00:06:19.069> I

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
be it's really a lot better than booting

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.410 
be it's really a lot better than booting
your<00:06:28.350> computer<00:06:28.890> into<00:06:29.130> boot<00:06:29.340> camp<00:06:29.420> because

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.420 
your computer into boot camp because

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.750 
your computer into boot camp because
it's<00:06:30.900> just<00:06:31.110> so<00:06:31.320> much<00:06:31.530> easier<00:06:31.860> because<00:06:32.550> I<00:06:32.700> never

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
it's just so much easier because I never

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.380 
it's just so much easier because I never
have<00:06:33.210> to<00:06:33.360> leave<00:06:33.570> my<00:06:33.900> Mac<00:06:34.460> desktop<00:06:35.460> to<00:06:35.910> be<00:06:36.060> able

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
the fact to that while I'm running this

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.780 
the fact to that while I'm running this
Windows<00:06:45.890> environment<00:06:46.890> here<00:06:47.100> with<00:06:47.280> parallels

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 
Windows environment here with parallels

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.410 
Windows environment here with parallels
I<00:06:48.590> can<00:06:49.590> have<00:06:49.800> a<00:06:49.830> Windows<00:06:50.310> based<00:06:50.520> program<00:06:51.000> going

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.420 
I can have a Windows based program going

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.680 
I can have a Windows based program going
at<00:06:51.630> the<00:06:52.110> same<00:06:52.350> time<00:06:52.710> that<00:06:53.100> I'm<00:06:53.340> working<00:06:53.820> on<00:06:54.120> my

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
at the same time that I'm working on my

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.040 
at the same time that I'm working on my
Mac<00:06:55.230> environment<00:06:55.500> as<00:06:56.040> well<00:06:56.250> so<00:06:57.180> I<00:06:57.570> highly

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
Mac environment as well so I highly

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.170 
Mac environment as well so I highly
recommend<00:06:58.110> it<00:06:58.770> it's<00:06:59.010> not<00:06:59.250> that<00:06:59.310> expensive

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
recommend it it's not that expensive

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.720 
recommend it it's not that expensive
it's<00:07:00.750> very<00:07:01.110> cheap<00:07:01.470> now<00:07:01.500> and<00:07:02.570> even<00:07:03.570> the

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:04.730 
it's very cheap now and even the

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.080 
it's very cheap now and even the
parallels<00:07:05.730> nine<00:07:06.720> version<00:07:07.440> of<00:07:08.040> it<00:07:08.340> for<00:07:08.370> Mac<00:07:08.760> is

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
parallels nine version of it for Mac is

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.940 
parallels nine version of it for Mac is
only<00:07:09.300> about<00:07:09.600> sixty<00:07:10.050> eight<00:07:10.200> dollars<00:07:10.440> and

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:10.950 
only about sixty eight dollars and

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.340 
only about sixty eight dollars and
that's<00:07:11.580> really<00:07:12.030> not<00:07:12.210> a<00:07:12.450> whole<00:07:12.750> lot<00:07:13.080> it's<00:07:13.290> not

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.350 
that's really not a whole lot it's not

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.460 
that's really not a whole lot it's not
that<00:07:13.650> expensive<00:07:13.890> so<00:07:14.690> that's<00:07:15.690> my<00:07:15.900> take<00:07:16.170> on<00:07:16.410> it

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:16.470 
that expensive so that's my take on it

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.440 
that expensive so that's my take on it
you<00:07:16.860> know<00:07:17.090> definitely<00:07:18.110> parallels<00:07:19.110> over<00:07:19.830> the

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:20.450 
you know definitely parallels over the

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.370 
you know definitely parallels over the
bootcamp<00:07:21.450> you<00:07:22.050> know<00:07:22.200> any<00:07:22.470> day<00:07:22.740> and<00:07:23.150> I<00:07:24.380> highly

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380 
bootcamp you know any day and I highly

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.860 
bootcamp you know any day and I highly
recommend<00:07:25.500> that<00:07:26.100> you<00:07:26.790> try<00:07:27.000> parallels<00:07:27.690> if

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 
recommend that you try parallels if

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.600 
recommend that you try parallels if
you've<00:07:28.020> never<00:07:28.200> tried<00:07:28.500> it<00:07:28.620> it's<00:07:29.010> really<00:07:29.310> easy

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
you've never tried it it's really easy

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.710 
you've never tried it it's really easy
to<00:07:29.790> install<00:07:30.120> and<00:07:31.010> you<00:07:32.010> can<00:07:32.790> work<00:07:33.060> better<00:07:33.420> in

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 
to install and you can work better in

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.350 
to install and you can work better in
both<00:07:33.990> environments<00:07:34.260> you<00:07:34.920> can<00:07:34.950> multitask<00:07:35.760> in

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 
both environments you can multitask in

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.950 
both environments you can multitask in
both<00:07:36.630> environments<00:07:36.840> and<00:07:37.610> I<00:07:38.610> highly<00:07:39.270> recommend

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 
both environments and I highly recommend

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.110 
both environments and I highly recommend
it
