00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:10.290
 so now again a question from me so 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.790
 woman the positive sides of the port 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.089
 we have already on countries man 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.390
 the world de shown and a video 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.070
 but I think there will be some 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.100
 I warn you about risks now 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.380
 again like to know something so that's it 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.080
 is right so basically it is of it 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.240
 ok and also has advantages for example 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.460
 when allergic because I specifically targeted 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.980
 just all protein and 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.140
 carbohydrate sources can feed the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.510
 are negative sides and that must 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.399
 You always think about it when I have it 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.930
 I do not do it right when I'm somewhere 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.940
 I have a mishap because I too 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.309
 much of the good of my sea algae 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.489
 Put in powder and add so much iodine 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.910
 for example, that's a problem 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.610
 see the second problem can be that 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.699
 I already get excited 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.519
 the toxoplasmosis is the neo- trace 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:07.320
 a few others say boom 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.920
 precursors if I just an internal 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.119
 Feeds are to say when the goods 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.610
 not well chilled or somehow 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.350
 bacteria could become more thawed 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.150
 form 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.490
 Salmonella are in large quantities too 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.900
 not cheap for the dog so that may 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.229
 One should not forget that could last 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.560
 be a separator and then one 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.390
 difficult salmonella source also for 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.299
 but represent the people are 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.409
 exceptions yes and so on are some 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.210
 to call things 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.890
 these are the negative sides of the harbor 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.259
 and therefore you have to be there already 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.810
 know very well and have to be well 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.180
 the meat and the goods that you feed 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.040
 very good and if necessary 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.170
 see a veterinarian 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.399
 After half a year, it does 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.780
 meaning a blood test regarding the 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.570
 to provide the dog with the care 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.630
 The profile is called the offer 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.489
 Most laboratories and you can also 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.590
 ration calculation if 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.920
 Something has gone awry there 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.270
 everything professional 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.450
 be countered that a profi 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.670
 please tell them something more or less 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.670
 and then that can happen too 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.620
 Great success threw it on everyone 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.900
 case anything just like that a bush 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.190
 open up and somehow what that 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.510
 Feeding house the sun 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.760
 that's a little science 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.400
 whoever has this time for him and that 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.800
 I 'm sure that can be there 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.420
 continue to operate otherwise you should 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.700
 but maybe a little more careful 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.250
 I suppose you have them too 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.480
 a few cases in their practice what 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.950
 I mean when I want to draw time 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.770
 no names know but number so 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.510
 there is about the name 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.650
 Difficulties are quite dogs 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.840
 wonderful but have been made 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.550
 But stomach problems always persist 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.200
 again have what a diarrhea 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.570
 view people as normal 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.230
 and here it was just too much protein 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.370
 what was fed too much yes much 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.080
 fermentation displacement of bacterial flora 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.840
 after switching to a commercial one 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.829
 feed on a good dry food 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.690
 insofar as I'm just there on the 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.820
 additives look at the 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.280
 vitamin care was at the show 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.230
 Patients then a great success there 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.269
 also had to take medication 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.220
 always had to be resorbed normally 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.040
 Suddenly the disease in the 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:36.500
 So that can sometimes be good 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.180
 meant harp come out as I said 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.799
 otherwise blood tests would have the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.299
 him after half a year 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:47.660
 weapons make more sense 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.660
 crosswise
