Springs<00:02:39.050> there's<00:02:40.050> one<00:02:40.260> spring<00:02:40.560> over<00:02:40.770> here<00:02:43.700> so

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
Springs there's one spring over here so

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.960 
Springs there's one spring over here so
a<00:02:44.730> spring<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.690> basically<00:02:46.260> one<00:02:46.860> block<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.580> water

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
a spring is basically one block of water

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.900 
a spring is basically one block of water
or<00:02:48.300> lava<00:02:48.600> anywhere<00:02:49.290> on<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.620> map<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.820> can

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
or lava anywhere on the map and it can

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.520 
or lava anywhere on the map and it can
spill<00:02:51.150> out<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.480> make<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.600> giant<00:02:51.930> water<00:02:52.230> bug<00:02:52.410> at

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
spill out and make a giant water bug at

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.320 
spill out and make a giant water bug at
this<00:02:52.650> one<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:53.430> see<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.640> source<00:02:53.880> block<00:02:54.150> is

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
this one you see the source block is

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.210 
this one you see the source block is
here<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.780> all<00:02:54.930> spills<00:02:55.230> down<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:55.770> giant

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
here and I all spills down to this giant

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.790 
here and I all spills down to this giant
River<00:02:56.610> here<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.930> river<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.410> next<00:02:58.650> thing

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
River here this river is the next thing

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.040 
River here this river is the next thing
I<00:02:58.830> want<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.040> talk<00:02:59.220> about<00:02:59.570> which<00:03:00.570> is<00:03:00.600> basically

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
I want to talk about which is basically

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.830 
I want to talk about which is basically
does<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:01.560> giant<00:03:02.280> pathway<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:02.910> water<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.690> the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
does this giant pathway of water in the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.080 
does this giant pathway of water in the
ground<00:03:03.960> and<00:03:04.890> they<00:03:05.160> can<00:03:05.310> go<00:03:05.430> on<00:03:05.550> for<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.790> long

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
ground and they can go on for a long

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.110 
ground and they can go on for a long
long<00:03:06.870> distance<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.530> squids<00:03:08.520> can<00:03:08.700> also<00:03:08.790> spawn

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
long distance and squids can also spawn

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.830 
long distance and squids can also spawn
them<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:11.250> let's<00:03:11.790> go<00:03:11.970> back<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.330> this<00:03:12.480> point

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
them so let's go back to this point

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.750 
them so let's go back to this point
because<00:03:13.350> there<00:03:13.770> are<00:03:13.890> some<00:03:14.100> other<00:03:14.220> things<00:03:14.310> need

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
because there are some other things need

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:23.850 
because there are some other things need
to<00:03:14.850> show<00:03:15.000> you

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.330 

the<00:03:24.400> next<00:03:24.700> thing<00:03:24.850> here<00:03:25.360> is<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.900> lake<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:27.100> a

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
the next thing here is a lake this is a

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.270 
the next thing here is a lake this is a
lake<00:03:27.640> it's<00:03:27.880> basically<00:03:28.210> the<00:03:28.740> smaller<00:03:29.740> body<00:03:30.070> of

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
lake it's basically the smaller body of

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.220 
lake it's basically the smaller body of
water<00:03:30.520> and<00:03:30.880> also<00:03:31.120> squids<00:03:31.420> can<00:03:31.630> spawn<00:03:31.870> here

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
water and also squids can spawn here

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.590 
water and also squids can spawn here
like<00:03:32.470> this<00:03:32.830> one<00:03:33.070> here<00:03:33.460> and<00:03:33.670> there<00:03:34.420> usually

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
like this one here and there usually

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.580 
like this one here and there usually
about<00:03:35.070> two<00:03:36.070> to<00:03:36.400> four<00:03:36.640> blocks<00:03:37.030> deep<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:38.350> this

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
about two to four blocks deep so this

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.350 
about two to four blocks deep so this
here's<00:03:38.800> a<00:03:38.860> lake<00:03:39.010> they<00:03:39.760> sometimes<00:03:40.000> can<00:03:40.240> have

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
here's a lake they sometimes can have

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.030 
here's a lake they sometimes can have
these<00:03:40.450> little<00:03:40.570> land<00:03:40.930> bridges<00:03:41.140> over<00:03:41.440> them<00:03:41.620> you

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
these little land bridges over them you

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.440 
these little land bridges over them you
see<00:03:42.220> this<00:03:42.280> dirt<00:03:42.670> bridge<00:03:42.910> here<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:44.520> then<00:03:45.520> we're

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
see this dirt bridge here and then we're

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.290 
see this dirt bridge here and then we're
almost<00:03:46.570> at<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.900> end<00:03:46.990> this<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.680> cave<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:49.120> can

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
almost at the end this is a cave you can

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.600 
almost at the end this is a cave you can
go<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.990> caves<00:03:50.230> usually<00:03:50.650> go<00:03:50.890> pretty<00:03:51.130> deep<00:03:51.220> but

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
go the caves usually go pretty deep but

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.060 
go the caves usually go pretty deep but
sometimes<00:03:51.970> they<00:03:52.090> don't<00:03:52.240> and<00:03:52.920> it's<00:03:53.920> really

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
sometimes they don't and it's really

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.620 
sometimes they don't and it's really
easy<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.340> find<00:03:54.520> ores<00:03:54.880> here<00:03:55.209> because<00:03:55.510> they're

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
easy to find ores here because they're

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.500 
easy to find ores here because they're
all<00:03:55.750> exposed<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.640> mobs<00:03:57.640> not<00:03:57.910> to<00:03:58.030> spawn<00:03:58.270> in

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
all exposed and mobs not to spawn in

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.880 
all exposed and mobs not to spawn in
there<00:03:58.720> which<00:03:59.110> makes<00:03:59.350> it<00:03:59.500> kind<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.740> dangerous

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
there which makes it kind of dangerous

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.120 
there which makes it kind of dangerous
to<00:04:00.340> go<00:04:00.430> in<00:04:00.550> there<00:04:01.590> lastly<00:04:02.590> we're<00:04:02.860> going<00:04:03.040> to

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
to go in there lastly we're going to

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.790 
to go in there lastly we're going to
talk<00:04:03.310> about<00:04:03.459> biomes<00:04:03.970> if<00:04:04.239> you're<00:04:05.140> on<00:04:05.230> a<00:04:05.260> Mac<00:04:05.350> you

move<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.700> mouse<00:04:15.850> around<00:04:16.980> first<00:04:17.980> shows<00:04:18.549> your

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
move the mouse around first shows your

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.500 
move the mouse around first shows your
aversion<00:04:19.060> frames<00:04:20.019> per<00:04:20.260> second<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:21.510> memory

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
aversion frames per second and memory

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.450 
aversion frames per second and memory
used<00:04:22.919> then<00:04:23.919> it<00:04:24.130> has<00:04:24.570> your<00:04:25.570> x<00:04:25.990> y&amp;z<00:04:26.890> position<00:04:27.340> in

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
used then it has your x y&amp;z position in

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.510 
used then it has your x y&amp;z position in
the<00:04:27.550> game<00:04:27.730> and<00:04:28.560> here's<00:04:29.560> feet<00:04:29.860> position<00:04:30.220> for<00:04:30.400> y

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
the game and here's feet position for y

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.210 
the game and here's feet position for y
ice<00:04:30.910> position<00:04:31.390> for<00:04:31.540> y<00:04:31.660> then<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.950> direction

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
ice position for y then the direction

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.360 
ice position for y then the direction
you're<00:04:33.460> facing<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.450> degrees<00:04:34.770> then<00:04:35.770> the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
you're facing and the degrees then the

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.430 
you're facing and the degrees then the
biome<00:04:36.790> which<00:04:36.820> is<00:04:37.120> a<00:04:37.150> desert<00:04:37.419> and<00:04:37.810> we<00:04:38.140> will<00:04:38.260> talk

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
biome which is a desert and we will talk

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.260 
biome which is a desert and we will talk
about<00:04:38.560> biomes<00:04:38.919> in<00:04:39.100> more<00:04:39.250> detail<00:04:39.550> then

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
about biomes in more detail then

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.890 
about biomes in more detail then
sunlight<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:41.250> other<00:04:42.250> light<00:04:42.580> and<00:04:42.900> then

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
sunlight and other light and then

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.450 
sunlight and other light and then
whether<00:04:44.530> you're<00:04:44.710> attacking<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.070> ground<00:04:45.310> or

whether you're attacking the ground or
not<00:04:45.610> if<00:04:45.790> you're<00:04:45.970> touching<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.300> ground<00:04:46.450> also

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
not if you're touching the ground also

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.430 
not if you're touching the ground also
true<00:04:47.080> if<00:04:47.260> not<00:04:47.530> will<00:04:47.800> be<00:04:47.919> false<00:04:48.450> so<00:04:49.450> now<00:04:50.140> stock

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
about biomes here I'm in a desert biome

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.590 
about biomes here I'm in a desert biome
which<00:04:53.169> is<00:04:53.440> characterized<00:04:54.070> by<00:04:54.250> lots<00:04:55.030> of<00:04:55.240> sand

spring<00:05:16.540> is<00:05:16.840> an<00:05:17.290> extreme<00:05:17.800> Hills<00:05:18.130> biome<00:05:18.610> which

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
spring is an extreme Hills biome which

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.520 
spring is an extreme Hills biome which
is<00:05:21.280> basically<00:05:21.790> a<00:05:21.910> bunch<00:05:22.270> of<00:05:22.510> giant<00:05:22.780> Hills<00:05:23.229> I

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
is basically a bunch of giant Hills I

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.280 
is basically a bunch of giant Hills I
can<00:05:23.979> sometimes<00:05:24.460> reach<00:05:24.669> up<00:05:24.850> to<00:05:25.030> cloud<00:05:25.330> level<00:05:25.690> so

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
can sometimes reach up to cloud level so

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.290 
can sometimes reach up to cloud level so
you<00:05:26.380> can<00:05:26.560> see<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:27.010> biome<00:05:27.370> is<00:05:27.550> changing<00:05:28.120> and

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
you can see the biome is changing and

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.959 
you can see the biome is changing and
right<00:05:29.200> now<00:05:29.320> we're<00:05:29.500> on<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.800> edge<00:05:30.130> of<00:05:30.490> the

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
right now we're on the edge of the

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:32.609 
right now we're on the edge of the
two<00:05:31.059> hills<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.659> now<00:05:31.869> we're<00:05:32.019> actually<00:05:32.139> in<00:05:32.499> the

00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:32.619 
two hills and now we're actually in the

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:38.249 
two hills and now we're actually in the
biome<00:05:32.979> so<00:05:33.699> here<00:05:34.029> is<00:05:34.059> extreme<00:05:34.689> Hills<00:05:35.639> and<00:05:37.259> then

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
biome so here is extreme Hills and then

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.369 
biome so here is extreme Hills and then
this<00:05:38.529> is<00:05:38.649> a<00:05:38.739> few<00:05:38.979> more<00:05:39.129> i'm<00:05:39.249> going<00:05:39.399> to<00:05:39.459> show<00:05:39.610> you

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:40.379 
this is a few more i'm going to show you

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.819 
this is a few more i'm going to show you
this<00:05:41.379> one<00:05:41.559> here<00:05:41.949> is<00:05:41.979> a<00:05:42.129> forest<00:05:42.610> which<00:05:43.449> has<00:05:43.829> oak

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:44.829 
this one here is a forest which has oak

00:05:44.829 --> 00:05:48.869 
this one here is a forest which has oak
trees<00:05:45.339> and<00:05:45.369> birch<00:05:45.999> trees<00:05:46.739> which<00:05:47.739> are<00:05:47.949> this<00:05:48.729> is

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:48.879 
trees and birch trees which are this is

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:53.159 
trees and birch trees which are this is
an<00:05:48.969> oak<00:05:49.119> tree<00:05:49.149> and<00:05:49.829> that's<00:05:50.829> a<00:05:50.979> birch<00:05:51.129> tree<00:05:52.169> and

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
an oak tree and that's a birch tree and

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.029 
an oak tree and that's a birch tree and
then<00:05:53.559> there's<00:05:54.069> one<00:05:54.399> more<00:05:54.610> of<00:05:54.759> a<00:05:54.849> year<00:05:55.919> just<00:05:56.919> as

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
then there's one more of a year just as

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.179 
then there's one more of a year just as
a<00:05:57.099> jungle<00:05:57.459> biome<00:05:57.849> but<00:05:58.539> are<00:05:58.749> usually<00:05:58.899> very<00:05:59.319> big

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:00.189 
a jungle biome but are usually very big

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:02.669 
a jungle biome but are usually very big
and<00:06:00.429> they<00:06:01.059> have<00:06:01.179> giant<00:06:01.569> jungle<00:06:01.959> trees<00:06:02.289> small

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:02.679 
and they have giant jungle trees small

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:06.089 
and they have giant jungle trees small
jungle<00:06:02.889> trees<00:06:03.309> lots<00:06:04.239> of<00:06:04.479> lakes<00:06:04.689> and<00:06:05.110> sometimes

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
jungle trees lots of lakes and sometimes

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.609 
jungle trees lots of lakes and sometimes
these<00:06:06.309> Oasis<00:06:06.909> like<00:06:07.089> places<00:06:07.509> which<00:06:08.169> are<00:06:08.319> lake

00:06:08.609 --> 00:06:08.619 
these Oasis like places which are lake

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:11.699 
these Oasis like places which are lake
surrounded<00:06:09.069> by<00:06:09.399> slowly<00:06:10.179> downward<00:06:11.110> going<00:06:11.409> land

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:11.709 
surrounded by slowly downward going land

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:14.369 
surrounded by slowly downward going land
so<00:06:12.699> now<00:06:12.849> let's<00:06:13.029> talk<00:06:13.179> about<00:06:13.239> what<00:06:13.689> biomes<00:06:14.110> can

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379 
so now let's talk about what biomes can

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:16.559 
so now let's talk about what biomes can
be<00:06:14.469> used<00:06:14.709> for<00:06:14.879> let's<00:06:15.879> say<00:06:15.999> I<00:06:16.059> wanted<00:06:16.419> some

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:16.569 
be used for let's say I wanted some

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:18.809 
be used for let's say I wanted some
cocoa<00:06:16.929> beans<00:06:17.110> in<00:06:17.289> survival<00:06:17.799> the<00:06:18.399> only<00:06:18.549> place<00:06:18.699> I

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
cocoa beans in survival the only place I

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:21.419 
cocoa beans in survival the only place I
could<00:06:18.879> find<00:06:18.969> that<00:06:19.479> is<00:06:19.719> a<00:06:20.619> jungle<00:06:20.979> biome

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:21.429 
could find that is a jungle biome

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:23.399 
could find that is a jungle biome
because<00:06:22.119> it<00:06:22.269> can<00:06:22.419> grow<00:06:22.629> on<00:06:22.899> these<00:06:23.079> jungle

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
because it can grow on these jungle

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:26.459 
because it can grow on these jungle
trees<00:06:23.619> only<00:06:24.059> pick<00:06:25.059> those<00:06:25.299> ones<00:06:25.539> like<00:06:26.019> leaves

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469 
trees only pick those ones like leaves

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.799 
trees only pick those ones like leaves
only<00:06:26.619> pointing<00:06:27.069> it<00:06:27.159> right<00:06:27.189> now<00:06:27.369> I<00:06:27.719> wanted<00:06:28.719> to

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:28.809 
only pointing it right now I wanted to

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.269 
find a birch tree I'd have to go to the
forest<00:06:31.689> biome<00:06:32.019> because<00:06:32.319> that's<00:06:33.069> the<00:06:33.219> only

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:33.279 
forest biome because that's the only

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:35.399 
forest biome because that's the only
place<00:06:33.489> you<00:06:33.669> can<00:06:33.759> get<00:06:33.909> those<00:06:34.089> and<00:06:34.989> if<00:06:35.079> i<00:06:35.169> wanted

only be a good place to go also another
thing<00:06:43.119> that<00:06:43.659> is<00:06:43.809> very<00:06:43.899> important<00:06:44.589> that<00:06:44.919> that

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:45.579 
thing that is very important that that

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:48.540 
thing that is very important that that
has<00:06:46.149> a<00:06:46.179> very<00:06:46.989> good<00:06:47.110> connection<00:06:47.739> to<00:06:47.949> biomes<00:06:48.369> are

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
has a very good connection to biomes are

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.419 
has a very good connection to biomes are
snow<00:06:49.149> golems<00:06:49.629> which<00:06:50.319> are<00:06:50.529> a<00:06:50.559> type<00:06:50.649> of<00:06:50.829> mob<00:06:51.159> that

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:51.429 
snow golems which are a type of mob that

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:54.739 
snow golems which are a type of mob that
we'll<00:06:51.610> be<00:06:51.689> talking<00:06:52.689> about<00:06:52.929> in<00:06:53.199> the<00:06:53.439> next<00:06:53.559> video

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:54.749 
we'll be talking about in the next video

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:57.779 
we'll be talking about in the next video
so<00:06:55.749> if<00:06:55.929> i<00:06:56.019> have<00:06:56.169> this<00:06:56.279> have<00:06:57.279> it<00:06:57.429> for<00:06:57.579> making

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:57.789 
so if i have this have it for making

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.600 
so if i have this have it for making
snuggle<00:06:58.119> in<00:06:58.209> here<00:06:58.479> a<00:06:59.099> jungle<00:07:00.099> biome<00:07:00.309> is<00:07:00.369> very

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
snuggle in here a jungle biome is very

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.239 
snuggle in here a jungle biome is very
humid<00:07:01.029> so<00:07:01.329> the<00:07:01.449> snow<00:07:01.659> golem<00:07:01.959> with<00:07:01.989> died<00:07:02.319> almost

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:03.249 
humid so the snow golem with died almost

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:06.539 
humid so the snow golem with died almost
immediately<00:07:03.459> and<00:07:04.889> snowballs<00:07:05.889> leave<00:07:06.159> a<00:07:06.189> trail

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:06.549 
immediately and snowballs leave a trail

00:07:06.549 --> 00:07:08.669 
immediately and snowballs leave a trail
of<00:07:06.579> snow<00:07:06.969> wherever<00:07:07.329> they<00:07:07.479> go<00:07:07.509> in<00:07:07.929> most<00:07:08.169> biomes

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:08.679 
of snow wherever they go in most biomes

00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:11.219 
of snow wherever they go in most biomes
but<00:07:09.099> in<00:07:09.309> this<00:07:09.939> plane<00:07:10.299> by<00:07:10.509> a<00:07:10.539> plane's<00:07:10.929> buying

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:11.229 
but in this plane by a plane's buying

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:13.559 
but in this plane by a plane's buying
for<00:07:11.379> example<00:07:11.799> it<00:07:12.219> doesn't<00:07:12.909> leave<00:07:13.059> any<00:07:13.269> snow

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:13.569 
for example it doesn't leave any snow

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:17.789 
for example it doesn't leave any snow
and<00:07:14.159> some<00:07:15.159> biomes<00:07:15.579> like<00:07:16.049> you<00:07:17.049> can<00:07:17.199> forest<00:07:17.619> in

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:17.799 
and some biomes like you can forest in

00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:22.580 
and some biomes like you can forest in
my<00:07:17.919> lips<00:07:18.219> of<00:07:18.399> snow

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:22.590 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.960 

ya<00:07:23.590> see<00:07:23.830> it<00:07:23.950> leaves<00:07:24.130> to<00:07:24.250> know<00:07:24.370> in<00:07:24.490> the<00:07:24.520> forest

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:24.970 
ya see it leaves to know in the forest

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.210 
ya see it leaves to know in the forest
villa<00:07:25.210> in<00:07:25.389> a<00:07:25.480> plain<00:07:25.750> file<00:07:26.080> so<00:07:26.770> if<00:07:26.889> you<00:07:26.980> want<00:07:27.160> a

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:27.220 
villa in a plain file so if you want a

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.560 
villa in a plain file so if you want a
snow<00:07:27.490> farm<00:07:27.790> you<00:07:27.940> have<00:07:28.060> to<00:07:28.180> build<00:07:28.360> it<00:07:28.420> in

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:28.570 
snow farm you have to build it in

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.990 
snow farm you have to build it in
somewhere<00:07:29.560> it's<00:07:29.710> not<00:07:29.770> Plains<00:07:30.280> biome<00:07:30.400> or

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 
somewhere it's not Plains biome or

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.670 
somewhere it's not Plains biome or
anywhere<00:07:31.690> else<00:07:31.750> that<00:07:31.900> doesn't<00:07:32.169> create<00:07:32.470> snow

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 
anywhere else that doesn't create snow

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.659 
anywhere else that doesn't create snow
in<00:07:33.040> and<00:07:33.750> that's<00:07:34.750> pretty<00:07:34.870> much<00:07:34.990> it<00:07:35.169> for<00:07:35.230> biomes

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:35.669 
in and that's pretty much it for biomes

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:38.450 
in and that's pretty much it for biomes
so<00:07:36.669> let's<00:07:36.850> summarize<00:07:37.090> what<00:07:37.630> we<00:07:37.750> learned<00:07:38.080> today

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 
so let's summarize what we learned today

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.070 
so let's summarize what we learned today
we<00:07:39.460> learned<00:07:39.700> about<00:07:40.000> generated<00:07:40.870> structures

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 
we learned about generated structures

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.550 
we learned about generated structures
such<00:07:41.680> as<00:07:41.740> villages<00:07:42.250> springs<00:07:43.060> lakes<00:07:43.900> rivers

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 
such as villages springs lakes rivers

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.950 
such as villages springs lakes rivers
and<00:07:44.800> caves<00:07:45.430> and<00:07:45.760> then<00:07:46.419> we<00:07:46.570> learned<00:07:46.810> about

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 
and caves and then we learned about

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.890 
and caves and then we learned about
biomes<00:07:47.680> and<00:07:47.980> the<00:07:48.610> relevance<00:07:49.060> of<00:07:49.270> them<00:07:49.540> to<00:07:49.780> the

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:49.900 
biomes and the relevance of them to the

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.870 
biomes and the relevance of them to the
game<00:07:50.110> thanks<00:07:50.950> for<00:07:51.070> listening<00:07:51.430> and<00:07:51.550> happy

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:51.880
