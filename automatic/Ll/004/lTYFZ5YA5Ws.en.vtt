 simple 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.460
 be yourself this is a valuable tip 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.850
 that no one can forget 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.890
 the selection process is a step that is 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.469

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.820
 undertaking in a particular 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.860
 position, this professional has already 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.750
 a screening for a first step 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.399
 any curriculum checks 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.489
 technical skills 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.250
 in the interview is much more to validate 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.460
 the information that has been 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.890
 curriculum but also has this perception 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.380
 very strong that the most important 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.290
 behavior how do you react 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.200
 to watch certain situations such as 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.140
 professional in question in case you are 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.360
 of being evaluated that people observe the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.930
 way of communicating the way 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.119
 only how you reacted past instructions 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.650
 situations of conflict is 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.500
 also important to bring about 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.170
 which were not necessarily positive 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.689
 but how did you respond to these 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.299
 situations and how you were able to 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.520
 it is also very important to understand that 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.930
 kind of people this we'll observe 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.180
 are you related better than environment 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.100
 that you value because this is mine. 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.899
 this position is behind 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.420
 for this environment that you value 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.909
 It's better with you that you do not 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.899
 even in this company because you will not 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.700
 be happy 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.590
 then the question to be yourself bring 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.799
 examples and concrete experiences is the most 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.799
 important 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.610
 Be yourself again. 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.430
 it is important to keep in mind that the process 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.040
 selective is a double hand thinking 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.110
 head hunting issue has also evaluated 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.470
 need to ask questions region is for 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.040

 do not miss this opportunity there are many 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.190
 times I understand and I've had experiences 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.680
 interviewed people who had 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.380
 profile and not technically persons 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.170
 but have some difficulty in 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.420
 if I put this one to sell and often I 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.970
 I told them I defended beck and joe. 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.650
 letteri structure but neither is it not 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.380
 whenever you meet a person 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.660
 available to help you or have the time 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.310
 to understand what lies behind their 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.239
 difficulties you may be the person 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.340

 inside what makes sense to you 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.330
 if it is necessary and do not make me 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.580
 customer a particular company the 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.950

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.000
 relationship with people in a 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.010
 a little more is direct transparent has 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.360
 that being charged results 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.310
