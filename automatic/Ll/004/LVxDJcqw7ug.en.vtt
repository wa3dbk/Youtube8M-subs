device<00:02:34.360> do<00:02:34.570> its<00:02:34.750> thing

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:52.670 

you

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.890 

so<00:02:53.400> my<00:02:53.549> device<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:53.819> finally<00:02:54.299> finished<00:02:54.629> and<00:02:54.780> you

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
so my device is finally finished and you

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.949 
so my device is finally finished and you
can<00:02:55.049> see<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.349> I<00:02:55.439> deleted<00:02:56.060> 313<00:02:57.060> files<00:02:57.299> which

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
can see that I deleted 313 files which

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.679 
can see that I deleted 313 files which
obviously<00:02:58.439> is<00:02:58.860> not<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:59.069> lot<00:02:59.340> but<00:02:59.549> I<00:02:59.819> just<00:03:00.299> ran<00:03:00.569> D

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
obviously is not a lot but I just ran D

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.809 
obviously is not a lot but I just ran D
test<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.230> few<00:03:01.439> minutes<00:03:01.709> before<00:03:02.099> so<00:03:02.370> that's<00:03:02.610> why

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
test a few minutes before so that's why

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.990 
test a few minutes before so that's why
it's<00:03:02.970> not<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.180> lot<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.510> files<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:05.370> once<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.849> is

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
it's not a lot of files so once that is

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.300 
it's not a lot of files so once that is
done<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.450> would<00:03:06.959> suggest<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.590> re<00:03:07.860> springing
