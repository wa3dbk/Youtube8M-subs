there's not a whole lot that's going to

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.859 
there's not a whole lot that's going to
change<00:02:05.130> evaluation<00:02:06.000> wise<00:02:06.149> maybe<00:02:06.450> things<00:02:06.689> will

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
change evaluation wise maybe things will

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.540 
change evaluation wise maybe things will
change<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.590> they<00:02:07.680> tend<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.979> end<00:02:08.099> up<00:02:08.220> settling

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
change but they tend to end up settling

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.120 
change but they tend to end up settling
