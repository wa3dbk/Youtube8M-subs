is that it's not so much using sound to
indicate<00:02:10.289> locations<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.190> really<00:02:11.610> using

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
indicate locations but really using

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.020 
indicate locations but really using
sound<00:02:12.500> cinematically<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.770> using<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
sound cinematically and using the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.979 
sound cinematically and using the
technology<00:02:15.599> of<00:02:16.310> Hollywood<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.879> create<00:02:18.599> a
