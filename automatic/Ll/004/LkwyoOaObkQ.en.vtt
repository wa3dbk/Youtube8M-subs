00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.440
 good friends I bring you this tweet that 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.370
 many had not asked and it's the one we 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.029
 fight in and with this tweet we will be able to 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:19.939
 hack Wi-Fi networks and well this is because 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:24.019
 pretty easy simple but if I am 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.089
 sincere I still prefer 100% what 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.970
 that would be the web but there 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.890
 although question of tastes with question 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.620
 of except a matter of taste 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.870
 simply here we can see the networks 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.520
 offline that we have here we can put 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.140
 the password manually but it is 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.030
 what we do not want no no no we do not have 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.769
 the password is simply assumed 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.960
 we will search in networks 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:48.829
 here we will get compatible networks and 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.449
 networks and with this incompatible by 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.489
 example here we have that nothing else we 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.190
 comes a compatible network that will come 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.170
 being this the others are incompatible 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.530
 all we have to do is 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.690
 press 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.170
 and we will calculate the minutes that 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.339
 you can take hack the network ok in case of 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.710
 that you can not get here in the house 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.619
 there are not many networks nearby trying to 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.580
 look for this exit and look for some network and 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:19.000
 Well, I'm going to 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.740
 Dissolves by this notification ok 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.870
 here we are that you are checking us 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.440
 the passwords have not been found 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.240
 two passwords and says that it can not 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.460
 if possible because it has changed the 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.470
 password and everything not so good 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.760
 I will go to the street to look if I can 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.850
 find modems 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.620
 where you can hack and immediately 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.060
 I bring the video in case I can not 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.100
 Well, I think that until here 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.980
 video once I ask for an apology 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.740
 if I can not find compatible networks 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.440
 but as I tell them, if I am 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.830
 sincere I prefer what is the web but 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.520
 here I must have it 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.920
 this application is practically basic 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.810
 for me but at this moment I do not see it 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.360
 here is the same 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.179
 let's say these two applications are the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.000
 we have to hack Wi-Fi networks that 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.430
 will be the pro web and the wifi team 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.220
 and ok it 's something that you decide that 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.930
 since you choose here below in 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.599
 such as video response I'll leave 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.190
 videos about the pro web and also 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.920
 as I repeat again if I find 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.950
 wifi networks compatible with wifi and I 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.690
 I immediately distracted the video in 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.849
 this same video I'm going to show you how 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.410
 hack how to hack the network but in case of 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.819
 I do not say goodbye to friends 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.799
 thank you very much for watching the videos 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.299
 remember to subscribe to the channel highlighted 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.519
 little hand up here down can do it 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.340
 subscribe you can give it up here and 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.200
 that's all friends ok I'll go look for 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.730
 the wifi networks and if I am 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.099
 thank you very much for watching the friends videos 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.930
 but remember are options are options 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.030
 that they give us to be able to modify what 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.280
 better does not work for you has the web pro 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.290
 but it works great and we fight 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.819
 to me or the other way around it works for you 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.500
 marvel wey feituni but not you 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.640
 it works just like friends so 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.560
 good friends many times to see the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.090
 videos and see you in the next I'll go 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.090
 to search for wi-fi bye bye networks
