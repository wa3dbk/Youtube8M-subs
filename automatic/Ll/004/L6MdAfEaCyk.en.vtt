like the front of it and so yeah it just

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.850 
like the front of it and so yeah it just
means<00:03:52.239> they<00:03:52.360> don't<00:03:52.540> have<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.930> like<00:03:53.110> use<00:03:53.440> up<00:03:53.650> a

means they don't have to like use up a

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.860 
means they don't have to like use up a
big<00:03:54.160> base<00:03:54.430> plate<00:03:54.850> because<00:03:55.030> then<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.360> look<00:03:55.720> a

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870
