00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.390
 with lettuce loves and good as they have 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.490
 been I hope that very well the day of 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.410
 today I brought you a super fast tutorial 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.510
 of a full make-up to the color for 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.990
 spring then I go now in 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.990
 The procedure 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.870
 first of all they 're going to have to 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.059
 excuse my super husky voice in this 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.800
 video I'm sick but since it's a 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:44.010
 makeup for every day only 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.010
 own a tv I wanted to care about my face 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.800
 and now it goes the concealer that they see that to 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.930
 I love putting it in a triangle and it 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.550
 I recommend them a lot because they illuminate 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.340
 and they charge the fat at the same time 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.840
 diffuses very well and tries to put little 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.910
 so you will not see false 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.460
 and good of course you can not miss the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.300
 super first so that their shadows last 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.400
 all day and well now it has a color 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.110
 very clearly and shiny purple and sews 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.640
 with a flat brush on my eyelid 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.640
 mobile this color looks lovely 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.550
 and good for this touch full of color and 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.100
 spring I put a blue like water color 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.780
 and glossy especially my inner part 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.200
 this color looks beautiful and it gives you 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.930
 a lot of light to the look 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.030
 I put a mint green color with a brush 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.130
 small to give a touch more 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.130
 spring and a little more colorful 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.870
 that is a matte black shadow with a 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.600
 brush to delineate the place of 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.190
 eyeliner so it does not look too 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.760
 exaggerated the look and the colors are followed 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.980
 watching pretty and to be a little 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.670
 more cooker is trying to take the line a 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.670
 little more out 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.319
 Do not forget to take good care of your 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.930
 eyelashes to make them look pretty 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.760
 and then put on enough mascara 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.180
 but not so much so that you do not see lumps 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.180
 rare 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.490
 do not forget the tabs below 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.140
 and then with the eyebrows are pretty 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.150
 important to fill them with a color that 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.069
 stay with you 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.590
 and only follows its natural form 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.150
 and good as it is spring and surcharges 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.889
 to be seen with a little flush in the 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.829
 cheeks only with a little so that 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:43.409
 you look like sunny a very moisturizes 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.659
 okay your lips and then make sure 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.090
 put very little dye in the center of 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.889
 your lips and blends very well with a 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.010
 cotonete or with your finger so that it will be 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:55.439
 nice and then add a pink gloss 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.569
 but do not touch the red so you do not 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:01.189
 what does it do completely 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.189
 and we're done 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.130
