00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.590
 Hello dear friends i want to keep them empty again online video watching her 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.969
 Online video guidebooks the former coach and some experts I am 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:41.129
 in all questions 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.399
 on the subject of online video for you 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.830
 Today I want to talk about microphones 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.140
 that is this topic i will divide into several areas Merkl one 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.140
 Videos because it is very comprehensive 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.500
 Today we talk about the dynamic microphones "So I start with it 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.150
 dynamic microphones land 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.960
 because 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.970
 but that is a very cost effective option 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.270
 I have a dynamic microphone here 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.000
 Stages by Procter Ellens pop bands like to be used 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.740
 There is a lot of different types in this area so I am going to San MartÃ­n 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.360
 and name or write labels what insiders and kidneys of 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.270
 PDF 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.640
 Percent with a listing 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.609
 now are dynamic microphones for 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.410
 over 50 euros between 1500 euros 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.320
 they are 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.460
 really good 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.180
 dynamic microphones 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.900
 and the whole thing connected with a cable so be the boy 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.240
 and process one and a half meters long unseen grader year now but the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.710
 Camera crazy 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.490
 Isla Saban 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.770
 Way connected to the camera Zeiss is not for contact but BRA directly with 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.590
 Corba that is actually a good solution hamlet 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.229
 because they have no radio interference yes so dynamic metropolis the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.810
 you have to talk relatively close to years of singer at the stage of must 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.100
 one very close Nico lives by far as the whole very fast very fast 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.939
 very quiet so you have to comply unfortunately 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.389
 in contrast, there are condenser microphones 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.449
 a we have quite different characteristics talk about it like one 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:22.999
 other times yes 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.699
 So that would be my tip for today in any case please 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:31.679
 so that their message acoustics also comes across acoustically couple use them 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.119
 Microphones 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:38.029
 the time spent buying a camera already pay attention to it as a percent 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:42.119
 Microphone input so have a plug most of it are mini sounds more needs 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:43.799
 one has dapd dapd in the case of 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.439
 Exalead is called that 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.719
 the connection here 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:47.650
 so 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.650
 Mini sounds on the camera 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:03.489
 thank you very much i hope this tip was useful for you or you 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.489
 definitely should heed it 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.060
 It certainly makes 50 percent or more of reading success if its message 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.629
 not just visually 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.199
 comes across well 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.339
 her in that case I have a wonderful backdrop the more optical ste 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.309
 by being very good acoustically yes 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:24.609
 No 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.609
 World War II, the competition reaches part 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.649
 Dr 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:32.379
 we have a share 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.629
 We spend 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:34.829
 sublimity 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.439
 my films 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.439
 Picture 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:42.479
 Rheine 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:45.479
 but far from it 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.709
 freedom 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:56.220
 You will see 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.269
 he episode and their satisfied customers will thank you HB 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.929
 I am a Galileo to him 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:04.070
 tap with today 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.640
 about Galileo year online video consultant online video expert 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.620
 until next time with the next patch on the topic 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.359
