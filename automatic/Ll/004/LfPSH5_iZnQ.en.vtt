00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
same time it seems something if these

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.569 
same time it seems something if these
are<00:01:46.409> problems<00:01:46.740> those<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.189> they're<00:01:47.279> behaving

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
are problems those and they're behaving

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.760 
are problems those and they're behaving
like<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.149> why<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.719> your<00:01:48.990> dog<00:01:49.229> that's<00:01:49.499> not
