00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
you may have a problem if you are left

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.359 
you may have a problem if you are left
in

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
in

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.959 
in
here's<00:02:09.849> a<00:02:09.909> 3.5<00:02:10.569> millimeter<00:02:10.780> headphone<00:02:11.049> jack

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:11.969 
here's a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.580 
here's a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
and<00:02:12.969> as<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.239> see<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:14.079> is<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.260> first<00:02:14.409> time

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and as you see this is the first time

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.880 
and as you see this is the first time
Motorola<00:02:14.980> has<00:02:15.159> done<00:02:15.370> if<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:15.700> device<00:02:16.150> with

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
Motorola has done if a device with

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.899 
Motorola has done if a device with
capacitive<00:02:17.890> excuse<00:02:18.099> me<00:02:18.219> with<00:02:18.370> touchscreen

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
capacitive excuse me with touchscreen

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.479 
capacitive excuse me with touchscreen
buttons<00:02:19.569> rather<00:02:20.290> than<00:02:20.530> capacitive<00:02:21.159> buttons

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
buttons rather than capacitive buttons

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.309 
buttons rather than capacitive buttons
so<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.299> makes<00:02:22.689> it<00:02:23.040> pretty<00:02:24.040> close<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
so it makes it pretty close to the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.509 
so it makes it pretty close to the
Android<00:02:26.319> experience<00:02:26.829> that<00:02:26.980> most<00:02:27.159> people<00:02:27.430> are

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519

Android experience that most people are
used<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.790> or<00:02:28.060> unlike<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.390> Nexus<00:02:28.780> device

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140

starts off at the screen number two and

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.310 
starts off at the screen number two and
then<00:04:33.010> you<00:04:33.130> go<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.550> right<00:04:33.760> so<00:04:34.180> if<00:04:34.960> you<00:04:35.170> don't

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
like that you can't really change it on

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.670 
like that you can't really change it on
the<00:04:37.510> stock<00:04:37.780> launcher<00:04:38.050> you'd<00:04:38.410> have<00:04:38.560> to

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
the stock launcher you'd have to

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.990 
the stock launcher you'd have to
download<00:04:38.860> something<00:04:39.340> from<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.550> App<00:04:39.730> Store

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280
