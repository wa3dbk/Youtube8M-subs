00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
night and had a kid in this color guitar

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.500 
night and had a kid in this color guitar
well<00:03:17.400> anyway<00:03:19.680> this<00:03:20.680> particular<00:03:21.460> one<00:03:21.670> is<00:03:22.060> tuned

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
well anyway this particular one is tuned

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.330 
well anyway this particular one is tuned
right<00:03:23.020> now<00:03:23.140> I<00:03:23.200> haven't<00:03:23.440> been<00:03:23.560> drop<00:03:23.860> deep<00:03:24.130> but

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
right now I haven't been drop deep but

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.380 
right now I haven't been drop deep but
they<00:03:24.490> are<00:03:24.640> standard<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.970> we<00:03:28.180> can<00:03:28.300> go<00:03:28.360> to

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
they are standard so we can go to

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.840 
they are standard so we can go to
standard<00:03:28.810> tuning<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:30.220> look<00:03:30.340> at<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.610> familiar

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
standard tuning and look at the familiar

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.920 
standard tuning and look at the familiar
chords<00:03:31.510> there<00:03:33.090> there's<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.150> C<00:03:34.420> chord<00:03:34.660> for

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
chords there there's a C chord for

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.800 
chords there there's a C chord for
example<00:03:34.990> and<00:03:35.770> we<00:03:35.890> can<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:42.010> get<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.220> idea

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
example and we can so you get the idea

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.560 
example and we can so you get the idea
now<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.260> Bastardo<00:03:45.070> model<00:03:45.430> was<00:03:45.670> inspired<00:03:46.270> by

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
now the Bastardo model was inspired by

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.560 
now the Bastardo model was inspired by
something<00:03:47.050> from<00:03:47.740> the<00:03:47.830> past<00:03:48.160> called<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.880> viola

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
something from the past called the viola

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.990 
something from the past called the viola
Bastardo<00:03:50.320> in<00:03:51.220> fact<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.700> was<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.820> really

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
Bastardo in fact that was a really

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.600 
Bastardo in fact that was a really
appropriate<00:03:52.390> name<00:03:52.780> for<00:03:53.220> these<00:03:54.220> instruments

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
appropriate name for these instruments

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.200 
appropriate name for these instruments
I've<00:03:54.910> built<00:03:55.320> particularly<00:03:56.320> this<00:03:56.440> model<00:03:56.830> and

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
I've built particularly this model and

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.450 
I've built particularly this model and
because<00:03:58.770> you<00:03:59.770> can<00:03:59.890> look<00:04:00.040> this<00:04:00.130> up<00:04:00.280> in<00:04:00.400> the

whereas you know a lot of the earlier
files<00:04:10.360> were<00:04:10.810> just<00:04:11.110> very<00:04:11.350> droney<00:04:11.770> and<00:04:12.100> they

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
files were just very droney and they

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.420 
files were just very droney and they
didn't<00:04:12.489> exactly<00:04:13.330> just<00:04:13.750> focus<00:04:14.500> on<00:04:14.680> what<00:04:15.340> we

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
didn't exactly just focus on what we

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.520 
didn't exactly just focus on what we
call<00:04:15.610> shredding<00:04:16.090> today<00:04:16.390> so<00:04:17.290> they<00:04:17.470> were

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
call shredding today so they were

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.930 
call shredding today so they were
essentially<00:04:18.510> set<00:04:19.510> up<00:04:19.630> for<00:04:19.810> shredding<00:04:20.760> in<00:04:21.760> that

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
essentially set up for shredding in that

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.590 
essentially set up for shredding in that
manner<00:04:22.950> I<00:04:23.950> kind<00:04:24.460> of<00:04:24.490> like<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.790> name<00:04:25.150> mostarda

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
manner I kind of like the name mostarda

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.080 
manner I kind of like the name mostarda
because<00:04:26.140> I<00:04:26.380> think<00:04:26.500> that<00:04:26.770> in<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.310> family<00:04:27.970> of

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
because I think that in the family of

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.350 
because I think that in the family of
stringed<00:04:28.510> instruments<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:30.490> may<00:04:30.730> be<00:04:30.790> viewed<00:04:31.150> as

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
stringed instruments it may be viewed as

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.640 
stringed instruments it may be viewed as
sort<00:04:31.810> of<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.320> bastard<00:04:33.130> child<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:34.750> I<00:04:35.169> kind<00:04:35.620> of

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
sort of the bastard child and I kind of

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.909 
sort of the bastard child and I kind of
like<00:04:35.830> that<00:04:36.040> anyway<00:04:38.550> this<00:04:39.550> one<00:04:39.880> is<00:04:40.780> on<00:04:41.590> its<00:04:41.650> way
