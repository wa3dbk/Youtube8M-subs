really<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:22.100> small<00:01:22.760> it's<00:01:23.180> supposed<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.450> look

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
really a small it's supposed to look

really a small it's supposed to look
like<00:01:23.660> that<00:01:23.810> but<00:01:24.290> they've<00:01:24.740> kind<00:01:25.070> of<00:01:25.100> broken

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
like that but they've kind of broken

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.620 
like that but they've kind of broken
apart<00:01:25.670> but<00:01:25.910> they're<00:01:26.030> supposed<00:01:26.120> to<00:01:26.330> be<00:01:26.450> like<00:01:26.600> a

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
apart but they're supposed to be like a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.160 
apart but they're supposed to be like a
little<00:01:30.640> okay<00:01:31.640> a<00:01:31.820> little<00:01:32.390> wider<00:01:32.600> world<00:01:32.960> it

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
little okay a little wider world it

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.840 
little okay a little wider world it
looks<00:01:33.380> like<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:33.770> would<00:01:33.890> be<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:34.040> pretzel<00:01:34.370> it<00:01:34.730> does

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
looks like it would be a pretzel it does

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:46.120 
looks like it would be a pretzel it does
kind<00:01:35.120> of<00:01:35.210> approach<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.750> good<00:01:36.290> slogan

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.440 

did<00:01:47.130> their<00:01:47.280> chocolate<00:01:47.640> color<00:01:47.820> crumble

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450

did their chocolate color crumble
I<00:01:48.830> can<00:01:49.830> see<00:01:50.070> where<00:01:50.390> this<00:01:51.390> would<00:01:51.600> last<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.080> long

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
I can see where this would last a long

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.980 
I can see where this would last a long
time<00:01:56.030> it's<00:01:57.030> good<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:57.450> super<00:01:57.840> sweet
