00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 just for you guys do not switch video already 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.589
 I'm going to tell you that this book that is not 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.200
 about soccer despite this cover review 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:25.769
 of an artilleryman of gustavo araújo logo 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:28.289
 then the captain's conversion vignette already 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.789
 that I cried back there I do not agree 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.219
 much with her 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.380
 first because the Caesar aurelian is the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.850
 main character of this book here 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.100
 9 years old 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.920
 in 1972 we started talking about 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.460
 things but he plays football on the street he 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.700
 do not wear clothes , especially with 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.670
 this title the gunner who also 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.500
 football is that the person who 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.600
 if I do not understand much about football and if 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.270
 I'm not mistaken, it 's that person who stays 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.039
 putting the plays in something like that 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.920
 then you will understand why the name of the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.070
 book is the top scorer after reading 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.830
 end that only at the end of five knowing 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.960
 but this cover does not portray much the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.970
 book idea 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.400
 I already told you that the story is 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.070
 passes in 1972 and 1982 people to dictatorship 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.990
 military still exists in Brazil right 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.560
 she started at 64 and was up to 85 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.740
 imagine many , many many years and the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.470
 aurélio caesar which is known as lelo 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.780
 is his nickname is how it fits 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.979
 most of the book is the son of 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.899
 military his father is a captain gives 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.290
 have a much better sense of what it is 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.210
 story telling what happens during the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.310
 time of military dictatorship he is the son of 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.530
 but it's a story practically 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.820
 biographical self not practically 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.759
 autobiographical but I believe that 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.100
 have autobiographical elements here 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.600
 despite the fact that 32 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.190
 author that gustavo has in the sessions 73 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.200
 Neon looks at curiosity 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:12.690
 But I thought Gustavo knew 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.490
 to rescue many of the feelings of 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.710
 so even if you did not have your 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.560
 childhood side of the 70's I did not have 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.900
 obviously but it about rescuing the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.690
 child's feeling that will that 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.440
 had or one of you suddenly 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.430
 have to explore the eu and the basement looks like a 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.970
 universe to be discovered a box can 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.910
 to have anything in is that small 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.680
 things will to play know up to 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.740
 some jokes that they do here for 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.870
 example the breath in the can that never played 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.350
 basketball stand turning cards 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.380
 to complete an album of any 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.710
 But I do not like it today. 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.330
 football I've completed album de 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.420
 soccer 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.050
 New curiosity for you guys to play 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.360
 button football play football at last 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.870
 but what happens is football here 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.320
 people is background is sure a cloth of 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.560
 background to develop the characters 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.600
 so the characters relate 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.110
 often through football is in the 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.450
 game is commenting on a game 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.820
 Even though I do not like football, it 's the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.910
 moment of the book in which he gives the author 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:34.830
 describes a match that took place 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:41.670
 Truth in maracanã in maracanã 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:43.950
 I think it's very realistic and it's not 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.530
 Realist does not apologize is the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.019
 information is very accurate it already seems 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.209
 really have a a lot of research 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.790
 deep in this sense because bids 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.110
 are described and players are 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.380
 remembered 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:02.160
 Even though I liked it, I did not live in 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.310
 72 or when you pass the book you can 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.670
 you see that there was a whole square search 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:12.440
 to go understand the player 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.510
 at that time of year is I have there is 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.880
 that's how I really was 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.090
 impressed by this scene I can 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.859
 tell you the perfect book 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.919
 I do not think the book was made by some 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.230
 questions and these dogs will stay 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.290
 barking because the residence 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.310
 Come on, I did not find the bad ones already. 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.940
 including that they have many 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.919
 information that is interesting and 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.320
 moment some author treats the reader as 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.380
 idiot also more than invest some 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.200
 there may be clues some tips 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.560
 things that will happen and neither moment 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.990
 It's obvious but I missed it too. 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.330
 naturalness in the dialogues one more thing 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.500
 common even of what we think but to 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.680
 I missed and some metaphors during the 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.810
 book during the story I also found 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:07.430
 which could have been better worked 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:10.610
 which are a bit obvious but the 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.460
 story is really very exciting 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.650
 I did not say much of the synopsis yet 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.630
 more the history the first the change the 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.870
 first thing you will read this 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.039
 book is during consultations and not 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.390
 have realized that they are within a 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:28.700
 church is coming in and they are there for 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.260
 account of a mass for which someone died 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.660
 if you do not know who this person is 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.770
 just know that the lelo is the character 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.830
 main 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.780
 I knew this person and liked that person. 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.539
 right person 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.090
 he feels so worried because he does not 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.320
 is crying he thinks he 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.970
 should be crying because he 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.180
 I liked this person 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.430
 soon after but already part for a product 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.340
 cheap than happened before this scene 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.620
 right until the end of the book you 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.560
 Find out everything that happened I did not 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:05.330
 I was thinking about this first 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.889
 cell from church to mass during 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.930
 book maybe if I had stayed 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.600
 thinking about it I might have 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:15.320
 took other tracks but I stayed 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.940
 quite surprised at the end I expected and 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.450
 I was excited 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:23.490
 jamey salary then recapping then 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.860
 the good points are the characters 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.170
 history is well developed 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.900
 exciting bitch brings nostalgia to the 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:34.080
 information of the facts of what 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.300
 happened in 72 are quite accurate and 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.400
 as negative points the lack of 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.680
 the dialogue and metaphors 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:45.090
 which could have been better worked 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.560
 with this it takes three toró to but it is 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.510
 almost 14 like that 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.750
 another curiosity for you is that the 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:54.720
 gustavo araújo author high published it 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:57.210
 and dictated the books and published there in the 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.010
 amazon shop then who has come 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.620
 for now the advantage 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.790
 he said that the body version is in 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.560
 development 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.690
 as it becomes available in the places 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.690
 link to you also in the description of 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.700
 video is good but enjoy while 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.010
 no publisher has taken yet because I 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.210
 I took a look there for less than 2 

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.160
 real 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.710
 he has another book also released that 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:23.790
 It was after that, you guys, check it out. 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:27.030
 That's it, but my tip is - 27 de 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:29.580
