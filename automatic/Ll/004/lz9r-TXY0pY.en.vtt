for<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.430> long<00:00:20.580> time<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:21.359> developed<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.810> new

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
for a long time we developed a new

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.929 
for a long time we developed a new
technology<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.589> made<00:00:23.220> us<00:00:23.339> decide<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.820> was

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
technology that made us decide it was

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.849 
technology that made us decide it was
time<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.150> give<00:00:24.390> our<00:00:24.509> own<00:00:24.660> brand<00:00:24.929> this<00:00:25.800> is

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
those two pieces and you put them

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.000 
those two pieces and you put them
together<00:00:51.960> with<00:00:52.710> glue<00:00:52.920> tape<00:00:53.489> or<00:00:53.699> velcro<00:00:55.010> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
actually making these as one piece it's

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.740 
actually making these as one piece it's

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
we've been able to do is take the shell

through the entire structure what that

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.060 
through the entire structure what that

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
it you can see here there's no gaps

part of that what that does for us is it

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.040 
part of that what that does for us is it
allows<00:01:55.730> us<00:01:55.760> to<00:01:56.060> lower<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.510> density<00:01:56.690> of<00:01:56.990> the
