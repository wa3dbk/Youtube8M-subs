00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:00.469 
and see where we go from here I thought

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:02.920 
and see where we go from here I thought
that<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:02.000> reason<00:04:02.329> why<00:04:02.449> they<00:04:02.599> were<00:04:02.659> building

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
that the reason why they were building

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.539 
that the reason why they were building
Sheamus<00:04:03.469> up<00:04:03.650> was<00:04:03.829> to<00:04:03.919> get<00:04:04.099> him<00:04:04.250> into<00:04:04.519> the

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
Sheamus up was to get him into the

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.640 
Sheamus up was to get him into the
intercontinental<00:04:05.180> championship<00:04:05.599> run<00:04:06.019> hell

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
intercontinental championship run hell

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.379 
intercontinental championship run hell
even<00:04:06.919> both<00:04:07.189> of<00:04:07.340> these<00:04:07.459> guys<00:04:07.729> in<00:04:08.030> two<00:04:08.180> weeks

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
even both of these guys in two weeks

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.179 
even both of these guys in two weeks
they<00:04:08.629> could<00:04:08.780> be<00:04:08.870> added<00:04:09.019> in<00:04:09.229> the<00:04:09.319> Elimination

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
they could be added in the Elimination

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.209 
they could be added in the Elimination
Chamber<00:04:10.370> for<00:04:10.549> the<00:04:12.219> Intercontinental

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:13.219 
Chamber for the Intercontinental

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.069 
Chamber for the Intercontinental
Championship<00:04:13.789> anyways<00:04:14.180> but<00:04:14.449> you<00:04:14.870> know<00:04:15.049> I

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
Championship anyways but you know I

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.629 
Championship anyways but you know I
think<00:04:15.439> that<00:04:15.590> Sheamus<00:04:15.949> getting<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.250> wind<00:04:16.459> is

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
think that Sheamus getting the wind is

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:17.949 
think that Sheamus getting the wind is
probably<00:04:16.909> to<00:04:17.030> be<00:04:17.120> better<00:04:17.329> for<00:04:17.539> them<00:04:17.659> to<00:04:17.780> be<00:04:17.870> in

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
probably to be better for them to be in

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.259 
probably to be better for them to be in
the<00:04:18.049> long<00:04:18.229> run
