hello<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.410> extreme<00:00:01.740> sounds<00:00:02.280> I'm

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hello this is the extreme sounds I'm

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.619 
hello this is the extreme sounds I'm
going<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.700> show<00:00:02.850> you<00:00:02.909> how<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.120> use<00:00:03.360> headphones

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
going to show you how to use headphones

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.000 
going to show you how to use headphones
as<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.259> microphone<00:00:06.049> to<00:00:07.049> do<00:00:07.170> this<00:00:07.379> is<00:00:07.589> so

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
as a microphone to do this is so

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.209 
as a microphone to do this is so
incredibly<00:00:08.849> simple<00:00:09.389> because<00:00:09.900> normally<00:00:10.440> just

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
incredibly simple because normally just

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.770 
incredibly simple because normally just
plug<00:00:11.460> your<00:00:11.490> headphones<00:00:11.730> into<00:00:12.000> headphone<00:00:12.570> jack

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
plug your headphones into headphone jack

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.860 
plug your headphones into headphone jack
which<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.650> pretty<00:00:13.980> simple<00:00:14.190> but<00:00:15.000> instead<00:00:15.809> of

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
which is pretty simple but instead of

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.590 
which is pretty simple but instead of
that<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:17.039> plug<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.400> directly<00:00:17.699> into<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
that you just plug it directly into the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.950 
that you just plug it directly into the
microphone<00:00:18.840> jack<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.939> this<00:00:20.939> will<00:00:21.359> act<00:00:21.630> as<00:00:21.779> a

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
microphone jack and this will act as a

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.599 
microphone jack and this will act as a
microphone<00:00:22.350> because<00:00:22.560> actually<00:00:23.100> headphones

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
microphone because actually headphones

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.880 
microphone because actually headphones
the<00:00:24.269> same<00:00:24.539> just<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> other<00:00:25.230> way<00:00:25.380> around<00:00:25.410> so

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the same just the other way around so

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.519 
the same just the other way around so
this<00:00:26.640> just<00:00:26.820> flips<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.420> around<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.289> works

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
this just flips it around and it works

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.009 
this just flips it around and it works
as<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.830> microphone<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:30.210> prove<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.720> will<00:00:30.900> work

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
as a microphone to prove this will work

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.630 
as a microphone to prove this will work
with<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.439> about<00:00:31.529> any<00:00:31.890> type<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.219> headphone

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
with just about any type of headphone

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.760 
with just about any type of headphone
I'm<00:00:32.850> using<00:00:33.090> bog-standard<00:00:33.690> headphones<00:00:34.530> these

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
I'm using bog-standard headphones these

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.260 
I'm using bog-standard headphones these

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
right so we'll see how they sound so now

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.500 
right so we'll see how they sound so now
I<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.930> audacity<00:00:40.559> up<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.920> we<00:00:41.219> have<00:00:41.460> our
