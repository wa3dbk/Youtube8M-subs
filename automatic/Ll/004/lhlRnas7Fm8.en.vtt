00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.190
 and good has been from the north 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.480
 it is tradition they are treated with their time because 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.090
 finally those that were released then 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.260
 of the world by monthly tomÃ¡s 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:25.740
 as it is usually and good after an edition 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:29.560
 that brings them together and that we are going to analyze 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.119
 I tell you it cost me 32 euros 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.649
 and good this stage of one as you see 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.649
 the door both pretty 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:44.739
 the volume are considerable but they are 32 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.380
 euros invested in good reading and 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:51.310
 Well let's see a few percent 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.680
 the story I was not very introduced 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.090
 in the world ahead I always wanted 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.090
 introduce me but of course I like because 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.720
 the story 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.720
 but the truth 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.840
 the seven colors and then more than two 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.780
 rings and other branches the white and the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.980
 black that since it's the main plot 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.190
 of what happens I'm food 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.620
 through those two colors 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.810
 so I tell you if you want initials or 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.360
 If you want to know about the world of 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.170
 For this is the moment as an ideal 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.300
 because I already ortigosa well all 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.830
 colors and besides it's not hard to 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.660
 understand 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.909
 you can feel perfectly and is 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.860
 very well put some drawings 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.930
 or maybe it happened very good 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.280
 it's quality are repeated euros but it's 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.930
 that the quality is very good here we have 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.290
 the drawing 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.460
 for the pages 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.460
 You see they are very good 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.350
 and good also the covers of the 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.350
 original comics 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.310
 first the edition either 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.480
 the passers-by 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.430
 it's super well done now it's very 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.760
 all right 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.409
 and good little more to say 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.069
 I say to those who like flashlight 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:26.680
 green and then come on we like this more 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.079
 comic and those who want to be introduced 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.659
 in the universe of green lantern 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.830
 for me I think that this is the best 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:38.740
 better than you can why 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:41.050
 and all the lenses and 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.740
 it can sit pretty good and good 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.740
 a little more 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:52.310
 so well I do not forget the 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:56.680
 history that trying to create the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.109
 as I said they are 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.540
 the power to serve the dead 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.159
 so then 'green lantern' are 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.709
 counting on that they are reliving 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:08.970
 dead people who were their friends before and who 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.410
 now we can fight against him 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.240
 and mainly goes from that 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.780
 and good tells us more than I do not want 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.230
 unveil 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.600
 In summary, it's worth 32 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.290
 sure but the edition is very good 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.260
 history is good 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.260
 they're good so it's recovered but
