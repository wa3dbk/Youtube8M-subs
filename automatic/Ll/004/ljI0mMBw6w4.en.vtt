00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
how we're going to remove the radio so

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.530 
how we're going to remove the radio so
these<00:00:37.630> keys<00:00:38.020> have<00:00:38.290> this<00:00:38.470> little<00:00:38.680> notch<00:00:38.950> here

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
these keys have this little notch here

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.950 
these keys have this little notch here
so<00:00:40.540> put<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.320> keys<00:00:41.560> not<00:00:41.860> all<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.160> way<00:00:42.190> in<00:00:42.490> but

so put the keys not all the way in but

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.990 
so put the keys not all the way in but
until<00:00:43.960> this<00:00:44.110> notch<00:00:44.410> just<00:00:45.010> a<00:00:45.310> little<00:00:45.580> bit<00:00:45.760> and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
so the locks at the back of the radio

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.830 
so the locks at the back of the radio
unlock<00:00:51.070> and<00:00:51.520> they<00:00:51.910> all<00:00:52.060> have<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.450> be<00:00:52.480> facing

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
unlock and they all have to be facing

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:00.690 
unlock and they all have to be facing
inside<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:56.590> like<00:00:56.860> that<00:00:59.340> so<00:01:00.340> as<00:01:00.430> you<00:01:00.520> can

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
inside and just like that so as you can

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.940 
inside and just like that so as you can
see<00:01:00.940> I've<00:01:01.060> put<00:01:01.330> them<00:01:01.510> in<00:01:01.660> to<00:01:02.080> that<00:01:02.230> notch<00:01:02.560> and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
see I've put them in to that notch and

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.270 
see I've put them in to that notch and
they're<00:01:03.280> all<00:01:03.520> these<00:01:03.910> edges<00:01:04.600> are<00:01:05.280> facing

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
they're all these edges are facing

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.270 
they're all these edges are facing
outside<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.750> we're<00:01:07.900> going<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.110> just<00:01:08.740> take<00:01:09.040> our

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
outside so we're going to just take our

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.230 
outside so we're going to just take our
fingers<00:01:09.670> underneath<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:11.020> get<00:01:11.260> this<00:01:11.440> radio

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
fingers underneath and get this radio

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.630 
fingers underneath and get this radio
and<00:01:13.240> this<00:01:13.390> is<00:01:13.570> a<00:01:13.600> good<00:01:14.050> idea<00:01:14.080> to<00:01:14.740> remove<00:01:15.400> the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
and this is a good idea to remove the

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.180 
and this is a good idea to remove the
keys<00:01:16.360> right<00:01:16.570> now<00:01:16.810> so<00:01:17.260> you<00:01:17.620> don't<00:01:17.800> scratch

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
keys right now so you don't scratch

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.020 
keys right now so you don't scratch
anything<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.040> can<00:01:21.190> see<00:01:21.430> we're<00:01:21.550> also<00:01:21.670> put

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
anything as you can see we're also put

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.660 
anything as you can see we're also put
in<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:22.330> style<00:01:22.660> so<00:01:23.140> when<00:01:23.620> you<00:01:23.740> put<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.370> radio

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
in the style so when you put the radio

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.270 
in the style so when you put the radio
down<00:01:25.470> you're<00:01:26.470> not<00:01:26.620> going<00:01:26.980> to<00:01:27.070> scratch

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
down you're not going to scratch

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.700

connection for the aux cable so we're

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.899 
connection for the aux cable so we're
just<00:03:00.569> going<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:00.959> demonstrate<00:03:01.219> how<00:03:02.219> everything

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
just going to demonstrate how everything

just going to demonstrate how everything
works<00:03:03.120> with<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.480> ipod<00:03:04.199> cable<00:03:04.590> but<00:03:05.579> aux<00:03:05.909> cable

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
works with the ipod cable but aux cable

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.670 
works with the ipod cable but aux cable
is<00:03:06.719> just<00:03:06.959> stuff<00:03:07.230> for<00:03:07.439> volume<00:03:07.859> and<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:10.500> kid

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
is just stuff for volume and the kid

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.229 
is just stuff for volume and the kid
comes<00:03:10.919> with<00:03:11.159> a<00:03:11.250> cable<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:11.699> don't<00:03:11.849> have<00:03:11.939> to<00:03:12.090> buy

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
comes with a cable you don't have to buy

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.789 
comes with a cable you don't have to buy
anything<00:03:12.269> extra<00:03:14.419> she<00:03:15.419> said<00:03:16.109> you<00:03:16.530> have<00:03:16.650> to

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
anything extra she said you have to

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.189 
anything extra she said you have to
screw<00:03:17.099> in<00:03:17.159> the<00:03:17.370> ground<00:03:17.759> not<00:03:18.060> just<00:03:18.329> put<00:03:18.599> in<00:03:18.720> here

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:21.199
