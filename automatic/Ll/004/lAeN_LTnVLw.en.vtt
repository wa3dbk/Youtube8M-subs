maximum transfer speeds or raid 1 if you

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.450 
maximum transfer speeds or raid 1 if you
want<00:00:56.719> more<00:00:56.930> redundancy<00:00:57.469> now<00:00:58.010> of<00:00:58.070> course<00:00:58.219> in

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
want more redundancy now of course in

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.119 
want more redundancy now of course in
raid<00:00:58.640> 0<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:59.210> get<00:00:59.359> 240<00:00:59.989> megabytes<00:01:00.559> per<00:01:00.649> second

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
raid 0 you get 240 megabytes per second

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.700 
raid 0 you get 240 megabytes per second
of<00:01:01.219> transfer<00:01:01.329> speeds<00:01:02.329> let's<00:01:03.050> open<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.559> box

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
of transfer speeds let's open the box

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.340 
of transfer speeds let's open the box
and<00:01:03.920> see<00:01:04.129> what<00:01:04.369> else<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:04.610> get<00:01:04.790> with<00:01:04.909> it

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
and see what else you get with it

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.580 
and see what else you get with it
so<00:01:06.350> opening<00:01:06.680> up<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:06.920> box<00:01:07.130> right<00:01:07.340> here

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.920 

and<00:01:11.189> sliding<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.790> out<00:01:14.780> immediately<00:01:15.780> you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and sliding it out immediately you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.130 
and sliding it out immediately you
noticed<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:17.240> actually<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.450> lot<00:01:18.750> bigger

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
noticed it's actually not a lot bigger

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.580 
noticed it's actually not a lot bigger
than<00:01:19.289> their<00:01:19.710> original<00:01:20.810> durable<00:01:21.810> rugged

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
than their original durable rugged

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.740 
than their original durable rugged
design<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.399> fact<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.360> marginally

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
design in fact it's it's just marginally

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.469 
design in fact it's it's just marginally
taller<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.880> marginally<00:01:26.880> thicker<00:01:27.179> than<00:01:27.450> it

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
taller and marginally thicker than it

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.990 
taller and marginally thicker than it
but<00:01:28.289> again<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.429> thing<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.729> makes<00:01:29.880> it

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
but again the one thing that makes it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.279 
but again the one thing that makes it
super<00:01:30.119> unique<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.810> there's<00:01:30.990> actually

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
super unique is that there's actually

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.679 
super unique is that there's actually
two<00:01:31.560> drives<00:01:32.039> now<00:01:32.520> because<00:01:32.850> drive<00:01:33.179> technology

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
two drives now because drive technology

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.270 
two drives now because drive technology
has<00:01:33.899> advanced<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.530> much<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.920> drives<00:01:35.189> are

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
has advanced so much the drives are

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.919 
has advanced so much the drives are
super<00:01:35.640> thin<00:01:35.850> they<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.509> actually<00:01:36.630> get<00:01:36.869> a

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
super thin they can actually get a

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.120 
super thin they can actually get a
weight<00:01:37.140> which<00:01:37.259> sandwiching<00:01:37.740> two<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.009> them

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
weight which sandwiching two of them

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.770 
weight which sandwiching two of them
inside<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.729> particular<00:01:38.909> enclosure<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
inside this particular enclosure and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.779 
inside this particular enclosure and
there's<00:01:40.140> still<00:01:40.320> enough<00:01:40.560> space<00:01:41.039> inside<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
there's still enough space inside to

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.080 
there's still enough space inside to
give<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:43.049> gear<00:01:43.200> ventilation<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.640> fact<00:01:44.909> it

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
give the gear ventilation in fact it

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.120 
give the gear ventilation in fact it
actually<00:01:45.330> uses<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.170> aluminum<00:01:46.619> surfaces

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
actually uses the the aluminum surfaces

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.669 
actually uses the the aluminum surfaces
as<00:01:47.280> heat<00:01:47.700> sinks<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.539> keep<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> drives<00:01:49.259> nice

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
as heat sinks to keep the drives nice

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.499 
as heat sinks to keep the drives nice
and<00:01:49.860> cool<00:01:50.069> one<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> things<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.420> we

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
and cool one of the things that we

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.899 
and cool one of the things that we
learned<00:01:51.720> at<00:01:52.069> CES<00:01:53.069> was<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.459> fact<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.759> this
