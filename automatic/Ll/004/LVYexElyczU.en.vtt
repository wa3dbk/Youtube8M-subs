00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.379 

I<00:00:44.159> know<00:00:45.159> that<00:00:45.460> I'm<00:00:45.699> closer

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:46.389 
I know that I'm closer

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:49.259 
I know that I'm closer
blended<00:00:47.050> with<00:00:47.260> you<00:00:47.440> this<00:00:47.620> week<00:00:47.920> but<00:00:48.760> I<00:00:49.030> don't

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
blended with you this week but I don't

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:57.259 
blended with you this week but I don't
know<00:00:49.359> why<00:00:49.569> I<00:00:51.510> can't<00:00:52.510> jump<00:00:52.960> higher<00:00:53.170> than<00:00:53.530> this

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.899 

ok<00:00:58.269> cool<00:00:58.539> it's<00:00:58.719> not<00:00:58.870> in<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.350> jump<00:00:59.679> a<00:01:00.309> lot<00:01:00.729> of

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
ok cool it's not in the jump a lot of

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.509 
ok cool it's not in the jump a lot of
people<00:01:01.329> make<00:01:01.510> that<00:01:01.539> confusion<00:01:02.350> of<00:01:02.499> it<00:01:03.249> being

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
people make that confusion of it being

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.460 
people make that confusion of it being
in<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:03.699> jump<00:01:04.089> like<00:01:04.360> I<00:01:04.479> need<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.750> jump<00:01:05.110> higher

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
in the jump like I need to jump higher

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.100 
in the jump like I need to jump higher
it's<00:01:06.460> not<00:01:06.759> necessarily<00:01:07.299> that<00:01:07.329> it's<00:01:07.750> it's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
it's not necessarily that it's it's

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.679 
it's not necessarily that it's it's
getting<00:01:08.439> that<00:01:08.770> board<00:01:09.399> to<00:01:09.700> stick<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.240> your<00:01:10.390> feet

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
getting that board to stick to your feet

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.170 
getting that board to stick to your feet
and<00:01:10.960> doing<00:01:11.619> the<00:01:11.710> proper<00:01:11.979> motions<00:01:12.670> that<00:01:12.969> get

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
and doing the proper motions that get

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.850 
and doing the proper motions that get
the<00:01:13.360> board<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.719> stick<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.170> your<00:01:14.259> feet<00:01:14.560> and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
the board to stick to your feet and

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.490 
the board to stick to your feet and
you're<00:01:15.670> doing<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.000> classic<00:01:16.600> like<00:01:16.869> beginner

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
you're doing the classic like beginner

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.639 
you're doing the classic like beginner
ollie<00:01:17.859> motion<00:01:18.549> of<00:01:18.840> bring<00:01:19.840> your<00:01:20.049> front<00:01:20.289> foot<00:01:20.469> up

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
ollie motion of bring your front foot up

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.370 
ollie motion of bring your front foot up
into<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:21.009> air<00:01:21.250> and<00:01:21.490> then<00:01:21.850> push<00:01:22.149> it<00:01:22.180> down<00:01:22.380> so

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
into the air and then push it down so

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.880 
into the air and then push it down so
that's<00:01:24.159> just<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.990> just<00:01:26.079> not<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.560> way<00:01:26.680> that

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
that's just it's just not the way that

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.819 
that's just it's just not the way that
an<00:01:27.039> ollie<00:01:27.340> works<00:01:27.990> see<00:01:28.990> I<00:01:29.020> make<00:01:29.380> this<00:01:29.530> full

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
an ollie works see I make this full

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.880 
an ollie works see I make this full
length<00:01:30.070> video<00:01:30.250> I<00:01:30.460> think<00:01:30.909> it<00:01:31.060> was<00:01:31.240> called<00:01:32.969> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
length video I think it was called the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.349 
length video I think it was called the
physics<00:01:35.890> of<00:01:36.100> an<00:01:36.250> ollie<00:01:36.520> or<00:01:36.880> something<00:01:37.240> like

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
physics of an ollie or something like

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:40.859 
physics of an ollie or something like
that<00:01:37.420> where<00:01:37.869> I<00:01:37.899> cover<00:01:38.289> the<00:01:39.130> exact<00:01:39.670> thing<00:01:40.119> that

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
that where I cover the exact thing that

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.940 
that where I cover the exact thing that
like<00:01:41.939> physics<00:01:42.960> covers<00:01:43.960> in<00:01:44.289> terms<00:01:44.590> of<00:01:44.770> like

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
like physics covers in terms of like

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.830 
like physics covers in terms of like
where<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.490> put<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.789> force<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.329> how<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.539> drag

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
where to put the force and how to drag

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.870 
where to put the force and how to drag
your<00:01:47.020> foot<00:01:47.200> up<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:47.979> see<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:48.280> motion<00:01:48.579> that

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
your foot up so you see that motion that

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.980 
your foot up so you see that motion that
you're<00:01:48.999> doing<00:01:49.149> with<00:01:49.390> your<00:01:49.420> foot<00:01:49.780> right<00:01:49.960> there

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
you're doing with your foot right there

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.130 
you're doing with your foot right there
you<00:01:50.710> kind<00:01:50.979> of<00:01:51.159> start<00:01:51.759> to<00:01:52.030> do<00:01:52.359> the<00:01:52.570> motion<00:01:52.990> of

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
you kind of start to do the motion of

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.419 
you kind of start to do the motion of
dragging<00:01:53.619> your<00:01:53.710> foot<00:01:53.950> but<00:01:54.159> you're<00:01:54.280> not

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
dragging your foot but you're not

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.039 
dragging your foot but you're not
actually<00:01:54.729> dragging<00:01:55.390> it<00:01:55.539> at<00:01:55.659> all

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
actually dragging it at all

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.770 
actually dragging it at all
cool<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:56.950> practice<00:01:57.369> this<00:01:57.520> right<00:01:57.759> here<00:01:57.969> bend

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
cool so practice this right here bend

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.719 
cool so practice this right here bend
your<00:01:58.960> front<00:01:59.109> knee<00:01:59.259> extend<00:02:00.219> your<00:02:00.340> back<00:02:00.520> knee

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
your front knee extend your back knee

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.120 
your front knee extend your back knee
bend<00:02:01.569> your<00:02:01.749> front<00:02:01.869> knee<00:02:02.020> while<00:02:02.829> extending

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
bend your front knee while extending

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.919 
bend your front knee while extending
your<00:02:03.399> back<00:02:03.579> knee<00:02:03.789> just<00:02:04.030> practice<00:02:04.719> that

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
your back knee just practice that

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.899 
your back knee just practice that
nothing<00:02:05.350> else<00:02:05.499> now<00:02:05.950> when<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.219> show<00:02:06.429> these<00:02:06.609> steps

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
nothing else now when I show these steps

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.760 
nothing else now when I show these steps
I<00:02:07.060> don't<00:02:07.240> I'm<00:02:07.390> not<00:02:07.450> showing<00:02:08.020> this<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.470> show<00:02:08.740> you
