00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.980
 I am that advice 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.060
 very good to all people I am a machine and 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.189
 I bring you a new video of keywords 2 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.410
 this time a video about the use 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.210
 of the clover and the cannon in the maps of 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.460
 Kyle battle and assault in Capricorn 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.839
 respectively I bring you this video 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.309
 to show you a bit what is the 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.710
 operation of these two weapons of 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.839
 siege because he uses because he is 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.489
 convenient to use them and well then more 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:39.050
 or less how to use them in their 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.149
 different maps I hope you like the 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.300
 video that helps you and nothing because we're going 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.300
 there 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.690
 through we access just after leaving 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.520
 our base on the right we have a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.650
 path that goes up towards what is a 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.329
 mountain and we are here on top 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.010
 with the tri woods is simply we give it 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.990
 to the use key and we can start to 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.820
 use it when we started using the train 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.860
 huguet we have three new skills 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.440
 in the action bar the 1 is the turn 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.030
 to the left the 2 is the shot of 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.610
 balls and the 36 the turn to the right 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.850
 in the turns is very important because 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.259
 as there are three bases in the on the map 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.570
 we have to go from one to the other 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.460
 according to the need of our team 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.590
 The tri searches is a siege weapon that 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.479
 will do a lot of damage and that we 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.950
 it serves a lot to offer support to 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.750
 team members that are catching 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.490
 the bases 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.380
 The first thing I recommend is 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.610
 start throwing balls towards the middle and 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.740
 that the base of the medium is going to be the one that goes 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.180
 to be more disputed at the beginning the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.150
 first ball that we throw to the middle we 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.440
 will serve to open a hole in the wall and 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.729
 Once the hole is open, we can 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.540
 start throwing all the things that 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.540
 we want towards the middle 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.119
 to accept the balls to the base of the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.280
 we will have to fill the bar 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.960
 up to about half there's always 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.880
 a small margin if we fill it a 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.010
 little less than half, we will make them 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.750
 the ball a little closer to us but 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.360
 more or less in half always for 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.520
 that the ball enters what is the base 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.700
 that for the game that we have opened the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.680
 wall 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.360
 once we have managed to get the 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.010
 base of the medium offering support to 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.660
 our allies simply because 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.129
 we'll have to look where they're going 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.470
 the enemies towards what is going to be and 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.540
 start throwing balls to continue to go 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.430
 doing all the support we can if 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.080
 we get to the base with the 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.780
 balls and we started doing a lot of 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.769
 hurt our allies that are there 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.620
 defending or attacking a base they will 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.300
 have super simple to get up 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.010
 towards the base that you are seeing now 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.019
 which I think is maxion to get to 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.269
 mansion we have to fill the bar a 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.880
 little more than half without passing us if we 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.599
 we spend a lot we will arrive we will leave 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.640
 of the map or we will arrive until the 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.640
 house that is there we will not hurt 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.940
 so if you notice it is half not a 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.110
 little bit more if you do between half is 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.549
 more or less between the middle and the end 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.049
 then there is always that margin if you 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.209
 you pass a little bit because you will get further 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.040
 and if you leave it a little short then the 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.630
 ball will not go that far but at 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.310
 better the enemies are not so in the background 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.440
 then depending on where the 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.190
 enemies you are calculating where you have 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.890
 what to throw 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.370
 and finally the third base the mill 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.790
 well the bar margin that we have to 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.060
 fill to get to the base is 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.409
 between the end and a little less if I 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.140
 I think if I got to the end with 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.659
 the navarra if you arrive completely 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.459
 bar you are going to go and you are going to give then 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.459
 the house is there are not going to give 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.930
 nobody then you have to calculate then 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.489
 well almost to the end here you are 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.470
 seeing what course the video has put 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.390
 so you can see perfectly more or less 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.629
 up to where you have to fill the 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.489
 Barda is almost to the end but without 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.230
 reach this final has no more and as 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.079
 always because we have a small margin 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.590
 if we leave the bar a little smaller 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.420
 we will get less far and if the 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.489
 queen we have put up where we 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.470
 they wanted to fill it up a little bit more 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.599
 flows depending on where we see that 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.459
 are the enemies normally as the 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.230
 enemies are always in the middle of the 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.060
 base and our allies also for 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.430
 take the base that is when you're in 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.319
 the square delimited thanks to 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.790
 square that delimits the base then there 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.889
 is when you are defending or taking 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.410
 the base if you're outside is not as if what 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.690
 you were there and then then always 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.260
 try to calculate that someone falls 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.630
 medium 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.250
 besides, it is not always necessary that 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.870
 shoot towards the bases especially 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.480
 when there are battles for example that you see 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.330
 here if we are not fighting any basis 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.920
 We can always support if they are very 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.130
 we will not close our reach as 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.040
 The product has a range one rank 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.990
 minimum but to almost the entire map we are going to 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.380
 can access with the balls then 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.760
 whenever we see that there are then 73 of 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.650
 our team against three of the other in 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.420
 some area that is not a base of other 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.150
 ways we can even throwing a 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.370
 ball with a ball we already do a lot 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.410
 of help we help a lot because the 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.360
 ball will remove then between half a 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.490
 little more of the lives of the enemies and 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.860
 with it because our allies me 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.639
 little with a little bit of piety that they have 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.680
 they can easily download 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.199
 finally tell you that the three sets 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.999
 Obviously they are objects that can be 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.400
 destroy can destroy us our 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:20.080
 trichet and we can destroy the 7 enemy 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.349
 so good if they destroy our 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.999
 trebuchet what I always do is go 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.789
 Quickly for the repair kit 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:29.979
 if I see that one comes towards me as you see 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.409
 here although if one comes to me a 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.439
 enemy only then I try always 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:39.300
 kill him and try to eliminate him and 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:41.529
 reuse the tribute if two come and 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.300
 I do not think twice I go out 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:45.250
 of the tribes the step of them and I go 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.930
 running towards the repair kit the 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.550
 time they are going to be destroying 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.080
 between widget to and it gives me time to catch 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.759
 the repair kit and go living in 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.340
 four destroy they will leave and I will 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:57.400
 he arrived and in a second he deals 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.979
 then he has lost two players 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.060
 two players have lost time 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:04.750
 destroying the set tribe so that I 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.520
 arrive followed and repair it 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.560
 bear in mind also that depending 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.330
 at the base that we are the distance to 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.310
 the lateral bases will be different 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.050
 from the tribe that is blue the 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.330
 distance to mill is the same as 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.060
 from the red tribute the distance to 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.320
 mansion in the same way the distance 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.060
 between the tribe that is blue to this 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.560
 mansion is the same distance that is from 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.560
 between like the red until mill 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.419
 and nothing people I hope you liked 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.599
 this video will soon bring you the second 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:36.789
 part on the map canyon assault to 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:38.889
 Capricorn that also has some 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:40.960
 tricks and some useful things that 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:44.050
 You can not know and that you can 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.669
 teach and I will also bring you then the 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.469
 tricks of the other two maps in the 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.539
 you have to kill balls in one 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:51.789
 enemy and the other two come out 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:53.169
 voices as you know and give points and good 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:54.939
 I will explain more or less what is 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:56.590
 can do what I do not recommend what 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:58.060
 that I have discovered and what more or 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.620
 least I recommend is the only thing
