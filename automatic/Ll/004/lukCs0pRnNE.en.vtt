00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
through and your average listener

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.300 
through and your average listener
doesn't<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.490> any<00:02:02.610> clue<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.590> it's<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.860> G<00:02:05.130> C

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310

doesn't have any clue that it's just G C
and<00:02:05.490> D<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:05.939> there's<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> real<00:02:06.180> kind<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.740> a

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
and D so there's a real kind of a

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.319 
and D so there's a real kind of a
confidence-building<00:02:08.729> thing<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.090> being<00:02:09.179> able

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:09.329 
confidence-building thing of being able

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.410 
confidence-building thing of being able
to<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.539> bang<00:02:10.440> out<00:02:10.590> some<00:02:10.649> tunes<00:02:11.100> you<00:02:12.030> know<00:02:12.150> at

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
to just bang out some tunes you know at

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.910 
to just bang out some tunes you know at
all<00:02:12.720> levels<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.350> I<00:02:13.440> think<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.709> was<00:02:13.799> one<00:02:13.890> of

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
all levels and I think that was one of

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.710 
all levels and I think that was one of
the<00:02:14.010> big<00:02:14.100> things<00:02:14.130> were<00:02:14.940> my<00:02:15.060> mother<00:02:15.269> when<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.660> was

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
the big things were my mother when I was

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.240 
the big things were my mother when I was
playing<00:02:16.049> would<00:02:16.410> say<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.650> know<00:02:16.799> play<00:02:17.100> us<00:02:17.220> a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
playing would say you know play us a

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.009 
playing would say you know play us a
tune<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.549> not<00:02:17.850> like<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> play<00:02:18.239> was<00:02:18.450> like<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
tune and not like a play was like the

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.449 
tune and not like a play was like the
rift<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.320> crazy<00:02:19.560> train<00:02:19.890> or<00:02:20.100> something<00:02:20.220> like

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
rift a crazy train or something like

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.990 
rift a crazy train or something like
that<00:02:20.519> or<00:02:20.910> pieces<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.079> solo<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:23.000> that's

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000
