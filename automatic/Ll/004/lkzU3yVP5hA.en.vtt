we literally put the the key in there

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.880 
we literally put the the key in there
and<00:01:11.340> locate<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.850> into<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.350> tiny<00:01:13.350> little<00:01:13.560> screw

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and locate it into the tiny little screw

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.440 
and locate it into the tiny little screw
inside<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.850> might<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.180> wiggle<00:01:15.299> it

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
inside you might have to wiggle it

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.359 
inside you might have to wiggle it
around<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.750> bit<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.110> locate<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.860> then

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
around a bit just to locate it and then

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.149 
around a bit just to locate it and then
we<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.610> unwind<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.119> screw<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.830> point

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
we just unwind that screw to a point

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.469 
we just unwind that screw to a point
where<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:21.210> becomes<00:01:21.540> loose<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.360> may

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
where it it becomes loose and you may

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.060 
where it it becomes loose and you may
need<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.110> stages<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.590> these

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
need to do this in stages and these

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.469 
need to do this in stages and these
these<00:01:26.340> are<00:01:26.520> done<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.060> security

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
these are done like this for security

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.450 
these are done like this for security
reasons<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.049> stop<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.650> kids<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.130> people

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
reasons to stop the kids and people

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.609 
reasons to stop the kids and people
tampering<00:01:30.000> with<00:01:30.150> these<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.259> unwind

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
tampering with these so we just unwind

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.929 
tampering with these so we just unwind
these<00:01:34.310> now<00:01:35.310> these<00:01:35.549> are<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.360> slotted<00:01:37.140> fixing

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
these now these are on a slotted fixing

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.600 
these now these are on a slotted fixing
so<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.150> don't<00:01:39.329> need<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.509> take<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.799> screws

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
so we don't need to take the screws

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.609 
so we don't need to take the screws
right<00:01:41.880> out<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.140> not<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> problem

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
right out but you can it's not a problem

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.230 
right out but you can it's not a problem
if<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.799> do<00:01:43.920> take<00:01:44.130> them<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.490> out<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:48.060> let's

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
if you do take them right out and let's

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.020 
if you do take them right out and let's
screw<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.530> see<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.579> lifts

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
screw that and you can see it just lifts

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.789 
screw that and you can see it just lifts
off<00:01:51.149> now<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.110> look<00:01:52.200> at<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> back<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.710> this

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
off now if we look at the back of this

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.889 
off now if we look at the back of this
switch<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:54.030> see<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.630> there's<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
switch you can see here that there's a

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.560 
switch you can see here that there's a
slot<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> bottom<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.759> keyhole<00:01:57.180> fixing

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
slot in the bottom and a keyhole fixing

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.410 
slot in the bottom and a keyhole fixing
in<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> top<00:01:57.990> okay<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.369> that<00:02:00.060> literally

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
in the top okay so it that literally

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.139 
in the top okay so it that literally
drops<00:02:00.899> onto<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.290> bottom<00:02:01.530> screw<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.820> if

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
drops onto that bottom screw and and if

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.490 
drops onto that bottom screw and and if
you<00:02:03.270> wiggle<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.570> around<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.960> will<00:02:04.049> drop<00:02:04.229> onto

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
you wiggle it around it will drop onto

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.350 
you wiggle it around it will drop onto
that<00:02:04.590> keyhole<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.670> will<00:02:05.759> drop<00:02:05.939> back<00:02:06.090> into

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that keyhole and it will drop back into

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.919 
that keyhole and it will drop back into
position<00:02:06.479> okay<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:08.099> can<00:02:08.250> let<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.520> dangle

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
position okay so you can let this dangle

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.710 
position okay so you can let this dangle
on<00:02:09.929> from<00:02:10.410> from<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> box<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.970> hang<00:02:12.180> if

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
on from from the box and just hang if

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.570 
on from from the box and just hang if
you<00:02:12.870> look<00:02:13.020> inside<00:02:14.690> inside<00:02:15.690> here<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.980> 9-volt

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
you look inside inside here is a 9-volt

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.190 
you look inside inside here is a 9-volt
battery<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.360> like<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.599> one<00:02:18.720> you'd<00:02:18.900> see<00:02:19.080> in

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
battery just like the one you'd see in

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.320 
battery just like the one you'd see in
your<00:02:19.349> fire<00:02:19.680> alarm<00:02:19.800> at<00:02:20.069> home<00:02:20.250> or<00:02:20.760> your<00:02:21.060> smoke

the<00:02:23.670> battery<00:02:23.790> give<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.780> wiggle<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.650> I

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
the battery give it a wiggle and I

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.869 
the battery give it a wiggle and I
suggest<00:02:26.040> what<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.220> do<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.400> hold<00:02:26.550> on<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.730> the

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
suggest what you do is hold on to the

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.880 
suggest what you do is hold on to the
wires<00:02:27.090> at<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.569> point<00:02:27.870> because<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.620> will<00:02:28.709> stop

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
wires at this point because it will stop

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.410 
wires at this point because it will stop
the<00:02:29.010> why's<00:02:29.160> becoming<00:02:29.580> disconnected<00:02:29.849> inside

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
the why's becoming disconnected inside

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.740 
the why's becoming disconnected inside
just<00:02:31.140> give<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.530> connector<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> wiggle<00:02:32.370> and

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
just give the connector a wiggle and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.259 
just give the connector a wiggle and
pull<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.840> apart<00:02:34.040> okay<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.280> discard<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.120> and

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
pull it apart okay and discard that and

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.910 
pull it apart okay and discard that and
dispose<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:36.870> recycle<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.379> in<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.830> a

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
dispose of it and recycle it in in a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.449 
dispose of it and recycle it in in a
proper<00:02:38.160> way

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
proper way

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.270 
proper way
replace<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.390> with<00:02:39.720> your<00:02:39.750> new<00:02:40.080> battery<00:02:40.620> just

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
replace it with your new battery just

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.699 
replace it with your new battery just
plug<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.580> back<00:02:41.700> on<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:43.140> that's<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:43.500> it's<00:02:43.620> as

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
plug it back on and that's it it's as

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:44.390 
plug it back on and that's it it's as
simple<00:02:43.800> as<00:02:44.010> that

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
simple as that

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.070 
simple as that
and<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.030> can<00:02:45.180> tuck<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.450> back<00:02:45.569> inside<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.959> box

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
and you can tuck it back inside the box

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.309 
and you can tuck it back inside the box
and<00:02:46.610> then<00:02:47.610> it's<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.209> reverse<00:02:48.480> procedure<00:02:48.690> to

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
and then it's the reverse procedure to

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.619 
and then it's the reverse procedure to
refit<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.400> plate<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:50.970> we're<00:02:51.300> going<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.450> drop

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
refit the plate so we're going to drop

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.170 
refit the plate so we're going to drop
this<00:02:51.830> bottom<00:02:52.830> slot<00:02:53.099> on<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.489> this<00:02:53.580> bottom<00:02:53.910> screw

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
this bottom slot on to this bottom screw

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.600 
this bottom slot on to this bottom screw
here<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.660> then<00:02:55.650> we're<00:02:55.769> going<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.920> drop<00:02:56.310> the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
here and then we're going to drop the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.729 
here and then we're going to drop the
the<00:02:57.269> other<00:02:57.420> screw<00:02:57.750> will<00:02:57.959> locate<00:02:58.319> into<00:02:58.620> this

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
the other screw will locate into this

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.009 
the other screw will locate into this
key<00:02:58.920> hole<00:02:59.159> and<00:02:59.430> then<00:02:59.879> we<00:02:59.970> can<00:03:00.150> wheel<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.720> about

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
key hole and then we can wheel it about

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.479 
key hole and then we can wheel it about
a<00:03:01.050> little<00:03:01.349> so<00:03:01.680> just<00:03:01.920> drop<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.159> in<00:03:02.220> like<00:03:02.340> that

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
a little so just drop it in like that

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.300 
a little so just drop it in like that
and<00:03:02.750> there<00:03:03.750> we<00:03:03.810> go<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.200> let's<00:03:04.379> relocate<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:05.099> and

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
and there we go so let's relocate it and

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.940 
and there we go so let's relocate it and
then<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.760> take<00:03:05.940> your<00:03:06.090> allen<00:03:06.209> key<00:03:06.420> again<00:03:06.720> and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
then you take your allen key again and

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.000 
then you take your allen key again and
you<00:03:07.950> just<00:03:08.129> tighten<00:03:08.280> up<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:09.409> the<00:03:10.409> screws<00:03:10.769> in

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
you just tighten up the the screws in

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.339 
you just tighten up the the screws in
the<00:03:11.580> reverse<00:03:11.879> way<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.840> we<00:03:12.900> took<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.200> thing

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
the reverse way that we took the thing

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.680 
the reverse way that we took the thing
off<00:03:13.470> in<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.650> first<00:03:13.860> place<00:03:13.950> okay<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:15.420> that's

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
off in the first place okay so that's

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.809 
off in the first place okay so that's
how<00:03:15.810> we<00:03:15.870> change<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.290> battery<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.519> obviously

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
how we change the battery and obviously

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.000 
how we change the battery and obviously
what<00:03:18.659> you<00:03:18.750> can<00:03:18.930> do<00:03:19.080> before<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.560> put<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.800> plate

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
what you can do before you put the plate

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.509 
what you can do before you put the plate
on<00:03:20.220> if<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.970> push<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.720> switch<00:03:22.099> you<00:03:23.099> can<00:03:23.280> test

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
on if you push the switch you can test

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.949 
on if you push the switch you can test
it<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.819> make<00:03:23.849> sure<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.300> it's<00:03:24.450> actually

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
it to make sure that it's actually

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.470 
it to make sure that it's actually
triggering<00:03:25.349> your<00:03:25.470> doors<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.769> open<00:03:26.360> just<00:03:27.360> in

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
triggering your doors to open just in

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.140 
triggering your doors to open just in
case<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:28.470> wasn't<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.159> was<00:03:29.640> not

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
case it wasn't that that was not

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.399 
case it wasn't that that was not
functioning<00:03:30.659> properly<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:31.049> can<00:03:31.170> tighten

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
functioning properly you can tighten

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:32.990 
functioning properly you can tighten
those<00:03:31.500> screws<00:03:31.650> right<00:03:32.010> up<00:03:32.220> don't<00:03:32.730> need<00:03:32.909> to

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
those screws right up don't need to

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.910 
those screws right up don't need to
tighten<00:03:33.239> them<00:03:33.360> up<00:03:33.420> cover<00:03:33.659> the<00:03:34.470> false<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.830> a
