it's very easy you just kind of break up
the<00:01:24.119> soil<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:26.280> gets<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.610> little<00:01:26.790> bit<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.060> air

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
the soil so it gets a little bit of air

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.359 
the soil so it gets a little bit of air
gets<00:01:27.780> turned<00:01:28.080> over<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.530> tilled<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.040> mixed<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
gets turned over and tilled and mixed a

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.450 
gets turned over and tilled and mixed a
little<00:01:29.490> bit<00:01:30.110> that's<00:01:31.110> very<00:01:31.470> simple<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.070> then

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
little bit that's very simple and then

right off and nobody will ever notice

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.730 
right off and nobody will ever notice
him<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:09.330> you'll<00:02:09.480> never<00:02:09.660> see<00:02:09.960> him<00:02:10.140> because

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
him and you'll never see him because

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.320 
him and you'll never see him because
this<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.100> her<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.430> know<00:02:11.550> eyes<00:02:11.670> where

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
this is her you know eyes where

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.820 
this is her you know eyes where
underneath<00:02:12.660> now<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.320> nobody<00:02:13.560> can<00:02:13.710> even

underneath now and nobody can even
really<00:02:14.160> see<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.610> except<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.620> that's

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
really see this except you and that's

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.590 
really see this except you and that's
where<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.340> prune<00:02:17.640> from<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.120> prune<00:02:18.390> from

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
where you prune from you prune from

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.050 
where you prune from you prune from
underneath<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.980> don't<00:02:20.160> prune<00:02:20.430> from<00:02:20.670> above

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
underneath you don't prune from above

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.000 
underneath you don't prune from above
with<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.570> Japanese<00:02:22.080> maple<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.530> that's<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.830> one

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
with a Japanese maple and that's the one

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.110 
with a Japanese maple and that's the one
big<00:02:23.190> distinction<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:25.350> lot<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.710> people

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
big distinction that a lot of people

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.060 
big distinction that a lot of people
make<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.240> mistake<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.470> can<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:29.040> can

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
make the mistake of and you can you can

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.790 
make the mistake of and you can you can
prove<00:02:29.580> from<00:02:29.820> above<00:02:30.120> but<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.990> really<00:02:31.560> see

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
prove from above but you really see

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.240 
prove from above but you really see
what's<00:02:32.010> going<00:02:32.070> on<00:02:32.460> from<00:02:32.790> from<00:02:33.090> beneath<00:02:33.390> so

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
what's going on from from beneath so

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.340 
what's going on from from beneath so
whenever<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.520> see<00:02:35.990> whenever<00:02:36.990> you<00:02:37.170> see<00:02:37.320> a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
whenever you see whenever you see a

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.200 
whenever you see whenever you see a
branch<00:02:37.590> like<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.370> has<00:02:38.490> no<00:02:38.670> no<00:02:38.940> growth

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
branch like that that has no no growth

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.990 
branch like that that has no no growth
on<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:41.010> may<00:02:41.190> want<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.430> cut<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.790> because

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
on it you may want to cut it because

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.400 
on it you may want to cut it because
it's<00:02:42.150> not<00:02:42.360> doing<00:02:42.660> anybody<00:02:42.870> any<00:02:43.080> good<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:45.410> and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
it's not doing anybody any good and and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.199 
it's not doing anybody any good and and
that<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:47.400> energy<00:02:47.430> can<00:02:48.120> go<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.300> new<00:02:48.630> growth

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
that that energy can go to new growth

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.580 
that that energy can go to new growth
let's<00:02:51.209> say<00:02:51.390> yeah<00:02:51.510> anytime<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:52.050> see<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.290> branch

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
let's say yeah anytime you see a branch

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.520 
let's say yeah anytime you see a branch
without<00:02:52.920> any<00:02:53.280> foliage<00:02:53.959> just<00:02:54.959> snip<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.380> right

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
without any foliage just snip it right

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.070
