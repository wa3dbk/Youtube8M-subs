okay<00:00:00.299> now<00:00:01.129> we<00:00:02.129> will<00:00:02.280> do<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.939> water<00:00:03.300> testing<00:00:05.240> we

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
okay now we will do the water testing we

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.509 
okay now we will do the water testing we
need<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.509> take<00:00:06.830> two<00:00:08.540> glasses<00:00:09.540> this<00:00:10.290> way<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.800> in

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
need to take two glasses this way and in

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.299 
need to take two glasses this way and in
one<00:00:11.759> we<00:00:12.090> fill<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.509> boring<00:00:12.809> water<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.160> is

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
one we fill the boring water so this is

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.620 
one we fill the boring water so this is
the<00:00:14.429> tap<00:00:14.809> from<00:00:15.809> here<00:00:16.109> we<00:00:16.230> take<00:00:16.410> boring<00:00:17.010> water

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
the tap from here we take boring water

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:30.380 
the tap from here we take boring water
75%<00:00:18.630> age<00:00:19.640> not<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.789> full<00:00:23.810> 75%<00:00:24.810> age<00:00:29.090> so<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.269> is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
75% age not in full 75% age so this is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.650 
75% age not in full 75% age so this is
the<00:00:30.480> boring<00:00:30.779> water<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.910> we<00:00:32.910> take<00:00:33.120> purified

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
the boring water and we take purified

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.580 
the boring water and we take purified
water<00:00:33.899> from<00:00:34.800> our<00:00:34.980> water<00:00:35.700> purifier<00:00:36.380> in<00:00:37.380> your

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
water from our water purifier in your

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:47.319 
water from our water purifier in your
few<00:00:37.890> fires<00:00:38.160> which<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.579> 75%<00:00:39.149> again<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:40.110> know<00:00:44.750> so

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
few fires which is 75% again you know so

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.709 
few fires which is 75% again you know so
this<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.510> raw<00:00:49.200> water<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.820> purified

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
this is raw water and this is purified

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:00.069 
this is raw water and this is purified
water<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:53.090> we<00:00:54.090> will<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.570> testing<00:00:54.989> here

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.170 

put<00:01:01.079> these<00:01:01.230> two<00:01:01.469> glasses<00:01:04.460> no<00:01:05.460> water<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
put these two glasses no water and

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.530 
put these two glasses no water and
boring<00:01:06.689> water<00:01:07.850> pouring<00:01:08.850> water<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
boring water pouring water and the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.910 
boring water pouring water and the
purified<00:01:09.960> water<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.470> will<00:01:10.560> put<00:01:10.710> these<00:01:10.860> two

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
purified water we will put these two

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.120 
purified water we will put these two
glasses<00:01:11.310> here

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
glasses here

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.969 
glasses here
and<00:01:14.600> we<00:01:15.600> will<00:01:15.750> take<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.729> electrolyzer

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
and we will take the electrolyzer

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.320 
and we will take the electrolyzer
you<00:01:19.979> put<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.520> way<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:23.250> turn<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
you put it in that way and we turn the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.710 
you put it in that way and we turn the
switch<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:28.189> what<00:01:29.189> switch<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.540> we

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
switch on and what switch is on then we

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.499 
switch on and what switch is on then we
can<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:31.229> how<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.710> water<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:33.030> getting<00:01:33.590> changed

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
can see how the water is getting changed

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.140 
can see how the water is getting changed
so<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.049> impurities<00:01:37.729> we<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.939> lightly<00:01:39.770> say<00:01:41.150> so

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
so the impurities we can lightly say so

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.639 
so the impurities we can lightly say so
on<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.540> left-hand<00:01:43.140> side<00:01:43.259> glass<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:45.649> boring

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
on the left-hand side glass is boring

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.130 
on the left-hand side glass is boring
water<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.930> right-hand<00:01:49.320> glass<00:01:49.560> is

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
water and the right-hand glass is

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.920 
water and the right-hand glass is
purified<00:01:52.140> water<00:01:52.590> from<00:01:53.399> water<00:01:53.610> purifier<00:01:54.119> nyoro

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
purified water from water purifier nyoro

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.660 
purified water from water purifier nyoro
purifiers<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:57.000> these<00:01:57.270> two<00:01:57.509> classes<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:58.170> can

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
purifiers so these two classes we can

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.149 
purifiers so these two classes we can
lively<00:01:59.670> see<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.290> bottom<00:02:01.469> also<00:02:01.890> we<00:02:02.009> can

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
lively see and in the bottom also we can

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.420 
lively see and in the bottom also we can
see<00:02:02.369> all<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.729> impurities<00:02:04.009> like<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.189> we<00:02:05.310> have

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
see all the impurities like this we have

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.600 
see all the impurities like this we have
to<00:02:05.549> do<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.939> testing<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.630> 40<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.110> 45

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
to do this testing for 40 to 45

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.540 
to do this testing for 40 to 45
seconds<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:09.140> then<00:02:09.619> we<00:02:09.800> have<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.039> turn<00:02:10.280> the

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
seconds and then we have to turn the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.460 
seconds and then we have to turn the
switch<00:02:11.420> off<00:02:12.160> then<00:02:13.160> here<00:02:13.550> we<00:02:14.180> can<00:02:14.390> see<00:02:15.310> the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
switch off then here we can see the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.210 
switch off then here we can see the
bacteria<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.410> pouring<00:02:22.040> water

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
bacteria this is a pouring water

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.120 
bacteria this is a pouring water
bacteria<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.600> same<00:02:23.840> water<00:02:24.140> we<00:02:24.500> are<00:02:24.530> purifying

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
bacteria the same water we are purifying

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.930 
bacteria the same water we are purifying
it<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.900> water<00:02:27.110> is<00:02:27.290> getting<00:02:27.440> changed<00:02:30.940> this

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
it and the water is getting changed this

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.140 
it and the water is getting changed this
way<00:02:32.210> and<00:02:32.450> there<00:02:32.600> is<00:02:32.660> no<00:02:33.820> impurities<00:02:34.820> in<00:02:35.000> this

way and there is no impurities in this

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.710 
way and there is no impurities in this
water<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:36.200> directly<00:02:36.770> we<00:02:36.950> can<00:02:36.980> drink<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:38.540> also

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
water and directly we can drink and also

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.070 
water and directly we can drink and also
we<00:02:39.230> have<00:02:39.440> another<00:02:39.980> testing<00:02:40.550> called<00:02:40.760> TDS<00:02:41.720> total

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
we have another testing called TDS total

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.400 
we have another testing called TDS total
dissolved<00:02:42.410> solids<00:02:42.670> we<00:02:43.670> can<00:02:43.820> also<00:02:43.970> check<00:02:44.410> with

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
dissolved solids we can also check with

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.370 
dissolved solids we can also check with
that<00:02:45.620> meter<00:02:45.920> also<00:02:46.160> TDS<00:02:46.850> meter<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:48.110> this<00:02:48.260> is

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
that meter also TDS meter so this is

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.970
