00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
blue and I've got to see that is the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.380

closest<00:01:22.950> goal<00:01:23.220> line<00:01:23.369> technology<00:01:23.610> thing<00:01:24.240> I've

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
closest goal line technology thing I've

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.499 
closest goal line technology thing I've
seen<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.869> far<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.860> literally<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:27.270> about

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
seen so far that is literally it's about

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.200 
seen so far that is literally it's about
an<00:01:27.840> inch<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.890> that's<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.490> millimeters

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
an inch in that that's just millimeters

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.780 
an inch in that that's just millimeters
but<00:01:30.390> overall<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:31.350> did<00:01:31.590> lose<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.430> that

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
but overall we did lose because of that

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.719 
but overall we did lose because of that
decision<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:34.350> go<00:01:34.619> up<00:01:34.799> against<00:01:35.250> our<00:01:35.369> next

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
decision so we go up against our next

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.910 
decision so we go up against our next
opponent<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.960> wasn't<00:01:37.170> looking<00:01:37.530> forward<00:01:37.799> to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
opponent and I wasn't looking forward to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.460 
opponent and I wasn't looking forward to
