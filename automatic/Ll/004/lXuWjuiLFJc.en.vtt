00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 salute you brave warriors in 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.440
 this video we will show you how 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.150
 create an army and which ones use in 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.910
 empire attacks online 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.800
 war game from this good you are a warrior 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.000
 whether or not the implementation of your plans depends 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.760
 making saves strong and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.460
 high-quality armies will protect you 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.300
 empire against enemies and help win 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.390
 resources adviser in the game showed you how 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.430
 attack an independent province now 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.520
 we will show you how to extract the maximum 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.530
 the benefit of attacking the first thing you 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.540
 should know this is what independent 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.000
 provinces guarded by serfs 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.180
 garrison that will fight with 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.070
 army striker so it would be good 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.629
 know against which army you will 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.039
 fight your spies will help you with this 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.410
 if you called back the spy when 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.870
 advisors can then use it to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.780
 introduction to another independent province 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:08.460
 and if you didnâ€™t recall him, you can 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:12.409
 do it now just select 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.409
 province and send a spy there 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.270
 we can consider a spy report 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.670
 which shows us what time u 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.490
 enemy nomad and that terrain 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.829
 Provinces mountainous highlands gives 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.500
 bonus to life points of the fortress wall 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.869
 here we see the level of the enemy's fortress 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.320
 days stored resources that can 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.500
 pick up 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.720
 and here is the army in the garrison with 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.549
 which we will fight right over 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.360
 garrison is protective 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.909
 facilities 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.610
 if they exist in the province of steam 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.679
 make an offensive let's do it with 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.350
 using the simulator built into the game and 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:55.500
 for battles in this screen click on 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.990
 link will fight as attacking it 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.450
 action will automatically download all your 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.439
 army as an attacker but a garrison 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.229
 adversary 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.140
 boot as a defender now click 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.429
 on the siege fortress button and system 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.459
 will do battle 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.519
 class him on the link report and look 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.730
 the results in this simulation is your army 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.609
 loses the archers of the enemy and and destroys 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.739
 before she destroys the walls of the fortress 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:25.049
 what to do of course you need to hire 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.209
 more soldiers who can attack 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:30.209
 fortress and destroy it faster 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.819
 these units can be either swordsmen or 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.769
 ram and it's always a good idea to add 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.290
 and archers who will fire 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.040
 enemy garrison during the siege 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.569
 fortresses all of them can be hired in the barracks 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:48.920
 swordsmen in the infantry barracks 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.920
 and rams you one workshop 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.910
 Both options are suitable for successful 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.410
 serfs asad a whole swordsmen cheap them 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.750
 can hire large quantities 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.389
 the sides are more expensive but they are more effective against 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.819
 fortress walls you might lose 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:12.239
 greater swordsmen than rams during 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.910
 siege you decide continue to hire 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.389
 soldier and conduct a battle simulation while 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.549
 results will not satisfy you not 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.860
 forget that simulations always give 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.409
 approximate result and check 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.630
 him two and three times after some 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.850
 time 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.950
 you will build a strong enough army for 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.760
 conducting fortress sieges with 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.370
 minimal 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.920
 or not at any cost always 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.440
 check enough with you 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.230
 military to win simulation with 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.780
 the result of moral more than 50 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.460
 are you ready to send your army against 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.920
 independent provinces 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.440
 not quite your soldiers have 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.440
 certain payload but she 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.360
 usually limited and therefore they always 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.060
 will leave behind not 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.760
 looted and resources if you want to 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.630
 you had the maximum profit you 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.220
 there must be carts 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.620
 heavy payload 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.230
 so it would always be nice to have her 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.200
 in plenty to rob all the resources from 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.870
 provinces in one mission when you have 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.690
 enough combat-ready military units and 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.640
 carts can send your army 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.260
 to land an independent province and 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.230
 plunder her resources 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.660
 do the last simulation in order 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:42.380
 to be confident as a result of the battle 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:44.260
 and select the province you want 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.330
 attack on the imperial map 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:52.220
 select an attack from a specific menu 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:57.680
 as well as the soldiers you want to send 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:01.220
 in the mission of class on the attack button 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.800
 and hike will start can choose 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.820
 shortening the path of the army which will 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.820
 cost 1 diamond 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.480
 recovery successfully besieged independent 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.920
 the province and crushed all its resources 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.470
 after the mission you will receive a report on 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.810
 returning your soldiers to the province from 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.900
 where they were sent and to which 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.390
 unloaded looted and resources 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.580
 directly to the fortress 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:34.580
 so you can attack each of 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.529
 independent provinces 10 times so far 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.509
 resources in them will not completely end 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:42.569
 so tutorial about attack independent 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:45.529
 provinces ends in strength and honor 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:45.529
 valiant warriors
