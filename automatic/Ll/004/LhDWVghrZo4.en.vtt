00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.190
 hello we are at ifa 2014 and you 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.589
 be in mobile gigs in the case 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.959
 for once presented by asus 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.150
 and mercedes benz so the boys of 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:19.270
 mercedes and what we have here is that 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.070
 toshiba mini that's the new 7 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.750
 inch tablet from toshiba what's up 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.370
 the computex so little rum haunted 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.740
 and now in the near future 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.470
 The trade is a new tablet 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.660
 With windows 8.1 means so here 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.449
 the bing version runs and costs in 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.339
 germany to start 199 euro comes 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.679
 then on the one hand in white and in one 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.329
 purple version that over one 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.010
 particular dealer is offered the 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.870
 not yet known to us 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.850
 Anyway, none of them could be next door 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.039
 known to major online merchants 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.589
 but somebody also officially 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:53.229
 has a bit and especially online 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.510
 is active comes to the hardware of the device 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.530
 we have a 7 inch display here 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.170
 Interestingly, a TN panel man 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.489
 So that sees the perspective yes everything 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.229
 other than optimal 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.420
 the brightness also leaves plenty 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.219
 to be desired as our video here 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.689
 already shows, but then it is 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:09.130
 a bit better than the camera now 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.200
 can give back but outdoors 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.320
 the device will not be that fun 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.189
 Anyway, here we have 1024 x 600 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.289
 pixeln clock 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.700
 So it is unfortunately in comparison 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.130
 to the pre-series device of the computex 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.780
 nothing done here now 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.880
 So you're not up to 2 480 x 800 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.140
 gone but just stay with bse vga 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.430
 is such a thing 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.719
 they should be sure again 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.380
 Consider if that's really such a good one 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.240
 idea was 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.340
 because it is here among others the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.020
 content of windows 8 scales therefore 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.460
 is so by software over the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.159
 Driver made sure that the whole 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.299
 take care here 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.859
 that helps the picture quality then 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.560
 Of course not 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.950
 performance quite well 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.569
 we have an internet chat 37 35 here 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.380
 So this is the moment version with 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:54.929
 1.33 gigahertz which switches to 1 83 ghz 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.390
 the usual quadcore as well 1 gb 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.740
 RAM and 16 gigabytes of flash 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.700
 The whole thing is in a plastic housing 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.030
 as you can see here 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.319
 and has a structured surface 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.399
 Here you can see on the camera 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.590
 unfortunately not so because of the brightness 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.629
 if you go it is a good idea 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.099
 little gross and so on but 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.060
 an attractive design and holds 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.920
 fingerprints in any case 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.780
 reliable for and ensures that 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.129
 The tablet may be relatively safe one 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.989
 hand is you look at the short 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.250
 back we have a 2 up here 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.440
 megapixel camera 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.239
 this is a very simple little snap 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.019
 that should not be great now 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.879
 making pictures 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.120
 at the top it goes on with 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.500
 a micro usb port of micro sd cards 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.629
 slot da is a small microphone 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.250
 the volume will be natural and the 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.840
 headphone jack and on the right 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.760
 There's also still here if 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.680
 the cameras with the power on and off 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.090
 Ausschalter more there is only once 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.010
 not on the front you can see that here 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.500
 in the corner still a VGA camera 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.139
 sits a very simple and a start 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.190
 Button does not exist in this case 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.480
 how thick and how difficult the thing is 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.389
 I can not tell you right now 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.400
 but it is just an absolute low end 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.510
 device should be in this year in 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.760
 Germany is coming to the market and 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.730
 is then as I said from 120 euros to 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.560
 have therefore be good then toshiba 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.090
 is wonderful how to think 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.410
 but we do the pricing 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.910
 will see and we wish that 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.530
 japanese of course and then gets it 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.720
 good luck too 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.819
 I was there alone for mobile visit 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.230
 ifa 2014 and if you like what 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.970
 We are happy to do this here 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.340
 a thumbs up for the thumb 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.319
 channel and a follower on twitter 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.250
 see google plus or facebook 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.250
 get back to us soon
