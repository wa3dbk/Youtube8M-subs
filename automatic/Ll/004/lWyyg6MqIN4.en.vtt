00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:17.730
 so now you need to break away from the screen and 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:17.730
 hold the camera something like this filed 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:54.940
 am now your eyes at all like that 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:58.060
 leave perfectly maybe no maybe this 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.450
 such you do not hospitals obtyat 3d now 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:13.060
 going on comb see and comb prepare 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:18.159
 the basis of this media here are the ducks can 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.710
 keep your master chips there 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.979
 show and of course not very 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.490
 where only the indicator gate blew the thread 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.229
 that all acquired experience is necessary for someone 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.389
 transfer better done from 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.689
 broadcast make technology 

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:42.249
 which I managed to open available 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:44.649
 all to each to be used if 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:46.170
 each will do so in relation to 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:52.899
 his skill 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.759
 the world will become more educated become then 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.469
 there is if all technologies are open 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.670
 anyone can watch any video 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:05.200
 understand how this or that action is done 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.039
 some master we get the world 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.039
 open technology 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:18.990
 just now look to be developed 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:24.920
 new technologies for dragon weaving 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:29.160
 relatively new its essence is that 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.430
 markup has 6 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:39.450
 huge base around each 3 to 6 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:41.640
 other faces of the rosary and it gives such 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.360
 cellular structure can be continued 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.750
 markup about the invention drudged throughout 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.340
 head from any place with any of the faces 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.370
 just repeating parallel lines 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.020
 which is already on the head that is it 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.250
 it becomes obvious as soon as 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:02.340
 going on beginning all lines are visible for 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:07.890
 future dread they just go 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:14.820
 parallel lines of god you here 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:17.970
 About such a technology developed in 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.300
 motion dreadlocks in transit and spread 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.300
 free 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.670
 linux operating system 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:35.270
 now it is a matter of philosophy 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:38.640
 bent we watch the movie revolution post 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:43.910
 about the history of creating wine locks 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:48.150
 talk about princesses 20 years 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:54.900
 the opposite of what it is 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:04:00.739
 can dreadlocks be an object 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.739
 copyright who is the author 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:17.470
 author copyright if / copyright 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:17.470
 then itâ€™s a fraction of the road rest
