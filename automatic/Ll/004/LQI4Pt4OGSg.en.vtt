00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the kidneys to the bladder and finally

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.459 
the kidneys to the bladder and finally
they<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.969> result<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.870> blockage<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.350> a

urine flow and cause bleeding which is

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.920 
urine flow and cause bleeding which is
why<00:00:51.930> they<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.289> be<00:00:52.410> removed<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.719> the<00:00:54.719> main

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
why they have to be removed so the main

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.930 
why they have to be removed so the main
cause<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.230> kidney<00:00:55.530> stones<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.129> basically<00:00:56.610> not

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
cause of kidney stones is basically not

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.680 
cause of kidney stones is basically not
drinking<00:00:57.360> enough<00:00:57.480> fluids<00:00:57.719> especially<00:00:58.350> water
