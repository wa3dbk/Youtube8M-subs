demo at the end of this video and I
would<00:00:47.129> say<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.610> excellent<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.809> not

are<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.440> little<00:00:52.949> bit<00:00:53.129> more<00:00:53.160> responsive<00:00:53.789> things

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
are a little bit more responsive things

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.000 
are a little bit more responsive things

let's have a look and let's change
camera<00:01:13.350> angle<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.250> get<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> closer

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
camera angle so you can get a closer

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.730 
camera angle so you can get a closer
look<00:01:14.820> there's<00:01:15.780> only<00:01:15.900> one<00:01:16.140> control<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.650> need

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
look there's only one control you need

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.200

to<00:01:16.860> look<00:01:16.979> at<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.310> front<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.850> that's<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
to look at on the front and that's the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.149 
to look at on the front and that's the
crossfader<00:01:18.750> curve<00:01:18.869> here<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.860> need<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
crossfader curve here you just need to

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.499 
crossfader curve here you just need to
make<00:01:20.310> sure<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.490> that's<00:01:20.759> set<00:01:21.000> all<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> way<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
make sure that that's set all the way to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
turn it too heavy it means that it's

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.630 
turn it too heavy it means that it's
quite<00:01:46.200> tight<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.710> means<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.250> kind<00:01:47.369> of

quite tight it means that it's kind of

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.920 
quite tight it means that it's kind of
quite<00:01:47.790> difficult<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.240> push<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> jog<00:01:48.810> way

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
quite difficult to push the jog way

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.410 
quite difficult to push the jog way
around<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.799> when<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.979> turn<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.310> light<00:01:50.579> you

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
around and when you turn it to light you

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.120 
around and when you turn it to light you
can<00:01:51.570> see<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.960> spins<00:01:52.380> round<00:01:52.710> with<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
can see it spins round with just a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.219 
can see it spins round with just a
little<00:01:53.340> touch<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:54.390> that's<00:01:54.689> more<00:01:54.930> about

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
little touch so that's more about

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.959 
little touch so that's more about
getting<00:01:55.619> used<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.159> kind<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.430> personal

platter and the jog wheel to show you
the<00:02:36.459> position<00:02:36.670> where<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:37.329> are<00:02:37.359> for<00:02:37.659> your

the position where you are for your

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.159 
the position where you are for your
scratching<00:02:38.049> so<00:02:38.920> here<00:02:39.219> my<00:02:39.519> scratch<00:02:39.819> sound<00:02:40.169> the

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:41.169 
scratching so here my scratch sound the

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.520 
scratching so here my scratch sound the
classic<00:02:41.560> fresh<00:02:41.889> scratch<00:02:42.310> sound<00:02:43.319> starts<00:02:44.319> there

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
classic fresh scratch sound starts there

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.659 
classic fresh scratch sound starts there
and<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.709> can<00:02:44.829> see<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.099> the<00:02:45.219> black<00:02:45.430> line

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:45.669 
and you can see that the black line

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.280 
and you can see that the black line
always<00:02:45.969> goes<00:02:46.269> back<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.540> exactly<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.260> same

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
always goes back to exactly the same

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.860 
always goes back to exactly the same
point<00:02:50.159> so<00:02:51.159> I<00:02:51.189> can<00:02:51.280> use<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.760> visual<00:02:52.389> cue<00:02:52.629> point

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
point so I can use that visual cue point

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.449
