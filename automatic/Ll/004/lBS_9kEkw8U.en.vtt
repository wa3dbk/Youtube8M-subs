00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.810

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.290
 It also makes lemonade but better 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.290

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.830
 with the things that I have to give him 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000

 Let's see 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.209
 and I feel so much that it took me a long time to go up 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.620

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.620
 headband for hair 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.580
 with the computer that I am writing 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.610
 because it's about a friend 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.650

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.190

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.000
 bed 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.000
