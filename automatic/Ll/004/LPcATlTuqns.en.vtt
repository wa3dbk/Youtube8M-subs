holy holy Jones but overall the chapter
was<00:00:15.900> pretty<00:00:16.230> decent<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.890> was<00:00:17.010> more<00:00:17.250> again

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
was pretty decent it was more again

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.370

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
reflecting on a bunch of stuff that we

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.800 
reflecting on a bunch of stuff that we
can't<00:00:19.410> already<00:00:19.770> knew<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.150> few<00:00:21.570> different

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
can't already knew but a few different

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.779 
can't already knew but a few different
things<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.439> like<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:23.220> got<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> little<00:00:23.580> bit<00:00:23.760> of

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
things that like we got a little bit of

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.220 
things that like we got a little bit of
development<00:00:24.359> with<00:00:24.449> some<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.779> straw<00:00:24.990> hats

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
development with some of the straw hats

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.390 
development with some of the straw hats
and<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.500> thought<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:25.949> really<00:00:26.160> nice

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
or something or is he gonna be like the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.680 
or something or is he gonna be like the
form<00:00:49.710> from<00:00:49.860> now<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.460> throughout<00:00:51.390> his

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
form from now on and throughout his

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.260 
form from now on and throughout his
training<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.620> learned<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.399> little<00:00:53.640> glance<00:00:54.000> of

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
training we learned a little glance of

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.420 
training we learned a little glance of
what<00:00:54.420> he<00:00:54.570> learned<00:00:54.840> he<00:00:55.559> learned<00:00:55.739> his<00:00:55.890> true<00:00:56.190> form

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
what he learned he learned his true form

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.889 
what he learned he learned his true form
and<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.760> guess<00:00:56.940> he<00:00:57.090> has<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.570> kind<00:00:57.870> of

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
and I guess he has like this kind of

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.520 
and I guess he has like this kind of
ghostly<00:00:58.579> form<00:00:59.579> where<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.230> true

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
ghostly form where like the the true

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.680 
ghostly form where like the the true
form<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.399> fruit<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.910> power<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.449> gave

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
form of the fruit the power that gave

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.270 
form of the fruit the power that gave
him<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.439> he's<00:01:04.650> kind<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.040> guess

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
him is that he's kind of like I guess

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.460 
him is that he's kind of like I guess
soul<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.030> way<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.900> he<00:01:07.049> could<00:01:07.200> go<00:01:07.320> into

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
soul in a way and like he could go into

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.320 
soul in a way and like he could go into
the<00:01:07.740> bones<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.580> long<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> bones

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the bones like as long as the bones

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.359 
the bones like as long as the bones
aren't<00:01:09.630> damaged<00:01:10.110> himself<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.710> believe<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.250> he

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
aren't damaged himself I believe like he

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.160 
aren't damaged himself I believe like he
could<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.670> leave<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.180> leave<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:12.990> leave

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
could just leave it leave you know leave

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.960 
could just leave it leave you know leave
that<00:01:13.350> book<00:01:13.619> skeleton<00:01:14.189> body<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:14.820> people

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that book skeleton body and like people

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.030 
that book skeleton body and like people
could<00:01:15.210> still<00:01:15.420> see<00:01:15.630> him<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.960> such<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
could still see him and such so the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.249 
could still see him and such so the
bones<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.549> guess<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.119> container<00:01:18.869> for

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
bones I guess is like the container for

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.230 
bones I guess is like the container for
his<00:01:19.409> soul<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.549> he<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:20.850> go<00:01:21.119> around

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
his soul and like he can just go around

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.149 
his soul and like he can just go around
I<00:01:21.689> believe<00:01:22.170> that's<00:01:22.290> how<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:22.710> described

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
I believe that's how it was described

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.249 
I believe that's how it was described
and<00:01:23.430> that's<00:01:24.270> pretty<00:01:24.570> awesome<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.110> got<00:01:25.229> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and that's pretty awesome that we got a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.660 
and that's pretty awesome that we got a
little<00:01:25.439> bit<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.650> development<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.369> right

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670

him<00:03:05.470> like<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.769> know<00:03:05.859> what's<00:03:06.040> your<00:03:06.159> purpose

him like you know what's your purpose

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.830 
him like you know what's your purpose
what<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:06.790> your<00:03:06.909> reason<00:03:07.180> for<00:03:07.359> doing<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.659> and

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
what is your reason for doing this and

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.479 
what is your reason for doing this and
he<00:03:08.049> said<00:03:08.409> something<00:03:08.769> like<00:03:08.889> nothing<00:03:09.340> or<00:03:09.459> I

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
he said something like nothing or I

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.440 
he said something like nothing or I
don't<00:03:09.549> have<00:03:09.790> one<00:03:09.939> or<00:03:10.090> something<00:03:10.239> like<00:03:10.389> that

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
don't have one or something like that

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.860 
don't have one or something like that
and<00:03:10.980> basically<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.639> reason<00:03:12.819> y<00:03:13.090> ou<00:03:13.299> D<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.629> doing

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
and basically the reason y ou D is doing

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.500 
and basically the reason y ou D is doing
this<00:03:13.959> he's<00:03:14.109> a<00:03:14.139> part<00:03:14.409> of<00:03:14.439> this<00:03:14.530> new<00:03:14.739> age<00:03:14.919> of

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
this he's a part of this new age of

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.150 
this he's a part of this new age of
fishermen<00:03:16.510> pirates<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.109> guess<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.769> basically

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
fishermen pirates I guess that basically

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.839 
fishermen pirates I guess that basically
they<00:03:18.400> don't<00:03:18.609> want<00:03:18.790> their<00:03:19.049> predecessors<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:21.730> be

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
they don't want their predecessors to be

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.280 
they don't want their predecessors to be
forgotten<00:03:22.150> like<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.569> guess<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:23.019> don't<00:03:23.169> want
