 hi my name is olya monday and 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.830
 Today we make a video about our books 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.960
 shopping i think most of it 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.580
 noticed that before I didnâ€™t like these videos 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.220
 did for a few reasons 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.170
 Firstly, not always someone gives 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.910
 books after half a year since i 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.189
 finished playing book surprise 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.170
 I even then received parcels from 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.210
 books from complete strangers to me 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.730
 people they read books all 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.739
 were in a hurry and the new ones did not come the same 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.239
 I'm one of those gentle shopaholics that little 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.149
 life seems shit i go to book 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.430
 shop and buy yourself a book steam rooms 43 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.250
 lac on i know perfectly well that stores 5 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.829
 times more expensive than on the internet 0 internal 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.480
 bulk monster 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.379
 silent and now on the Volga I have left 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.559
 many do not read books ten pieces on 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.170
 Little 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.390
 so I decided all the diet is over and 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.939
 put on your virtual internet 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.380
 basket of all sorts of yummy think you 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.549
 familiar is the feeling that you are you 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.890
 nothing can be bought 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.080
 are you ready to buy literally every second 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.210
 novelty arguing that you 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.890
 it is urgently needed otherwise you will die but barely 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.960
 some kind of relative appears 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.700
 liberty activist how too don't you know what 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.159
 Buy the book I ordered is not much 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.530
 only 4 but for me it is already big 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.130
 event so let's get my firmware on 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.829
 forks 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.430
 and i want to start with them julie paul julie 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.259
 julie 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.840
 I really wanted to read this before 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.310
 book however after mentioning ulyans or 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.950
 huskies and in your lingerie 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.259
 I understood that this book should be immediately 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.479
 Sorry no where should I have failed 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.700
 I decided to find this edition 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.979
 side romance you're on the cover I'm just 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.470
 huge fan of movies on food and 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.670
 I was delighted with the movie shot by 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.619
 this book name 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.750
 Meryl strip they are all great 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.270
 coped with their roles and the movie 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.280
 not just indescribable atmosphere 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.550
 however, I really hope that the book seems to be 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.590
 even better movie no 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.900
 can anything seem better so 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.910
 I bought another book about motor 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.860
 shild multiplier famous 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.550
 thanks to its populated animations about 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.500
 Simon's cat 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.330
 i'm a big fan of this cartoon so 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.640
 that I always buy a new book from this 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.740
 the series does not double go light and karabis 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.170
 the rule is different from all previous ones 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.020
 she has become more colored illustrations 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.150
 in size 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.100
 but thinner than its predecessors so 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.750
 You see, I just had to 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.670
 buy this book and here are some 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.470
 illustration book is really very 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.570
 funny and does not cause anything on the face 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.160
 besides the smile , the book will appear especially 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.530
 interesting to cat owners like me 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.960
 it seems because the stone is made up 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.210
 creating these pictures his own 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.890
 four-legged pets reason for buying in 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.750
 I can't find the next book so far 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.700
 then probably then there was some 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.370
 prostration when made out the order 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.130
 this book veronica mouth elected which 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.970
 has become a popular Russian-speaking reader 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.160
 long before its official 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.780
 Russian-language release this novel their 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.330
 ninety nine and nine different 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.370
 YouTube that I could not pass by 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.350
 but honestly not at all what it is 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.330
 clicks nothing phenomenal judging by 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.280
 annotations in general some kind of regular movie 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.560
 cannon thing is no worse and no better 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.690
 my tribeswoman confirmed my 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.910
 autumn or not I'll tell you when 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.590
 read the book and the last acquired 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.910
 me this month with a book wife 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.880
 time traveler 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.100
 Audrey thread for several years in a row I 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.510
 I put my virtual cart in the book 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.790
 but the last moment for some reason 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.280
 change my mind and buy something or another I 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.350
 very long ripe for the purchase of this book 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.660
 I could not understand ready to read laziness 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.670
 now or you need to wait a little longer 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.410
 and an hour I can say that you are ready well 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.690
 gives another question when it gives me 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.550
 for the tubes but the first one is done 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.959
 half way and no further 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.910
 I do not want to watch the film version 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.950
 preferences because I think that's 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.800
 discourage me by saying goodbye appetizing on 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.800
 filament then all your bookshelf 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.910
 I didn't just do great 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.220
 their paradise manifested manifest ok 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.790
 they all coped beautifully with their 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:15.120
 roles they all coped with great 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.120
 their roles and showed 103
