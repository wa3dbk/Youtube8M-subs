why I made the switch and really haven't

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.689 
why I made the switch and really haven't
looked<00:00:21.810> back<00:00:21.840> since<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.350> have<00:00:22.560> painter<00:00:23.160> x3<00:00:23.609> is

looked back since I have painter x3 is

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.849 
looked back since I have painter x3 is
packed<00:00:24.119> with<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.390> lot<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.660> new<00:00:24.960> features<00:00:25.140> but

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
packed with a lot of new features but

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.500 
packed with a lot of new features but
the<00:00:26.250> thing<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.460> keeps<00:00:26.880> bringing<00:00:27.060> me<00:00:27.240> back<00:00:27.300> to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the thing that keeps bringing me back to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.849 
the thing that keeps bringing me back to
painter<00:00:28.050> as<00:00:28.230> opposed<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.650> any<00:00:28.800> other

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
painter as opposed to any other

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.800 
painter as opposed to any other
applications<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.090> brushes<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.570> know

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
applications is the brushes you know

applications is the brushes you know
I've<00:00:30.900> said<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.380> past<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.890> I

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
I've said this in the past and I

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.459 
I've said this in the past and I
continue<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.460> say<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.260> probably

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
continue to say this so I probably

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.840 
continue to say this so I probably
should<00:00:34.739> back<00:00:34.920> up<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.280> give<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> little

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
though I owned painter I didn't have

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.020 
though I owned painter I didn't have
time<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.110> learn<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> interface<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.219> for

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
time to learn the interface and for

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.400 
time to learn the interface and for
whatever<00:00:57.480> reason<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.020> was<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> little

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
whatever reason it was a little

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.930 
whatever reason it was a little
intimidating<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.010> me<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.460> didn't<00:00:59.760> mess<00:00:59.910> with

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
intimidating to me so I didn't mess with

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.869 
intimidating to me so I didn't mess with
it<00:01:00.239> until<00:01:00.600> about<00:01:00.989> version<00:01:01.680> 9<00:01:01.920> when<00:01:02.370> version<00:01:02.730> 9

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it until about version 9 when version 9

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.420 
it until about version 9 when version 9
came<00:01:03.149> out<00:01:03.359> they<00:01:03.750> made<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.710> little<00:01:04.739> more<00:01:05.100> user

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
came out they made it a little more user

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.520 
came out they made it a little more user
friendly<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:06.090> far<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.930> interface<00:01:07.380> was

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
friendly as far as the interface was

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.770 
friendly as far as the interface was
concerned<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.400> decided<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.210> learn<00:01:09.540> it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
concerned and so I decided to learn it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.270 
concerned and so I decided to learn it
because<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.350> knew<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.680> had<00:01:10.860> some<00:01:11.070> really

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
because I knew it had some really

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.030

interesting<00:01:11.640> features<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.479> after<00:01:13.140> using

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
interesting features to it after using

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.940 
interesting features to it after using

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
it for six months exclusively I decided

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.520 
it for six months exclusively I decided
this<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.939> application<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.049> me<00:01:19.170> you'll

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
can see that there are strokes there

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.830 
can see that there are strokes there
that<00:01:53.159> are<00:01:53.280> apparent<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.119> not<00:01:54.360> all

airbrushed<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:57.119> feels<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.600> something

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
airbrushed and it feels like something

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.499 
airbrushed and it feels like something
that<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.890> were<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> piece<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.000> paper<00:02:00.299> you

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
that if it were on a piece of paper you

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.719 
that if it were on a piece of paper you
you<00:02:01.170> wouldn't<00:02:01.439> really<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.740> surprised<00:02:02.130> so

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
you wouldn't really be surprised so

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
application if I pull up a

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.320 
application if I pull up a

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the natural media in painter it's

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.280 
the natural media in painter it's
something<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.800> if<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.220> want<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.910> get<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
and it looks very believable the way

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.670 
and it looks very believable the way
that<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.660> paint<00:02:31.900> interacts<00:02:32.290> with<00:02:32.560> the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
that the paint interacts with the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.280 
that the paint interacts with the
strokes<00:02:32.950> beneath<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.670> blends<00:02:34.420> is<00:02:34.840> also

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
very believable and these are things

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.259 
very believable and these are things
that<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:38.140> can<00:02:38.349> get<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.860> similar<00:02:39.459> look<00:02:39.850> in<00:02:40.090> other

that you can get a similar look in other

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.940 
that you can get a similar look in other
applications<00:02:40.510> but<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.319> doesn't<00:02:41.650> feel<00:02:41.890> like

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
applications but it doesn't feel like

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.460 
applications but it doesn't feel like
real<00:02:42.549> paint<00:02:42.910> that's<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.989> thing<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.319> love

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470
