00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.730 
information in one view so it's really a
very<00:01:25.969> fun<00:01:26.969> communication<00:01:27.840> application<00:01:28.560> on

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
very fun communication application on

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.550 
very fun communication application on
the<00:01:29.520> other<00:01:29.640> hand<00:01:29.759> media<00:01:30.210> escape<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:31.170> focus

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the other hand media escape the focus

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.249 
the other hand media escape the focus
there<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.039> on<00:01:32.249> media<00:01:32.639> as<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.899> name<00:01:34.049> suggests

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
there is on media as the name suggests

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.260 
there is on media as the name suggests
so<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.460> an<00:01:35.609> application<00:01:36.240> that

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
so this is an application that

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.149 
so this is an application that
aggregates<00:01:37.079> or<00:01:37.319> blurs<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.710> boundaries

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
aggregates or blurs the boundaries

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.279 
aggregates or blurs the boundaries
between<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.789> different<00:01:39.149> media<00:01:39.509> experiences

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
between the different media experiences

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.249 
between the different media experiences
in<00:01:40.469> the<00:01:40.560> handset<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.249> it's<00:01:41.490> about<00:01:41.639> accessing

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
in the handset so it's about accessing

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.529 
in the handset so it's about accessing
quick<00:01:43.259> access<00:01:43.469> to<00:01:43.889> your<00:01:43.979> music<00:01:44.270> videos<00:01:45.270> and
