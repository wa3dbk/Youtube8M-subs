explains<00:00:15.680> so<00:00:16.680> we've<00:00:16.890> got<00:00:17.130> three<00:00:17.520> different

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
explains so we've got three different

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.760 
explains so we've got three different
grinds<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.480> coffee<00:00:18.720> all<00:00:19.020> these<00:00:19.289> are<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.500> same

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
grinds of coffee all these are the same

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.370 
grinds of coffee all these are the same
type<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.130> coffee<00:00:20.580> but<00:00:21.390> they<00:00:21.630> will<00:00:21.810> all<00:00:21.960> be

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
type of coffee but they will all be

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.560 
type of coffee but they will all be
quite<00:00:22.680> different<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.369> flavor<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.119> being<00:00:24.420> made

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
quite different in flavor and being made

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.480 
quite different in flavor and being made
in<00:00:24.810> all<00:00:24.930> these<00:00:25.109> different<00:00:25.590> types<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.250> coffee

maker<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:27.840> first<00:00:28.109> one<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> quite

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
maker the first one here is a is a quite

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.799 
maker the first one here is a is a quite
a<00:00:29.880> coarse<00:00:30.269> grind<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:31.170> quite<00:00:31.560> loose<00:00:32.750> it's<00:00:33.750> not

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
a coarse grind it's quite loose it's not

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.160 
a coarse grind it's quite loose it's not
too<00:00:34.230> soft<00:00:34.590> or<00:00:34.829> sticky<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:36.480> one<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.840> used

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
too soft or sticky and this one is used

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.010 
too soft or sticky and this one is used
for<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.920> cavity<00:00:38.129> air<00:00:38.579> or<00:00:38.879> sometimes<00:00:39.660> called<00:00:39.750> a

French press or a plunger pot the reason

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.440 
French press or a plunger pot the reason
we<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.370> use<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> coarser<00:00:45.030> grind<00:00:45.210> is

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
we have to use a coarser grind is

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.860 
we have to use a coarser grind is
because<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.289> filter<00:00:46.860> here<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> metal<00:00:48.629> field

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
because the filter here is a metal field

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.709 
because the filter here is a metal field
has<00:00:49.110> much<00:00:49.530> larger<00:00:49.770> holes<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.300> don't<00:00:51.510> want

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
has much larger holes and you don't want

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.810 
has much larger holes and you don't want
anything<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:52.829> through<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> filter<00:00:53.789> into

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
anything to go through the filter into

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.790 
anything to go through the filter into
the<00:00:54.260> into<00:00:55.260> your<00:00:55.379> coffee<00:00:55.590> cup<00:00:56.870> so<00:00:57.870> because<00:00:58.649> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the into your coffee cup so because of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.410 
the into your coffee cup so because of
being<00:00:58.980> course<00:00:59.309> obviously<00:00:59.820> you'll<00:01:00.000> get<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> more

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
being course obviously you'll get a more

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.520 
being course obviously you'll get a more
gentle<00:01:00.989> infusion<00:01:02.420> as<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.600> water<00:01:03.840> comes<00:01:04.320> into

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
gentle infusion as the water comes into

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.620 
gentle infusion as the water comes into
contact<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> grounds<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:06.180> only<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
contact with the grounds it's only the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.020 
contact with the grounds it's only the
actual<00:01:06.930> act<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.560> plunging<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.520> coffee<00:01:08.729> at<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
actual act of plunging the coffee at the

actual act of plunging the coffee at the

going this central area here and that's

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.450 
going this central area here and that's
compacted<00:01:46.300> into<00:01:46.479> quite<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.260> small<00:01:47.650> space<00:01:48.100> and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
compacted into quite a small space and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
place this on the stove it heats up and

the water is forced up through the
grounds<00:01:57.070> are<00:01:57.220> quite<00:01:57.460> high<00:01:57.640> pressure<00:01:58.090> into<00:01:58.360> the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
grounds are quite high pressure into the

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.870 
grounds are quite high pressure into the
top<00:01:58.810> so<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.440> get<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.740> kind<00:02:00.190> of<00:02:00.340> consistency

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
top so you get a kind of consistency

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.249 
top so you get a kind of consistency
rather<00:02:01.150> like<00:02:01.479> you<00:02:01.630> would<00:02:01.780> from<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:02.020> real

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
rather like you would from a real

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.530 
rather like you would from a real
espresso<00:02:02.860> machine<00:02:03.220> a<00:02:03.430> much<00:02:03.759> denser<00:02:04.119> more

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
espresso machine a much denser more

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.749 
espresso machine a much denser more
powerful<00:02:05.229> flavor

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.030 

the<00:02:11.209> finest<00:02:11.690> one<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:11.930> have<00:02:12.170> here<00:02:12.470> is<00:02:12.590> this<00:02:12.770> one

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
the finest one I have here is this one

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.280 
the finest one I have here is this one
which<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.550> little<00:02:13.819> bit<00:02:13.910> softer<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:15.110> can

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
which is a little bit softer you can

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.650 
which is a little bit softer you can
still<00:02:15.530> feel<00:02:15.830> some<00:02:16.099> graininess<00:02:16.879> in<00:02:17.209> there<00:02:17.450> but

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
still feel some graininess in there but

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.350 
still feel some graininess in there but
it's<00:02:17.810> not<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:18.890> not<00:02:19.099> as<00:02:19.310> loose<00:02:19.610> as<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.180> other

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
it's not it's not as loose as the other

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.270 
it's not it's not as loose as the other
two<00:02:20.599> is<00:02:20.840> just<00:02:20.870> clumps<00:02:21.739> together<00:02:21.860> very

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
two is just clumps together very

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.670 
two is just clumps together very
slightly<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.480> you'd<00:02:23.720> use<00:02:23.959> in<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.319> in<00:02:24.590> a

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
slightly and that you'd use in a in a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.309 
slightly and that you'd use in a in a
filter<00:02:25.099> paper<00:02:25.450> either<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.629> manual<00:02:27.110> version

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
filter paper either a manual version

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.620 
filter paper either a manual version
like<00:02:27.709> this<00:02:27.890> one<00:02:28.160> or<00:02:28.489> of<00:02:28.790> course<00:02:28.970> an<00:02:29.150> electric

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
like this one or of course an electric

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.479 
like this one or of course an electric
ones<00:02:29.870> where<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.769> paper<00:02:31.010> will<00:02:31.250> obviously

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
ones where the paper will obviously

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.040 
ones where the paper will obviously
prevent<00:02:32.000> any<00:02:32.269> of<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.569> grounds<00:02:32.900> getting

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
prevent any of the grounds getting

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.949 
prevent any of the grounds getting
through<00:02:33.470> into<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.860> jug<00:02:34.099> below<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:34.959> because

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
through into the jug below and because

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.170 
through into the jug below and because
the<00:02:36.230> grounds<00:02:36.739> are<00:02:36.950> finer<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.700> get<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:37.910> much

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
the grounds are finer you get a much

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.780 
the grounds are finer you get a much
larger<00:02:38.900> surface<00:02:39.410> area<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:40.069> the<00:02:40.280> coffee<00:02:40.489> coming

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
larger surface area of the coffee coming

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.630 
larger surface area of the coffee coming
into<00:02:41.000> contact<00:02:41.269> with<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.690> water<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:43.340> makes

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
into contact with the water and it makes

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.030 
into contact with the water and it makes
a<00:02:43.819> more<00:02:44.120> intense<00:02:44.540> cup<00:02:44.930> slightly<00:02:45.410> stronger<00:02:45.950> and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
a more intense cup slightly stronger and

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.839 
a more intense cup slightly stronger and
a<00:02:46.069> bit<00:02:46.220> richer<00:02:46.730> than<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.000> cavity<00:02:47.450> air

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.539 

so<00:02:52.420> even<00:02:53.140> though<00:02:53.290> you've<00:02:53.500> used<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:54.010> exact

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
so even though you've used the exact

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.030 
so even though you've used the exact
same<00:02:54.640> coffee<00:02:55.180> you've<00:02:56.170> ground<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:56.829> three

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
same coffee you've ground it in three

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.410 
same coffee you've ground it in three
different<00:02:57.159> ways<00:02:57.370> you've<00:02:57.790> made<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.209> three

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
different ways you've made it in three

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.899 
different ways you've made it in three
different<00:02:58.540> ways<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.439> each<00:02:59.739> coffee<00:03:00.040> will<00:03:00.459> will

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
different ways and each coffee will will

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.330 
different ways and each coffee will will
taste<00:03:01.180> quite<00:03:01.450> different<00:03:02.019> people<00:03:02.260> often<00:03:03.189> ask

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
taste quite different people often ask

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.009 
taste quite different people often ask
me<00:03:03.459> what's<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.909> best<00:03:04.209> way<00:03:04.390> to<00:03:04.420> make<00:03:04.750> coffee
