00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.729
 hello friends let's give resolution to a 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:11.440
 theme of cell phone connection 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:14.200
 when we connect it to the computer 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:19.529
 and does not recognize it, we can not see what 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.529
 has inside then we first connect 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.040
 the mobile 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.040
 we do not unlock 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:34.329
 and we see that it does not detect it then 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.329
 let's go to team properties 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.250
 Device Manager 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.059
 and here we see that we have it but it is 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.250
 with a yellow triangular and here 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.710
 samsung android also then that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.399
 we have to do so we can see it 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.040
 because we're going to the team here and we see that 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.510
 is not here then what we can 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.620
 do is 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.239
 secondary button or button on the right and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.540
 uninstall 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.350
 let's accept and install them 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.430
 they are your android we also install them 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.230
 we settled in accept 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.230
 and now we disconnect 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.510
 and reconnect 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.670
 and when reconnecting we see here 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.890
 down that puts installing the software of 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.800
 device driver and now 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.810
 we let him do this we can 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.740
 close it we can close it 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.860
 we open here my team and we are going to see 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.860
 there 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.850
 that already appears to us 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:53.580
 and once you just installed good to 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:57.340
 times if we have blockage by pattern 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.520
 we have to unlock the phone and now 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.329
 we see that here it appeared 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.190
 then we open it and we have here the 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.600
 micro SD 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.600
 and the telephone 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.450
 and we have the phone too and so 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.460
 we can see all the files I hope 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.760
 that is helpful because sometimes that 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.090
 the phone is connected and not the computer 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.460
 does not recognize it then it happens that I hope 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.510
 may it help you to give me a 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.260

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.160
