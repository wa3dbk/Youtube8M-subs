00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.170
 I started using a cream 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.030
 moisturizing soldiers if I chose las 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.860
 bioderma higueras to make sure 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.570
 that my to practice it properly 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.040
 before applying the rest of my 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.360
 makeup these days I use 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.409
 all the time this cream the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.550
 because I find them somewhere 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.620
 people I really like 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.769
 the dimming sensation that she is 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.940
 on my face once this step there 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.800
 internally and i'll start with 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.960
 apply the benefits professional 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.790
 on the world the most possible for 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.469
 to camouflage a little but by pauw 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:06.110
 and nasri that amount be the most 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:07.490
 uniform possible if I pass now 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.960
 every five years it's a bit warmer 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.070
 I'm not going since they both fountains 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 but I'm only going to take a 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.700
 corrector to camouflage the 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.350
 imperfections that seems to me if you 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.460
 take a corrector that tonal of the 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.950
 same color as your thumb offered 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.539
 sparnatrail then a little lighter than 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.039
 two by one complete makeup so I 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.330
 will put its mystery and groupers 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.009
 kind i'm coming fell on it 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.009
 with a sponge of the brand course 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.670
 obviously I come fixed and all that with 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.680
 my half boeing rhythmic nassian skin 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.299
 also know how to prevent 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.330
 my skin to shine during the whole 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.330
 day 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.570
 I will try to come give me a 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.610
 little size with my powder 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.930
 illuminator of milani and that there she 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.850
 is in reach is a good vector 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.619
 because I still have as always 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 looks a little pale so I'm going 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.880
 try to come fix that a bit and 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.189
 to put some color on my cheeks 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:06.060
 I chose the blush of which pink from 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:08.039
 melanie also for my worries I 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.810
 the bronze used the box that rugby 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.190
 in reaching friends and I 'm going to take 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.200
 I close most because it's 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.120
 the one that looks the most like my color 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.370
 eyebrow in Calais had to solicit 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.290
 I will come and fill my eyebrows 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.760
 try to define them a little bit more 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.799
 that I will not use the sirc to 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:30.959
 inside I really just take the 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:32.340
 powder of a the Alex scrambles for 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.080
 make sure the eye shadows 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.730
 will stay in place I like to be on 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.370
 all the eyelid the premium potion 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.989
 of urban decay with my premature side 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.250
 pibal it's really my favorite 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.850
 finds that it is he who gives the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.850
 best result 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.560
 you now count to eyelids that 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.480
 start by applying the color that's 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.430
 that a mole of mac in the hollow 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.870
 nothing more in the form of v can 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.459
 start with vintage 2 just to come 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.459
 define the rest of the makeup 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.830
 after if I take a color that is 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.900
 really a classic at mac etc 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.010
 scale and 2 which is really a 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.150
 of my favorites so I'm going 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.670
 apply it on the entire eyelid 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.200
 below the color I put 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.370
 in monk redeuilh general father on 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.530
 apply two layers so that the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.970
 color is really more vibrant then 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.680
 after those already come obviously 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.650
 blur everything so that it is 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.570
 close this background well together last 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.740
 color I use these horses again 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.330

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.480
 fell I decided to apply 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.700

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.280

 that measure up to three days without 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.330
 have to do them the next day tax is 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.830
 really not practical for me that the 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.220
 long hair semprun acting 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.140
 business 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.370
 the worse also strong interchange 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.450
 the branches but it gives you the effect 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.310
 3 per year 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.200
