little centerpiece that I've created for
my<00:01:57.570> entryway<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.100> needed<00:01:59.369> something<00:01:59.700> in

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
my entryway and I needed something in

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.660 
my entryway and I needed something in
the<00:01:59.909> glass<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.719> some<00:02:01.020> shine<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.380> some<00:02:01.979> more

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the glass and some shine and some more

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.550 
the glass and some shine and some more
texture<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.450> which<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.810> see<00:02:04.020> at<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.290> end

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
texture in it which you see at the end

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.419 
texture in it which you see at the end
I<00:02:05.619> think<00:02:06.040> it's<00:02:06.189> time<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.430> put<00:02:06.670> our<00:02:06.700> candle<00:02:07.210> in

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
I think it's time to put our candle in

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.780 
I think it's time to put our candle in
see<00:02:09.429> how<00:02:09.459> this<00:02:09.819> looks<00:02:11.459> definitely<00:02:12.459> one<00:02:12.580> of<00:02:12.610> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
see how this looks definitely one of the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.229 
see how this looks definitely one of the
acorns<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.450> show<00:02:13.660> at<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.900> bottom<00:02:14.819> no<00:02:15.819> showing

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
acorns to show at the bottom no showing

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.780 
acorns to show at the bottom no showing
a<00:02:16.390> little<00:02:16.630> I'm<00:02:17.470> gonna<00:02:17.680> adjust<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.040> raffia<00:02:18.489> but

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
a little I'm gonna adjust the raffia but

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.640 
a little I'm gonna adjust the raffia but
though<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.000> want<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.300> acorns<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.080> show<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.319> lot

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
though I want the acorns to show a lot

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.530 
though I want the acorns to show a lot
more<00:02:20.920> than<00:02:21.099> this<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.940> here<00:02:22.120> we<00:02:22.239> are<00:02:22.269> now<00:02:22.510> I
