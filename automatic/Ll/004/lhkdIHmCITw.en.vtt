00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.300
 halfway through the dutch favorites marianne vos and sanne van paassen 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.720
 depart to the start of the bk the connoisseurs in the audience peter it go 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.720
 I collect money boss and minuses 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.029
 di rupo that floats in 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.669
 robert holl one possible 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:20.339
 well if i'm just glad it wasn't a year a great opportunity 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.739
 sanne van paassen 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:23.659
 top five 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.449
 he is a nice girl 8 yes in it 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.020
 and that the national coach is enthusiastic we are not so happy with the state of it 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.380
 trail the past 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.200
 there is the organization 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.950
 especially scraped off on technical pieces and just a little bit is possible 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.800
 box made and 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.200
 much of this technique and it is certainly marianne than before at one 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.830
 advantage over competitors called main competitors of mail 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.520
 the prÃ©natal car group 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.290
 I did he comes one 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.700
 but fox is ready for concentration 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.700
 focus before the start but it continues to decrease 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:02.299
 can work there 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.670
 how to start up from Easter and numb but further improve 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.060
 keeper creating a webshop 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.010
 it also immediately forms the first round 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.380
 a fast pace is emerging that is huge from faassen the german artist 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.680
 for the Czech tennis player in the American newspapers 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.950
 for three quarters of the race, the temperature in many places was three 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.000
 let others go 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.280
 Sanne will eventually become the six 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.810
 anticipating this, but the slippery course is her 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.280
 biggest competitor 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.770
 the beautiful four games now definitely score points for sports its broad field 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.080
 unfortunately do not drive 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.280
 fortunately she can be there herself 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.280
 In the leading group, Marianne Vos is taking her chance 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.470
 it has escaped and only the freeze 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.120
 fox is world champion for the fourth time, i'm very glad i got it 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.119
 have been able to renew 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:55.960
 the arena 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.610
 and always very happy 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.150
 and I struggled with that 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.950
 to give up the skipper window frames and what not to let the bear in May of 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.690
 to the poor last year 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.840
 read aloud 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.840
 the 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.879
 a 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.119
 and it would be very good 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:20.599
 the figure that comes a number of times 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.599
 own the fact that they left us and they did not mature us 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.679
 and probably nice opportunities to believe 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:29.679
 and in the final round 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.679
 and then with the hood and weekend a ticket 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:42.829
 the real life by seeing again the fact that the gap became larger in production 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.729
 face on the field this season for Marianne Fox 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:49.209
 she has her debut at the world sprint race on the track in happel doorn
