00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
the ground so basically what it does is

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.430 
the ground so basically what it does is
when<00:04:44.210> he<00:04:44.270> throw<00:04:44.540> it<00:04:44.630> out<00:04:44.750> using<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.230> drop

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
button it will throw it down and then it

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.340 
button it will throw it down and then it
multiplies<00:04:49.400> itself<00:04:49.730> into<00:04:50.300> more<00:04:50.840> bombs<00:04:51.080> and

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
multiplies itself into more bombs and

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.440 
multiplies itself into more bombs and
then<00:04:51.680> right<00:04:52.460> before<00:04:52.760> it<00:04:52.850> explodes<00:04:53.270> it

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
then right before it explodes it

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.780
