00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
on the opposite side of the base of them

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.110 
on the opposite side of the base of them
and<00:04:37.470> allow<00:04:38.010> them<00:04:38.040> from<00:04:38.550> where<00:04:38.790> they're<00:04:38.940> at<00:04:39.090> now

and allow them from where they're at now

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.510 
and allow them from where they're at now
as<00:04:39.540> soon<00:04:39.960> as<00:04:40.050> that<00:04:40.170> last<00:04:40.410> barracks<00:04:41.040> goes<00:04:41.250> down

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
as soon as that last barracks goes down

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.830 
as soon as that last barracks goes down
they're<00:04:42.000> gonna<00:04:42.120> start<00:04:42.270> heading<00:04:42.390> into<00:04:42.630> that

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
they're gonna start heading into that

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.540 
they're gonna start heading into that
core<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.260> get<00:04:43.350> almost<00:04:43.560> high<00:04:43.770> HP<00:04:43.980> buildings

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
core and get almost high HP buildings

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.540 
core and get almost high HP buildings
that<00:04:44.960> that<00:04:45.960> storage<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:46.950> then<00:04:47.040> right<00:04:47.310> into

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
that that storage and then right into

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.940 
that that storage and then right into
the<00:04:47.880> town<00:04:48.750> hall<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:48.990> CC<00:04:49.440> which<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.740> Queen's

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
the town hall and CC which the Queen's

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.050 
the town hall and CC which the Queen's
already<00:04:50.250> done<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.400> little<00:04:50.490> bit<00:04:50.610> of<00:04:50.670> work<00:04:50.880> on<00:04:51.030> I

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
already done a little bit of work on I

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.340 
already done a little bit of work on I
think<00:04:51.270> it's<00:04:51.360> soften<00:04:51.690> them<00:04:51.780> up<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:51.990> little<00:04:52.020> bit

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
think it's soften them up a little bit

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.950 
think it's soften them up a little bit
so<00:04:53.220> it<00:04:53.310> just<00:04:53.490> needs<00:04:53.670> a<00:04:53.760> few<00:04:53.790> swipes<00:04:54.180> on<00:04:54.420> that<00:04:54.600> CC

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
so it just needs a few swipes on that CC

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.810 
so it just needs a few swipes on that CC
for<00:04:55.110> it<00:04:55.170> to<00:04:55.260> go<00:04:55.380> down<00:04:55.410> and<00:04:55.860> then<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.610> Town<00:04:56.790> Hall

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
for it to go down and then the Town Hall

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.970 
for it to go down and then the Town Hall
right<00:04:57.360> there<00:04:57.570> will<00:04:57.750> fast<00:04:57.930> forward<00:04:58.020> boom<00:04:58.530> three
