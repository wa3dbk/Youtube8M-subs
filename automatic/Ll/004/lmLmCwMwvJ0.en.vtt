standpoint when we develop varieties

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.630 
standpoint when we develop varieties
with<00:02:33.409> very<00:02:34.040> good

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640

somewhat lower so as a breeder what
we're<00:02:41.239> trying<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.810> do<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.170> identify<00:02:42.790> those

we're trying to do is identify those

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.750 
we're trying to do is identify those

deficiency<00:02:51.349> chlorosis<00:02:52.780> there<00:02:53.780> are<00:02:53.870> also

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
deficiency chlorosis there are also

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.050

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829

in<00:03:10.669> the<00:03:10.970> soil<00:03:11.299> itself<00:03:11.810> it's<00:03:12.470> just<00:03:12.859> that<00:03:13.099> the

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
in the soil itself it's just that the

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.789 
in the soil itself it's just that the
iron<00:03:13.519> is<00:03:13.849> not<00:03:14.120> available<00:03:14.840> in<00:03:15.109> the<00:03:15.290> form<00:03:15.680> that

iron is not available in the form that

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.020 
iron is not available in the form that
soybeans<00:03:16.579> can<00:03:16.909> take<00:03:17.209> up<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:18.590> it's<00:03:18.829> in<00:03:19.519> a<00:03:19.699> form

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
soybeans can take up so it's in a form

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.319 
soybeans can take up so it's in a form
that's<00:03:20.209> called<00:03:20.510> iron<00:03:20.900> 3<00:03:21.889> and<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.849> soybean

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
that's called iron 3 and the soybean

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.259 
that's called iron 3 and the soybean
takes<00:03:23.690> up<00:03:23.930> iron<00:03:24.409> to<00:03:24.799> some<00:03:25.760> of<00:03:25.879> our<00:03:25.970> iron

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
takes up iron to some of our iron

chelate treatments that we've been

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.629 
chelate treatments that we've been
looking<00:03:27.739> at<00:03:27.859> have<00:03:28.040> been<00:03:28.069> in<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.370> range<00:03:28.519> of

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
looking at have been in the range of

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.520 
looking at have been in the range of
about<00:03:28.790> 20<00:03:28.849> to<00:03:29.209> 30<00:03:29.449> dollars<00:03:29.780> per<00:03:29.810> acre<00:03:30.260> so<00:03:30.290> they

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
about 20 to 30 dollars per acre so they

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.759 
about 20 to 30 dollars per acre so they
are<00:03:30.709> very<00:03:30.979> expensive<00:03:31.810> for<00:03:32.810> producers<00:03:33.409> to<00:03:33.590> use

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
are very expensive for producers to use

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.099 
are very expensive for producers to use

within these particular fields but when

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.509 
within these particular fields but when
you're<00:03:36.229> going<00:03:36.379> from<00:03:36.560> zero<00:03:36.829> yields<00:03:37.190> actually

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
you're going from zero yields actually

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.699 
you're going from zero yields actually
having<00:03:37.790> some<00:03:38.030> yield<00:03:38.269> they<00:03:38.900> do<00:03:38.959> they<00:03:39.319> will<00:03:39.530> pay

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
having some yield they do they will pay

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.740 
having some yield they do they will pay
off<00:03:39.919> in<00:03:40.159> the<00:03:40.250> end<00:03:40.280> within<00:03:40.639> particular<00:03:41.209> areas

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
off in the end within particular areas

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.300 
off in the end within particular areas
they're<00:03:42.049> looking<00:03:42.319> at<00:03:42.440> strip<00:03:42.680> trials<00:03:43.069> where<00:03:43.190> we

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
they're looking at strip trials where we

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.729 
they're looking at strip trials where we
can<00:03:43.459> look<00:03:43.609> at<00:03:43.819> different<00:03:44.299> zones<00:03:44.870> of<00:03:45.260> severity

can look at different zones of severity

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.580 
can look at different zones of severity
of<00:03:45.799> iron<00:03:46.129> chlorosis<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:47.239> get<00:03:47.389> an<00:03:47.510> idea<00:03:47.870> of<00:03:47.959> does

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
of iron chlorosis to get an idea of does

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.979 
of iron chlorosis to get an idea of does
that<00:03:48.620> strategy<00:03:49.190> pay<00:03:49.609> for<00:03:49.849> itself<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.540> what

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
that strategy pay for itself and what

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.170 
that strategy pay for itself and what
we've<00:03:51.139> been<00:03:51.260> really<00:03:51.560> finding<00:03:52.010> is<00:03:52.190> that<00:03:52.220> with

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
we've been really finding is that with

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.360 
we've been really finding is that with
some<00:03:53.449> of<00:03:53.540> these<00:03:53.599> these<00:03:54.349> newer<00:03:54.680> iron<00:03:54.949> chelate

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
some of these these newer iron chelate

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.219 
some of these these newer iron chelate
products<00:03:55.760> that<00:03:55.909> are<00:03:56.030> available<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.959> in

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:57.229 
products that are available that in

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:59.379 
products that are available that in
those<00:03:57.379> moderate<00:03:57.979> to<00:03:58.159> severe<00:03:58.519> areas<00:03:58.970> is<00:03:59.120> where

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
those moderate to severe areas is where

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.990 
those moderate to severe areas is where
they<00:03:59.629> tend<00:03:59.900> to<00:03:59.989> pay<00:04:00.229> off<00:04:00.409> the<00:04:00.650> most<00:04:01.000> there's

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
they tend to pay off the most there's

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000 
they tend to pay off the most there's
also<00:04:02.269> some<00:04:02.689> recent<00:04:03.109> research<00:04:03.260> that's<00:04:03.859> looked

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
also some recent research that's looked

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.809 
also some recent research that's looked
at<00:04:04.400> planting<00:04:05.060> another<00:04:05.510> crop<00:04:05.989> such<00:04:06.439> as<00:04:06.650> oats<00:04:07.010> to

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
at planting another crop such as oats to

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.719 
at planting another crop such as oats to
help<00:04:08.290> remove<00:04:09.290> some<00:04:09.319> of<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.769> moisture<00:04:10.010> because

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:10.729 
help remove some of the moisture because

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:14.920 
help remove some of the moisture because
high<00:04:10.970> moisture<00:04:11.269> can<00:04:11.810> also<00:04:12.049> exacerbate<00:04:13.659> IDC<00:04:14.659> as

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
high moisture can also exacerbate IDC as

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.710 
high moisture can also exacerbate IDC as
