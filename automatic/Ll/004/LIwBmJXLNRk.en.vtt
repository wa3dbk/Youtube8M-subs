00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.019
 hello welcome to the new tutorial 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.360
 crafts for all today we are going to 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.360
 make a garland for parties 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.990
 Y 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.570
 materials that we're going to need sheets 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.690
 of trade of various colors and glue 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.690
 in bar 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.910
 mentalities for all 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.740
 to begin we are going to take one of the 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.810
 colored sheets we are going to double you 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.400
 the middle along in this way 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.400
 marking the fold well 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.730
 then we re -double the base to 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.250
 long in the middle and we score again 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.340
 the doubles 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.070
 the same thing we do again in half 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.510
 at the pse throughout marking well in 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.220
 double again we will open it and 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.620
 let's transform those folds into 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.340
 folds of fan one up and 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.340
 one down 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.180
 ah 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.610
 the first doubles are made for 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.439
 mark the size of each doubles well 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.439
 so that it occupies all the leaf 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.150
 once we have the finished fan 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.920
 let's cover the folds well 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.400
 again and we're going to double it for the 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.510
 center in this way 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.890
 thus marking the center of the range of 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.890
 this we will make several colors 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.390
 then with the glue in bar we are going to 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.050
 adhere the fan itself to this 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:51.400
 way 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:52.720
 and we do the same with the rest of the 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.670
 fans 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.130
 now let's intersperse the colors and 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.690
 we're going to stick together what we're going 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.150
 to have to do is that one of the 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.960
 vertices are up and the other 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.960
 down 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.330
 and we're going to hit one by one until 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.330
 finish the required length 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.030
 once we finished it in this way what 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.610
 we open to hang it we adhere the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.920
 ends from side to side so the 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.770
 garland finished and hung and this one 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.370
 my dog is expanding I hope that you 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.350
 I liked it
