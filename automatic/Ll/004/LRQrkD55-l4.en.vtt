five earlier you might have noticed we
had<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.540> jet<00:03:05.780> beam<00:03:06.049> torch<00:03:06.320> on<00:03:06.560> that<00:03:06.769> we've<00:03:07.070> got

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
had a jet beam torch on that we've got

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.110 
had a jet beam torch on that we've got
the<00:03:07.549> DC<00:03:08.239> 40<00:03:09.110> on<00:03:09.230> them<00:03:09.470> it's<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.799> hey<00:03:09.950> 140<00:03:10.700> lumens

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
the DC 40 on them it's a hey 140 lumens

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.080 
the DC 40 on them it's a hey 140 lumens
it's<00:03:11.690> extremely<00:03:12.500> bright<00:03:12.709> torch<00:03:13.070> what<00:03:13.970> we

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
it's extremely bright torch what we

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.140 
it's extremely bright torch what we
gonna<00:03:14.239> do<00:03:15.250> it'll<00:03:16.250> light<00:03:16.459> up<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.730> little<00:03:16.940> C's

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
gonna do it'll light up the little C's

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.039 
gonna do it'll light up the little C's
then<00:03:18.760> got<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.880> say<00:03:20.000> our<00:03:20.150> target<00:03:20.360> range<00:03:20.720> out<00:03:20.930> at

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
then got to say our target range out at

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.870 
then got to say our target range out at
50<00:03:21.350> meters<00:03:21.530> I'll<00:03:22.130> show<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:22.400> how<00:03:22.579> well<00:03:22.790> it

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
50 meters I'll show you how well it

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.680 
50 meters I'll show you how well it
lights<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.209> up<00:03:24.190> I'll<00:03:25.190> also<00:03:25.400> show<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:25.910> 200<00:03:26.420> so

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
lights it up I'll also show it 200 so

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.530 
lights it up I'll also show it 200 so
first<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:27.110> all<00:03:27.579> I'm<00:03:28.579> gonna<00:03:28.730> show<00:03:28.820> you<00:03:29.030> 200

first of all I'm gonna show you 200

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.920 
first of all I'm gonna show you 200
meters<00:03:29.870> that's<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:30.260> 200<00:03:30.650> meter<00:03:30.799> marker<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.900> can

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
meters that's a 200 meter marker you can

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.680 
meters that's a 200 meter marker you can
see<00:03:33.200> that<00:03:33.380> full<00:03:33.560> 840<00:03:34.400> looms<00:03:34.670> in<00:03:35.000> action<00:03:35.510> I

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
see that full 840 looms in action I

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.990 
see that full 840 looms in action I
lights<00:03:36.500> up<00:03:36.650> in<00:03:36.769> the<00:03:36.860> noise<00:03:37.070> good<00:03:37.549> spreaded

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
lights up in the noise good spreaded

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.100 
lights up in the noise good spreaded
area<00:03:38.299> all<00:03:38.450> around<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:41.090> can<00:03:41.239> see<00:03:41.420> our<00:03:41.540> 50<00:03:41.870> meter

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
area all around you can see our 50 meter

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.520 
area all around you can see our 50 meter
mark<00:03:42.260> oh

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.750 

I'm<00:03:49.530> actually<00:03:49.680> going<00:03:50.159> to<00:03:50.250> take<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.550> pressure

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
I'm actually going to take the pressure

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.059 
I'm actually going to take the pressure
switch<00:03:51.060> off<00:03:51.299> I'm<00:03:52.110> going<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.319> go<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.739> manual

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
switch off I'm going to go to the manual

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.619 
switch off I'm going to go to the manual
switch<00:03:53.280> off<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.610> top<00:03:53.849> so<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.120> don't<00:03:54.209> have<00:03:54.510> to

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
switch off the top so you don't have to

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.380 
switch off the top so you don't have to
use<00:03:54.810> your<00:03:54.959> pressure<00:03:55.200> switch<00:03:55.790> so<00:03:56.790> now<00:03:57.060> I've

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
use your pressure switch so now I've

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.420 
use your pressure switch so now I've
released<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.019> pressure<00:03:58.200> switch<00:04:01.430> we're

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
released the pressure switch we're

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.580 
released the pressure switch we're
shooting<00:04:02.640> out<00:04:02.940> at<00:04:03.030> 50<00:04:03.360> meters<00:04:06.200> we<00:04:07.200> can<00:04:07.410> see

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
shooting out at 50 meters we can see

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:18.139 
shooting out at 50 meters we can see
perfectly<00:04:15.139> spot-on
