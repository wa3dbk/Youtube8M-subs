car typically Morris mine and this is a
Bedford<00:00:11.070> see<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.309> van<00:00:11.759> but<00:00:12.450> all<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.719> headlights

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
Bedford see a van but all the headlights

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.959 
Bedford see a van but all the headlights
the<00:00:13.200> round<00:00:13.530> seven-inch<00:00:14.250> headlight<00:00:14.670> are

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
the round seven-inch headlight are

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.330 
the round seven-inch headlight are
pretty<00:00:15.210> much<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.630> same<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.650> first<00:00:17.010> thing

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
pretty much the same so the first thing

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.170 
pretty much the same so the first thing
is<00:00:17.520> there's<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.850> screw<00:00:18.359> under<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.470> bottom<00:00:19.859> here

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
is there's a screw under the bottom here

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.370 
is there's a screw under the bottom here
we've<00:00:21.180> taken<00:00:21.420> out<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.869> one<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.080> isn't

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
we've taken out on this one but isn't

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.439 
we've taken out on this one but isn't
often<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.949> screw<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.490> bottom<00:00:23.609> there<00:00:23.939> and

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
often a screw in the bottom there and

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.810 
often a screw in the bottom there and
that<00:00:24.750> holds<00:00:25.109> what<00:00:25.380> love<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.710> chrome<00:00:26.070> ring<00:00:26.430> in

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
that holds what love this chrome ring in

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.589 
that holds what love this chrome ring in
and<00:00:27.210> then<00:00:27.859> pull<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.010> bottom<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.519> pivots<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and then pull the bottom in pivots the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.659 
and then pull the bottom in pivots the
bottom<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.050> then<00:00:31.170> slides<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.830> there's<00:00:32.579> a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
bottom and then slides up there's a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.000 
bottom and then slides up there's a
little<00:00:32.910> bit<00:00:33.570> at<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.899> top<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.290> hooks<00:00:34.500> behind

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
little bit at the top that hooks behind

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.819 
little bit at the top that hooks behind
that<00:00:35.190> there<00:00:35.399> there<00:00:36.350> that's<00:00:37.350> where<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> screw

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
that there there that's where the screw

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.400 
that there there that's where the screw
goes<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.219> bottom<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:39.090> that's<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.870> outer

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
goes on the bottom so that's the outer

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.319 
goes on the bottom so that's the outer
ring<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:41.820> you've<00:00:42.000> got<00:00:42.120> these<00:00:42.270> two

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
ring now on there you've got these two

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
ring now on there you've got these two
screws<00:00:42.960> here<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.379> got<00:00:43.530> one<00:00:43.800> here<00:00:44.219> right<00:00:44.430> at

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
screws here you got one here right at

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.000 
screws here you got one here right at
the<00:00:44.760> top<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.289> side<00:00:46.530> now<00:00:46.800> they<00:00:46.950> do

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the top and one on the side now they do

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.889 
the top and one on the side now they do
your<00:00:47.309> beam<00:00:47.489> adjustment<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.719> one

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
your beam adjustment so this one

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.110 
your beam adjustment so this one
obviously<00:00:49.050> does<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.070> down<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.850> this

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
obviously does the the up down and this

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.479 
obviously does the the up down and this
one<00:00:51.360> does<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.809> left<00:00:52.170> right<00:00:52.559> don't<00:00:53.219> touch

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
one does the left right don't touch

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.490 
one does the left right don't touch
those<00:00:53.789> there's<00:00:54.390> another<00:00:54.719> three<00:00:55.110> smaller

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
those there's another three smaller

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.279 
those there's another three smaller
screws<00:00:56.090> spread<00:00:57.090> around<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.539> outside<00:00:58.020> so

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
screws spread around the outside so

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.049 
screws spread around the outside so
you've<00:00:58.379> got<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.590> take<00:00:58.770> these<00:00:58.980> out<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.879> what

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
you've got to take these out and what

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.939 
you've got to take these out and what
that<00:01:00.270> does<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.780> take<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.710> little

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
that does is take this this little

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:23.120 
that does is take this this little
chrome<00:01:02.340> rim<00:01:02.670> off<00:01:03.110> there's<00:01:04.110> one<00:01:04.530> screw

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.590 

screw<00:01:24.130> down<00:01:24.310> then<00:01:24.580> what<00:01:24.700> happens<00:01:25.620> this<00:01:26.620> ring

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
screw down then what happens this ring

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.960 
screw down then what happens this ring
comes<00:01:28.600> forward<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.520> you're<00:01:30.640> gonna<00:01:30.730> have<00:01:30.850> to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
comes forward and you're gonna have to

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.430 
comes forward and you're gonna have to
pull<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.210> whole<00:01:31.420> headlight<00:01:31.810> out<00:01:31.960> if<00:01:32.200> you<00:01:32.260> like

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
pull the whole headlight out if you like

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.430 
pull the whole headlight out if you like
and<00:01:33.160> then<00:01:33.340> now<00:01:33.970> we've<00:01:34.510> had<00:01:34.690> this<00:01:34.840> just<00:01:35.200> Wharf

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
and then now we've had this just Wharf

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.410 
and then now we've had this just Wharf
but<00:01:35.650> it<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.190> one<00:01:36.400> when<00:01:36.670> we<00:01:36.760> did<00:01:36.910> take<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.300> it

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
but it the one when we did take it it

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.570 
but it the one when we did take it it
was<00:01:37.540> quite<00:01:37.750> rusty<00:01:38.290> it<00:01:38.350> was<00:01:38.470> stuck<00:01:38.710> on<00:01:38.740> so<00:01:39.490> you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
was quite rusty it was stuck on so you

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.670 
was quite rusty it was stuck on so you
may<00:01:39.730> need<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:40.080> wriggle<00:01:41.080> it<00:01:41.170> off<00:01:41.260> a<00:01:41.290> little<00:01:41.530> bit

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
may need to wriggle it off a little bit

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.910 
may need to wriggle it off a little bit
so<00:01:42.010> that's<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.490> rim<00:01:42.790> that's<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.920> retaining

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
so that's the rim that's the retaining

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.740 
so that's the rim that's the retaining
ring<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:45.910> then<00:01:46.060> this<00:01:46.210> is<00:01:46.420> your<00:01:46.570> main

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
ring and then this is your main

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.080 
ring and then this is your main
headlight<00:01:47.430> assembly<00:01:48.430> here<00:01:48.610> so<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:48.910> is<00:01:49.060> the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
headlight assembly here so this is the

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.340 
headlight assembly here so this is the
old<00:01:49.330> type<00:01:49.660> this<00:01:49.810> is<00:01:49.900> what<00:01:50.020> they<00:01:50.080> call<00:01:50.229> the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
old type this is what they call the

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.969 
old type this is what they call the
pre-focus<00:01:50.830> bulb<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:52.360> that's<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.470> connection

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
pre-focus bulb so that's the connection

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.640 
pre-focus bulb so that's the connection
on<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.250> back<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:54.940> then<00:01:55.570> this<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.380> old

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
on the back and then this is the old

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.130 
on the back and then this is the old
three<00:01:57.070> focused<00:01:57.700> bulb<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:58.660> this<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:58.900> not<00:01:59.080> a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
three focused bulb so this is not a

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.140 
three focused bulb so this is not a
halogen<00:01:59.770> bulb<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.190> halogen<00:02:00.580> bulbs<00:02:00.880> are<00:02:01.000> much

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
halogen bulb the halogen bulbs are much

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.719 
halogen bulb the halogen bulbs are much
better<00:02:01.390> than<00:02:02.170> this<00:02:02.350> but<00:02:02.860> that's<00:02:03.040> a<00:02:03.190> dip<00:02:03.430> and

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
better than this but that's a dip and

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.170 
better than this but that's a dip and
main<00:02:04.450> beam<00:02:04.690> but<00:02:05.140> obviously<00:02:05.470> with<00:02:05.590> these<00:02:05.710> old

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
main beam but obviously with these old

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.419 
main beam but obviously with these old
headlights<00:02:07.180> they're<00:02:07.600> reflectors<00:02:08.170> go<00:02:08.470> rusty

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
headlights they're reflectors go rusty

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.070 
headlights they're reflectors go rusty
now<00:02:10.149> these<00:02:10.330> are<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:10.570> new<00:02:10.780> replacement

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
now these are the new replacement

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.680 
now these are the new replacement
upgrade<00:02:11.740> headlights<00:02:12.190> we<00:02:12.430> sell<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.450> first

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
upgrade headlights we sell and the first

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.330 
upgrade headlights we sell and the first
thing<00:02:13.930> you'll<00:02:14.050> notice<00:02:14.290> we<00:02:14.769> get<00:02:14.920> them<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.130> same

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
thing you'll notice we get them the same

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.120 
thing you'll notice we get them the same
way<00:02:15.519> around<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.870> on<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.440> one<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.920> beam

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
way around is that on this one the beam

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.330 
way around is that on this one the beam
pattern<00:02:18.430> was<00:02:18.880> set<00:02:19.209> by<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.720> by<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.680> lens<00:02:21.010> in

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
pattern was set by the by the lens in

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.940 
pattern was set by the by the lens in
part<00:02:21.670> on<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.360> one<00:02:22.630> it's<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:23.050> all<00:02:23.260> set<00:02:23.680> by

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
part on this one it's it's all set by

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.190 
part on this one it's it's all set by
the<00:02:24.010> reflector<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:24.940> that's<00:02:25.690> because<00:02:26.019> of<00:02:26.140> the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
the reflector and that's because of the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.940 
the reflector and that's because of the
plastic<00:02:26.700> technology<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:27.910> molded<00:02:28.360> plastic<00:02:28.950> so

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
plastic technology is molded plastic so

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.670 
plastic technology is molded plastic so
okay<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.090> what<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.750> may<00:02:31.930> have<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.290> do<00:02:32.470> is

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
okay so what you may have to do is

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.710 
okay so what you may have to do is
change<00:02:32.950> your<00:02:33.100> wiring<00:02:33.430> if<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.880> haven't<00:02:34.239> got<00:02:34.510> if

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
change your wiring if you haven't got if

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.870 
change your wiring if you haven't got if
you've<00:02:34.840> got<00:02:35.019> a<00:02:35.050> sealed<00:02:35.380> beam<00:02:35.739> unit<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.670> will

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
you've got a sealed beam unit it will

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.210 
you've got a sealed beam unit it will
have<00:02:37.000> this<00:02:37.180> same<00:02:37.480> three<00:02:37.870> pin<00:02:38.140> connection<00:02:38.739> so

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
have this same three pin connection so

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.360 
have this same three pin connection so
you<00:02:39.250> see<00:02:39.549> a<00:02:39.580> beam<00:02:39.850> unit<00:02:40.299> will<00:02:41.260> be<00:02:41.380> fine<00:02:41.650> you

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
you see a beam unit will be fine you

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.550 
you see a beam unit will be fine you
just<00:02:42.430> have<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.850> buy<00:02:43.000> some<00:02:43.209> halogen<00:02:43.660> h4<00:02:44.110> bulbs

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
just have to buy some halogen h4 bulbs

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.190 
just have to buy some halogen h4 bulbs
we<00:02:45.459> do<00:02:45.700> supply<00:02:46.000> those<00:02:46.330> as<00:02:46.600> well<00:02:46.810> on<00:02:47.019> our

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
we do supply those as well on our

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.380 
we do supply those as well on our
website<00:02:47.739> and<00:02:48.489> then<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.730> have<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.000> fit<00:02:49.209> these

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
website and then you have to fit these

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.240 
website and then you have to fit these
into<00:02:49.900> here<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:52.570> top<00:02:52.930> don't<00:02:53.620> touch<00:02:54.010> the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
into here so the top don't touch the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.880 
into here so the top don't touch the
glass<00:02:54.370> bit<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.360> top<00:02:55.630> pin<00:02:56.140> is<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.470> big<00:02:56.650> pin

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
glass bit the top pin is the big pin

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.500 
glass bit the top pin is the big pin
there's<00:02:57.130> three<00:02:57.340> pins<00:02:57.640> on<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.030> back<00:02:58.180> I'll<00:02:58.480> show

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
there's three pins on the back I'll show

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.850 
there's three pins on the back I'll show
you<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:58.989> we<00:02:59.080> put<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.470> and<00:03:00.100> that<00:03:00.340> sits<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:01.030> there

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
you and we put it and that sits in there

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.620 
you and we put it and that sits in there
okay<00:03:02.860> like<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.519> so<00:03:03.760> this<00:03:03.880> is<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.209> top<00:03:04.420> you've

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
okay like so so this is the top you've

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.370 
okay like so so this is the top you've
got<00:03:04.660> these<00:03:04.840> three<00:03:05.200> pins<00:03:05.500> there

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
got these three pins there

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.040 
got these three pins there
and<00:03:06.590> then<00:03:06.830> this<00:03:07.340> wire<00:03:07.730> clip<00:03:08.240> just<00:03:08.510> sits<00:03:08.810> on<00:03:08.990> the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
and then this wire clip just sits on the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.090 
and then this wire clip just sits on the
outside<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.800> that<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.610> then<00:03:10.850> clips<00:03:11.300> under

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
outside of that and then clips under

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.040 
outside of that and then clips under
yeah<00:03:13.100> so<00:03:13.340> one<00:03:13.580> clips<00:03:13.940> under<00:03:14.270> there<00:03:14.450> two<00:03:14.780> clips

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
yeah so one clips under there two clips

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.480 
yeah so one clips under there two clips
under<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.410> some<00:03:15.860> of<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.010> headlights<00:03:16.310> have

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
under that some of the headlights have

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.000 
under that some of the headlights have
different<00:03:16.820> systems<00:03:17.000> but<00:03:17.990> you<00:03:18.170> see<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.500> can

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
different systems but you see that can

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.040 
different systems but you see that can
be<00:03:19.130> used<00:03:19.400> as<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.700> direct<00:03:20.120> replacement<00:03:20.450> for<00:03:21.020> a

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
be used as a direct replacement for a

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.510 
be used as a direct replacement for a
steel<00:03:21.260> beam<00:03:21.530> unit<00:03:21.950> because<00:03:22.100> they'll<00:03:22.220> have<00:03:22.370> the

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
steel beam unit because they'll have the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.580 
steel beam unit because they'll have the
same<00:03:22.550> three<00:03:22.970> pins<00:03:23.300> but<00:03:24.050> if<00:03:24.200> you've<00:03:24.350> got<00:03:24.470> the

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
same three pins but if you've got the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.710 
same three pins but if you've got the
pre<00:03:24.800> focused<00:03:25.310> one<00:03:25.550> what<00:03:26.150> you'll<00:03:26.300> have<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.510> do

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
pre focused one what you'll have to do

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.010 
pre focused one what you'll have to do
is<00:03:26.900> connect<00:03:27.320> cut<00:03:27.860> these<00:03:28.100> three<00:03:28.580> connect<00:03:29.450> these

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
is connect cut these three connect these

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.820 
is connect cut these three connect these
three<00:03:30.320> wires<00:03:30.590> here<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.510> fit<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.750> h4<00:03:33.410> headlight

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
three wires here and fit a h4 headlight

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.610 
three wires here and fit a h4 headlight
connector<00:03:34.360> and<00:03:35.360> if<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.600> just<00:03:35.780> go<00:03:36.380> over<00:03:36.500> here

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
connector and if you just go over here

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.850 
connector and if you just go over here
so<00:03:37.280> if<00:03:37.370> this<00:03:37.520> is<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.790> h4<00:03:38.360> bulb<00:03:38.570> here<00:03:39.140> this

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
so if this is a h4 bulb here this

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.090 
so if this is a h4 bulb here this
connection<00:03:40.490> here<00:03:40.820> is<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.840> main<00:03:42.050> beam<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.860> top

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
connection here is the main beam the top

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.190 
connection here is the main beam the top
one<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.460> the<00:03:43.490> dip<00:03:43.790> beam<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.510> this<00:03:44.630> one<00:03:44.870> on<00:03:45.020> the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
one is the dip beam and this one on the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.050 
one is the dip beam and this one on the
left<00:03:45.410> is<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.920> earth<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.700> obviously<00:03:46.940> the

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
left is the earth and obviously the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.510 
left is the earth and obviously the
connector<00:03:47.510> block<00:03:47.780> is<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.830> opposite<00:03:49.220> of<00:03:49.340> that

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
connector block is the opposite of that

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.930 
connector block is the opposite of that
okay<00:03:50.360> right<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:51.320> if<00:03:51.800> for<00:03:52.190> now<00:03:52.400> what<00:03:52.760> we'll

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
okay right so if for now what we'll

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.520 
okay right so if for now what we'll
assume<00:03:53.270> is<00:03:53.480> that<00:03:53.630> we've<00:03:53.780> we've<00:03:54.200> made<00:03:54.380> the

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
assume is that we've we've made the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.350 
assume is that we've we've made the
connections<00:03:55.040> on<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.250> back<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:56.180> we've

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
connections on the back and we've

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.660 
connections on the back and we've
plugged<00:03:56.570> those<00:03:56.840> in<00:03:57.110> we<00:03:57.710> do<00:03:57.860> also<00:03:58.220> supply<00:03:58.640> a

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
plugged those in we do also supply a

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.200 
plugged those in we do also supply a
rubber<00:03:59.590> seal<00:04:00.590> here<00:04:00.950> now<00:04:01.460> the<00:04:01.520> purpose<00:04:01.940> of<00:04:02.060> this

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
rubber seal here now the purpose of this

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.380 
rubber seal here now the purpose of this
rubber<00:04:02.480> seal<00:04:02.810> is<00:04:03.410> to<00:04:03.740> fit<00:04:03.980> over<00:04:04.010> here<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:05.240> then

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
rubber seal is to fit over here and then

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.810 
rubber seal is to fit over here and then
if<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.630> push<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:06.050> through<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:07.070> pins<00:04:07.370> come

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
if you push it through the pins come

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.070 
if you push it through the pins come
through<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.300> back<00:04:09.400> okay<00:04:10.430> so<00:04:10.880> push<00:04:11.330> that<00:04:11.360> over

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
through the back okay so push that over

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.510 
through the back okay so push that over
there<00:04:12.260> so<00:04:12.410> you've<00:04:12.530> got<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.740> pins<00:04:12.980> coming<00:04:13.310> out

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
there so you've got the pins coming out

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.640 
there so you've got the pins coming out
and<00:04:13.970> that<00:04:14.150> just<00:04:14.360> keeps<00:04:14.570> any<00:04:14.900> water<00:04:15.230> that<00:04:15.470> gets

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
and that just keeps any water that gets

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.890 
and that just keeps any water that gets
in<00:04:16.190> off<00:04:16.610> the<00:04:17.799> off<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.920> bulb<00:04:19.400> and<00:04:20.390> getting<00:04:20.750> in

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
in off the off the bulb and getting in

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.720 
in off the off the bulb and getting in
so<00:04:21.710> obviously<00:04:21.980> if<00:04:22.100> we've<00:04:22.220> changed<00:04:22.520> that

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
so obviously if we've changed that

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.790 
so obviously if we've changed that
connector<00:04:23.360> this<00:04:23.720> goes<00:04:23.960> on<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:24.530> you've<00:04:24.650> got

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
connector this goes on so you've got

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.730 
connector this goes on so you've got
these<00:04:24.920> three<00:04:25.540> lugs<00:04:26.540> here<00:04:26.960> on<00:04:27.170> the<00:04:27.260> back<00:04:27.470> and

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
these three lugs here on the back and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.220 
these three lugs here on the back and
they<00:04:28.190> locate<00:04:28.700> with<00:04:28.940> these<00:04:29.150> three<00:04:29.540> lugs<00:04:29.900> here

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
they locate with these three lugs here

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.620 
they locate with these three lugs here
so<00:04:31.160> make<00:04:31.430> sure<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:31.640> go<00:04:31.790> to<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:32.060> right<00:04:32.240> in<00:04:32.510> the

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
so make sure you go to the right in the

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.520 
so make sure you go to the right in the
right<00:04:32.810> way<00:04:33.050> up<00:04:33.230> and<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.560> should<00:04:33.890> all<00:04:35.320> back<00:04:36.320> it

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
right way up and it should all back it

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.340 
right way up and it should all back it
should<00:04:36.710> all<00:04:36.890> line<00:04:37.220> up<00:04:37.360> okay<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:39.020> then<00:04:39.200> what

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
should all line up okay and then what

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.320 
should all line up okay and then what
you've<00:04:39.440> got<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:39.650> do<00:04:39.770> is<00:04:39.890> get<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.250> outer<00:04:40.790> ring

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
you've got to do is get the outer ring

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.240 
you've got to do is get the outer ring
now<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.050> outer<00:04:42.260> ring<00:04:42.560> normy<00:04:42.800> has<00:04:42.890> a<00:04:42.920> little

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
now the outer ring normy has a little

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.520 
now the outer ring normy has a little
seam<00:04:43.910> in<00:04:44.120> it<00:04:44.150> which<00:04:44.300> normally<00:04:44.660> goes<00:04:44.780> towards

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
seam in it which normally goes towards

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.830 
seam in it which normally goes towards
the<00:04:45.590> bottom<00:04:48.160> it<00:04:49.160> only<00:04:49.400> goes<00:04:49.670> in<00:04:49.940> one<00:04:49.970> way<00:04:50.240> that

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
the bottom it only goes in one way that

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.740 
the bottom it only goes in one way that
only<00:04:51.800> line<00:04:52.160> up<00:04:52.430> one<00:04:52.700> way<00:04:53.200> that

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:10.760 

at<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.960> strip

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.170 

start<00:05:11.770> at<00:05:11.950> the<00:05:12.040> top<00:05:12.280> it<00:05:12.490> only<00:05:12.640> makes<00:05:12.910> it<00:05:13.060> a

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
start at the top it only makes it a

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.030 
start at the top it only makes it a
little<00:05:13.330> easier

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:39.380 

okay<00:05:23.080> second<00:05:24.080> one<00:05:24.200> in

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:47.750 

pointillism<00:05:45.110> now<00:05:46.160> clamp<00:05:47.160> the<00:05:47.400> headlight

gradient I'd like fitted and you get

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.380 
gradient I'd like fitted and you get
much<00:06:10.440> better<00:06:10.740> light<00:06:10.980> out<00:06:11.190> from<00:06:11.610> that<00:06:11.760> it<00:06:12.030> may

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
much better light out from that it may

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.570 
much better light out from that it may
be<00:06:12.450> advisable<00:06:12.810> depending<00:06:13.710> on<00:06:13.830> your<00:06:14.040> car<00:06:14.340> wire
