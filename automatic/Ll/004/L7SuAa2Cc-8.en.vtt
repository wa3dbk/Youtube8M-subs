00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.969 
scary for them to leave or is the
paradigm<00:05:28.169> shift<00:05:28.620> changing<00:05:29.250> where<00:05:30.860> you<00:05:31.860> know

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
paradigm shift changing where you know

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.740 
paradigm shift changing where you know
there's<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.520> lot<00:05:32.550> more<00:05:32.729> people<00:05:33.270> doing<00:05:33.630> it

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
there's a lot more people doing it

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.649 
there's a lot more people doing it
because<00:05:34.560> they<00:05:34.830> have<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.729> option<00:05:36.000> to<00:05:36.270> do<00:05:36.509> it

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
because they have the option to do it

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.010 
because they have the option to do it
and<00:05:37.340> you<00:05:38.340> know<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:38.460> was<00:05:38.969> I<00:05:39.240> was<00:05:39.300> always<00:05:39.570> trying

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 
to figure it out like maybe just because

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.520 
to figure it out like maybe just because
more<00:05:41.940> people<00:05:41.969> are<00:05:42.210> doing<00:05:42.479> it<00:05:42.599> people<00:05:42.990> are<00:05:43.169> more

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
more people are doing it people are more

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
their facilities you know like we're

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.749 
their facilities you know like we're
just<00:06:21.000> so<00:06:21.240> connected<00:06:21.750> now<00:06:21.949> I'm<00:06:22.949> really

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
just so connected now I'm really

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.320 
just so connected now I'm really
thinking<00:06:24.120> that<00:06:24.659> there's<00:06:25.020> always<00:06:25.409> been<00:06:25.800> that

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
thinking that there's always been that

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.439 
thinking that there's always been that
that<00:06:27.330> subgroup<00:06:27.719> out<00:06:28.139> there<00:06:28.409> and<00:06:29.300> you<00:06:30.300> know

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:30.449 
that subgroup out there and you know

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.079 
that subgroup out there and you know
like<00:06:31.229> they<00:06:31.469> if<00:06:31.740> they<00:06:31.949> did<00:06:32.159> have<00:06:32.370> a<00:06:32.400> lot<00:06:32.880> harder

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:33.089 
like they if they did have a lot harder

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:34.370 
like they if they did have a lot harder
than<00:06:33.210> we<00:06:33.449> do<00:06:33.599> today<00:06:33.630> and

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
than we do today and

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.620 
than we do today and
that<00:06:34.500> is<00:06:34.710> one<00:06:35.340> percent<00:06:35.820> true<00:06:36.060> but<00:06:36.300> we're<00:06:36.450> so

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
that is one percent true but we're so

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.150 
that is one percent true but we're so
connected<00:06:36.900> now<00:06:37.170> I<00:06:37.200> think<00:06:37.350> there's<00:06:37.770> just<00:06:38.010> this

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
connected now I think there's just this

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.760 
connected now I think there's just this
huge<00:06:38.460> paradigm<00:06:38.910> shift<00:06:39.360> going<00:06:39.570> on<00:06:39.780> where

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
huge paradigm shift going on where

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.950 
huge paradigm shift going on where
people<00:06:41.310> are<00:06:41.460> seeing<00:06:41.760> this<00:06:42.000> lifestyle<00:06:42.600> and

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
people are seeing this lifestyle and

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.660 
people are seeing this lifestyle and
they're<00:06:43.860> really<00:06:44.100> seeing<00:06:44.370> the<00:06:44.550> opportunities

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670 
they're really seeing the opportunities

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.960 
they're really seeing the opportunities
and<00:06:45.420> without<00:06:46.200> the<00:06:46.380> people<00:06:46.650> that<00:06:47.010> that<00:06:47.520> came

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970
