00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 three networks all this new one 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.299
 video welcome to the new episode of 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.550
 blu ray news section in which I will deepen 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.090
 the outputs of the week in edition 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.040
 blu ray 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.349
 unlike the previous bet in 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.450
 this episode I will not talk about different 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.850
 blu ray but of a single big one 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.250
 a special casket set 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.710
 expected I'm talking about the second one 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.689
 season of the throne of swords or for like 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.250
 like to call it me game of thrones that 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.349
 would then be the original title 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.849
 however before talking about quality 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.410
 I would like real discs 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.660
 talk to you a little better about the package 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.340
 for this part, I apologize if the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.290
 video is slightly flickering ever 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.610
 fact that after the tripod fails 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.469
 to get in position totally 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.170
 horizontal so I have to resume with 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.500
 the camera by hand then the casket 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.309
 presents itself in this capacity with the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.440
 written title of the fronts and the list 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.379
 of special contents 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.899
 however this first second facade 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.969
 me does not hold the comparison with the facade 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.559
 of the first season for the simple 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.199
 made that the first seasonal one at this 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.330
 frame in relief where they are present 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.030
 these figures in relief that gave 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.310
 really a nice touch to this 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.229
 casket also of built nature 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.250
 the earth these reliefs were present 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.140
 according to me very very beautiful thing that 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.060
 instead the second season did not give 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.860
 than from our nature and smooth if not 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.210
 if it were insisted some relief vi 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.220
 I still apologize for the red light 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.680
 of the mobile 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.720
 however this sin of the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.090
 Dust jacket is immediately forgiven 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.000
 when we go to remove the box 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.340
 because we removed the dust jacket 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.829
 this real box set with 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.990
 all the marks that the symbols of 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.790
 really beautiful houses so it is 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.650
 properly the throne of swords that 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.170
 the article to the series 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.210
 also remove the box not me too 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.830
 it's like the first season here too 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.060
 all the characters here we have the day 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.479
 active goblin also my character 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.500
 preferred own status and nina mister 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:11.220
 danieli star game the reggina serse 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:14.200
 and here the bus for all the various disks 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.790
 as for the first season here too 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.300
 each disk contains a number 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.640
 unspecified of episodes here for example 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.780
 on record 1 we have two episodes 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.209
 2 we have episodes 34 in disk three 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.330
 have of episodes 5 6 and 7 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.920
 on disk 4 we used 89 gods 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.900
 speeches that we do not have the episode 10 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.700
 with lots of special content for each 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.280
 single disc the booklet contains the 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.530
 description of each single family that 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.600
 intends to ascend to the throne of swords as well 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.200
 information on each individual 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.360
 episode 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.829
 and if it opens we have a map of everything 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.390
 the realm of these rose bowl is 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.310
 the series is set 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.200
 having said this the series composed of 10 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.420
 episodes is presented to us in five 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.250
 discs in which the episodes are spaces 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.570
 in the order I showed you before 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.970
 quality of each episode is really 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.820
 amazingly honestly I believe it 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.489
 higher than the quality of the first of the 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.160
 first season which was also excellent 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.570
 but in my opinion it didn't make the most of it 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.700
 the potential that high definition 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.680
 could give only flaw of this 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.360
 edition which is also a flaw of 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.830
 first season is the fact that i 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.620
 special contents are not included 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.860
 the comments are smeared on every single one 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.170
 disc with along with the episodes in the sense 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.870
 that there is no gigantic making of 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.270
 of the interview documentary 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.730
 rather, there are only one 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.990
 series of short documentaries dedicated to 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.120
 single episodes 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.610
 the found without doubt interesting but 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.230
 which for mine is very shaken because if 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.330
 a person wants to see content 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.220
 specific specials can not do 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.050
 reliance on a single disk but if not 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.880
 please remember which disk is at risk of 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.980
 come out really low a small one 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.060
 curiosity about the subtitles of both 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.890
 one of evenings the series in language 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.540
 original dubbed indication 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.180
 obviously there are scenes that in 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.670
 which an imaginary language speaks of 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.530
 these scenes are obviously 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.600
 subtitled however at the end of each 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.489
 single episode just before the start 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.950
 of tail errors appears at the bottom 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.049
 at the screen subtitles taken care of with 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.430
 the name of the curators is nothing 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.130
 particularly strange though 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.890
 personally I have never seen a similar one 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.780
 notation in other dvd's or blu ray and not 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.670
 to do without making me smile because of me 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.360
 very reminiscent of the sub fans who turn up 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.470
 Internet 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.620
 however it is an edition 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.780
 truly an example for how 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.520
 should be the blu ray when you are 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.990
 speaks of television series 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.580
 I in blue ray of television series not 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.320
 I own very much the first three 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.260
 lost seasons and the first season of 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.880
 of the throne of swords the first season of the 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.280
 throne of swords as well as three thrillers 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.930
 lost seasons are beautiful in high 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.330
 definition however in my opinion not 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.130
 exploit their full potential 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.500
 the second season of the throne of swords 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.419
 instead it is a wonder for the eyes 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.800
 as well as for the ears 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.990
 unfortunately the Italian audio is not 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.610
 reported in high definition while 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.169
 in the English edition of course yes 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.820
 since it is the audio master 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.680
 however the Italian track is anyway 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.580
 in digital surround and truly deserves 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.070
 very 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.979
 on balance an excellent edition of the vote 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.110
 why blu ray a 9:30 does not 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.090
 I give full marks because I am second 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.950
 me there is this defect that i 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.990
 special contents are spread for i 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.950
 various discs and not in a single disc of 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.050
 special contents 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.310
 the video ends here I hope there is 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.820
 liked it and not 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.820
 see you next time
