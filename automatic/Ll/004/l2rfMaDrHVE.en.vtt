00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
excited about the latest version it's

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.259 
excited about the latest version it's
been<00:00:27.570> off<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.840> past<00:00:28.109> couple<00:00:28.289> days<00:00:28.789> because<00:00:29.789> it

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
been off the past couple days because it

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.999 
been off the past couple days because it
added<00:00:30.480> some<00:00:30.750> parts<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.199> allow<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.800> build

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
added some parts that allow you to build

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.910 
added some parts that allow you to build
Rovers<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:33.300> actual<00:00:33.809> wheels<00:00:34.230> instead<00:00:34.860> of

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
Rovers like actual wheels instead of

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.760 
Rovers like actual wheels instead of
fuse<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.370> landing<00:00:35.700> gears<00:00:36.059> as<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.770> actually

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
fuse and landing gears as we actually

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.299 
fuse and landing gears as we actually
have<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.520> little<00:00:39.000> bit<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.210> suspension<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.930> them

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
have a little bit of suspension to them

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.470 
have a little bit of suspension to them
and<00:00:41.309> actual<00:00:42.030> tires<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.570> good<00:00:42.719> part<00:00:43.910> just<00:00:44.910> snap

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and actual tires the good part just snap

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.430 
and actual tires the good part just snap
off<00:00:48.079> anyway

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
off anyway

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.160 
off anyway
so<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.789> course<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.149> could<00:00:51.300> take<00:00:51.480> roofers<00:00:52.020> to

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
so of course you could take roofers to

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.600 
so of course you could take roofers to
other<00:00:52.260> planets<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.800> stuff<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> attach

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
other planets and stuff with the attach

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.150 
other planets and stuff with the attach
them<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> rocket<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:55.199> I've<00:00:55.500> been<00:00:55.770> mostly

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
them to a rocket but I've been mostly

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.150 
them to a rocket but I've been mostly
interested<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:57.030> just<00:00:57.800> driving<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.859> beretta

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
interested in just driving a beretta

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.529 
interested in just driving a beretta
that<00:00:59.430> I've<00:00:59.550> been<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> testing<00:01:00.090> how<00:01:00.210> various

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
that I've been a testing how various

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.420 
that I've been a testing how various
things<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.260> with<00:01:01.379> them<00:01:01.500> before<00:01:02.399> I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
things you can do with them before I

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.939 
things you can do with them before I
attempt<00:01:02.879> something<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.260> take<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.860> to

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
attempt something so just to take it to

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.469 
attempt something so just to take it to
the<00:01:05.040> moon<00:01:05.189> or<00:01:05.549> dinner<00:01:05.790> or<00:01:06.030> something<00:01:06.270> like

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the moon or dinner or something like

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.469 
the moon or dinner or something like
that<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> interesting

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that and so one of the interesting

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.750 
that and so one of the interesting
designs<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.409> came<00:01:10.470> up<00:01:10.650> with<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.400> got<00:01:11.520> more

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
designs that I came up with we got more

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.960 
designs that I came up with we got more
late<00:01:12.510> last<00:01:12.720> night<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.280> early<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.430> morning

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
late last night or early this morning

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.200 
late last night or early this morning
was<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:16.400> tentatively<00:01:17.400> calling<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
was this tentatively calling it the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.660 
was this tentatively calling it the
launcher<00:01:18.840> because<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> call<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.250> anything<00:01:20.549> I

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
launcher because I call it anything I

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.120 
launcher because I call it anything I
wanted<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:21.990> too<00:01:22.350> funny<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.830> morning

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
wanted but it was too funny the morning

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.300 
wanted but it was too funny the morning
so<00:01:23.400> that's<00:01:24.060> what<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> ended<00:01:24.420> up<00:01:24.689> naming

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
so that's what I ended up naming

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.270 
so that's what I ended up naming
and<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.380> I'm<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> go<00:01:28.890> ahead<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.160> go<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and so I'm going to go ahead and go to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.250

and<00:02:09.170> apply<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.229> brakes<00:02:10.500> full<00:02:11.370> stop<00:02:11.700> there

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
and apply the brakes full stop there

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.340 
and apply the brakes full stop there
it's<00:02:13.020> like<00:02:13.110> parking<00:02:13.470> brakes<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:15.170> anyway<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
it's like parking brakes and anyway the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.740 
it's like parking brakes and anyway the
most<00:02:16.470> interesting<00:02:17.040> part<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.370> my<00:02:17.750> little

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
most interesting part of my little

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.229 
most interesting part of my little
creation<00:02:19.290> here<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:20.489> course<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.910> launcher

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
creation here is of course the launcher

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.420 
creation here is of course the launcher
itself<00:02:21.300> which<00:02:21.989> is<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.350> solid<00:02:22.739> rocket<00:02:22.920> booster

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
itself which is the solid rocket booster

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.910 
itself which is the solid rocket booster
with<00:02:24.270> some<00:02:24.450> wings<00:02:24.630> on<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.930> for<00:02:25.080> guidance<00:02:25.410> trust

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
with some wings on it for guidance trust

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.310 
with some wings on it for guidance trust
me<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.220> needs<00:02:26.430> these<00:02:26.640> huh<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.480> little<00:02:27.840> nose<00:02:28.020> cone

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
me it needs these huh a little nose cone

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.420 
me it needs these huh a little nose cone
just<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.920> look<00:02:29.430> fancy<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:31.280> there's<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.340> little

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
just to look fancy and there's a little

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.900 
just to look fancy and there's a little
back<00:02:32.640> board<00:02:32.940> here<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:34.489> put<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.610> there<00:02:35.670> because

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
back board here I put that there because

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.009 
back board here I put that there because
I<00:02:36.090> don't<00:02:36.239> know<00:02:36.330> if<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.570> helps<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.870> get<00:02:36.959> a

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
I don't know if that helps it get a

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.289 
I don't know if that helps it get a
little<00:02:37.140> bit<00:02:37.350> of<00:02:37.440> thrust<00:02:37.709> or<00:02:37.980> if<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:38.970> just

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
little bit of thrust or if it's just

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.000 
little bit of thrust or if it's just
kind<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.140> way<00:02:40.260> you'd<00:02:40.410> see<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.709> in<00:02:40.830> real

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
kind of the way you'd see it in real

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.259 
kind of the way you'd see it in real
life<00:02:41.040> with<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.459> little<00:02:41.760> backboard<00:02:42.209> -<00:02:42.980> for<00:02:43.980> the

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
life with a little backboard - for the

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.820 
life with a little backboard - for the
thrust<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.420> hit<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.900> it's<00:02:46.140> way<00:02:46.290> down<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:46.739> it

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
thrust to hit and it's way down so it

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.350 
thrust to hit and it's way down so it
doesn't<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:47.250> blast<00:02:47.549> everywhere<00:02:48.209> or

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
doesn't just blast everywhere or

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.240 
doesn't just blast everywhere or
whatever<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.930> don't<00:02:49.680> know<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:49.799> just<00:02:50.070> thought<00:02:50.190> it

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
whatever I don't know I just thought it

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.370 
whatever I don't know I just thought it
was<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.489> nice<00:02:50.640> touch

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
was a nice touch

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.319 
was a nice touch
anyway<00:02:55.370> what<00:02:56.370> you're<00:02:56.489> supposed<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.880> do<00:02:57.090> is

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
anyway what you're supposed to do is

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.289 
anyway what you're supposed to do is
just<00:02:58.049> hit<00:02:58.290> Action<00:02:59.100> Group<00:02:59.130> 1<00:02:59.640> which<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.090> just

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
just hit Action Group 1 which is just

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.479 
just hit Action Group 1 which is just
the<00:03:00.480> one<00:03:00.660> button<00:03:00.930> on<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.350> keyboard<00:03:01.950> which<00:03:02.370> I

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
the one button on the keyboard which I

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.000 
the one button on the keyboard which I
set<00:03:02.730> up<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.150> decouple<00:03:04.079> this<00:03:04.470> thing<00:03:04.739> from<00:03:04.950> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
set up to decouple this thing from the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:16.030 
set up to decouple this thing from the
launcher<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.850> fire<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.690> rocket<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.230> so

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.949 

far<00:03:17.040> away<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:18.120> end<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.420> runway<00:03:18.599> is<00:03:18.780> all

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
far away the end of the runway is all

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.990 
far away the end of the runway is all
the<00:03:19.050> way<00:03:19.170> down<00:03:19.200> there<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.879> was

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
the way down there and so that was

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.690 
the way down there and so that was
pretty<00:03:21.180> cool<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.980> can't<00:03:23.190> go<00:03:23.310> back<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.489> my

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
pretty cool and I can't go back to my

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.000 
pretty cool and I can't go back to my
Rover<00:03:23.940> but<00:03:25.700> if<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.819> hit<00:03:26.970> restart<00:03:27.420> flight<00:03:28.010> you

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
Rover but if I hit restart flight you

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.280 
Rover but if I hit restart flight you
may<00:03:29.130> have<00:03:29.280> noticed<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:30.090> rover<00:03:30.569> recoiled

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
may have noticed that the rover recoiled

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.440 
may have noticed that the rover recoiled
significantly<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:32.190> you'd<00:03:32.340> be<00:03:32.459> thinking<00:03:32.640> well

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
significantly so you'd be thinking well

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.900 
significantly so you'd be thinking well
why<00:03:33.599> don't<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.900> just<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:35.250> know<00:03:35.370> hit<00:03:35.880> the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
why don't you just you know hit the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.630 
why don't you just you know hit the
parking<00:03:36.360> brake<00:03:36.680> so<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.799> doesn't<00:03:38.040> recoil<00:03:38.400> so

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
parking brake so it doesn't recoil so

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.490 
parking brake so it doesn't recoil so
much<00:03:38.819> so<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.090> doesn't<00:03:39.390> roll<00:03:39.599> 50<00:03:40.349> feet

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
much so it doesn't roll 50 feet

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.050 
much so it doesn't roll 50 feet
backwards<00:03:40.739> across<00:03:41.069> the<00:03:41.400> ground<00:03:41.610> or<00:03:41.790> whatever

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
backwards across the ground or whatever

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:50.800 
backwards across the ground or whatever
and<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.569> would<00:03:43.560> be<00:03:43.680> because<00:03:43.830> this<00:03:44.819> happens

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.870 

and<00:03:51.810> see<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.290> lands<00:03:52.560> all<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:53.310> way<00:03:53.400> over<00:03:53.760> there

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
and see it lands all the way over there

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.800 
and see it lands all the way over there
that's<00:03:54.120> pretty<00:03:54.329> awesome<00:03:55.370> one<00:03:56.370> more<00:03:56.810> quick

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
that's pretty awesome one more quick

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.370 
that's pretty awesome one more quick
thing<00:03:58.099> restart<00:03:59.099> flight

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.800 

I<00:04:01.940> tried<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.840> set<00:04:04.110> up<00:04:04.230> action<00:04:05.190> group<00:04:05.400> -<00:04:05.810> and

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
I tried to set up action group - and

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.540 
I tried to set up action group - and
these<00:04:07.050> little<00:04:07.380> Lander<00:04:07.800> legs<00:04:08.040> that<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.370> could

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
these little Lander legs that I could

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.180 
these little Lander legs that I could
hit<00:04:08.640> that<00:04:08.850> first<00:04:09.270> and<00:04:09.770> maybe<00:04:10.770> that<00:04:11.040> would

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
hit that first and maybe that would

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.330 
hit that first and maybe that would
stabilize<00:04:11.520> me<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.770> you<00:04:13.770> know<00:04:13.890> I'm<00:04:14.010> aware<00:04:14.160> that

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
stabilize me and you know I'm aware that

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.860 
stabilize me and you know I'm aware that
I<00:04:14.520> could<00:04:14.700> just<00:04:14.820> remove<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.300> backboard<00:04:15.750> or

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
I could just remove the backboard or

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.150 
I could just remove the backboard or
whatever<00:04:16.110> but<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.380> think<00:04:16.440> it's<00:04:16.739> pretty<00:04:16.890> cool

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
whatever but I think it's pretty cool

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.820 
whatever but I think it's pretty cool
and<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:18.150> wanted<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.870> be<00:04:18.989> kind<00:04:19.170> of<00:04:19.290> realistic

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
and I wanted it to be kind of realistic

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.370 
and I wanted it to be kind of realistic
and<00:04:20.010> have<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.459> back<00:04:21.270> plate<00:04:21.630> for<00:04:22.050> the<00:04:22.140> thrust

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
and have that back plate for the thrust

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.620 
and have that back plate for the thrust
to<00:04:22.530> bounce<00:04:23.160> off<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.490> so<00:04:24.030> I'm<00:04:24.180> not<00:04:24.330> removing

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
to bounce off of so I'm not removing

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.740 
to bounce off of so I'm not removing
that<00:04:25.460> trying<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.550> deal<00:04:26.760> with<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.150> thrust<00:04:27.570> and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
that trying to deal with the thrust and

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.790 
that trying to deal with the thrust and
realistic<00:04:28.110> way<00:04:28.320> or<00:04:28.560> whatever<00:04:28.910> but<00:04:30.380> these<00:04:31.380> legs

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
realistic way or whatever but these legs

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.720 
realistic way or whatever but these legs
don't<00:04:37.160> just<00:04:38.160> fine

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
don't just fine

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.950 
don't just fine
but<00:04:39.540> usually<00:04:39.990> those<00:04:40.170> legs<00:04:40.470> just<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:42.360> helps<00:04:42.660> it

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
but usually those legs just it helps it

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.380 
but usually those legs just it helps it
just<00:04:43.440> tip<00:04:43.650> over<00:04:43.830> and<00:04:44.160> a<00:04:44.250> much<00:04:44.430> slower<00:04:44.850> and<00:04:45.210> more

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
just tip over and a much slower and more

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.030 
just tip over and a much slower and more
drawn<00:04:45.690> out<00:04:45.870> of<00:04:46.080> fashion<00:04:46.260> but<00:04:47.930> so<00:04:48.930> anyway<00:04:49.040> we're

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
drawn out of fashion but so anyway we're

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.030 
drawn out of fashion but so anyway we're
gonna<00:04:50.100> end<00:04:50.400> this<00:04:50.610> flight<00:04:51.620> not<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:52.920> was

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
gonna end this flight not that it was

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.490 
gonna end this flight not that it was
much<00:04:53.220> of<00:04:53.250> a<00:04:53.490> flight<00:04:53.870> go<00:04:54.870> back<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.140> the<00:04:55.260> space

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
much of a flight go back to the space

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.420 
much of a flight go back to the space
plane<00:04:55.800> hangar<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.370> then<00:04:57.090> I'm<00:04:57.990> going<00:04:58.260> to<00:04:58.530> pause

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
plane hangar and then I'm going to pause

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.220 
plane hangar and then I'm going to pause
really<00:04:59.790> quick<00:05:00.030> so<00:05:00.330> that<00:05:00.360> if<00:05:00.660> I<00:05:00.780> mess<00:05:00.960> up<00:05:01.080> the

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
really quick so that if I mess up the

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.860 
really quick so that if I mess up the
next<00:05:01.410> segment<00:05:01.590> I<00:05:01.920> can<00:05:02.070> just<00:05:02.250> cut<00:05:02.460> it<00:05:02.550> out

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
next segment I can just cut it out

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.540 
next segment I can just cut it out
anyway<00:05:03.870> be<00:05:04.140> right<00:05:04.260> back

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.369 

okay<00:05:07.240> so<00:05:07.620> I'm<00:05:08.620> back<00:05:08.889> and<00:05:09.250> this<00:05:09.639> is<00:05:09.879> the<00:05:10.419> second

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
okay so I'm back and this is the second

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:12.990 
okay so I'm back and this is the second
version<00:05:11.530> of<00:05:11.830> this<00:05:12.009> you<00:05:12.220> can<00:05:12.400> see<00:05:12.550> I<00:05:12.580> took<00:05:12.699> off

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
version of this you can see I took off

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.550 
version of this you can see I took off
the<00:05:13.180> legs<00:05:13.389> because<00:05:13.629> they<00:05:13.780> were<00:05:13.960> kind<00:05:14.169> of<00:05:14.289> used

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
the legs because they were kind of used

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.309 
the legs because they were kind of used
the<00:05:14.620> same<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:18.580> other<00:05:18.759> major<00:05:19.060> difference

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 
the same and the other major difference

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.800 
the same and the other major difference
is<00:05:20.319> that<00:05:20.490> there's<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.580> little<00:05:21.940> control<00:05:22.360> module

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
is that there's a little control module

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.529 
is that there's a little control module
right<00:05:23.229> before<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.740> nose<00:05:23.919> cover<00:05:24.419> and<00:05:25.419> the

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
right before the nose cover and the

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.390 
right before the nose cover and the
reason<00:05:25.840> for<00:05:25.870> that<00:05:26.050> oh<00:05:26.530> and<00:05:26.860> there's<00:05:27.039> control

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
reason for that oh and there's control

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:36.210 
reason for that oh and there's control
surfaces<00:05:28.000> here<00:05:33.810> and<00:05:34.810> the<00:05:35.530> reason<00:05:35.800> that<00:05:35.830> I<00:05:36.039> went

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
surfaces here and the reason that I went

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.980 
surfaces here and the reason that I went
ahead<00:05:36.280> and<00:05:36.430> started<00:05:36.610> a<00:05:36.909> new<00:05:37.120> video<00:05:37.389> segment

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
ahead and started a new video segment

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.749 
ahead and started a new video segment
here<00:05:38.259> is<00:05:38.289> because<00:05:38.650> sometimes<00:05:39.099> I<00:05:39.280> don't<00:05:39.610> manage

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
here is because sometimes I don't manage

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.339 
here is because sometimes I don't manage
to<00:05:39.940> switch<00:05:40.330> to<00:05:40.539> the<00:05:40.630> correct<00:05:40.870> thing<00:05:41.139> right

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
to switch to the correct thing right

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.499 
to switch to the correct thing right
away<00:05:41.729> you'll<00:05:42.729> see<00:05:42.880> what<00:05:43.030> I<00:05:43.060> mean<00:05:43.240> in<00:05:43.419> a<00:05:43.479> minute

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
away you'll see what I mean in a minute

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.350 
away you'll see what I mean in a minute
because<00:05:44.020> I<00:05:44.229> have<00:05:44.380> to<00:05:44.530> launch<00:05:44.710> this<00:05:45.150> and<00:05:46.150> then<00:05:46.330> I

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
because I have to launch this and then I

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.629 
because I have to launch this and then I
have<00:05:46.449> to<00:05:46.780> switch<00:05:47.199> to<00:05:47.229> it<00:05:47.530> really<00:05:47.680> quick<00:05:48.009> with

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
have to switch to it really quick with

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.059 
have to switch to it really quick with
the<00:05:48.819> bracket<00:05:49.240> keys<00:05:49.270> and<00:05:49.840> sometimes<00:05:50.830> it<00:05:51.039> looks

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
the bracket keys and sometimes it looks

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.189 
the bracket keys and sometimes it looks
like<00:05:51.580> a<00:05:51.610> piece<00:05:51.849> of<00:05:51.880> debris<00:05:52.210> that's<00:05:52.750> near<00:05:53.139> the

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
like a piece of debris that's near the

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.680 
like a piece of debris that's near the
launch<00:05:53.470> pad<00:05:53.710> or<00:05:53.830> something<00:05:54.130> instead<00:05:54.370> and<00:05:54.789> so

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
launch pad or something instead and so

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:05.770 
launch pad or something instead and so
anyway<00:05:56.729> hit<00:05:57.729> action<00:05:58.240> group<00:05:58.449> one

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.570 

guidance

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:22.480 

spin

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.860 

continue<00:06:22.910> to<00:06:23.030> steer

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.470 

yes

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:38.670 

and<00:06:31.480> anyway<00:06:35.340> it's<00:06:36.340> being<00:06:37.300> powered<00:06:37.720> by

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
and anyway it's being powered by

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.140 
and anyway it's being powered by
electricity<00:06:39.100> now<00:06:39.490> just<00:06:40.090> the<00:06:41.760> the<00:06:42.760> control

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
electricity now just the the control

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.720 
electricity now just the the control
surfaces<00:06:43.660> themselves<00:06:43.920> and<00:06:44.920> it<00:06:45.220> has<00:06:45.340> quite<00:06:45.640> a

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
surfaces themselves and it has quite a

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.090 
surfaces themselves and it has quite a
bit<00:06:46.000> of<00:06:46.350> electricity<00:06:47.350> you<00:06:47.710> know<00:06:47.800> it's<00:06:48.010> only

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
bit of electricity you know it's only

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.560 
bit of electricity you know it's only
used<00:06:48.370> about<00:06:48.610> a<00:06:48.640> quarter<00:06:49.030> of<00:06:49.060> its<00:06:49.240> electricity

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
used about a quarter of its electricity

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.530 
used about a quarter of its electricity
so<00:06:49.960> far<00:06:50.230> and<00:06:50.800> it<00:06:51.370> has<00:06:51.520> aerodynamics<00:06:52.270> to<00:06:52.330> help

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.540 
so far and it has aerodynamics to help

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.640 
so far and it has aerodynamics to help
it<00:06:52.780> and<00:06:52.960> so<00:06:53.740> you<00:06:54.400> can<00:06:54.430> kind<00:06:54.760> of<00:06:54.910> still<00:06:55.650> use

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
it and so you can kind of still use

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.820 
it and so you can kind of still use
inertia<00:06:57.070> and<00:06:57.720> aerodynamics<00:06:58.720> it's<00:06:59.260> a<00:06:59.410> point<00:06:59.680> at

00:06:59.820 --> 00:06:59.830 
inertia and aerodynamics it's a point at

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.120 
inertia and aerodynamics it's a point at
where<00:06:59.920> you<00:07:00.070> want<00:07:00.280> it<00:07:00.340> to<00:07:00.460> go<00:07:01.470> and<00:07:02.470> it<00:07:02.770> has<00:07:02.920> some

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130 
where you want it to go and it has some

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.330 
where you want it to go and it has some
basic<00:07:03.460> sis<00:07:03.910> to<00:07:04.180> it<00:07:04.300> so<00:07:04.480> you<00:07:04.540> can<00:07:04.840> set<00:07:05.740> the<00:07:05.860> SAS

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.340 
basic sis to it so you can set the SAS

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:12.240 
basic sis to it so you can set the SAS
and<00:07:06.670> try<00:07:06.970> to<00:07:07.680> allow<00:07:08.680> it<00:07:08.890> to<00:07:10.260> adjust<00:07:11.260> itself<00:07:11.950> for

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
and try to allow it to adjust itself for

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.980 
and try to allow it to adjust itself for
you<00:07:12.400> I'm<00:07:13.300> actually<00:07:13.570> trying<00:07:14.020> to<00:07:14.320> aim<00:07:14.500> for<00:07:14.530> the

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 
you I'm actually trying to aim for the

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:21.180 
you I'm actually trying to aim for the
launcher<00:07:16.990> itself<00:07:18.780> which<00:07:19.780> has<00:07:20.050> come<00:07:20.350> oh<00:07:20.680> no<00:07:20.740> I'm

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190 
launcher itself which has come oh no I'm
