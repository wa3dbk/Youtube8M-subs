00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
bottom and it looks really messy I think

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.570 
bottom and it looks really messy I think
it's<00:02:46.209> because<00:02:46.360> of<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.660> formula<00:02:47.140> so<00:02:48.099> now<00:02:48.310> i'm

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580

make it a lot easier to apply I really

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:36.709 
make it a lot easier to apply I really
like<00:06:35.039> that<00:06:35.280> and<00:06:35.520> if<00:06:35.909> you<00:06:36.030> look<00:06:36.240> at<00:06:36.360> the<00:06:36.389> one

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:36.719 
like that and if you look at the one

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:40.219 
like that and if you look at the one
itself<00:06:37.320> it's<00:06:37.590> so<00:06:38.070> neat<00:06:38.940> it<00:06:39.659> has<00:06:39.900> like<00:06:40.110> these

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
itself it's so neat it has like these

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:42.560 
itself it's so neat it has like these
little<00:06:40.409> fibers<00:06:41.099> that<00:06:41.340> connect<00:06:41.759> to<00:06:41.969> the<00:06:42.330> wand

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
little fibers that connect to the wand

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.600 
little fibers that connect to the wand
and<00:06:42.870> I<00:06:43.050> think<00:06:43.500> those<00:06:43.590> fibers<00:06:44.070> are<00:06:44.190> what<00:06:44.340> helped

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
and I think those fibers are what helped

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.879 
and I think those fibers are what helped
create<00:06:44.880> that<00:06:45.539> nice<00:06:45.780> full<00:06:46.139> appearance<00:06:46.469> and<00:06:46.860> I

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:46.889 
create that nice full appearance and I

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.790 
create that nice full appearance and I
really<00:06:47.159> like<00:06:47.310> that<00:06:47.520> also<00:06:48.389> it<00:06:48.930> doesn't<00:06:49.259> have<00:06:49.590> a

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
really like that also it doesn't have a

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.939 
really like that also it doesn't have a
really<00:06:50.159> bad<00:06:50.340> smell<00:06:50.870> most<00:06:51.870> mascaras<00:06:52.349> have

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:52.949 
really bad smell most mascaras have

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:55.100 
really bad smell most mascaras have
really<00:06:53.370> you<00:06:53.490> know<00:06:53.610> strong<00:06:53.969> sense<00:06:54.389> to<00:06:54.659> them<00:06:54.780> and

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
really you know strong sense to them and

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.499 
really you know strong sense to them and
this<00:06:55.949> one<00:06:56.159> luckily<00:06:56.430> doesn't<00:06:56.849> have<00:06:56.969> a<00:06:57.000> super

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:57.509 
this one luckily doesn't have a super

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:00.439 
this one luckily doesn't have a super
strong<00:06:57.750> scent<00:06:58.199> so<00:06:58.469> I<00:06:58.680> like<00:06:59.039> that<00:06:59.250> and<00:06:59.550> the

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:00.449 
strong scent so I like that and the

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:02.540 
strong scent so I like that and the
color<00:07:00.719> here<00:07:01.349> it<00:07:01.530> doesn't<00:07:01.800> have<00:07:01.860> a<00:07:02.009> color<00:07:02.219> but<00:07:02.520> I

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
color here it doesn't have a color but I

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.999 
color here it doesn't have a color but I
guess<00:07:02.969> it's<00:07:03.180> just<00:07:03.240> one<00:07:03.570> uniform<00:07:04.020> color<00:07:04.320> this

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:05.009 
guess it's just one uniform color this

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:06.830 
guess it's just one uniform color this
