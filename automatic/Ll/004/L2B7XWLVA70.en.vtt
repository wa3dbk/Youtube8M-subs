 get pretty easter without buying 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.580
 good numbers 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.849
 gold I advise you for that to do the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.910
 solo season gold you do it's the 5000 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.570
 credit you will have 5 credit credit plus a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.000
 premium pack 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.070
 pretty much for his season you win 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.340
 9th in total credit and a pack prÃ©gnant 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.349
 body with the matches on his behalf a 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.529
 victory and scabies 400 credit pretty much 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.989
 even a draw at mans you do that you 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.510
 save pretty much a wine pack you 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.940
 can open 20 package in in you 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.550
 will have 180 me credit just have 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.649
 for only contracts but contracts 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.420
 to make about 200 matches 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.760
 erased having missed in buying yourself 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.399
 some contracts of who changes 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.640
 to make you nice match but it's 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.250
 a technique that I find and that I 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.550
 advise to my friends so that you are 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.460
 friends well i also advise good 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.070
 I tell you I hope you offer 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.930
 since if you make wine you wait 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.530
 at 20 steps you can open 20 pack 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.650
 From about 2200 this year 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.180
 200 fifa points having that makes you 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.229
 spend more than 20 euros 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.619
 with my technique you spend no 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.070
 credit 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.350
 you orientate yourself credit in football and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.770
 you will have packs to open with in 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.380
 hoping to come across heavy 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.909
 but hey it is choosing its cost of 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.390
 cats me personally i never 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.299
 rec 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.610
 but hey I wonder if the level 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.930
 as you can see if they play 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.450
 a little bit 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.780
 if if level and play it a little bit 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.720
 normal I'm still 60 years old 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.820
 if I do not come back the videos of two 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.740
 people on youtube and I find that 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.240
 in my girlfriend when they have small 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.430
 levels it touches the heavy except for a 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.020
 pack called freefall was you 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:10.780
 read your land against him by touch 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.820
 by being in is a big level but hey 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.560
 he plays and he had no troch the packs 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.860
 on flint box so that's what it plays 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.440
 I do not know how good my technique is 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.390
 I advise you to do the season in 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.820
 solo at 5000 credit you win at 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.400
 every season 9 me credit plus a pack 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.830
