00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.920
 hello I am mobile.de and we are with 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.630
 a company called leon heck that's ne 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.550
 daughter brand of zimory respectively 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.110
 chips humor maybe also known 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.029
 the media market for the storage devices 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.489
 and similar things and here we have 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.160
 a tablet of unic that is the 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:25.279
 tablet pc p7 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.110
 concretely 72 1280 x 800 pixel resolution 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.110
 And the special thing is this device has 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.410
 not just a role 31 port cortex a7 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:37.190
 with 1 2 ghz but just two more 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.079
 gigabyte ram and 16 gb of internal memory 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.969
 The thing is these devices are supposed to be in 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.800
 shortly before the end of march in the 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.210
 German media market and at expert and 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.070
 saturn and so on 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.659
 means they are really 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.399
 without the detour of Chinese 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.379
 importers and similar items in 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.909
 Germany makes available in total 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.699
 a pretty decent impression is also 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.469
 stable has full back up here 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.780
 is of course the wlan antin etc 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.579
 that's why this plastic strip 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.260
 that's what I'm running on right now 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.630
 i am informed android 4.1.1 so 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.740
 already jelly bean among others 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.450
 to realize that there just the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.369
 version number is the correct one 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.009
 should have enough power to do so 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.090
 example hockey videos should be on it 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.200
 You can also walk here now 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.909
 just do not show because the player still 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.469
 a bit of magic is as it is said 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.469
 until the end of march everything still clarified 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.439
 the part is supposed to have a battery of 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.720
 more than 4000 millimeter holes 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.900
 So there is something about the next 7 of 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.700
 google and similar stuff and intended for 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.310
 179 euro come in the german trade 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.280
 with 16 gigabyte memory 2 gigabyte ram 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.840
 and said the quad core cortex a7 of 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.409
 they look very crooked and catch here 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.490
 at the top 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.320
 because we have a small front 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.310
 webcam that is a VGA camera so far 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.290
 not informed now 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.960
 There are loud speakers sitting here 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.720
 the brightness and similar funny 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.640
 small sensors 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.250
 and here below continue with one 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.840
 micro usb port that looks next to it 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.120
 like I say a second micro usb 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.010
 port would I think or mini hdmi or 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.410
 micro hdmi it will be a 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.020
 Headphone jack is next to it 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.370
 sits a micro sd card slot the 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.260
 internal memory can be so completely 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.880
 easy-workers up here, we have 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.450
 a two-megapixel camera as far as I am concerned 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.250
 I am informed 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.560
 but she could also do something 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.940
 better dissolve but then if you then 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.260
 see the final product if it is in the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.270
 Trade is how high that actually is 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.030
 dissolves down here too 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.680
 speakers and overall I would 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.130
 say just under a centimeter thick 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.540
 the whole 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.440
 They said we got extra in 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.720
 cooperation with the Chinese 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.460
 Suppliers therefore paid attention to the oem 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.610
 that there will be no great gap dimensions 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.440
 having 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.740
 Look also very stable here bends 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.910
 nothing rotation works very well 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.530
 friendly the edges are a bit 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.870
 narrower than, for example, the nexus 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.290
 7 and made a very good overall 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.630
 impression 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.460
 as I said at the end of march at media market 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.190
 and co or similar German markets 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.810
 Available in stores and before it is completely 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.840
 Forgot the on and off here above 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.970
 off switch and 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.590
 the volume rocker to do so 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.400
 all right, this is the tablet of 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.720
 jannik's tablet pc p7 comes from the end 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.170
 march in germany on the market 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.170
 Thank you very much
