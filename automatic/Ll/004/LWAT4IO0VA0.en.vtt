 Hello, I want to try as an ancient 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:15.089
 polishes now decided to polish such 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.779
 spirit ruble coin to someone from just 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.740
 such a small felt circle 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:25.010
 center hole under the screw a little straight 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.010
 into it 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:44.170
 that from the weak of the very machine of the earth to 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:47.370
 the set comes polishing paste for 1 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.370
 We are testing the leg 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.899
 by not really saved 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.930
 auto 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.049
 polished saved course went hang 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.409
 although it could have been used over the corner 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.409
 fasting 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:39.480
 a little polished honest article 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.970
 Well, yes it is indeed the air has become 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:52.010
 scroll at the very looked 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:56.480
 nozzle spoiled such a color 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:06.739
 install another nozzle and the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:06.739
 polished off but if the folder 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.680
 may be the first nozzle too much 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.890
 pressed it ask visibility to do 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.890
 can't 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:38.560
 all hands in the mouth 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:43.450

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:48.330
 use another nozzle such this 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:54.360
 Do not sleep for a sharp but most likely 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.360

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:58.730

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.730
 don't need to polish it yet 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.260
 i relaxed 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:36.150
 I hope the coin was originally 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:36.150
 dirty now can become as good as new 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:55.540
