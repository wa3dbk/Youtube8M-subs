00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
meter lens in my opinion let's look at

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.959 
meter lens in my opinion let's look at
the<00:00:58.050> picture<00:00:58.379> quality<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.920> middle<00:00:59.190> the

fringing<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.239> plate<00:01:03.539> my<00:01:03.899> aps-c<00:01:04.409> test<00:01:05.010> is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
fringing that plate my aps-c test is

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.980 
fringing that plate my aps-c test is
almost<00:01:05.820> completely<00:01:06.450> gone

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990

the<00:01:07.439> contrast<00:01:07.920> levels<00:01:08.250> are<00:01:08.460> also<00:01:08.790> good<00:01:09.439> let's

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the contrast levels are also good let's

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.590 
the contrast levels are also good let's
look<00:01:10.650> over<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.010> corners<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.450> that

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
look over in the corners we can see that

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.179 
look over in the corners we can see that
the<00:01:12.720> lens<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.080> still<00:01:13.350> performing<00:01:13.799> really<00:01:14.070> well

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the lens is still performing really well

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.070 
the lens is still performing really well
although<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.810> touch<00:01:16.049> of
