basically these soft plastics there's a

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.970 
basically these soft plastics there's a
lot<00:02:19.460> of<00:02:19.580> different<00:02:19.820> reasons<00:02:20.120> different

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
lot of different reasons different

effectively<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:23.420> see<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:27.080> thing<00:02:27.260> about<00:02:27.500> these

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
effectively to see the thing about these

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.490 
effectively to see the thing about these
soft<00:02:28.040> plastics<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:29.960> doesn't<00:02:30.290> take

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
soft plastics is that it doesn't take

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.600 
soft plastics is that it doesn't take
much<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:33.290> create<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.710> moving<00:02:34.070> we<00:02:34.250> can<00:02:34.430> put<00:02:34.550> a

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
much to create the moving we can put a

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.810 
much to create the moving we can put a
lot<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.850> time<00:02:35.950> when<00:02:36.950> you're<00:02:37.100> worth<00:02:37.250> any<00:02:37.490> day<00:02:37.730> if

but<00:02:51.980> down<00:02:52.190> below<00:02:52.550> that<00:02:53.060> creature<00:02:53.660> bait<00:02:53.990> is

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
but down below that creature bait is

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.100 
but down below that creature bait is
just<00:02:54.410> dancing<00:02:55.360> one<00:02:56.360> thing<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:56.630> think<00:02:56.690> really

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
just dancing one thing I think really

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.720 
just dancing one thing I think really
makes<00:02:57.350> a<00:02:57.470> huge<00:02:57.680> difference<00:02:57.740> is<00:02:58.250> using<00:02:58.550> this<00:02:58.670> to

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
makes a huge difference is using this to

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.050 
makes a huge difference is using this to
palm<00:02:59.120> Bionic<00:02:59.570> line<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.590> smaller<00:03:01.100> diameter

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
palm Bionic line the smaller diameter

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.910 
palm Bionic line the smaller diameter
line<00:03:02.600> you're<00:03:02.840> really<00:03:03.050> able<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.350> get<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:03.650> jig

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
line you're really able to get that jig

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.980 
line you're really able to get that jig
down<00:03:04.130> real<00:03:04.370> fast<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:04.880> with<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.000> tungsten<00:03:05.690> on

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
down real fast and with a tungsten on

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.050 
down real fast and with a tungsten on
the<00:03:06.140> end<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.710> really<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.130> can<00:03:07.730> use<00:03:07.910> that

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
the end of it it really is can use that

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.180 
the end of it it really is can use that
aggressive<00:03:08.510> presentation<00:03:09.110> with<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.410> but<00:03:10.070> the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
aggressive presentation with it but the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.980 
aggressive presentation with it but the
thicker<00:03:10.400> line<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:10.850> doesn't<00:03:11.150> wobble<00:03:11.570> quite

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
thicker line it doesn't wobble quite

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.820 
thicker line it doesn't wobble quite
like<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.380> should

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
like it should

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.860 
like it should
another<00:03:13.730> thing<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.090> helps<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.390> lot<00:03:14.510> is<00:03:14.690> that

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
another thing that helps a lot is that

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.240 
another thing that helps a lot is that
loop<00:03:15.110> not<00:03:15.350> that<00:03:15.530> you<00:03:15.650> use<00:03:15.770> when<00:03:15.950> you're<00:03:16.070> tying

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
loop not that you use when you're tying

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.100 
loop not that you use when you're tying
them<00:03:16.460> tungsten<00:03:16.910> jigs<00:03:17.120> on<00:03:17.270> feel<00:03:17.930> with<00:03:18.080> that

them tungsten jigs on feel with that

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.660 
them tungsten jigs on feel with that
plastic<00:03:18.710> down<00:03:18.860> there<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.130> can<00:03:19.250> really<00:03:19.520> get

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
plastic down there you can really get

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.060 
plastic down there you can really get
the<00:03:19.880> really<00:03:20.570> hangs<00:03:20.780> horizontal<00:03:21.500> you<00:03:21.770> get<00:03:21.890> some

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
the really hangs horizontal you get some

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.380 
the really hangs horizontal you get some
of<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.250> other<00:03:22.280> nuts<00:03:22.640> on<00:03:22.880> there<00:03:23.060> they<00:03:23.210> don't

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
of the other nuts on there they don't

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.730 
of the other nuts on there they don't
hang<00:03:23.570> quite<00:03:23.810> right<00:03:23.990> in<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.200> fish<00:03:24.380> don't<00:03:24.620> like

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
hang quite right in the fish don't like

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.060 
hang quite right in the fish don't like
the<00:03:24.860> way<00:03:24.950> they<00:03:25.070> look<00:03:29.320> another<00:03:30.320> nice<00:03:30.560> perch<00:03:30.890> on

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
hitting spoons so schools could be a

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.990 
hitting spoons so schools could be a
great<00:04:08.740> lure<00:04:08.980> for<00:04:09.280> fighting<00:04:09.640> fish<00:04:09.820> and

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
great lure for fighting fish and

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:06.279 

effective<00:07:03.919> technique<00:07:04.720> really<00:07:05.720> boils<00:07:06.110> down<00:07:06.139> to

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:06.289 
effective technique really boils down to

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:08.020 
effective technique really boils down to
confidence-building<00:07:07.130> yeah<00:07:07.550> it<00:07:07.639> does<00:07:07.849> you

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
confidence-building yeah it does you

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.520 
confidence-building yeah it does you
know<00:07:08.120> these<00:07:08.300> Northland<00:07:08.900> impulse<00:07:09.289> if<00:07:09.470> you

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
know these Northland impulse if you

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.050 
know these Northland impulse if you
don't<00:07:09.680> have<00:07:09.770> confidence<00:07:09.949> in<00:07:10.370> any<00:07:10.520> plastics

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.060 
don't have confidence in any plastics

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.999 
don't have confidence in any plastics
it's<00:07:11.240> not<00:07:11.389> gonna<00:07:11.569> work<00:07:12.349> and<00:07:12.500> these<00:07:12.620> impulse

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:13.009 
it's not gonna work and these impulse

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:14.529 
it's not gonna work and these impulse
have<00:07:13.160> just<00:07:13.340> been<00:07:13.460> unbelievable<00:07:13.639> for<00:07:14.300> me<00:07:14.419> this

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:14.539 
have just been unbelievable for me this

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:16.629 
have just been unbelievable for me this
year<00:07:14.780> I<00:07:14.960> have<00:07:15.470> caught<00:07:15.650> a<00:07:15.680> ton<00:07:15.979> of<00:07:16.009> fish<00:07:16.190> on<00:07:16.520> them

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
when other you know other baits why bait

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.600 
when other you know other baits why bait
wouldn't<00:07:18.830> work<00:07:18.949> mm-hmm<00:07:21.310> effective<00:07:22.310> but<00:07:22.580> you

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:22.610 
wouldn't work mm-hmm effective but you

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.920 
wouldn't work mm-hmm effective but you
have<00:07:22.849> to<00:07:22.940> learn<00:07:23.090> how<00:07:23.150> to<00:07:23.270> use<00:07:23.509> it<00:07:23.660> though<00:07:23.750> once

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930 
have to learn how to use it though once

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.499 
have to learn how to use it though once
you<00:07:24.050> learn<00:07:24.199> how<00:07:24.229> to<00:07:24.380> do<00:07:24.560> that<00:07:25.300> definitely<00:07:26.300> cool

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:26.509 
you learn how to do that definitely cool
