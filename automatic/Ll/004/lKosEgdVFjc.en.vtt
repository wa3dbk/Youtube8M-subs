00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
my NAT type is strict and go into modern

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.999 
my NAT type is strict and go into modern

of or on that game the net type is open

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.120 
of or on that game the net type is open
so<00:01:41.930> highlighted<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> there<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:43.920> see
