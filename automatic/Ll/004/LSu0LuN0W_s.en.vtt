00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.760 
sure what that tile was called so let's
bring<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:25.210> back<00:02:25.600> up<00:02:26.100> boom<00:02:27.100> on<00:02:27.340> glass<00:02:27.760> and

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
bring that back up boom on glass and

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
bring that back up boom on glass and
Marylyn<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:34.120> just<00:02:34.360> type<00:02:34.510> this<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:35.790> specify

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
Marylyn so just type this in and specify

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.110 
Marylyn so just type this in and specify
that<00:02:37.860> now<00:02:38.860> we<00:02:38.920> can<00:02:39.160> get<00:02:39.310> right<00:02:39.490> back<00:02:39.700> into<00:02:39.940> the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
that now we can get right back into the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.330 
that now we can get right back into the
program<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:41.200> we're<00:02:41.530> going<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.680> import<00:02:42.130> this

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
program and we're going to import this

on the user catalog under new we're

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.480 
on the user catalog under new we're
going<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.120> find<00:02:52.330> material<00:02:53.160> single<00:02:54.160> click<00:02:54.340> on

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
going to find material single click on

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
going to find material single click on
material<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.239> bring<00:02:55.390> up<00:02:55.660> our<00:02:55.870> define<00:02:56.800> material

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
material to bring up our define material

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.860 
material to bring up our define material
dialog<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.750> let's<00:02:59.739> change<00:03:00.010> this<00:03:00.570> bring<00:03:01.570> it<00:03:01.720> in

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
dialog and let's change this bring it in

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.060 
dialog and let's change this bring it in
as<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.170> same<00:03:02.860> name<00:03:04.440> import<00:03:05.440> our<00:03:05.530> texture

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
as that same name import our texture

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.570 
as that same name import our texture
file<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:07.060> this<00:03:07.209> is<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.510> pattern<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:07.900> we<00:03:08.170> have

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
file so this is the pattern that we have

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.340 
file so this is the pattern that we have
and<00:03:10.500> now<00:03:11.500> we<00:03:11.560> need<00:03:11.830> to<00:03:11.980> change<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.790> scale<00:03:13.350> so

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
and now we need to change the scale so

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.030 
and now we need to change the scale so
for<00:03:14.680> this<00:03:14.890> let's<00:03:15.340> do<00:03:15.700> maybe<00:03:16.450> 16<00:03:17.140> by<00:03:17.380> 16

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.590 

underneath<00:03:21.040> our<00:03:21.220> pattern<00:03:21.700> I'm<00:03:21.970> going<00:03:22.030> to

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
underneath our pattern I'm going to

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.949 
underneath our pattern I'm going to
change<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.620> tile<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.930> under<00:03:25.930> our

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
change that to a tile and under our

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.280 
change that to a tile and under our
general<00:03:26.590> we<00:03:27.489> can<00:03:27.640> specify<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:28.239> as<00:03:28.630> well<00:03:28.930> and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
general we can specify that as well and

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.680 
general we can specify that as well and
I'm<00:03:30.280> going<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.459> change<00:03:30.730> that<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:30.940> match<00:03:31.360> we'll

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
I'm going to change that to match we'll

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.460 
I'm going to change that to match we'll
do<00:03:31.810> 16<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:32.560> 16<00:03:33.040> there<00:03:33.310> as<00:03:33.489> well<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.440> now<00:03:35.440> our

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
do 16 and 16 there as well so now our

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.220 
do 16 and 16 there as well so now our
image<00:03:35.860> has<00:03:36.070> been<00:03:36.220> sized<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.790> 16<00:03:37.209> by<00:03:37.390> 16<00:03:37.450> inches

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
image has been sized to 16 by 16 inches

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.650 
image has been sized to 16 by 16 inches
and<00:03:38.530> we'll<00:03:38.709> tile<00:03:38.920> accordingly<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:39.880> when

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
and we'll tile accordingly and when

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.449 
and we'll tile accordingly and when
we're<00:03:40.810> in<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.050> elevation<00:03:41.500> or<00:03:41.920> orthographic

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
we're in the elevation or orthographic

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.759 
we're in the elevation or orthographic
views<00:03:42.940> our<00:03:43.269> pattern<00:03:43.810> will<00:03:43.959> be<00:03:44.110> displayed<00:03:44.530> and

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
views our pattern will be displayed and

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.070 
views our pattern will be displayed and
the<00:03:45.030> texture<00:03:46.030> will<00:03:46.180> be<00:03:46.209> displayed<00:03:46.750> in<00:03:46.959> our

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
the texture will be displayed in our

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.040 
the texture will be displayed in our
perspective<00:03:47.380> camera<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.660> now<00:03:49.840> we'll<00:03:50.019> find

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
perspective camera so now we'll find

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.490 
perspective camera so now we'll find
that<00:03:50.380> in<00:03:50.709> our<00:03:50.830> user<00:03:51.100> catalog<00:03:52.019> single<00:03:53.019> click<00:03:53.230> on

and<00:04:50.210> we're<00:04:51.210> going<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.360> keep<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.690> pattern<00:04:51.930> just

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
and we're going to keep the pattern just

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.060 
and we're going to keep the pattern just
as<00:04:52.470> an<00:04:52.650> area<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.570> under<00:04:54.570> that<00:04:54.810> texture<00:04:55.440> bring

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
as an area and under that texture bring

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.680 
as an area and under that texture bring
