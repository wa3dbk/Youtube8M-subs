00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.059

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.250
 I traveled a lot my pokemon and I was 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.710
 good friends and we helped each other 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.510
 others I already had the 8 medals and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.760
 I wanted to rest a couple of months 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.590
 touring the hot region or before 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.869
 enter the pokemon league one day 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.849
 we were going through iris city and 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.949
 we were doing a bit of sightseeing and 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.109
 We saw the legendary and very well known tower 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.759
 burned many people told us that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.680
 some pokemon that like the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.870
 darkness lived there and they were very 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.000
 strong to me and my pokemon liked the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.590
 idea of ​​going to train there a little bit to 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.660
 keep us in shape for the league 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.670
 pokemon we were about to enter 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.530
 when an old man was hiding in 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.510
 the shadows and he told us there were many 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.489
 Pokemon spirits that had died and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.320
 that keep wandering around I eat 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.719
 any young man I did not lend him much 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.000
 attention and between was very dark and not 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.890
 I could see anything, take it to open and order it 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.410
 that will use flash and so he did 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.239
 We kept moving forward and we could have some 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.670
 how many fights with pokemon of the type 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.900
 ghost suddenly the sound was heard 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.030
 like a spark 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.340
 electrical and there will be shut down everything became 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.960
 dark take out all my pokemon and I 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.000
 order that they be alert of 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.190
 anything I say a potion to 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.020
 opened and recovered he ordered him to use 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.030
 flash again and a little in the distance 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.830
 you saw a silhouette of a pokémon that did not 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.420
 had seen before in the tower we 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.760
 we kept coming and followed 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.100
 discovering the identity of the pokemon and 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.200
 it was nothing more or less than a pikachu I 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.330
 I was surprised because the pikachu did not 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.190
 they live in places like this I went up and 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.170
 I said to open that it will focus the flash and 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.030
 I realized that that pikachu was from 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.460
 blue color and when I saw him in the eyes 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.380
 he could see the wickedness of pikachu commands him 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.210
 will have to move away and I backed 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.160
 but pikachu put on the smile more 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.740
 sinister I had never seen and it 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.690
 put in battle position then I 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.729
 I started thinking about my strategy of 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.979
 battle take out rat and cate and order 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.170
 that using the rathika onslaught gave you 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.119
 success but he went long when 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.770
 come back to see pikachu he was like smoke 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.560
 that took the form again 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.090
 then pikachu let out a laugh 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.770
 sinister and he used good impact and he 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.540
 gave rat and cate in the head 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.610
 penetrating his skull killing him from 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.680
 Immediately I was stunned but at 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.510
 same time I realized that itchy 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.700
 It could be very dangerous but I gave myself 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.799
 Something picciotto and glass toys 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.480
 they were weak against the electric type and 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.189
 my work was not in a position to 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.290
 fight until it will evolve in each 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.450
 bra pikachu was approaching little by little 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.430
 towards me and I became desperate and sent the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.680
 first poke ball from my belt and it came out 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.870
 pilot ordered him to stay away 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.180
 from pikachu picacho issued a scream 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.219
 heartbreaking and many pokemon came 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.260
 of the ghost type and they caught up and I said 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.239
 oto and he was brought before pikachu and killed him 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.549
 with a powerful good impact and opened it 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.470
 the entire abdomen and asked me tocayo 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.629
 were the tears because I already lost my 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.730
 friends then I had no other than 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.109
 take out blast today I know then I will order 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.209
 that will fight for the honor of their 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.459
 fellow blast today he fought a 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.500
 intense battle but picacho used his 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.450
 electric power and killed my blast today if 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.569
 I threw myself to the floor and started crying 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.639
 while listening to a voice I got up 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.069
 and I saw while I was still next to me 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.780
 using flash and also crying was 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.760
 the old man we saw when entering the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.859
 pikachu tower went next to him and I 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.930
 said I was a retired coach and 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.519
 I came here to see ao the legendary pokemon 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.949
 when the tower went into flames and did not 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.730
 I could escape free all my pokemon 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.590
 and order them 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.810
 they all escaped but my 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.760
 pikachu stayed here with me and from 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.739
 there we have been here locked up and not 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.080
 we were able to escape but today we could 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.180
 escape if we kill you how are you going to 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.220
 give away our freedom we give you 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.349
 we will give a last will I thought a 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.900
 little and I realized that this is my 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.629
 final destination then with tears in 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.000
 the eyes I said let go to open the old 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.860
 He smiled and said if I smiled because 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.989
 there would be very small still and I could not 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.060
 die in a place like this orders you 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.250
 you will have to use teleportation and 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.860
 that he was free to live his life there will be 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.599
 it went everything went dark and the last 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.410
 that I saw was the flash of lightning that 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.410
 I throw pikachu
