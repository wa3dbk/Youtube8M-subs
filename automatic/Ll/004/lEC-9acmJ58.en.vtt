00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.300
 the pp has betrayed him 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.090
 it's a good question for me to do 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.230
 is to give the link and not me the only 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.830
 thing I can say is that 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:24.050
 is that I've been with more than one foot out 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:27.349
 madrid more than one and I have brought 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.029
 for inside he had provided a and 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.080
 obviously that madrid that pays him but 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.120
 or by pressing from fought for a 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.280
 appropriate contract to a player who 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.670
 consider a player 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.140
 fantastic and what 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.809
 has been out of the team quite 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.970
 time per population to start playing 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:55.020
 child 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:59.460
 that has ten or twelve days twelve years 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.440
 13 pesos 13 years less than him but a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.090
 child that in my opinion again we are 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.610
 of my opinion in my vision of the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.550
 situation a child who has deserved to play 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.820
 and then I think that one has assimilated 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.070
 and accepted that situation well and then 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.410
 we enter after a period where 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.540
 all the people who wanted it were where 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.050
 all the people 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.420
 it was called in the session of rea madrid or 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.670
 in all the people that I remembered every day 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.860
 their attitudes in the field that every day 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.780
 I remembered the problem you had with 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.190
 the getafe in which streets the 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.170
 head of your entire profession partner 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.390
 people are criticized and they do not 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.570
 They wanted Madrid and one moment the other 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.120
 they have all gotten on their side they have not 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.800
 I defined a lot and I really 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.830
 I am very happy because I think that Pepe is 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.610
 a fantastic player a player of 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.170
 which already madrid needs because it is 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.470
 hard to find such a good player 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.560
 like him and he added that now I can 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.210
 have this support this tranquility 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.700
 because the mission of a coach is 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.310
 also a little is attracting itself 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.560
 same and the hate of the issue and leave 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.170
 your players and a good situation and 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.290
 I think now they will have much better 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.540
 conditions to be well Christian 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.110
 ronaldo and spoiled and relative to 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:27.069
 final that has passed 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:30.890
 I do not know Christian has done with me 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:34.220
 three fantastic seasons all of them 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.140
 I do not know if the best of his career no no 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.990
 Manches has also had moments 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.490
 fantastic and although you can tell which is 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.240
 its best season but I think we've 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.240
 found for it a situation 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.240
 tactic 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.170
 fantastic for me to express everything 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.830
 its potential and to be able to transform that 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.560
 numbers on goals in a situation 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.860
 fantastic for it I had a unique 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.550
 problem with the only problem very very 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.970
 very simple is very basic that is a 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.790
 coach criticize a player the 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.880
 tactical point of view try to improve 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.880
 what I believe it could be improved 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.130
 in the segment a node has accepted 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.290
 very well because he thinks that if maybe 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.740
 he knows everything and that the coach does not 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.800
 can help to grow more but no 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.120
 kind of any kind of problem these 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.580
 last two games that have been 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.400
 practically the two the only two in 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.330
 who has not played with me because he has 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.600
 always played 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.700
 and sometimes in over fatigue some 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.600
 sometimes with small problems has given 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.700
 always everything for the team and for and for 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.330
 that madrid these last two weeks 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:02.400
 For it seemed to him a backache 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:06.110
 and he never doubted the players 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.110
 and nothing but no problem
