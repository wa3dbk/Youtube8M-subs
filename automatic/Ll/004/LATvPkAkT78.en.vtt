00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.240
 my name is thomas müller i am 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.830
 responsible for the area of ​​electrics 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.599
 Electronics development at Volvo Cars 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.410
 I want to tell you something today 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.880
 about the new lte in our new xc90 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.500
 the touchscreen interface stands out 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.270
 for two things, we have two things 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.980
 several vehicle functions the 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.110
 usually pictured in buttons 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.270
 the cockpit in the control surface 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.730
 integrated to the second we have the 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.480
 regarding the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.340
 interaction possibilities possible 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.399
 Intuitively designed they look im 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.059
 Essentially three menu structures on 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.589
 on the left hand side you reach switzerland 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.570
 can be are all classic 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.339
 Vehicle settings available 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.769
 Usually depicted in socializing 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.329
 on the middle menu are the 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.829
 classic infotainment menus and on 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.120
 we have one on the right side 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.280
 Structure in the all applications 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.469
 are shown here the 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.540
 onboard available applications 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.690
 Of course, then added at the start of sales 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.720
 all connected applications of the 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.550
 further we have the menu structure for 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.810
 climate control mapped these 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:20.080
 structure always exists you can from 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.670
 the setting of the temperature over the 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.320
 adjustment of the seat heating or halt 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.840
 seat ventilation so available 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.120
 want to achieve this function directly 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.620
 you set further climate functions 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.650
 reach them through one 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.970
 simple pressure on the climate symbol and 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.270
 so are all climate functions 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.730
 adjustable from the my climate over the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.070
 huge lima up to the question of climate 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.960
 function very easy to reach the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.300
 homescreen by going to our home 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.310
 button presses and then is back in the 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.440
 illustration of the top menu structure 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.270
 for the info topics domain that 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.340
 infotainment menus from four so-called 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.200
 Tiles built on the first tile 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.640
 are the navigation functions the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.190
 second part media functions then 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.640
 phone and then a so-called app 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.910
 tile on which the customer can choose freely 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.459
 applications zeiss connected app tabs 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.170
 can prove if they are one of 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.810
 tile will choose this tile 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.900
 expanded and they see that the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.060
 other two essential 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.299
 tile namely media &amp; phone in this 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.159
 still open to the public 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.390
 If you have a menu like this 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.099
 in this case, the navigation menu 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.739
 you have selected that 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.790
 other two menu item still 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.250
 are directly selectable 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.109
 this is very important for us 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.480
 as we give the customer the shortest possible 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:39.000
 to achieve his interaction time 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.109
 Bettina would like to give the task if you 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.909
 so for example in this case 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.599
 want to navigate a phone call 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.280
 make 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.930
 then a simple press is enough 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.670
 the key of you are instant and 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.260
 phone mode and here we have 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.150
 the big advantage that we have 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.599
 two-dimensionality of the touch screen with 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.129
 directly selectable access 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.840
 can take advantage of this on the one hand 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.730
 scrolling in a list 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.859
 but also relatively fast 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.810
 for example the keypad to reach around 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:07.889
 enter phone numbers so because 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.650
 necessary when they return again 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.030
 in this case, to have the navigation 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.310
 there will be further gestures control 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.290
 installed so that they are relatively simple 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.629
 a card the way you like it from the tablet 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.280
 or smartphone are used to serve 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.299
 so we can be here at the 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.190
 enlarge the spot 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.989
 but we can also search out 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.349
 move the map relatively easily 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.030
 and even the goal of a whole 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.159
 simple pindl job on the map 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.459
 mark all settings in the headunit 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:37.290
 are always set contextually 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.949
 that means in this case if you want to 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.389
 example in the navigation menu are and 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.980
 they would all go to settings 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.810
 the settings available 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.970
 The same applies once for a long time 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.530
 then for media and phone so we 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.419
 the customer directly in the environment of 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.010
 would like to make a setting the 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.169
 offer attitude that makes sense 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.540
 because safety is a very important issue 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:59.819
 for volvo we have the design 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.560
 of the touch interface 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.260
 that it is very robust from the operation 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.579
 that we do the individual tasks a lot 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.409
 fast with as few clicks as possible 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.940
 and we can do it a lot 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.769
 intuitively designed so that the 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.810
 if possible driver during the ride 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.979
 task is not confused look 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.229
 the cockpit 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:19.109
 then we have a free one in the cockpit 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:23.070
 programmable 12 5 in color display 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.140
 integrated with the buttons 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.070
 It can be controlled by the steering wheel 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:31.560
 here a reduced information rate 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.390
 located in the center stick 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.910
 see the picture is useful 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.860
 while driving and on which the 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.810
 driver should be aware such 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.170
 example in this case navigation too 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.720
 invalidate notes or other 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:49.650
 ride-related things he can do too 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.520
 a menu button phone and media 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.230
 control functions 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.030
 the whole thing is supplemented by a head up 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.440
 display and the head up display is 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.450
 of course in the direct field of vision 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.650
 driver that he serves the display 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.900
 also the safety 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.640
 Of course, here are only the 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.200
 absolutely necessary for the driver 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.440
 Information presented as to 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.240
 example, the speed or too 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.250
 speed limit information or 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.370
 warnings with the vaart task 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.450
 have to do respectively 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.620
 navigation maps information about 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.210
 to make yourself a picture of it 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.620
 I would like to extend my heartfelt 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.510
 autoshow uwe riehs invite you where you are 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.010
 experience the vehicle live and yourself 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.010
 also to operate the system
