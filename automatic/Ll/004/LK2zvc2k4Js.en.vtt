00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
scratch live you can very quickly and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.020 
scratch live you can very quickly and
very<00:01:41.300> easily<00:01:41.479> access<00:01:42.410> songs<00:01:43.400> that<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:43.790> never

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
very easily access songs that you never

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.460 
very easily access songs that you never
thought<00:01:44.330> would<00:01:44.510> actually<00:01:44.869> mix<00:01:45.110> well<00:01:45.290> together

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
thought would actually mix well together

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.250 
thought would actually mix well together
and<00:01:46.150> then<00:01:47.150> incorporate<00:01:47.570> them<00:01:47.720> into<00:01:47.869> your<00:01:48.080> set

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
and then incorporate them into your set

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.990 
and then incorporate them into your set
so<00:01:48.800> it's<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:48.950> great<00:01:49.100> opportunity<00:01:49.400> to<00:01:49.760> have<00:01:49.970> a

so it's a great opportunity to have a
really<00:01:50.270> smooth<00:01:50.570> transition<00:01:50.600> when<00:01:51.380> you're

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
really smooth transition when you're

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.550
