much water band I'm using a medium
filter<00:00:35.059> because<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.120> used<00:00:36.300> all<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.480> fine

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780

filter is just a little bit sort of

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.459 
filter is just a little bit sort of
heavier<00:00:38.550> texture<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.600> time<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.350> you

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
heavier texture on that time that you

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.389 
heavier texture on that time that you
might<00:00:40.620> notice<00:00:40.920> too<00:00:41.250> much<00:00:41.489> really<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:44.280> can

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
might notice too much really and you can

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.979 
might notice too much really and you can
see<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.700> I'm<00:00:44.760> using<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.090> cutter<00:00:45.300> strips<00:00:45.690> as

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
see that I'm using the cutter strips as

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.020 
see that I'm using the cutter strips as
sort<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.379> guide<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.250> painting<00:00:47.910> each

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
sort of a guide and on painting each

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.389 
sort of a guide and on painting each
section<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.260> color<00:00:49.469> strip<00:00:49.800> basically

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
section to the color strip basically

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.950 
section to the color strip basically
I'll<00:00:50.550> fight<00:00:50.760> off<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> lights<00:00:51.329> there<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
I'll fight off the lights there and

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.000 
I'll fight off the lights there and
trying<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> get<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.320> all<00:00:55.440> done<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.860> nice

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
trying to get it all done in a nice

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.910 
trying to get it all done in a nice
smooth<00:00:56.460> single<00:00:57.210> pass<00:00:57.449> rather<00:00:58.440> than<00:00:58.680> stopping

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
smooth single pass rather than stopping

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.590 
smooth single pass rather than stopping
and<00:00:59.190> starting<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.640> best<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.090> because<00:01:00.449> it's

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and starting the best I can because it's

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.599 
and starting the best I can because it's
easier<00:01:01.199> if<00:01:01.320> there<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.590> some<00:01:01.800> spots<00:01:02.100> off<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
easier if there is some spots off to

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.390 
easier if there is some spots off to
stop<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.000> stuff<00:01:03.559> like<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.710> post<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> way

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
stop and stuff like this post in the way

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.530 
stop and stuff like this post in the way
and<00:01:05.460> that's<00:01:05.640> why<00:01:05.850> sort<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> can't<00:01:06.299> keep

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and that's why sort of can't keep

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.590 
and that's why sort of can't keep
spraying<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> post<00:01:07.860> there

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.630 

this<00:01:15.600> product<00:01:16.140> I'm<00:01:16.229> using<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.829> a<00:01:16.859> waddle

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
this product I'm using is a waddle

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.450 
this product I'm using is a waddle
exterior<00:01:18.469> semi-gloss<00:01:19.469> paint<00:01:19.890> which<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> self

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
exterior semi-gloss paint which is self

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.730 
exterior semi-gloss paint which is self
priming<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:24.079> you<00:01:25.079> can<00:01:25.140> see<00:01:25.380> there<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
priming and it's a you can see there the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.520 
priming and it's a you can see there the
50%<00:01:26.280> overlap<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.390> need<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.780> use<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> spray

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
50% overlap you need to use on a spray

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.649 
50% overlap you need to use on a spray
so<00:01:28.590> every<00:01:29.159> stroke<00:01:29.490> has<00:01:29.819> to<00:01:29.939> overlap<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.450> last

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
so every stroke has to overlap the last

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.370 
so every stroke has to overlap the last
stroke<00:01:31.020> by<00:01:31.200> 50%<00:01:32.149> and<00:01:33.149> I'm<00:01:33.270> using<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.840> fine

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
stroke by 50% and I'm using a fine

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.109 
stroke by 50% and I'm using a fine
finish<00:01:34.709> tip<00:01:35.100> which<00:01:35.310> gives<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.640> those<00:01:35.759> soft

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
finish tip which gives you those soft

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.749 
finish tip which gives you those soft
edges<00:01:36.509> which<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:36.959> see<00:01:37.399> if<00:01:38.399> you<00:01:38.549> use<00:01:38.729> a

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
edges which you can see if you use a

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.789 
edges which you can see if you use a
standard<00:01:39.360> airless<00:01:39.840> tip<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.229> doesn't<00:01:40.500> have

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
standard airless tip it doesn't have

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.699 
standard airless tip it doesn't have
those<00:01:40.950> soft<00:01:41.219> edges<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.819> will<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.240> lines

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
those soft edges and you will see lines

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:47.149 
those soft edges and you will see lines
particularly<00:01:43.709> on<00:01:44.009> semi<00:01:44.340> gloss<00:01:45.739> paint<00:01:46.739> or<00:01:46.950> full

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
particularly on semi gloss paint or full

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.339 
particularly on semi gloss paint or full
gloss<00:01:47.340> paint<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.539> only<00:01:48.750> way<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.929> avoid<00:01:49.229> that

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:49.349 
gloss paint the only way to avoid that

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:51.229 
gloss paint the only way to avoid that
is<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.709> spray<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.039> lot<00:01:50.369> further<00:01:50.640> back<00:01:50.819> with<00:01:51.209> a

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:51.239 
is to spray a lot further back with a

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:52.940 
is to spray a lot further back with a
standard<00:01:51.720> tip<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.049> then<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.289> get<00:01:52.409> overspray

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
standard tip but then you get overspray

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.669 
standard tip but then you get overspray
so<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.369> reason<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.090> use<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.780> 5-inch<00:01:55.170> tip<00:01:55.500> is

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
so the reason you use the 5-inch tip is

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.779 
so the reason you use the 5-inch tip is
no<00:01:56.099> less<00:01:56.429> overspray<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.470> soft<00:01:58.739> edges<00:01:59.130> you

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
no less overspray and the soft edges you

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.630 
no less overspray and the soft edges you
also<00:02:00.030> use<00:02:00.329> less<00:02:00.539> paint<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.250> tip<00:02:02.459> i'm

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
also use less paint this this tip i'm

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.510 
also use less paint this this tip i'm
using<00:02:02.880> here<00:02:03.289> is<00:02:04.289> actually<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.679> worn<00:02:04.979> tip<00:02:05.310> oh<00:02:05.459> if

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
using here is actually a worn tip oh if

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.100 
using here is actually a worn tip oh if
you<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.969> throw<00:02:06.179> a<00:02:06.209> good<00:02:06.569> tip<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.869> kept

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
you think I throw a good tip and kept

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.380 
you think I throw a good tip and kept
the<00:02:07.289> bad<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.729> good<00:02:08.940> enough<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.299> this

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the bad one it's good enough for this

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.360

laughs<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.879> just<00:02:11.910> did<00:02:12.299> there<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.660> not<00:02:12.959> ideal<00:02:13.730> but

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
laughs I just did there is not ideal but

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.000 
laughs I just did there is not ideal but
feeling<00:02:15.599> where<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.959> I'd<00:02:16.290> be<00:02:16.530> pretty<00:02:16.829> much<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
feeling where is I'd be pretty much the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.349 
feeling where is I'd be pretty much the
only<00:02:17.220> one<00:02:17.459> that's<00:02:17.670> going<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.819> be<00:02:17.880> able<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.120> spot

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
only one that's going to be able to spot

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:19.879 
only one that's going to be able to spot
that<00:02:18.569> spot<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.170> I'm<00:02:19.290> over<00:02:19.500> your<00:02:19.650> panel

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:19.889 
that spot that I'm over your panel

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.340 
that spot that I'm over your panel
better<00:02:20.100> most<00:02:21.030> people<00:02:21.389> won't<00:02:21.630> see<00:02:21.989> that<00:02:22.170> it's

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
better most people won't see that it's

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.140 
better most people won't see that it's
very<00:02:22.560> very<00:02:22.799> hard<00:02:22.920> despite<00:02:23.250> understanding

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
very very hard despite understanding

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.610 
very very hard despite understanding
exactly<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.600> right<00:02:24.780> position<00:02:24.930> when<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.350> dries

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
exactly the right position when it dries

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.610 
exactly the right position when it dries
it's<00:02:25.950> not<00:02:26.220> really<00:02:26.489> noticeable<00:02:27.079> so<00:02:28.079> obviously

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
it's not really noticeable so obviously

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.319 
it's not really noticeable so obviously
these<00:02:28.799> big<00:02:29.040> square<00:02:29.370> panels<00:02:29.819> are<00:02:30.000> much<00:02:30.299> easier

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
these big square panels are much easier

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.379 
these big square panels are much easier
to<00:02:30.750> find<00:02:31.109> because<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.130> get<00:02:32.250> full<00:02:32.519> a<00:02:32.760> good<00:02:33.150> full

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
to find because you get full a good full

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.990 
to find because you get full a good full
run<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:33.840> each<00:02:33.959> panel<00:02:34.670> absolutely<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.760> can<00:02:35.880> see

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
run on each panel absolutely you can see

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.449 
run on each panel absolutely you can see
again<00:02:36.239> 50%<00:02:36.660> overlap<00:02:39.799> this<00:02:40.799> is<00:02:40.980> just<00:02:41.370> a

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
again 50% overlap this is just a

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.009 
again 50% overlap this is just a
standard<00:02:41.670> airless<00:02:42.090> machine<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.599> pretty<00:02:42.870> much

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
standard airless machine it pretty much

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.960 
standard airless machine it pretty much
any<00:02:43.230> else<00:02:43.470> machine<00:02:43.859> will<00:02:44.010> form<00:02:44.250> perform<00:02:44.819> the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
any else machine will form perform the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:03:05.200 
any else machine will form perform the
same<00:02:45.209> way<00:02:45.450> as<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:46.560> one

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.810 

I'll<00:03:06.210> just<00:03:06.420> do<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.600> couple<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:07.020> panels<00:03:07.350> for<00:03:07.560> ya

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
I'll just do a couple of panels for ya

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.870 
I'll just do a couple of panels for ya

back edge of the gutter on a new house
we'll<00:03:36.060> have<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.300> beat<00:03:36.420> herbs<00:03:36.660> down<00:03:36.930> because

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
we'll have to beat herbs down because

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.840 
we'll have to beat herbs down because
it'll<00:03:37.350> be<00:03:37.410> new<00:03:37.590> color<00:03:37.860> bond<00:03:38.070> but<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:38.700> just

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
it'll be new color bond but you just

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.520 
it'll be new color bond but you just
basically<00:03:39.030> spray<00:03:39.600> onto<00:03:39.960> the<00:03:40.050> bottom<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.410> the
