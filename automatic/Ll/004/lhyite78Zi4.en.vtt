today on commenting your code in C sharp

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.250 
today on commenting your code in C sharp
so<00:00:07.859> too<00:00:07.980> rare<00:00:08.130> comments<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:09.210> literally<00:00:09.480> just

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
type two forward slashes and then write

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.000 
type two forward slashes and then write
whatever<00:00:13.910> this<00:00:14.910> line<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.480> code<00:00:15.750> prints<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
whatever this line of code prints to the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.570 
whatever this line of code prints to the
console<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:18.470> comments<00:00:19.470> are<00:00:19.590> completely

console and comments are completely
ignored<00:00:21.150> by<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.480> compiler<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.140> compiler<00:00:22.500> is

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
ignored by the compiler the compiler is

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.519 
ignored by the compiler the compiler is

these<00:00:25.529> comments<00:00:25.980> are<00:00:26.240> completely<00:00:27.240> ignored<00:00:27.720> so

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
these comments are completely ignored so

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.880 
these comments are completely ignored so
you<00:00:27.900> can<00:00:28.019> write<00:00:28.170> whatever<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.529> hell<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.859> like

you can write whatever the hell you like

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.769 
you can write whatever the hell you like
and<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.640> final<00:00:29.880> program<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.510> will<00:00:30.599> make

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
and in the final program it will make

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.799 
and in the final program it will make
absolutely<00:00:31.349> no<00:00:31.410> difference<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.700> is

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
absolutely no difference so this is

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.290 
absolutely no difference so this is
mostly<00:00:33.809> used<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:34.320> as<00:00:34.790> you<00:00:35.790> know<00:00:35.910> sort<00:00:36.270> of

usually comment my methods with an these

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.719 
usually comment my methods with an these
multi<00:01:09.510> line<00:01:09.630> comments<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:11.220> main<00:01:11.460> method

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
multi line comments so the main method

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.810 
multi line comments so the main method
and<00:01:12.530> I<00:01:13.820> usually<00:01:15.049> comment<00:01:16.400> lines<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.549> code<00:01:17.700> that

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
and I usually comment lines of code that

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.179 
and I usually comment lines of code that
aren't<00:01:18.210> completely<00:01:18.630> obvious<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.710> single

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
line comments so I'll try and be common

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.390 
line comments so I'll try and be common
thing<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.270> much<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.600> possible<00:01:25.040> throughout<00:01:26.040> us

of<00:01:27.049> you<00:01:28.049> know<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.710> tutorial<00:01:29.130> series<00:01:29.490> um<00:01:30.500> but<00:01:31.500> you

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
of you know a tutorial series um but you

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.620 
of you know a tutorial series um but you
know<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.670> show<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.060> main<00:01:33.360> practice

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
know just to show you the main practice

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.530 
know just to show you the main practice
of<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.320> how<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.100> should<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.369> used<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.970> have

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
of it and how it should be used I have

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.910 
of it and how it should be used I have
but<00:01:36.930> I'll<00:01:37.110> probably<00:01:37.350> end<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.740> forgetting

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
but I'll probably end up forgetting

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.160 
but I'll probably end up forgetting
because<00:01:38.460> i<00:01:38.880> don't<00:01:39.299> want<00:01:39.329> consuming<00:01:39.810> community

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
because i don't want consuming community

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.649 
because i don't want consuming community
projects<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.280> unfortunately<00:01:41.610> i've<00:01:42.479> been

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
projects so unfortunately i've been

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.270 
projects so unfortunately i've been
stuck<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> bad<00:01:43.259> habit<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.740> not

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
stuck with the bad habit of not

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.749 
stuck with the bad habit of not
commenting<00:01:44.520> my<00:01:44.790> code<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.180> much<00:01:45.329> as<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.540> should

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
commenting my code as much as I should

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.600 
commenting my code as much as I should
but<00:01:47.759> I'm<00:01:48.360> trying<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.689> eradicate<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.619> bad

get into that bad habit I've bad
programming<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:56.040> yeah<00:01:56.159> that's<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:57.149> story

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
programming so yeah that's if this story

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.719 
programming so yeah that's if this story
I<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:58.229> wanted<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.500> make<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.520> wanted<00:01:59.700> to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
I just wanted to make I just wanted to

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
a lot of people tend to skip over so

a lot of people tend to skip over so
yeah<00:02:05.759> don't<00:02:06.030> don't<00:02:06.270> take<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:07.129> soil<00:02:08.129> lot

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
yeah don't don't take this soil lot

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.940 
yeah don't don't take this soil lot
lightly<00:02:09.119> regardless<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.720> how<00:02:09.780> short<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.319> so

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
lightly regardless of how short it is so
