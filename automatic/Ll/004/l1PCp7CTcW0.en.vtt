 have no downloading down you're going to 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.090
 find certain cell songs 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.070

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.270
 jogging we have the song of the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.170
 storms 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.560
 the song of the sun the position of the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.500
 position that we have the song of 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.330
 time and they have given baby these two 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.959
 last songs the time and they have 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.730
 giving a level do not have effects yet 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.310
 present news paraditas but these 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.770
 three and here I have companies for 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.650
 play the regular to make an ocarina 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.570
 is going to need clay as it is said 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.610
 the formula will be there in the link 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.160
 download to download it now 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.200
 I said I think second in sign 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.190
 and then they know and they will have it 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.450
 karina that they activate with the right click 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.610
 Then as I was saying, they are going to find 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.150
 the songs and to learn you're going to 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.280
 do it with the right click and it says already 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.860
 skin editor has learned the song of 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.160
 cure is that Nestor has learned the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.380
 song to heal a song of coral from 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.180
 the storms so I have already learned it 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.719
 song of the sun 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.430
 the song of time and the song of 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:58.230
 lobby 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.190
 which we are going to play first because 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.100
 I can not learn this 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.560
 no wonder I do not like how it sounds 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.070
 this is if they want good first let's go 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.990
 to play the violin song 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.790
 they rented to see but that's for 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.020
 cure all the defects that you have of 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.350
 positions for that will have to 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.350
 poison 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.819
 I'm poisoned now we're going to 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.480
 play the song and I'll check here in 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.480
 my sheet is 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.590
 I just come and heal alone makes 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.350
 that song that song that heals me 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.640
 pastera again so that when they are 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.640
 trying this is fast 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.260
 for the next song that we're going to 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.000
 playing is going to be the song of the 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.820
 storms I do not know if it's going to work 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.960
 because for a long time I could not learn to see 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.960
 let's see Song of Storms 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.070
 aita 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.810
 obviously, as is the song of 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.880
 the storms are going 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.730
 make rain obviously his own name 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.450
 He says it because I have not healed 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.450
 example with weapons 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:34.800
 or 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.340
 do not panic panic panic 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.850
 what 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.850
 ah 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.900
 is 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:49.580
 this credit 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.080
 not because I 'm not cured and there's another one 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.440
 once so I should not have 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.639
 poisoned besides good the next one that 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:02.080
 let's do is the song of the sun here 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.080
 let's see let's play the song of the sun 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.190
 Because it does not work 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.560
 to my mistake 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:17.610
 although he was very good at this 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:21.150
 arrives at the first one does not stop 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.840
 rain only makes the sun rise or 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.840
 get in 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.020
 again I was wrong it can not be 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:36.950
 there is no if he has it then 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.590
 totally to luck 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.670
 it is totally unintentionally good are the 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.980
 only functions that they have in effect 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:47.930
 makes you mess up just get out or 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:50.420
 cure you and make it rain I think that 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.100
 he also wants it to really rain 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.380
 next song that does not have any 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.380
 effect on the song of time 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:03.240
 this 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.240
 nothing more for the memories 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:12.060
 in more than anything I remember the great 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.919
 thing they do not do much but 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.180
 it's nothing because of the memories we're going to see the 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.180
 song without a doubt I saw 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:29.460
 imagine with a skin and I'm going to walk 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.470
 running everywhere but good 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.700
 people here is all that this contains 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.950
 Mount as I tell you we can only 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:38.300
 recover these little memories a 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.819
 specific memory playing cell and 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:44.900
 and to have it add something 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:46.039
 nice to your game good that I always say 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.780
 of all the engines that I realize 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:49.520
 whenever I recorded a nice but 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:54.280
 I could not bring any way all 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:57.610
 I choose them for you 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:00.010
 but good I retire people here go away 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.620
 remember to leave me a like if I out there 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.320
 you know how to help the channel as they listened 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.050
 in the intro 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.860
 and see you next time and let me 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.860
