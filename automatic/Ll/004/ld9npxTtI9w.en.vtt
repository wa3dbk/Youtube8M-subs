 Hydrangeas are plants of Asian origin, very rustic and easy to cultivate, with deciduous leaves 

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:31.257
 These plants produce flowers on the new branches, so pruning is done to stimulate the development of new shoots 

00:00:33.668 --> 00:00:38.668
 To keep the shrub compact and stimulate flowering it is advisable to prune the hydrangeas every year 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.649
 Proceed in autumn or towards the end of winter, when the plant is in vegetative rest 

00:00:47.462 --> 00:00:53.462
 First of all the wilted flowers and the ruined, stunted, twisted or sick branches are removed 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.060
 Then proceed by cutting all the branches shortening them by about a third of their length 

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:10.545
 In late autumn the hydrangeas already present the enlarged buds that will develop the branches of the following year 

00:01:13.836 --> 00:01:21.836
 therefore when we prune the old branches we arrive up to a well developed gem, which is possibly placed towards the outside of the bush 

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:32.921
 We avoid excessive pruning, which could cause the presence of many new branches 

00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:39.371
 and therefore to an excessive number of flowers, which would therefore tend to be too small 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.210
 Hydrangea pruning should also be done during the growing season 

00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:10.250
 also during the year also, on the plants in vegetation, we remove the weak or ruined branches from the bad weather
