00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.709
 survival yes yes yes 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.039

 with all my controls, it's good 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.980
 your decision as I want to 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.180
 example here but that will route headquarters 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.919
 before with the w 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.919
 Well, I'm changing it with the op 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.639
 the vision sounds that of many united 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.800
 little sensitivity I think it's the mouse 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.610
 if you are going a lot as well as if you have 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.729

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.249
 I thought 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.780
