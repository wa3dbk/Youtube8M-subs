 he does not remember that he has no corner lurking but different 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.680
 and the team around the boy 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.730
 staged 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.500
 that's who a BAFTA and certainly no marriage 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.209
 more than 500 what should 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.320
 also the first projects are back for something like that 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.929
 still possible to write yourself 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.929
 Some time ago the visit was the 90th 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:26.960
 worldwide 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.599
 a keyboard crater 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.829
 Picture Hoffmann there is the red write 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.450
 first time to report 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.050
 there all in place 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.050
 and Siemens once took place 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.720
 RÃ¼diger Rehm 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.340
 Trainier 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.830
 Fischenich that Moers and after mode will be 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.830
 give known mode 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.080
 meanwhile, and Dirk have swiftly 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.440
 on the nautical chart has few issues with the update Aabar he is 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.510
 that works 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.800
 Speer Statement not completely liquid 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.300
 it's all funny though 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300
 when the state recites that 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.200
 it is suspected that you are in a good mood 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.300
 Picture, however, quite good 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.770
 sometimes 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.230
 mol title game 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.580
 that's not the heat from the starter from there on to the look with an example 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.560
 creates 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.510
 we have to step up 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.570
 the final was a few players 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.940
 Christmas Day Surfers and so on 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.940
 Problem of this multitasking 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.000
 he has certainly seen since you can equal two players against each other 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.139
 play 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.249
 and that works too 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.899
 despite 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.899
 "Must come" as possible 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:23.559
 Stoppel Mare is moving that is 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.489
 the the 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.199
 and then we also had a bridal couple 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.699
 the Firefox 4 is not installed 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.199
 Flosdorff is betrayed in here 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.799
 how important a forest is asked to meet 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.560
 a year earlier Dr as interpreter 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.329
 that's why he demanded 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.129
 unrecognized for fair play 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.109
 that proves 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.889
 the lose and if that sentence does not look at the world either 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.040
 but here one can build around Afghans on the same as the criticism of the 90 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:10.900
 and if somebody else 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.900
 Unboxing video you like to watch 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:17.800
 rtr 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.119
 Rotterdam 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:24.399
 the air pollutes advised customers see 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:27.399
 I am currently alive 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.209
 really pretty neat heated up 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.409
 the Friends Red 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.869
 The massive animals do not lean 

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:42.869
 Firefox is a lot better 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.709
 but 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.709
 we also have music 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.979
 5 1 for yourself soon more time 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.179
 both should pull 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:03.179
 Dallas was brave and open 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:10.249
 amazing as that is not so good here 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.079
 Volker Marquardt 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.079
 that's why it comes 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.849
 Ruthemann works 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.629
 that's why it's funny 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.050
 like most smartphones 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.919
 Jan youtube video 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.919
 were represented 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.650
 and Bertrand Gille 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.520
 for me was not yet 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.520
 Red APA 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:52.520
 420 go youtube videos come on tv anyway tasted 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.370
 that jerks 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.249
 extremely strong 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:59.249
 there we have 1 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.169
 thus the dream and FDP in full screen mode 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:09.659
 also more dangerous 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.300
 Ulm 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.319
 Rostock 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.970
 Rheine 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.569
 ca 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.379
 rank 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:27.059
 H 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:29.960
 Grasser was not quite 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.110
 the man raced active squad back quarter degrees 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.180
 a woman Aachen the letter was at play of the crisis 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.439
 Queen Mary 2 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:43.439
 Prime Market 10 59 SID 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.139
 Tomorrow we want to 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:51.069
 Endurance test attractive 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:54.839
 then let's write a bit 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.900
 as you see by the way a little longer dead 

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:03.439
 you can sit comfortably 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:06.439
 is just as about Midi she Keller 90 

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:10.279
 and we want to Detmold BM until 20 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.039
 get everything out now 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:19.889
 and then we just leave in the Nile Delta 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:24.009
 and here 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.349
 Handwriting recognition 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:29.509
 and if you fall models now 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.509
 can record in the appendix and still celebrate 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:36.289
 Fritz Settele pleased 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.289
 because so far no one can say anything about that 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.180
 Seeing with other municipalities is mostly becomes exact 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.990
 no matter asked claim pluses all the super 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.479
 So take that offers June 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.319
 Duca community look forward 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:55.319
 Blog writes 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:59.180
 yes, what else is coming 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.919
 At Boxing Million there is the g-7 Carolinas and they 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.219
 I bet the device we are looking for now arrested 

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:08.939
 Of course, there is money 

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:11.659
 then watch her chosen globally 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:12.589
 alternatively you can
