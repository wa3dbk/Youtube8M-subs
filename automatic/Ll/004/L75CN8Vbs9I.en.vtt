00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.160 
screen so if I minimize that it
minimizes<00:04:01.260> it<00:04:01.770> say<00:04:02.610> if<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.880> go<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:03.320> Twitter<00:04:04.320> and

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
minimizes it say if I go to Twitter and

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.350 
minimizes it say if I go to Twitter and
cause<00:04:07.170> that<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.800> closes<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.460> app<00:04:08.610> so

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
cause that it closes the app so

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.540 
cause that it closes the app so
previously<00:04:09.630> you'd<00:04:10.140> have<00:04:10.260> to<00:04:10.380> swipe<00:04:11.100> down<00:04:11.310> here

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
previously you'd have to swipe down here

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.890 
previously you'd have to swipe down here
like<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:12.000> close<00:04:12.240> the<00:04:12.420> app<00:04:12.510> but<00:04:12.720> now<00:04:12.840> you

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
like that to close the app but now you

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.720 
like that to close the app but now you
can<00:04:13.170> close<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.620> through<00:04:13.800> that<00:04:13.950> cross<00:04:14.220> that's

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
can close it through that cross that's

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.150 
can close it through that cross that's
obviously<00:04:15.150> if<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.630> are<00:04:15.690> using<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:16.260> mouse<00:04:16.830> if

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
obviously if you are using a mouse if

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.620 
obviously if you are using a mouse if
using<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:17.459> touchscreen<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.209> don't<00:04:18.390> see

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
using a touchscreen so you don't see

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.190 
using a touchscreen so you don't see
those<00:04:18.840> those<00:04:19.799> things<00:04:20.160> off<00:04:20.400> there<00:04:21.080> Susan<00:04:22.080> move

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
those those things off there Susan move

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.700 
those those things off there Susan move
the<00:04:22.320> mouse<00:04:22.500> up<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:23.760> can<00:04:23.940> see<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.650> so<00:04:25.650> the

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
the mouse up and you can see that so the

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.780 
the mouse up and you can see that so the
other<00:04:25.800> thing<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:25.979> can<00:04:26.160> do<00:04:26.280> is<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.490> can<00:04:26.520> pin

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
other thing you can do is you can pin

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.410 
other thing you can do is you can pin
apps

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
apps

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.790 
apps
the<00:04:27.810> Windows<00:04:28.080> Store<00:04:28.350> app<00:04:28.500> is<00:04:28.650> actually

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
the Windows Store app is actually

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.630 
the Windows Store app is actually
already<00:04:29.040> pinned<00:04:30.200> so<00:04:31.200> this<00:04:31.710> is<00:04:31.740> my<00:04:32.040> flickr<00:04:32.400> app

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
already pinned so this is my flickr app

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.260 
already pinned so this is my flickr app
i<00:04:32.850> can<00:04:33.150> right<00:04:33.330> click<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:33.810> pin<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:35.270> so

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
i can right click and pin that and so

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.390 
i can right click and pin that and so
let's<00:04:36.420> say<00:04:36.600> close<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.290> out<00:04:37.440> so<00:04:38.010> if<00:04:38.100> i<00:04:38.160> want<00:04:38.340> to

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
let's say close that out so if i want to

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.620 
let's say close that out so if i want to
launch<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.760> app<00:04:38.850> now<00:04:39.030> i<00:04:39.060> don't<00:04:39.180> have<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.480> go<00:04:39.570> to

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
launch the app now i don't have to go to

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.750 
launch the app now i don't have to go to
the<00:04:39.840> full<00:04:40.020> start<00:04:40.320> screen<00:04:40.650> i<00:04:40.830> can<00:04:41.190> just<00:04:41.580> come

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
the full start screen i can just come

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.080 
the full start screen i can just come
down<00:04:41.970> here<00:04:42.470> watch<00:04:43.470> that<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.490> that<00:04:44.700> launches

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
down here watch that and that launches

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.790 
down here watch that and that launches
the<00:04:45.210> app<00:04:45.330> straight<00:04:45.690> away<00:04:45.960> from<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.380> task<00:04:46.650> bar

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
the app straight away from the task bar

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.160 
the app straight away from the task bar
goes<00:04:47.100> away<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:48.000> it's<00:04:48.150> a<00:04:48.180> nice<00:04:48.360> easy<00:04:48.720> way<00:04:49.140> of

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
goes away so it's a nice easy way of

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.310 
goes away so it's a nice easy way of
launching<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:51.090> Windows<00:04:51.360> Store<00:04:51.690> apps<00:04:51.750> without

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
launching the Windows Store apps without

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.580 
launching the Windows Store apps without

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
having to go to the Start screen another

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.140 
having to go to the Start screen another
change<00:04:58.890> is<00:04:59.160> a<00:05:00.320> compatibility<00:05:01.320> multi<00:05:01.650> 911<00:05:02.250> so

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
change is a compatibility multi 911 so

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.820 
change is a compatibility multi 911 so
what<00:05:03.510> this<00:05:03.600> means<00:05:03.840> is<00:05:03.990> that<00:05:04.050> you<00:05:04.410> can<00:05:04.590> add<00:05:04.800> a

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
what this means is that you can add a

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.190 
what this means is that you can add a
site<00:05:05.160> so<00:05:05.640> it<00:05:05.820> down<00:05:06.060> grades<00:05:06.420> or<00:05:06.780> pick<00:05:07.080> the

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
site so it down grades or pick the

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.810 
site so it down grades or pick the
browser<00:05:07.440> appears<00:05:07.830> downgraded<00:05:09.590> so<00:05:10.610> this<00:05:11.610> is<00:05:11.640> an

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
to my a 7 I think actually it emulates

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.200 
to my a 7 I think actually it emulates
ie9<00:05:35.820> not<00:05:36.120> 87<00:05:36.420> but<00:05:36.960> this<00:05:37.140> same<00:05:37.410> season<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.940> same

too<00:06:22.950> I<00:06:23.190> think<00:06:23.790> there<00:06:24.180> are<00:06:24.240> a<00:06:24.270> couple<00:06:24.360> to<00:06:24.600> change

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
too I think there are a couple to change

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.390 
too I think there are a couple to change
the<00:06:24.930> Intel<00:06:25.260> mainly<00:06:25.530> around<00:06:25.650> the<00:06:25.800> power<00:06:25.950> the

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
the Intel mainly around the power the

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.370 
the Intel mainly around the power the
power<00:06:26.790> button<00:06:27.000> as<00:06:27.660> you<00:06:27.720> see<00:06:27.960> the<00:06:28.200> dramatic

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
power button as you see the dramatic

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.040 
power button as you see the dramatic
changes<00:06:29.130> but<00:06:29.640> they<00:06:29.760> do<00:06:29.940> go<00:06:30.240> to<00:06:30.570> make

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
changes but they do go to make

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.280 
changes but they do go to make
integration<00:06:31.860> between<00:06:31.980> the<00:06:32.250> desktop<00:06:32.670> and<00:06:33.290> the

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
integration between the desktop and the

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.990 
integration between the desktop and the
modern<00:06:34.650> apps<00:06:34.860> a<00:06:35.130> little<00:06:35.400> better<00:06:35.580> and<00:06:35.730> you<00:06:35.880> can

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
modern apps a little better and you can

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.180 
modern apps a little better and you can
pin<00:06:36.210> them<00:06:36.360> that<00:06:36.600> kind<00:06:36.840> of<00:06:36.960> thing<00:06:37.860> future

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
pin them that kind of thing future

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.830
