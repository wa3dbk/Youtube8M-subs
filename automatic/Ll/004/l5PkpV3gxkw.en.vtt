00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
limited but in this case I'm not going

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.300 
limited but in this case I'm not going
to<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:54.390> don't<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.320> necessary<00:01:55.920> there's

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
to I don't think it's necessary there's

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.330 
to I don't think it's necessary there's
just<00:01:56.520> too<00:01:56.729> many<00:01:56.909> words<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:58.200> now<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.130> can

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
just too many words for that now you can

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.230 
just too many words for that now you can
also<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.850> we've<00:02:00.119> got<00:02:00.299> two<00:02:00.540> other<00:02:02.240> years

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
also see that we've got two other years

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.090 
also see that we've got two other years
in<00:02:03.509> here<00:02:03.810> which<00:02:04.079> seems<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.560> make<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> little

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
in here which seems to make it a little

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.880 
in here which seems to make it a little
complicated<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:06.750> first<00:02:07.049> one<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.770> was

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
complicated the first one is that it was

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.639 
complicated the first one is that it was
first<00:02:08.099> published<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> USA<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.410> 2006

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
first published in the USA in 2006

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.280 
first published in the USA in 2006
and<00:02:11.370> even<00:02:11.730> then<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.269> was<00:02:12.480> an<00:02:12.599> imprint<00:02:13.049> of

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
and even then that was an imprint of

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.970 
and even then that was an imprint of
Random<00:02:13.890> House<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:15.200> now<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.260> thing<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.620> we're

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
Random House but now the thing is we're

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.920 
Random House but now the thing is we're
not<00:02:17.010> sure<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.970> patient<00:02:18.540> embers<00:02:18.810> are

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
Edition and the UK edition in this case

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.640 
Edition and the UK edition in this case
so<00:02:25.010> we're<00:02:26.010> going<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.459> not<00:02:27.120> use<00:02:27.230> 2006<00:02:28.230> as<00:02:28.470> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
so we're going to not use 2006 as the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.190 
so we're going to not use 2006 as the
date<00:02:28.940> we<00:02:29.940> also<00:02:30.120> see<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.810> says<00:02:30.989> this

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
date we also see that it says this

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.080 
date we also see that it says this

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
edition and in which case reduce the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.670 
edition and in which case reduce the
year<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.299> paperback<00:02:48.690> edition<00:02:48.780> but<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
year of the paperback edition but the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.890 
year of the paperback edition but the
simplest<00:02:50.069> way<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.579> to<00:02:50.819> dis<00:02:51.269> use<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.690> version

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
simplest way is to dis use the version

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.770 
simplest way is to dis use the version
at<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.530> top<00:02:52.799> so<00:02:53.760> we've<00:02:53.940> got<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.329> main<00:02:54.540> bits

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
at the top so we've got the main bits

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.319 
at the top so we've got the main bits
that<00:02:54.959> we<00:02:55.140> need<00:02:55.409> for<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.370> reference<00:02:56.849> we<00:02:57.120> just

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
that we need for a reference we just

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.680 
that we need for a reference we just
have<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.690> reorganize<00:02:58.019> them<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.620> little<00:02:58.920> bit<00:02:59.099> and

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
have to reorganize them a little bit and

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:07.099 
have to reorganize them a little bit and
the<00:03:00.690> way<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> reference<00:03:01.349> works<00:03:04.159> is<00:03:05.780> this<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:06.840> the

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
the way a reference works is this is the

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:13.309 
the way a reference works is this is the
references<00:03:07.739> list<00:03:08.129> at<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.609> end<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:12.319> paper

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
references list at the end of the paper

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.990 
references list at the end of the paper
that<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.709> do<00:03:13.859> in<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.840> we<00:03:15.840> start<00:03:16.139> off<00:03:16.760> with<00:03:17.760> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
that you do in and we start off with the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.099 
that you do in and we start off with the
surname<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.720> author<00:03:19.459> then<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.489> comma<00:03:21.109> then

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
surname of the author then a comma then

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.650 
surname of the author then a comma then
their<00:03:22.950> initial<00:03:24.349> followed<00:03:25.349> by<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> full<00:03:25.889> stop

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
their initial followed by a full stop

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.680 
their initial followed by a full stop
then<00:03:27.660> we<00:03:27.810> do<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.680> year<00:03:29.060> then<00:03:30.060> we<00:03:30.150> do<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.419> title

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
then we do the year then we do the title

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.250 
then we do the year then we do the title
of<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.959> book<00:03:34.129> then<00:03:35.129> we<00:03:35.190> do<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.370> full<00:03:35.549> stop<00:03:36.260> space

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
of the book then we do a full stop space

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.770 
of the book then we do a full stop space
and<00:03:37.560> then<00:03:38.400> we<00:03:38.760> do<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.090> city<00:03:39.359> of<00:03:39.569> publication

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
and then we do the city of publication

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.819 
and then we do the city of publication
where<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.829> was<00:03:40.949> published<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:43.049> publisher

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
where it was published and the publisher

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.659 
where it was published and the publisher
that<00:03:44.030> put<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.060> full<00:03:45.269> stop<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:47.190> thing<00:03:47.370> we<00:03:47.519> do

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
that put a full stop and the thing we do

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:53.839 
that put a full stop and the thing we do
is<00:03:47.970> title<00:03:48.530> we<00:03:49.530> tell<00:03:49.799> size<00:03:50.069> it<00:03:51.980> so<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.190> is<00:03:53.459> what

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
is title we tell size it so that is what

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.539 
is title we tell size it so that is what
I<00:03:54.060> would<00:03:54.209> consider<00:03:54.599> perfect<00:03:55.349> reference<00:03:55.549> now

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
I would consider perfect reference now

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.619 
I would consider perfect reference now
there<00:03:56.819> are<00:03:56.970> slight<00:03:57.299> variations<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:58.169> our<00:03:58.349> style
