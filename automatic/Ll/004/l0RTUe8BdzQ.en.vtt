a level of progress is to your wheel
becomes<00:02:18.900> faster<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.630> one<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
becomes faster so this is one of the

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.540 
becomes faster so this is one of the
special<00:02:22.350> levels<00:02:22.650> where<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.100> start<00:02:23.430> off

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
special levels where you start off

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.270 
special levels where you start off
initially<00:02:23.880> with<00:02:24.420> full<00:02:24.660> speed<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.980> adds

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
initially with full speed so that adds

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.720 
initially with full speed so that adds
to<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.580> challenge<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:31.250> this<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.459> boss

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
to the challenge and this is a boss

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.900 
to the challenge and this is a boss
level<00:02:33.000> where<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.900> go<00:02:34.290> destroy<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:35.370> boss<00:02:35.550> and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
level where you go destroy the boss and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:44.960 
level where you go destroy the boss and
you<00:02:36.390> do<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.780> by<00:02:36.840> collecting<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:38.040> White<00:02:38.220> Star

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.210
