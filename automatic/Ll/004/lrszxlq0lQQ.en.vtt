I rocked it so then heard this take and

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.649 
I rocked it so then heard this take and
hold<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.220> really<00:02:38.430> nice<00:02:38.610> curl<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.299> definitely

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
hold a really nice curl so I definitely

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.740
