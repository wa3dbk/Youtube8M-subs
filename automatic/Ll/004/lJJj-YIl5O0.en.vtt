00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
system they just came out with this

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.010 
system they just came out with this
product<00:00:36.940> probably<00:00:37.940> four<00:00:38.390> or<00:00:38.420> five<00:00:38.540> years<00:00:38.930> ago

happens is after you shut your engine
off<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.579> fuel<00:01:34.819> stops<00:01:35.270> flowing<00:01:35.719> through

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
off and the fuel stops flowing through

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.559 
off and the fuel stops flowing through
the<00:01:36.409> injectors<00:01:36.979> there's<00:01:37.969> a<00:01:38.060> small<00:01:38.539> amount

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
the injectors there's a small amount

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.649 
the injectors there's a small amount
that<00:01:39.229> is<00:01:39.919> left<00:01:40.219> on<00:01:40.459> the<00:01:40.490> tip<00:01:40.849> of<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.179> injector

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
that is left on the tip of the injector

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.159 
that is left on the tip of the injector
and<00:01:41.829> the<00:01:42.829> heat<00:01:43.099> from<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:43.579> engine<00:01:43.840> either<00:01:44.840> in

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:45.169 
and the heat from the engine either in

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:47.349 
and the heat from the engine either in
the<00:01:45.349> intake<00:01:45.740> port<00:01:46.009> on<00:01:46.249> a<00:01:46.310> port<00:01:46.789> fuel-injected

gas direct-injected engine causes heat
soak<00:01:53.919> to<00:01:54.919> occur<00:01:55.279> with<00:01:55.549> that<00:01:55.729> injector<00:01:56.299> and

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
soak to occur with that injector and

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.059 
soak to occur with that injector and
what<00:01:56.689> that<00:01:56.869> means<00:01:57.109> is<00:01:57.349> basically<00:01:57.560> the

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
what that means is basically the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.719 
what that means is basically the
injector<00:01:59.079> sits<00:02:00.079> there<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.590> it's<00:02:01.039> like<00:02:01.159> baking

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
injector sits there and it's like baking

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.690 
injector sits there and it's like baking
in<00:02:01.909> an<00:02:01.999> oven<00:02:02.179> and<00:02:02.919> until<00:02:03.919> that<00:02:04.099> engine<00:02:04.459> cools

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
in an oven and until that engine cools

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.120 
in an oven and until that engine cools
down<00:02:04.819> all<00:02:05.179> the<00:02:05.299> way<00:02:05.419> the<00:02:06.200> temperature<00:02:06.799> inside

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
down all the way the temperature inside

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.370 
down all the way the temperature inside
there<00:02:07.549> actually<00:02:07.880> rises<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.630> little<00:02:08.780> bit<00:02:09.170> right

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
there actually rises a little bit right

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.779 
there actually rises a little bit right
after<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:09.709> shut<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:09.920> off<00:02:10.160> because<00:02:10.459> the

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
after you shut it off because the

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.750 
after you shut it off because the
cooling<00:02:11.209> system<00:02:11.719> has<00:02:11.930> stopped<00:02:12.230> working<00:02:12.760> and

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
cooling system has stopped working and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.990 
cooling system has stopped working and
then<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.269> gradually<00:02:14.450> cools<00:02:14.930> down<00:02:15.079> after<00:02:15.560> that

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
then it gradually cools down after that

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.630 
then it gradually cools down after that
but<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.050> little<00:02:17.320> bit<00:02:17.440> of<00:02:17.560> fuel<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.220> is<00:02:18.370> left

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
but that little bit of fuel that is left

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.970 
but that little bit of fuel that is left
on<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:18.850> tip<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.360> injector<00:02:19.990> or<00:02:20.170> left<00:02:20.800> in

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
on the tip of that injector or left in

sensitive part of the injector for

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.020 
sensitive part of the injector for
plugging<00:02:28.110> has<00:02:29.110> this<00:02:29.410> small<00:02:30.010> drop<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.430> gasoline

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
plugging has this small drop of gasoline

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.630 
plugging has this small drop of gasoline
left<00:02:31.390> in<00:02:31.630> there<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:32.620> gasoline<00:02:33.190> gets

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
left in there and that gasoline gets

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.930 
left in there and that gasoline gets
cooked<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:35.050> breaks<00:02:35.410> down<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:36.070> leaves<00:02:36.640> behind

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
cooked and breaks down and leaves behind

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.770 
cooked and breaks down and leaves behind
deposits<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.020> those<00:02:38.860> deposits<00:02:39.670> cause<00:02:40.390> that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
deposits and those deposits cause that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.640 
deposits and those deposits cause that
injector<00:02:41.560> tip<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.490> get<00:02:42.670> plugged<00:02:43.060> up<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:44.080> not

injector tip to get plugged up and not
function<00:02:45.160> properly<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.820> so<00:02:46.360> then<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.660> next

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
function properly and so then the next

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.220 
function properly and so then the next
time<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.530> start<00:02:47.860> your<00:02:47.920> car<00:02:48.280> up<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
time you start your car up and the

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.010 
time you start your car up and the
injector<00:02:50.709> starts<00:02:51.070> firing<00:02:51.370> again<00:02:51.820> it<00:02:52.600> can't

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
injector starts firing again it can't

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.040 
injector starts firing again it can't
fire<00:02:53.380> completely<00:02:54.450> correctly<00:02:55.450> because

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
fire completely correctly because

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.050 
fire completely correctly because
there's<00:02:56.320> those<00:02:56.530> little<00:02:56.830> hard<00:02:57.160> deposits<00:02:57.550> that

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
there's those little hard deposits that

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.560 
there's those little hard deposits that
are<00:02:58.120> now<00:02:58.330> baked<00:02:58.690> in<00:02:58.930> there<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.970> caused<00:03:01.300> the

nice<00:03:05.200> fine<00:03:05.739> mist<00:03:06.480> like<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.630> want<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.020> be

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
nice fine mist like you want it to be

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.590 
nice fine mist like you want it to be

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
now all the sudden turns into a stream

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.590 
now all the sudden turns into a stream
or<00:03:11.410> big<00:03:12.280> droplets<00:03:12.610> are<00:03:13.030> coming<00:03:13.300> out<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.480> that

injector and those droplets or streams
of<00:03:18.610> fuel<00:03:18.880> do<00:03:19.720> not<00:03:19.930> ignite<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.100> combustion

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
of fuel do not ignite in the combustion

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.500 
of fuel do not ignite in the combustion
chamber<00:03:22.350> properly<00:03:23.350> they<00:03:24.070> tend<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.610> puddle<00:03:25.269> or

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
chamber properly they tend to puddle or

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.970 
chamber properly they tend to puddle or
pool<00:03:25.780> somewhere<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:27.489> cause<00:03:28.980> incomplete

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
pool somewhere and cause incomplete

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.310 
pool somewhere and cause incomplete
combustion<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.850> so<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.840> engine<00:03:32.140> is<00:03:32.260> not

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
combustion and so the engine is not

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.100 
combustion and so the engine is not
running<00:03:32.500> correctly<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:34.209> injectors<00:03:34.750> are<00:03:34.930> not

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
running correctly the injectors are not

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.320 
running correctly the injectors are not
opening<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.160> closing<00:03:36.580> correctly<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.269> the

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
opening and closing correctly and the

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.390 
opening and closing correctly and the
fuel<00:03:37.600> is<00:03:37.810> not<00:03:37.860> atomizing<00:03:38.860> with<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.220> air

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
fuel is not atomizing with the air

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.210 
fuel is not atomizing with the air
correctly<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:41.019> so<00:03:41.290> that's<00:03:41.560> where<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:41.890> start

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
correctly and so that's where you start

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.400 
correctly and so that's where you start
to<00:03:42.370> notice<00:03:42.549> you<00:03:42.880> know<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.060> got<00:03:43.299> a<00:03:43.330> new<00:03:43.510> car<00:03:43.750> it

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
to notice you know you got a new car it

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.190 
to notice you know you got a new car it
ran<00:03:44.680> really<00:03:44.829> good<00:03:45.130> for<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.430> first<00:03:45.640> you<00:03:46.060> know

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
ran really good for the first you know

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.960 
ran really good for the first you know
ten<00:03:47.200> fifteen<00:03:47.650> thousand<00:03:48.160> miles<00:03:48.310> but<00:03:48.700> then<00:03:48.850> you

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
ten fifteen thousand miles but then you

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.479 
ten fifteen thousand miles but then you
gradually<00:03:49.690> started<00:03:50.200> losing<00:03:50.620> performance<00:03:51.250> and

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
gradually started losing performance and

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.880 
gradually started losing performance and
gradually<00:03:52.090> started<00:03:52.510> losing<00:03:52.930> fuel<00:03:53.680> mileage

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
gradually started losing fuel mileage

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.069 
gradually started losing fuel mileage
and<00:03:54.310> efficiency<00:03:54.850> avid<00:03:55.209> engine<00:03:55.540> maybe<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.930> got

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
and efficiency avid engine maybe it got

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.509 
and efficiency avid engine maybe it got
a<00:03:56.320> little<00:03:56.650> bit<00:03:56.799> harder<00:03:57.190> to<00:03:57.220> start<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:59.519> fuel

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
a little bit harder to start and fuel

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.789 
a little bit harder to start and fuel
that<00:04:00.730> has<00:04:00.790> ethanol<00:04:01.540> in<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.840> is<00:04:01.959> even<00:04:02.620> more

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
that has ethanol in it is even more

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.650 
that has ethanol in it is even more
susceptible<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.549> this<00:04:03.820> because<00:04:04.360> of<00:04:04.570> the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
susceptible to this because of the

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.080 
susceptible to this because of the
problems<00:04:05.140> associated<00:04:05.500> with<00:04:05.890> ethanol<00:04:06.579> and<00:04:06.850> it

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
problems associated with ethanol and it

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.449 
problems associated with ethanol and it
drawing<00:04:07.510> more<00:04:07.900> water<00:04:08.230> into<00:04:08.560> your<00:04:08.680> system<00:04:09.220> and

drawing more water into your system and

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.170 
drawing more water into your system and
it<00:04:10.060> also<00:04:10.090> leaves<00:04:10.750> behind<00:04:11.370> more<00:04:12.370> deposits<00:04:13.030> in

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
it also leaves behind more deposits in

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.789 
it also leaves behind more deposits in
your<00:04:13.209> system<00:04:14.310> now<00:04:15.310> most<00:04:16.060> new<00:04:16.900> gasoline<00:04:17.200> that's

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
your system now most new gasoline that's
