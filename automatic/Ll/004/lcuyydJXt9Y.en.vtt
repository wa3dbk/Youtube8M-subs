00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.940
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.960
 first tutorial on minecraft on one 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.820
 2.0 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.270
 Today I want to show you how you are 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.710
 can create custom ops without mods that 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.210
 the only thing you need is minecraft 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.230
 and decides we have say 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.610
 enter now in the world carry the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.000
 I made extra notes I'm doing now 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:45.149
 from now on all my tutorials on it 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:50.540
 and yes it's always dark and 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.540
 hope here 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.200
 down quiet here the banks bit 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:16.119
 Blessings are usually the body up 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:23.500
 the spiders and here we see the 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:26.759
 Bats have their heads where they are 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.759
 can also use 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.750
 there 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.520
 As you print it is still a little bit 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.590
 Yes 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.289
 I think I built to the sand now 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:17.450
 yes I have this man is 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:22.080
 usually national the kripo on the 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.940
 you on the spiders on it and I show 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:44.100
 Now how do you build mine? 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:46.520
 everyday once a monster are gone here 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.830
 you can see it again now 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:03:01.700
 Bats have the butter you can 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:03:04.590
 also with witches and to darken there 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.330
 actually sometimes the bodies live like that 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.330
 are now on the spiders on it 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:37.330
 relatively just stop just the monster 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.800
 So over each other to lock the need 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:52.690
 In any case, that's very important 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:57.910
 stand on top of each other so spider left 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:09.489
 Steinert, too , makes it clear 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:10.630
 are you see it better so that's it 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.290
 Now, of course , they always say 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.560
 and is separated again in a 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.560
 equal 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.860
 Sony calls very true in the latest 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:31.370
 version at the moment and then went ours 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:34.280
 world so in it the other athletes here 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.570
 are now the new red are always 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:42.620
 monster and now we will be here 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.940
 just left- click the videos like 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.350
 people who are meadows and pull that 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.350
 then up at the top 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.530
 have marked so now I was up 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.270
 I'll filter you my filter 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.850
 folder in the description west with it 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.830
 do not download the filters 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.280
 But I have to do more later 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.650
 purely 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.080
 I find a little bit up 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.590
 In each case we need three filters 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:18.139
 once exchange ruk properties and 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:20.150
 ingrid creators must be in this 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.250
 order makes first and the 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.460
 Filter off glue 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.910
 finished rockford pittis here now 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:39.020
 Stop life and come here 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:40.490
 For example, there are no names yet 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:49.160
 we have to know if you name 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:51.620
 first name filter and craig tuck that 's it 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.220
 now we can do it 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:58.990
 he has said it before and we say 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.990
 we 'll just meet again 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.950
 yes and there we are also successful mz 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.850
 arrived and now we go first 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:16.270
 back to our world 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:17.800
 I hope that everything worked out yes there 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.640
 you can see it right now 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.450
 Herbert is back we can now too 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.350
 we want to push the opponents 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.330
 apart 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:31.210
 guess that the front was just too 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:33.910
 close and yes if you more so what 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.580
 therefore countless wanted to see 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.960
 possibilities even if you see more 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.640
 you want to know in the comments 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.580
 Write or generally she was 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:46.240
 wanted to see the thing with a horse 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:48.040
 really cool and there you can do a lot 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.630
 Much more stuff I do right 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:55.420
 money there is the next herbert export 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:56.320
 via mail herbert yes I hope it has 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.570

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.970
 all download links can be found in the 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.410
 description and of course, say what is 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:08.650
 First of all thank you for watching us 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:10.600
 We still see it flies for the lady 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.280
 from bochum that said yes that can 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.810
 also with witches and if you do 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.580
 Bats do the nurses times 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.380
 so be below for example if now 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.370
 witches and four then do it can 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.370
 be that it does not work 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.950
 thank you for watching 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:41.110
 and then I would say 

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:44.250
 with an epic in the deep 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.250
 we say goodbye
