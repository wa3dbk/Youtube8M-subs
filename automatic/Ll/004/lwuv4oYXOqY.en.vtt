easy with my technique how you can do

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.280 
easy with my technique how you can do
curves<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.729> make<00:00:47.210> them<00:00:47.360> just<00:00:47.690> as<00:00:47.870> simple<00:00:48.170> and

curves and make them just as simple and

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.340 
curves and make them just as simple and
easy<00:00:48.379> as<00:00:48.739> doing<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:49.550> straight<00:00:49.850> piece<00:00:50.089> block<00:00:50.420> the

easy as doing a straight piece block the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.950 
easy as doing a straight piece block the
way<00:00:51.500> I<00:00:51.530> do<00:00:51.680> my<00:00:51.860> curved<00:00:52.670> piecing<00:00:53.149> is<00:00:53.329> I<00:00:53.570> use<00:00:53.929> a

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
way I do my curved piecing is I use a

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.139 
way I do my curved piecing is I use a
product<00:00:54.410> called<00:00:54.590> wonder<00:00:55.219> tape<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:55.730> the

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
product called wonder tape and the

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.630 
product called wonder tape and the
wonder<00:00:56.480> tape<00:00:56.690> is<00:00:56.899> going<00:00:57.079> to<00:00:57.230> let<00:00:57.440> you<00:00:57.739> do<00:00:58.609> your

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
wonder tape is going to let you do your

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.569 
wonder tape is going to let you do your
curves<00:00:59.149> and<00:00:59.449> use<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.289> tape<00:01:00.559> instead<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:01.250> pins

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
curves and use the tape instead of pins

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.060 
curves and use the tape instead of pins
this<00:01:02.149> is<00:01:02.300> complete<00:01:02.690> pinless<00:01:03.170> method<00:01:03.620> of<00:01:03.739> doing

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
this is complete pinless method of doing

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.719 
this is complete pinless method of doing
your<00:01:04.460> curves<00:01:05.059> so<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:06.740> way<00:01:06.920> you<00:01:06.979> do<00:01:07.280> this<00:01:07.460> is

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
your curves so the way you do this is

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.790 
your curves so the way you do this is
you<00:01:08.030> simply<00:01:08.240> take<00:01:08.660> your<00:01:08.690> wonder<00:01:09.229> tape<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:09.710> I'm

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
you simply take your wonder tape and I'm

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.740 
you simply take your wonder tape and I'm
going<00:01:09.979> to<00:01:10.009> fix<00:01:10.369> it's<00:01:10.640> very<00:01:10.880> sticky<00:01:11.179> so<00:01:11.720> you

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
going to fix it's very sticky so you

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.870 
going to fix it's very sticky so you
take<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.649> wonder<00:01:12.950> tape<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:13.429> you're<00:01:13.729> going<00:01:13.850> to

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
take the wonder tape and you're going to

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.570 
take the wonder tape and you're going to
fix<00:01:14.179> it<00:01:14.330> to<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.509> edge<00:01:14.780> of<00:01:15.170> your<00:01:15.229> curve<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.490> you

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
fix it to the edge of your curve and you

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.910 
fix it to the edge of your curve and you
roll<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:17.090> tape<00:01:17.659> out<00:01:17.869> and<00:01:18.110> I<00:01:18.170> don't<00:01:18.409> cut<00:01:18.679> the

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
roll the tape out and I don't cut the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.330 
roll the tape out and I don't cut the
tape<00:01:19.179> away<00:01:20.179> until<00:01:20.869> I've<00:01:21.140> completely<00:01:21.890> clipped

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
tape away until I've completely clipped

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.180 
tape away until I've completely clipped
my<00:01:22.729> curves<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:24.289> have<00:01:24.440> to<00:01:24.560> clip<00:01:24.800> about

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
my curves so you have to clip about

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.950 
my curves so you have to clip about
every<00:01:25.490> inch<00:01:25.670> or<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.030> just<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.540> can<00:01:26.659> get<00:01:26.780> the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
every inch or so just so you can get the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.249 
every inch or so just so you can get the
tape<00:01:27.229> to<00:01:27.829> go<00:01:27.979> around<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.430> curve<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.570> just<00:01:29.990> clip

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
tape to go around the curve so just clip

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.980 
tape to go around the curve so just clip
on<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:30.500> diagonal<00:01:31.009> just<00:01:31.460> like<00:01:32.149> I<00:01:32.299> am<00:01:32.450> here<00:01:32.840> and

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
on a diagonal just like I am here and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.859 
on a diagonal just like I am here and
then<00:01:33.740> I'm<00:01:33.979> simply<00:01:34.280> going<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.820> lay<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.840> tape

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
then I'm simply going to lay the tape

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.899 
then I'm simply going to lay the tape
very<00:01:36.829> very<00:01:37.189> on<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:38.090> very<00:01:38.270> edge<00:01:38.509> of<00:01:38.840> your<00:01:39.909> curve

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
very very on the very edge of your curve

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.940 
very very on the very edge of your curve
and<00:01:41.210> this<00:01:41.360> is<00:01:41.420> on<00:01:41.719> the<00:01:41.750> outside<00:01:42.320> edge<00:01:42.560> of<00:01:42.740> the

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
and this is on the outside edge of the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.910 
and this is on the outside edge of the
curve<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:44.540> once<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:44.930> have<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.290> tape<00:01:45.530> on<00:01:45.740> there

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
curve so once you have the tape on there

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.130 
curve so once you have the tape on there
you<00:01:46.040> can<00:01:46.189> rip<00:01:46.430> this<00:01:46.610> off<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.770> then<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:49.310> will

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
you can rip this off and then you will

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.359 
you can rip this off and then you will
make<00:01:51.140> sure<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.649> tape<00:01:51.860> is<00:01:52.039> on<00:01:52.159> there

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
make sure that the tape is on there

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.770 
make sure that the tape is on there
secure<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:53.420> pull<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.320> paper<00:01:54.619> side<00:01:55.070> off<00:01:55.369> and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
secure you pull the paper side off and

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.499 
secure you pull the paper side off and
once<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:56.930> have<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.200> paper<00:01:57.409> off<00:01:57.740> now<00:01:58.579> all<00:01:59.240> you

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
once you have the paper off now all you

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:00.819 
once you have the paper off now all you
need<00:01:59.539> to<00:01:59.750> do<00:01:59.899> is<00:02:00.170> you're<00:02:00.380> going<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.619> start

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
need to do is you're going to start

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.440 
need to do is you're going to start
matching<00:02:01.189> your<00:02:01.579> edges<00:02:01.939> just<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.299> way<00:02:02.390> you

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
matching your edges just the way you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.090 
matching your edges just the way you
would<00:02:02.750> if<00:02:02.869> you<00:02:02.960> were<00:02:02.990> pinning<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.560> except<00:02:03.950> now

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
would if you were pinning it except now

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.429 
would if you were pinning it except now
it's<00:02:04.369> much<00:02:04.700> easier<00:02:05.119> you're<00:02:05.869> going<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.289> be<00:02:06.380> able

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
it's much easier you're going to be able

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.919 
it's much easier you're going to be able
to<00:02:06.740> match<00:02:07.609> your<00:02:07.880> edges<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.299> start<00:02:08.570> with<00:02:08.690> one

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
to match your edges you start with one

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.650 
to match your edges you start with one
corner<00:02:09.350> right<00:02:09.799> here<00:02:09.829> and<00:02:10.239> you<00:02:11.239> just<00:02:11.269> match

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
corner right here and you just match

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.110 
corner right here and you just match
your<00:02:11.930> edges<00:02:12.320> just<00:02:12.590> like<00:02:12.739> this<00:02:13.040> you're<00:02:13.850> going

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
your edges just like this you're going

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.949 
your edges just like this you're going
to<00:02:14.239> go<00:02:14.390> ahead<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:15.019> match<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.560> other<00:02:15.769> side<00:02:15.890> and

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
to go ahead and match the other side and

to go ahead and match the other side and
match<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:18.260> corner<00:02:18.739> and<00:02:18.890> match<00:02:19.370> your<00:02:19.609> edges

match that corner and match your edges

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.849 
match that corner and match your edges
and<00:02:20.890> then<00:02:21.910> simply<00:02:22.959> work<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.079> to<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.380> center

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:24.859 
and then simply work it to the center

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.610 
and then simply work it to the center
and<00:02:25.010> by<00:02:25.400> doing<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.120> make<00:02:26.480> sure<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.109> you

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
and by doing this you make sure that you

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.550 
and by doing this you make sure that you
don't<00:02:28.010> have<00:02:28.280> any<00:02:28.670> puckers<00:02:29.299> or<00:02:29.510> any<00:02:29.660> pleats<00:02:30.079> one

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
don't have any puckers or any pleats one

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.050 
don't have any puckers or any pleats one
of<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.739> biggest<00:02:31.100> problems<00:02:31.579> that<00:02:31.669> people<00:02:31.760> have

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
of the biggest problems that people have

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.120 
of the biggest problems that people have
doing<00:02:32.510> curves<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:33.019> they<00:02:33.380> tend<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:33.949> in

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
doing curves is they tend to so in

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
doing curves is they tend to so in
pleats<00:02:34.430> I'm<00:02:34.880> going

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
pleats I'm going

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.610 
pleats I'm going
make<00:02:35.299> sure<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.599> you<00:02:35.720> don't<00:02:35.900> do<00:02:36.079> that<00:02:36.260> and

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
make sure that you don't do that and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.289 
make sure that you don't do that and
another<00:02:36.980> thing<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.370> happens<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.909> sometimes

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
another thing that happens is sometimes

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.059 
another thing that happens is sometimes
you<00:02:38.480> get<00:02:38.569> more<00:02:38.840> fabric<00:02:39.140> on<00:02:39.439> one<00:02:39.620> side<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:39.890> a

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
you get more fabric on one side of a

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.770 
you get more fabric on one side of a
curve<00:02:40.280> than<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.610> other<00:02:40.760> when<00:02:41.269> you<00:02:41.390> start<00:02:41.659> from

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
curve than the other when you start from

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.390 
curve than the other when you start from
the<00:02:41.900> outside<00:02:42.349> and<00:02:42.470> work<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.799> to<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:42.920> inside

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
the outside and work it to the inside

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.789 
the outside and work it to the inside
you'll<00:02:43.879> end<00:02:44.060> up<00:02:44.209> getting<00:02:44.569> absolutely<00:02:45.439> no

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
you'll end up getting absolutely no

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.710 
you'll end up getting absolutely no
you'll<00:02:46.159> be<00:02:46.189> able<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.489> ease<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.909> in<00:02:47.180> in<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
you'll be able to ease it in in the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.059 
you'll be able to ease it in in the
center<00:02:48.079> because<00:02:48.230> that's<00:02:48.560> where<00:02:48.829> all<00:02:48.890> your
