 geosat 4 for 4 and indicator m studied you have to do you are registered 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.620
 developed by private individuals in collaboration with the Italian federation fit 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.899
 off road 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.350
 in collaboration with the whole military geographical institute 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.760
 in fact it is the only navigator that integrates over teleatlas cats 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.700
 topographic maps ign this what you would see in romania to install a 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.070
 true are the data a madness fire at last 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.500
 but if we go military 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.510
 functions me 4for4 the lack of together here is the result - 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.660
 Homer 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.650
 in much more detailed detail 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.740
 cartographic data network we also see mule tracks and paths that are not 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.960
 traces of the teleacras cartography 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.439
 therefore very valuable very useful dating 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.360
 and fresh navigation 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.620
 amaterasu important of software functions 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.790
 car 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.530
 dedicated to navigation by road 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.359
 poor our seed we represent 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.569
 if you don't find navigators tomorrow elnagh distance a small icon an 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:36.090
 the corner of the evening while here hey trip master zucchini rolls or the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.509
 partial and total meter counter 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.480
 a tool 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.480
 absolutely useful for free street navigation 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.840
 another very important function 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.840
 it is the possibility to install the tracks of completed routes 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.420
 eh you can save up to 10 - totals china all 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.320
 the fact that you can share and therefore am dead is nice 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.719
 compatible with software such as 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.750
 other software management is available 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.009
 text merchant can then share these tracks 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.719
 contrada virtual street community 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.609
 and no function if it is in great demand is widely used for 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.009
 mount m 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.659
 but also many geocaching images, for example that are no morgan 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:23.749
 this sector
