00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.450
 in the bobinger 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.940
 Now he has heard that star 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.390
 classic bobinger in the fall in the finish 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.240
 set in the bobinger that is it is 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.040
 I would say lacquered with clear lacquer 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.810
 has a bit of a satin finish 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.690
 surface so not completely dull 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.380
 very shiny for one or the other 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.450
 maybe a bit 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.580
 living room cabinet character i am here 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.350
 really cool from the optics and also 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.990
 grad with the black nickel plated 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.759
 hardware as you can see there and good 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:33.070
 We have the sizes 22 16 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.569
 at the bass drum so a bit 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.130
 shorter than it is meanwhile 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.470
 maybe the standard is 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.710
 yes today 22 x 18 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.380
 then a twelve times eight hectare with 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.600
 Team tires and the star cast mining 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.670
 system attached to the cocking tire 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.090
 is in three points so the tom is 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.619
 handy and bored and a 16 times 16 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.909
 Of course, Tom was also involved 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:01.000
 Ripen the or the wood 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.800
 Since we have nine bobinger at the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.599
 bass drum 7 mm at the top 6 millimeters 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.550
 I'm just talking about that and not 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:11.200
 also from the tram because the first not 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.599
 this belongs to we have again only in 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.700
 shells at that means it's primarily about 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:20.050
 The three drumming here one man 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.480
 of course our video cases again 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.920
 that means evans g1 on the toms 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.319
 and ECO4 as impact running the region 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.230
 often as lag fell on the bass drum like that 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.420
 But that's also part of the work 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.190
 The teams are usually factory-made 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.569
 is 2 built so double lay 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.819
 actually falls from the brother already 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.550
 nine fatter sound than it already is 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.920
 hears there already neat and 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:53.319
 it comes out of the fell what 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.870
 normal factory is on it is yes 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.340
 quite good from the dark wood and 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.989
 of course settled because of the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.989
 microphone from a hole in it 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.959
 All hardware is rubber backed 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.610
 not wrong to know exactly how 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:16.130
 the first clowns everywhere you can see it 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:21.160
 beautiful from the boiler even that was 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:25.459
 classic sign in itself very nice set 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:29.110
 super top processed so synonymous if you 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.550
 the boiler looks straight perfect 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.260
 It's easy to be as bad as me 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:39.830
 I have noticed great part 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.450
 i would say enough i swatted 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.450
 would play a bit again 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.130
 I'm talking about star calcio 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.990
 I hope I could give you an impression 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.550
 procure as the set sounds to me 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.030
 I like it very much 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.140
 good 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:22.450
 sounds great I can even find the works 

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.310
 So fell the bilayer cases yet 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.280
 times a number horny but that's synonymous 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.750
 matter of course if you 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.400
 then buck it you can you like 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.980
 over in the store look that there at times 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.600
 play or just directly online 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.210
 order if you have any questions call 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.130
 e mail me 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:43.020
 that was so far from me and the starface 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.020
 Bobinger until the next job
