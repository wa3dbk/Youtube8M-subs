double-click<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.059> comp<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:13.070> as<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.250> can

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
double-click on the comp and as you can

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.050 
double-click on the comp and as you can
see<00:00:14.849> if<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.690> select<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.230> camera<00:00:16.619> yeah<00:00:17.070> okay

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
see if we select the camera yeah okay

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.370 
see if we select the camera yeah okay
the<00:00:18.300> animation<00:00:19.170> path<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.460> same<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.380> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the animation path is the same and the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.140 
the animation path is the same and the
animation<00:00:22.949> like<00:00:24.080> this<00:00:25.080> one<00:00:25.880> has<00:00:26.880> been

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
animation like this one has been

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.889 
animation like this one has been
exported<00:00:29.060> into<00:00:30.060> After<00:00:30.960> Effects<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:32.899> there's

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
exported into After Effects and there's

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.610 
exported into After Effects and there's
now<00:00:34.140> yeah<00:00:35.149> demonstrates<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.840> everything

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
now yeah demonstrates that everything

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.910 
now yeah demonstrates that everything
matches<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.579> let's<00:00:39.420> go<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> same<00:00:40.590> frame

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
matches so let's go to the same frame

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.770 
matches so let's go to the same frame
here<00:00:41.480> more<00:00:42.480> or<00:00:42.629> less<00:00:42.920> it<00:00:43.920> stays<00:00:44.579> put<00:00:45.030> here

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
here more or less it stays put here

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:56.229 
here more or less it stays put here
where<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.680> place<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.260> can<00:00:49.260> also<00:00:49.440> add

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.360 

because<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.780> four<00:00:58.260> meter<00:00:58.500> by<00:00:58.800> four<00:00:59.100> meter

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
because I have four meter by four meter

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.899 
because I have four meter by four meter
great<00:00:59.730> there<00:01:00.590> turn<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.770> into<00:01:01.949> 3d<00:01:02.399> are<00:01:04.220> -<00:01:05.220> 90<00:01:05.790> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
great there turn it into 3d are - 90 and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:15.649 
great there turn it into 3d are - 90 and
x<00:01:09.409> position<00:01:10.409> at<00:01:11.390> zero<00:01:12.390> zero<00:01:13.760> because<00:01:14.760> that's

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
x position at zero zero because that's

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.460 
x position at zero zero because that's
the<00:01:15.930> center<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.590> coordinate<00:01:17.250> system<00:01:17.850> II<00:01:17.970> like

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
the center of coordinate system II like

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:27.080 
the center of coordinate system II like
if<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.740> curate<00:01:20.369> grid<00:01:23.000> as<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.280> video<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:27.060> can

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
if I curate grid as in the video we can

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.170 
if I curate grid as in the video we can
see<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:29.130> grid<00:01:29.990> generated<00:01:30.990> by<00:01:31.200> After<00:01:31.590> Effects

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
see the grid generated by After Effects

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.679 
see the grid generated by After Effects
matches<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.930> grid<00:01:34.229> created<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.340> Lightwave<00:01:35.909> in

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
matches the grid created in Lightwave in

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:45.100 
matches the grid created in Lightwave in
every<00:01:37.110> frame<00:01:37.380> no<00:01:37.950> matter<00:01:38.250> how<00:01:39.590> crazy<00:01:43.070> anything

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
every frame no matter how crazy anything

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.980 
every frame no matter how crazy anything
animated<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.530> scene<00:01:47.210> now<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.240> turn<00:01:48.720> off

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
animated in the scene now I turn off

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.649 
animated in the scene now I turn off
visibility<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.310> rendered<00:01:50.700> sequence<00:01:51.360> so

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
visibility for the rendered sequence so

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.060 
visibility for the rendered sequence so
that<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:54.049> real-time<00:01:55.049> update<00:01:55.530> of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
that we can have real-time update of

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.170 
that we can have real-time update of
this<00:01:56.600> 3d<00:01:57.600> grid<00:01:58.100> inside<00:01:59.180> After<00:02:00.180> Effects<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.750> I

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
this 3d grid inside After Effects and I

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.719 
this 3d grid inside After Effects and I
have<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:04.189> make<00:02:05.189> sure<00:02:05.640> I'm<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> same<00:02:07.049> frame

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
have to make sure I'm in the same frame

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.990 
have to make sure I'm in the same frame
25

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
25

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.200 
25
that's<00:02:11.000> because<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.890> light<00:02:13.400> wave<00:02:13.610> animation

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
that's because the light wave animation

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.960 
that's because the light wave animation
is<00:02:14.390> exported<00:02:15.140> as<00:02:15.320> I<00:02:15.350> defined<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.520> in<00:02:16.700> there

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
is exported as I defined it in there

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.300 
is exported as I defined it in there
under<00:02:17.300> Global's<00:02:18.040> from<00:02:19.040> 1<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.640> 72<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:21.050> 0<00:02:22.040> is

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
under Global's from 1 to 72 so 0 is

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.220 
under Global's from 1 to 72 so 0 is
really<00:02:23.120> 1<00:02:23.380> okay<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.250> same<00:02:25.550> frame

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
really 1 okay this is the same frame

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.180 
really 1 okay this is the same frame
select<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.410> camera<00:02:27.850> decide<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.120> move<00:02:29.270> it<00:02:29.570> down

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
select the camera decide to move it down

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:40.110 
select the camera decide to move it down
and<00:02:31.930> sync<00:02:32.930> selected<00:02:36.970> very<00:02:37.970> same<00:02:38.270> camera

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
and sync selected very same camera

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.920 
and sync selected very same camera
rotate<00:02:44.920> almost<00:02:45.920> vertical<00:02:46.580> yeah<00:02:47.240> something

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
rotate almost vertical yeah something

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.370 
rotate almost vertical yeah something
like<00:02:47.960> this<00:02:48.320> sync<00:02:48.980> selected<00:02:49.780> almost<00:02:50.780> vertical

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
like this sync selected almost vertical

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.530 
like this sync selected almost vertical
and<00:02:52.480> again<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.840> again<00:02:54.170> I<00:02:54.560> can<00:02:54.800> keep<00:02:55.370> changing
