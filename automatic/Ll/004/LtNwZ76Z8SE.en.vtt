actually fall into the umbrella when we
call<00:00:17.500> friendship<00:00:17.800> and<00:00:18.640> so<00:00:18.880> it's<00:00:19.000> always<00:00:19.150> like

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.690 

you<00:00:31.580> oughta<00:00:32.059> see<00:00:32.180> six<00:00:32.570> sides<00:00:33.220> have<00:00:34.220> symbols<00:00:34.520> on

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
you oughta see six sides have symbols on

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.520 
you oughta see six sides have symbols on
each<00:00:34.730> side<00:00:35.059> and<00:00:35.300> we<00:00:35.390> teach<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:35.720> symbols<00:00:36.110> in

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
each side and we teach the symbols in

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.119 
each side and we teach the symbols in
our<00:00:36.650> group<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.370> six<00:00:37.610> symbols<00:00:37.910> on<00:00:38.270> each<00:00:38.300> cube

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
our group the six symbols on each cube

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.049 
our group the six symbols on each cube
remember<00:00:40.129> this<00:00:40.220> is<00:00:40.400> rotating<00:00:41.150> and<00:00:41.930> combine

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
remember this is rotating and combine

remember this is rotating and combine
this<00:00:44.059> is<00:00:44.210> what<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:45.650> alphabet<00:00:45.829> looks<00:00:46.309> like<00:00:46.580> a

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
this is what the alphabet looks like a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.240 
this is what the alphabet looks like a
through<00:00:47.239> Z<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:47.800> it's<00:00:48.800> organized

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
through Z and it's organized

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.299 
through Z and it's organized

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
friendship cute group of course the more

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:09.609 
friendship cute group of course the more
you<00:00:55.190> learn<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.089> more<00:00:56.269> you<00:01:07.630> are<00:01:08.630> response<00:01:09.380> code

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
you learn the more you are response code

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.300 
you learn the more you are response code
is<00:01:10.190> that<00:01:10.250> your<00:01:10.640> I<00:01:11.380> can<00:01:12.380> recognize<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:12.950> symbol

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
is that your I can recognize the symbol

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.279 
is that your I can recognize the symbol
so<00:01:14.030> it's<00:01:14.180> not<00:01:14.270> just<00:01:14.330> your<00:01:14.600> computer<00:01:14.750> now<00:01:15.229> you

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
so it's not just your computer now you

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.160 
so it's not just your computer now you
understand<00:01:15.950> it's<00:01:16.039> just<00:01:16.550> looking<00:01:16.789> like<00:01:17.170> it's

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
understand it's just looking like it's

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.230 
understand it's just looking like it's
just<00:01:18.320> like<00:01:18.500> looking<00:01:18.770> at<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.670> Japanese

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
just like looking at a Japanese

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.719 
just like looking at a Japanese
character<00:01:20.690> or<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.200> Chinese<00:01:21.410> character<00:01:21.740> you

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
character or a Chinese character you

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.700 
character or a Chinese character you
know<00:01:22.880> what<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:23.119> has<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.479> meaning<00:01:23.750> here's<00:01:24.649> a

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
know what it has a meaning here's a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.859 
know what it has a meaning here's a
really<00:01:24.920> detailed<00:01:25.160> example<00:01:25.850> of<00:01:26.030> visual<00:01:26.390> binary

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
really detailed example of visual binary

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.570 
really detailed example of visual binary
color<00:01:27.880> that<00:01:28.880> explains<00:01:29.320> in<00:01:30.320> a<00:01:30.590> 2-bit<00:01:31.190> code<00:01:31.340> it's

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
color that explains in a 2-bit code it's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.139 
color that explains in a 2-bit code it's
I<00:01:31.729> think<00:01:31.789> I<00:01:32.300> have<00:01:32.960> one<00:01:33.140> because<00:01:33.289> I<00:01:33.470> are<00:01:34.149> and

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
I think I have one because I are and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.419 
I think I have one because I are and
that<00:01:35.330> makes<00:01:35.509> two<00:01:35.599> in<00:01:36.319> a<00:01:36.380> 2-bit<00:01:36.770> code<00:01:36.920> it's<00:01:37.190> a

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
that makes two in a 2-bit code it's a

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.789 
that makes two in a 2-bit code it's a
zero<00:01:37.759> zero<00:01:37.789> zero<00:01:38.090> one<00:01:38.720> zero

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
zero zero zero one zero

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.819 
zero zero zero one zero
and<00:01:40.549> so<00:01:40.700> there's<00:01:40.850> four<00:01:41.060> possibilities<00:01:41.829> and

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
and so there's four possibilities and

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.039 
and so there's four possibilities and
each<00:01:43.100> each<00:01:43.969> additional<00:01:44.570> layer<00:01:45.020> of

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
each each additional layer of

00:01:45.049 --> 00:02:00.039 
each each additional layer of
possibilities<00:01:48.280> potential<00:01:49.280> issues<00:01:59.049> but

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
possibilities potential issues but

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.990 
possibilities potential issues but
there's<00:02:00.229> also<00:02:00.380> new<00:02:00.770> technologies<00:02:00.950> called<00:02:01.789> the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
there's also new technologies called the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.959 
there's also new technologies called the
emotive<00:02:02.360> Dethklok<00:02:02.689> it's<00:02:03.500> a<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:04.069> EEG<00:02:04.640> gyro

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
emotive Dethklok it's a a EEG gyro

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.050 
emotive Dethklok it's a a EEG gyro
signal<00:02:05.479> acquisition<00:02:05.630> device<00:02:06.409> so<00:02:07.399> we<00:02:07.640> shed<00:02:07.909> the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
signal acquisition device so we shed the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.680 
signal acquisition device so we shed the
need<00:02:08.209> for<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:09.729> keyboard<00:02:10.759> we<00:02:11.180> should<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.540> need

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
need for the keyboard we should the need

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.569 
need for the keyboard we should the need
for<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:12.940> mouse<00:02:13.940> epic<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.140> our<00:02:15.560> mind<00:02:15.920> becomes

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
for the mouse epic and our mind becomes

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:27.300 
for the mouse epic and our mind becomes
the<00:02:16.730> new<00:02:16.970> graphic<00:02:17.930> user<00:02:18.230> interface<00:02:26.230> also

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
the new graphic user interface also

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.550 
the new graphic user interface also
prototype<00:02:28.310> keyboard<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:29.690> has<00:02:29.720> concentric

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
prototype keyboard that has concentric

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.380 
prototype keyboard that has concentric
rings<00:02:30.910> organized<00:02:32.110> with<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.230> 22<00:02:33.590> symbols<00:02:34.390> and

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
rings organized with the 22 symbols and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.420 
rings organized with the 22 symbols and
we<00:02:35.450> call<00:02:35.599> that<00:02:35.630> kind<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.959> texting<00:02:36.349> out<00:02:36.500> but<00:02:37.340> the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
we call that kind of texting out but the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.069 
we call that kind of texting out but the
idea<00:02:37.489> is<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:38.000> put<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.209> quick<00:02:38.480> texting<00:02:38.959> app

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
idea is that you put a quick texting app

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:49.470 
idea is that you put a quick texting app
on<00:02:39.290> your<00:02:39.440> smart<00:02:39.769> smart<00:02:40.760> watch

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.260 

I<00:02:49.709> think<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.830> should<00:02:51.010> give<00:02:51.129> advantages<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.150> the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
I think I should give advantages to the

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.460 
I think I should give advantages to the
geeks<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.810> think<00:02:53.500> that's<00:02:53.709> lucky

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
geeks that think that's lucky

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.960 
geeks that think that's lucky
yeah<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:56.800> like<00:02:58.349> friendship<00:02:59.349> cute<00:02:59.830> group<00:03:00.310> can
