gotta get the reps and get a feel for
things<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.480> then<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.780> earn<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.140> right<00:00:37.290> for

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
things and then you earn the right for

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.850 
things and then you earn the right for
more<00:00:37.920> reps<00:00:38.129> or<00:00:39.260> some<00:00:40.260> guys<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.620> are<00:00:40.710> earned

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
the rights to get fewer reps and I think

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.470 
the rights to get fewer reps and I think
he's<00:00:44.040> earned<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> right<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> get<00:00:45.059> some<00:00:45.300> reps

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.590 
he's earned the right to get some reps

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
absolutely John's been in this offense

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.200 
absolutely John's been in this offense
for<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.810> long<00:01:36.960> time<00:01:37.310> he's<00:01:38.310> been<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.060> other

for a long time he's been on the other

side of it so I think that's a lot of
help<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.180> quarterback<00:01:42.720> Cesare<00:01:43.140> learning

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740

a new system and I think he's good at
what<00:01:46.770> he<00:01:46.890> does<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> think<00:01:48.300> with<00:01:48.659> the

guys<00:02:03.000> want<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.570> learn

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.440 

take<00:02:11.239> all<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.450> them<00:02:11.599> are<00:02:11.660> pretty<00:02:11.810> important

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
take all of them are pretty important

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.119 
take all of them are pretty important
but<00:02:14.450> certainly<00:02:15.410> trust<00:02:15.650> him<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.069> do<00:02:16.220> it<00:02:16.370> and

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
but certainly trust him to do it and

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.540 
but certainly trust him to do it and
they're<00:02:19.129> all<00:02:19.220> important<00:02:20.230> problem<00:02:21.370> passed<00:02:22.370> it

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
they're all important problem passed it

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.570 
they're all important problem passed it
on<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.849> you<00:02:22.940> here<00:02:23.510> dancers<00:02:24.099> yeah<00:02:25.099> I've<00:02:25.340> liked

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
on to you here dancers yeah I've liked

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.690 
on to you here dancers yeah I've liked
the<00:02:25.700> way<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:25.910> Rob's<00:02:27.220> kind<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.310> tacked<00:02:28.519> each

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
the way that Rob's kind of tacked each

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.900 
the way that Rob's kind of tacked each
practice<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:30.400> as<00:02:31.400> he<00:02:31.640> gets<00:02:31.849> comfortable<00:02:32.120> and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
practice and as he gets comfortable and

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.699 
practice and as he gets comfortable and
when<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.000> can<00:02:35.150> see<00:02:35.330> him<00:02:35.420> just<00:02:35.630> play<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.230> think

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
when you can see him just play I think

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.670 
when you can see him just play I think
he's<00:02:36.860> got<00:02:37.040> some<00:02:38.230> some<00:02:39.230> real<00:02:39.319> ability<00:02:39.650> like

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
he's got some some real ability like

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.640 
he's got some some real ability like
he's<00:02:42.680> like<00:02:43.670> his<00:02:43.849> size<00:02:44.090> like<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.200> way<00:02:45.319> runs

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
he's like his size like the way runs

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.710 
he's like his size like the way runs
think<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.340> he's<00:02:46.459> got<00:02:46.670> some<00:02:47.000> natural

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
think that he's got some natural

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.339 
think that he's got some natural
football<00:02:48.440> awareness<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:51.110> think<00:02:51.230> it's

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
football awareness and I think it's

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.370 
football awareness and I think it's
important<00:02:51.769> to<00:02:51.799> him<00:02:52.870> passionately<00:02:53.870> had<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.200> sit

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
important to him passionately had to sit

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.870 
important to him passionately had to sit
out<00:02:54.470> from<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.799> last<00:02:54.950> couple<00:02:55.130> practices<00:02:55.670> like

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
trend in to where we can get a little

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.969 
trend in to where we can get a little
bit<00:04:55.760> more<00:04:55.910> when<00:04:56.090> we<00:04:56.120> come<00:04:56.240> back<00:04:56.570> sir<00:04:56.919> do<00:04:57.919> you

guys that need to play some football and
you<00:05:21.090> just<00:05:21.240> learn<00:05:21.480> from<00:05:21.780> those<00:05:21.960> we<00:05:22.500> had<00:05:22.620> a<00:05:22.650> just

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
you just learn from those we had a just

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.490 
you just learn from those we had a just
tonight<00:05:23.880> you<00:05:24.510> know<00:05:24.600> Hayden<00:05:24.780> got<00:05:25.020> beat<00:05:25.230> on<00:05:25.260> an

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
tonight you know Hayden got beat on an

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.070 
tonight you know Hayden got beat on an
inside<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:26.160> if<00:05:26.250> he<00:05:26.340> can<00:05:26.460> learn<00:05:26.580> from<00:05:26.730> that

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
inside and if he can learn from that

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.600 
inside and if he can learn from that
that's<00:05:28.080> a<00:05:28.170> good<00:05:28.320> rep<00:05:28.560> even<00:05:29.280> though<00:05:29.340> it<00:05:29.430> didn't

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
that's a good rep even though it didn't

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.210 
that's a good rep even though it didn't
look<00:05:29.730> good<00:05:29.790> and<00:05:30.480> so<00:05:30.930> I've<00:05:31.740> liked<00:05:32.070> their

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
look good and so I've liked their

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.390 
look good and so I've liked their
approach<00:05:32.550> and<00:05:33.650> we<00:05:34.650> just<00:05:34.800> got<00:05:34.980> to<00:05:35.070> keep<00:05:35.190> playing

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
approach and we just got to keep playing

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.060 
approach and we just got to keep playing
and<00:05:35.760> they<00:05:35.880> gotta<00:05:36.680> hone<00:05:37.680> in<00:05:37.830> on<00:05:37.920> the

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
and they gotta hone in on the

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.160 
and they gotta hone in on the
fundamentals<00:05:38.700> and<00:05:39.000> apply<00:05:39.360> those<00:05:39.600> in<00:05:39.840> the<00:05:39.960> team

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
fundamentals and apply those in the team

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.350 
fundamentals and apply those in the team
settings<00:05:40.710> it's<00:05:40.950> that's<00:05:41.340> kind<00:05:41.760> of<00:05:41.790> the<00:05:41.880> process

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
settings it's that's kind of the process

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.850 
settings it's that's kind of the process
so<00:05:42.600> it's<00:05:43.560> cold<00:05:43.800> spring<00:05:44.100> ball

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.260 

yeah<00:05:49.860> I've<00:05:50.160> liked<00:05:50.730> the<00:05:50.850> way<00:05:50.970> that<00:05:51.180> Taiwan<00:05:51.990> is

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
yeah I've liked the way that Taiwan is

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.180 
yeah I've liked the way that Taiwan is
he<00:05:54.270> certainly<00:05:54.570> shown<00:05:54.870> some<00:05:55.140> things<00:05:55.410> talented

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
he certainly shown some things talented

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.740 
he certainly shown some things talented
and<00:05:57.140> he<00:05:58.140> trusts<00:05:58.560> himself<00:05:58.710> I<00:05:59.390> think<00:06:00.390> he's<00:06:00.540> even

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
and he trusts himself I think he's even

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.240 
and he trusts himself I think he's even
better<00:06:01.020> and<00:06:01.320> that's<00:06:02.750> so<00:06:03.750> much<00:06:03.930> natural<00:06:04.250> just

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
better and that's so much natural just

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.940 
better and that's so much natural just
hearing<00:06:05.630> plays<00:06:06.630> calls<00:06:07.140> for<00:06:07.440> the<00:06:07.470> first<00:06:07.710> time

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
hearing plays calls for the first time

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.450 
hearing plays calls for the first time
understanding<00:06:09.980> can<00:06:10.980> the<00:06:11.100> rhyme<00:06:11.280> or<00:06:11.430> reason

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
understanding can the rhyme or reason

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.880 
understanding can the rhyme or reason
behind<00:06:11.850> some<00:06:12.240> of<00:06:12.360> the<00:06:12.480> big<00:06:13.020> blocking<00:06:13.560> schemes

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
behind some of the big blocking schemes

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.760 
behind some of the big blocking schemes
or<00:06:14.190> protections<00:06:15.060> but<00:06:15.300> I<00:06:15.600> think<00:06:16.380> he's<00:06:16.530> done

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
or protections but I think he's done

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.040 
or protections but I think he's done
some<00:06:16.980> good<00:06:17.100> things<00:06:17.160> and<00:06:17.670> certainly<00:06:18.600> has<00:06:18.840> to

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
some good things and certainly has to

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.830 
some good things and certainly has to
learn<00:06:19.320> from<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:19.680> ones<00:06:19.860> he<00:06:20.010> has<00:06:20.160> it<00:06:20.510> but<00:06:21.510> I

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
learn from the ones he has it but I

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.030 
learn from the ones he has it but I
think<00:06:21.870> you're<00:06:22.170> right<00:06:22.320> in<00:06:22.500> the<00:06:22.590> way<00:06:22.740> that<00:06:22.860> he's

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
think you're right in the way that he's

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.150 
think you're right in the way that he's
he's<00:06:23.880> shown<00:06:24.120> some<00:06:24.360> wrongs<00:06:24.570> where<00:06:24.840> he's<00:06:25.160> he's

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
he's shown some wrongs where he's he's

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.060 
he's shown some wrongs where he's he's
running<00:06:26.460> with<00:06:26.520> the<00:06:26.610> purpose
