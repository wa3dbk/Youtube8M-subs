little bit expensive here comes the

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.200 
little bit expensive here comes the
turbine<00:00:59.879> we<00:01:00.000> talked<00:01:00.269> about<00:01:01.970> normally<00:01:02.970> one<00:01:03.120> of

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
turbine we talked about normally one of

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.640 
turbine we talked about normally one of
the<00:01:03.269> strongest<00:01:03.690> pullers<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> country

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the strongest pullers in the country

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.920 
the strongest pullers in the country
this<00:01:05.070> time<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.610> turbine<00:01:06.030> lets<00:01:06.240> loose<00:01:06.479> and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
this time the turbine lets loose and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.080 
this time the turbine lets loose and
this<00:01:07.260> was<00:01:07.590> very<00:01:07.860> scary

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090
