00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:18.630
 growing up in water for 36 years is a project 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.060
 educational for children from 3 to 6 years of age 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.340
 age aimed at reaching in times 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.320
 short a complete aquatic autonomy 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.960
 even in deep water where the child 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.599
 it's not up to refining motor schemes 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.940
 motto specifics such as floats 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.769
 premium supine back and style a 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.110
 improve all the motor schemes of 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.269
 base and above all reinforce the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.399
 strength and coordination skills 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.320
 resistance with the maximum of 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.270
 fun 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.980
 to achieve these results e 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.350
 fundamental that the activities come 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.870
 mostly carried out in deep water e 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.600
 with the minimum supporting materials in 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.850
 so that in order to move, play the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.129
 child must continually use 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.469
 of aquatic and non-terrestrial schemes 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.539
 vice versa if the child is put on 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.450
 Low water spends most 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.280
 of time walking 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.170
 another important aspect of the method 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.869
 trash in the water is the presence of 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.580
 parents in the water up to 4 and sometimes i 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.860
 five years of age 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.259
 in this way every child followed by 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.170
 near by a reference adult can 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.550
 keep his attention high 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.530
 move with the wines a support for 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.179
 throughout the lesson and with the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.740
 maximum security 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.390
 experience remote 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.939
 injectives that require support 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.610
 individual types floats state 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.520
 five passive transports without unnecessary 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.380
 pauses or wasted time are avoided 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.539
 moreover that stress and anxiety of 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.909
 separation that most of the 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.100
 children live three years with the entrance 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.229
 in the kindergarten of the gump 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.509
 with a further separation 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.009
 that water does not involve any benefit 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.170
 indeed it blocks learning the method 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.939
 grow up in the water respect the continuous 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.640
 need to play to learn things 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.649
 new ones of the child and at the same time ago 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.990
 be careful not to trigger rigid patterns 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.119
 that once automated so 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.670
 inaccurate due to the nervous system 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.190
 not yet well refined they leave then 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.019
 little room for improvement and risk 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.420
 to compromise the possibility in 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.480
 future of having success in any 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.430
 competitive activities in each lesson yes 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.959
 propose new games and activities 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.420
 very funny and perfectly 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.220
 adapted to their age group 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.950
 involve the child on all levels 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.410
 of personality and emotional drives 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.600
 there is also always cognitive 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.209
 an alternation of challenging games of 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.660
 concentration limitation with games 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.150
 all creative free experimenters 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.200
 the proposed activities come 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.600
 customized in relation to the levels and 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.040
 the characteristics of each child in 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.630
 so that each of them can 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.150
 experience activities with difficulty 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.220
 always growing that allows him to 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.019
 evolve to make progress in each 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.069
 lesson 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.739
 the child is always the protagonist 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.600
 main always has the possibility of 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.850
 choose to experience what in 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.799
 that moment feels like doing it comes 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.739
 constantly gratified for his 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.650
 progress and accepted and comforted for 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.840
 its uncertainties fears 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.799
 in this climate of trust of pleasure of 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.530
 Welfare 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.420
 the results are always evident also i 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.920
 more fearful starting from scratch 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.709
 within a maximum of one year 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.510
 attending only once a week 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.209
 learn to swim alone in the water 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.519
 deep subsequently acquire i 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.739
 static floats begin to do 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.500
 slipping and go before 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.019
 body of the parent and then from the board a 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.040
 this point generally towards the 45 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.630
 years of age 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.430
 after familiarizing yourself with 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.940
 the teacher with his fellow students 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.250
 group 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.989
 the activities continue without having 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.329
 need the presence of the parent in 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.919
 water ready to refine movements 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.900
 of arms and legs e 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.090
 the latera aspiration 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.609
 all through very varied exercises 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.220
 with increasing difficulties especially 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.680
 in playful form before the entrance to the 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.299
 shoulders while most of them are 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.699
 already able to do the back and the stylus 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.000
 complete as well as flipped forward 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:14.610
 back jumps 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.610
 budgets and slips of all kinds
