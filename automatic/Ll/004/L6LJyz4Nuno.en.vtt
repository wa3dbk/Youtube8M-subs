00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.870
 how about lady how are we doing well 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:11.300
 of 16 because cause causes me to see 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.190
 that fixes bikes and puts them to meditate 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.990
 see today is a hitazo of the video why 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.910
 I'm going to do two things at the same time 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.560
 the first one I will introduce the bike 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.420
 because I have it for weeks now but 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.430
 you know him the second one we're going to 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.650
 put to measure first of all is a 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.110
 mountain bike but look at you look 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.240
 comes with road wheels 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.740
 this is a trick that takes a lot of 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:37.989
 is 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:41.770
 in eastern germany does not show up 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.290
 so far because here are the pedals 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.000
 and automatic and such until today both 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.980
 weeks that I have them and that has 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.989
 I've been training with seeing and doing these 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.930
 exits and look here are the pedals 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.670
 who had so far and with them going 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.010
 very well the barack took them 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.480
 walls then today I premiere this I've 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.250
 gone to buy it and now the first thing that 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.250
 let's do is about the coves in the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.980
 Market Stall 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.980
 with 10 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.480
 what it does now is that it is 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.480
 searching 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.670
 as far as sneakers are you are just 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.080
 a brand that is called mab and he told me 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.119
 that is fine so I guess it will be 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.619
 well and as you see suffered the patita is 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.240
 almost going to run the subject is here 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.850
 when he has gone to the store I told them 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.830
 ones that are good but above all that 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.210
 because he told me but for all 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.729
 hours that you're going to be there how are they going to be 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.680
 55 hours that are not too rigid that they do not 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.180
 they are very hard and that fuck you do not 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.770
 count your feet because if you do not 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.479
 passing tips so seeing what 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.950
 they had there seems like this is what it is 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.080
 the best that there was something we are choosing 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.780
 the mark of your skin and we put the face 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.360
 so that you stay right on the site of 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.520
 in the middle of the metatarsalgia the long 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.470
 from tattersall each front to the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.390
 standing there where we place the face then 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.100
 this is very important because it is what 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.790
 allows the transmission of force 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.920
 part age 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.280
 means that when we have the scales 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.730
 in the place 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.959
 now only the bike and the cyclist are missing and 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.959
 is already 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.330
 do not 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
 what 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.700
 they really nominated me to stores all in 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.700
 the knees 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.860
 but a little 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.860
 around here promoting saying divine 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.860
 the truth is that depositions of all 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.590
 mix 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.590
 skated 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.900
 d 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.129
 or 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.830
 what we have measured now are all 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.530
 we collect the data series that what 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.270
 allows is to evaluate dynamically 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.880
 how your joints work 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.860
 so here what we have is in sight 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.890
 of the strategic points that we have 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.480
 placed the sensors we see the data 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.750
 that collects this system while you 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.550
 you pedal and highlight that this is a 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.770
 adjustment that is balanced that you 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.960
 allows the control you need in 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.550
 some angulation is the flexion of the 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.410
 knee extension at minimum angle 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.290
 of the heel the maximum angle of the heel in 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.030
 movement and especially forward and 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.660
 backward the next the recoil 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.490
 This is a setting that should 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.120
 provide you comfort and control 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.120
 practical 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.359
 this is valentine controlling the gesture 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.370
 and all the work for example perceptive 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.370
 that we have been exercising before 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.650
 the lens the pedalboard as it pedals more 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.650
 before 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.120
 perfect and twins in the movement that 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.120
 he has his head 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.669
 affect the same intensity control your 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.669
 the gesture 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.850
 very different the measurements of the bike 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.320
 within a biomechanical analysis are 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.780
 a fundamental part a part 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.060
 important but so is the control 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.710
 of the gesture and also how he pedaled 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:05.930
 valentine mis-aligns the knee 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.910
 right especially and with the new 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.860
 restructuring of the pattern 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.090
 we have managed to align it so that 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.070
 the mission of force is much more 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.070
 linear the idea is to have a pedaling 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.720
 inertial that what he proposes is that the 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.150
 two legs work like two pistons 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.400
 because the muscles involved are 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.710
 with the tuna propelled that we have for 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.710
 walk is to say the hip extension 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.990
 and knee extension that is this 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.570
 musculature is what works when the 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.160
 pedal low so the conclusion of 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.970
 today is that if I have to stay with 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.970
 one thing is that 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.139
 well and it happens that people will say yes 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.210
 make it madrid-lisbon do not go for 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.479
 Madrid for Lisbon does not mean 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.580
 that from top to bottom we achieve what 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.620
 you see it's easy and people saying to 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.780
 how complicated is this to put the 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.160
 bike to such a site watches the from the 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.990
 first that tells me by bike to site 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.380
 and here it has it backwards but good in 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:03.830
 saint louis these things happen with 16 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.900
 this mix but the conclusion of everything 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.030
 is 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.500
 better than we always invest valentine 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.500
 pedalea del derecho 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.150
 This is like for me to teach 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.610
 it's like how this one here you see this 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.320
 is luis enrique who makes it easy 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.240
 because the cause inclines me towards the bike 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.100
 easy then I come here to put the 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.620
 bike like this instead of the 16 that 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.540
 also be true not only does the 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.889
 bike to site but they put me 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.110
 as well 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:36.460
 then I find myself climbing to 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:39.840
 think now I have a couple of announcements me 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.840
 they said he was doing series 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.730
 the 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.730
 thank you very much for everything
