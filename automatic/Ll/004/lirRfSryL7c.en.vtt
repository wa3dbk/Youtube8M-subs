00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
what's up guys in this tutorial I'll be

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.160 
what's up guys in this tutorial I'll be
showing<00:00:02.730> you<00:00:03.000> how<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.210> make<00:00:03.389> industrial<00:00:03.659> pipes

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
showing you how to make industrial pipes

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.629 
showing you how to make industrial pipes
such<00:00:04.470> as<00:00:04.650> this<00:00:05.000> so<00:00:06.000> let's<00:00:06.210> get<00:00:06.330> started<00:00:07.639> so

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
such as this so let's get started so

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.060 
such as this so let's get started so
first<00:00:08.849> off<00:00:09.120> you're<00:00:09.300> going<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.480> go<00:00:09.599> into<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
first off you're going to go into the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.240 
first off you're going to go into the
shape<00:00:11.070> stab<00:00:11.400> take<00:00:12.000> out<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.179> cylinder<00:00:13.009> I'm<00:00:14.009> going

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
shape stab take out a cylinder I'm going

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.980 
shape stab take out a cylinder I'm going
to<00:00:14.309> wrote<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.929> rotate<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.080> 90<00:00:16.590> degrees<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.990> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
to wrote it rotate it 90 degrees and the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.550 
to wrote it rotate it 90 degrees and the
for<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.119> based<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.660> sides<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.050> your<00:00:22.140> logo

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
for this based on the sides of your logo

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.990 
for this based on the sides of your logo
or<00:00:22.590> text<00:00:23.039> or<00:00:23.100> whatever<00:00:23.369> you're<00:00:23.519> using<00:00:23.550> you're

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
or text or whatever you're using you're

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.189 
or text or whatever you're using you're
going<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.180> want<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.330> change<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> radius<00:00:24.869> but

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
going to want to change the radius but

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.540 
going to want to change the radius but
since<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.619> don't<00:00:25.650> have<00:00:25.830> one<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.070> those<00:00:26.220> I'm<00:00:26.400> just

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
since I don't have one of those I'm just

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.179 
since I don't have one of those I'm just
keep<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.180> 50<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:28.500> I'm<00:00:28.560> going<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.740> increase<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
keep it 50 so I'm going to increase the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.670 
keep it 50 so I'm going to increase the
height<00:00:29.960> make<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.109> long<00:00:31.260> pipe<00:00:33.530> alright<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
height make it a long pipe alright and

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.270 
height make it a long pipe alright and
so<00:00:34.710> now<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.190> take<00:00:36.059> out<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> tube<00:00:37.070> I'm<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.190> to

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
so now I take out a tube I'm going to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:47.240 
so now I take out a tube I'm going to
rotate<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.820> as<00:00:39.000> well<00:00:45.559> alright<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.800> i<00:00:46.829> turned

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
rotate that as well alright so i turned

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.080 
rotate that as well alright so i turned
down<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.550> outer<00:00:47.730> radius<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.200> huge

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
down the outer radius so it's not huge

00:00:50.090 --> 00:01:00.370 
down the outer radius so it's not huge
turn<00:00:51.090> down<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.480> height

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.720 

and<00:01:00.500> for<00:01:01.490> this<00:01:01.580> it's<00:01:02.540> all<00:01:02.750> based<00:01:03.020> on<00:01:03.230> your

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
and for this it's all based on your

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.580 
and for this it's all based on your
preference<00:01:04.730> because<00:01:05.080> you<00:01:06.080> could<00:01:06.200> have<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:06.500> as

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
preference because you could have it as

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.230 
preference because you could have it as
big<00:01:06.830> or<00:01:07.040> as<00:01:07.100> small<00:01:07.220> as<00:01:07.550> you<00:01:07.670> want<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:08.090> doesn't

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
big or as small as you want it doesn't

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.080 
big or as small as you want it doesn't
have<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.510> be<00:01:08.540> this<00:01:08.900> perfect<00:01:09.230> size<00:01:12.850> all<00:01:13.850> right

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
have to be this perfect size all right

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.130 
have to be this perfect size all right
so<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.300> get<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.600> arc<00:01:14.690> you're<00:01:14.840> going<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.050> go

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
so to get the arc you're going to go

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.980 
so to get the arc you're going to go
into<00:01:15.260> the<00:01:15.940> spline<00:01:16.940> menu<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.360> then<00:01:17.480> take<00:01:17.870> out

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
into the spline menu and then take out

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.120 
into the spline menu and then take out
an<00:01:18.110> arc<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:20.350> then<00:01:21.350> you're<00:01:21.500> going<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.650> go<00:01:21.710> back

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
an arc and then you're going to go back

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.210 
an arc and then you're going to go back
to<00:01:22.160> the<00:01:22.370> spline<00:01:22.580> menu<00:01:22.880> take<00:01:23.090> out<00:01:23.210> a<00:01:23.240> circle<00:01:24.220> go

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
to the spline menu take out a circle go

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.600 
to the spline menu take out a circle go
to<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.460> NURBS<00:01:25.730> menu<00:01:26.240> take<00:01:26.930> out<00:01:27.050> sweep<00:01:27.290> NURBS

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
to the NURBS menu take out sweep NURBS

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.700 
to the NURBS menu take out sweep NURBS
put<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.700> arc<00:01:28.880> in<00:01:29.090> first<00:01:29.390> then<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.140> circle<00:01:30.560> and

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
put the arc in first then the circle and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.600 
put the arc in first then the circle and
second<00:01:31.160> and<00:01:32.770> since<00:01:33.770> Maya<00:01:34.030> cylinder<00:01:35.030> it's<00:01:35.510> a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
second and since Maya cylinder it's a

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.980 
second and since Maya cylinder it's a
radius<00:01:37.610> is<00:01:37.820> fifty<00:01:38.210> i'm<00:01:38.390> going<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.600> put<00:01:38.810> the

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
radius is fifty i'm going to put the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.050 
radius is fifty i'm going to put the
circles<00:01:39.470> radius<00:01:39.710> 250<00:01:40.369> as<00:01:40.460> well<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:40.940> can

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
circles radius 250 as well so it can

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.859 
circles radius 250 as well so it can
match<00:01:41.240> up<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:43.520> then<00:01:44.030> i'm<00:01:44.150> going<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.330> rotate<00:01:44.540> it

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
match up and then i'm going to rotate it

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.730 
match up and then i'm going to rotate it
just<00:01:45.770> as<00:01:45.950> I<00:01:46.100> did<00:01:46.360> most<00:01:47.360> other<00:01:47.660> things<00:01:47.780> just<00:01:48.619> so

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
just as I did most other things just so

00:01:48.740 --> 00:02:00.980 
just as I did most other things just so
it'll<00:01:48.860> match<00:01:49.009> up<00:01:49.250> with<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:50.320> other<00:01:51.320> pipe

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.649 

it's<00:02:01.560> going<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.770> drag<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.189> up<00:02:02.430> now<00:02:05.299> all<00:02:06.299> this

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
it's going to drag this up now all this

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.859 
it's going to drag this up now all this
is<00:02:06.840> fairly<00:02:07.079> simple<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.680> mean<00:02:08.509> I'm<00:02:09.509> pretty<00:02:09.569> sure

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
is fairly simple I mean I'm pretty sure

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.270 
is fairly simple I mean I'm pretty sure
most<00:02:09.989> people<00:02:10.349> can<00:02:10.470> do<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.739> without<00:02:10.920> this

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
most people can do this without this

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.630 
most people can do this without this
tutorial<00:02:11.790> but<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.900> guys<00:02:13.050> wanted<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:13.890> give

it to you alright now we're going to

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.940 
it to you alright now we're going to
copy<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.239> paste<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.690> tube<00:02:22.110> once<00:02:22.769> that's

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
copy and paste the tube once that's

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.150 
copy and paste the tube once that's
there<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.959> copy<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.130> paste<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.519> tube<00:02:28.130> so<00:02:29.130> that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
there so copy and paste the tube so that

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.009 
there so copy and paste the tube so that
you<00:02:29.370> can<00:02:29.489> put<00:02:29.610> on<00:02:29.640> top<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.180> arced<00:02:30.510> 1<00:02:30.720> i'm

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
you can put on top of this arced 1 i'm

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:38.949 
you can put on top of this arced 1 i'm
going<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.230> rotate<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.739> match<00:02:32.130> up<00:02:32.340> with<00:02:32.459> arc

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.199 

looks<00:02:39.959> good<00:02:43.400> obviously<00:02:44.400> if<00:02:44.519> I<00:02:44.760> was<00:02:45.030> actually

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
looks good obviously if I was actually

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.030 
looks good obviously if I was actually
doing<00:02:45.660> like<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.930> speed<00:02:46.230> art<00:02:46.410> with<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:46.890> or

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
doing like a speed art with this or

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.240 
doing like a speed art with this or
something<00:02:47.220> I'd<00:02:47.489> make<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.269> perfect<00:02:48.780> but<00:02:49.250> since

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
something I'd make it perfect but since

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.390 
something I'd make it perfect but since
it's<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.489> tort<00:02:50.760> tutorial<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.780> could<00:02:52.250> i'm<00:02:53.250> just

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
it's a tort tutorial I could i'm just

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.240 
it's a tort tutorial I could i'm just
going<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.580> speed<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.090> up<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.480> everything<00:02:55.250> art

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
going to speed it up and everything art

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.690 
going to speed it up and everything art
so<00:02:57.080> now<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.110> we<00:02:58.350> have<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.950> pipes<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.580> is

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
so now that we have the pipes this is

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.640 
so now that we have the pipes this is
based<00:02:59.880> that's<00:03:00.180> basically<00:03:00.540> all<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.840> need<00:03:01.019> but

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
based that's basically all you need but

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.030 
based that's basically all you need but
i<00:03:02.160> usually<00:03:02.519> add<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.760> wheel<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.620> do<00:03:05.010> that

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
i usually add a wheel in so to do that

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:15.830 
i usually add a wheel in so to do that
take<00:03:05.640> out<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.820> torus<00:03:07.609> rotate<00:03:08.609> this

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.839 

all<00:03:16.349> right<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.739> since<00:03:17.040> it's<00:03:17.220> huge<00:03:17.489> I'm<00:03:17.700> going

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
all right and since it's huge I'm going

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.170 
all right and since it's huge I'm going
to<00:03:17.910> turn<00:03:18.180> down<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.569> radius<00:03:19.099> and<00:03:20.099> the<00:03:20.180> pipe

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
to turn down the radius and the pipe

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.619 
to turn down the radius and the pipe
radius<00:03:25.040> drag<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.069> up<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:27.330> of<00:03:27.420> course<00:03:27.480> you

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
radius drag that up and of course you

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.540 
radius drag that up and of course you
don't<00:03:27.750> have<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.019> add<00:03:28.110> this<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.470> just<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.920> think

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
don't have to add this is just I think

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.880 
don't have to add this is just I think
it's<00:03:29.879> a<00:03:29.970> nice<00:03:30.120> addition<00:03:30.709> matches<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.860> theme

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
it's a nice addition matches the theme

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.729 
it's a nice addition matches the theme
and<00:03:32.250> everything<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.780> make<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.110> pipe<00:03:37.349> radius

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
and everything and make the pipe radius

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.059 
and everything and make the pipe radius
about<00:03:37.950> 10<00:03:38.420> it's<00:03:39.420> not<00:03:39.569> too<00:03:39.750> small<00:03:39.900> all<00:03:40.620> right<00:03:40.860> so

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
about 10 it's not too small all right so

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.759 
about 10 it's not too small all right so
go<00:03:41.400> back<00:03:41.549> in<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.819> shapes<00:03:42.150> tab<00:03:42.620> take<00:03:43.620> out<00:03:43.739> a

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
go back in the shapes tab take out a

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.030 
go back in the shapes tab take out a
capsule<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:45.560> you're<00:03:46.560> going<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.709> answer<00:03:46.890> it

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
capsule and you're going to answer it

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.229 
capsule and you're going to answer it
down<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.340> radius<00:03:49.400> turn<00:03:50.400> on<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.730> height<00:03:50.940> so

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
down the radius turn on the height so

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.900 
down the radius turn on the height so
that<00:03:51.269> doesn't<00:03:51.630> go<00:03:51.690> over<00:03:53.090> drag<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.120> up<00:03:55.910> too

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
that doesn't go over drag that up too

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.960 
that doesn't go over drag that up too
tall<00:03:57.230> there<00:03:58.230> you<00:03:58.380> go<00:03:58.440> now<00:03:58.799> just<00:03:59.069> click<00:03:59.610> on<00:03:59.760> it

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
tall there you go now just click on it

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:07.420 
tall there you go now just click on it
copy<00:04:00.510> paste<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:02.459> then<00:04:03.410> rotate<00:04:04.790> copy<00:04:05.790> paste

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
copy paste and then rotate copy paste

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.770 
copy paste and then rotate copy paste
rotate<00:04:08.430> copy<00:04:08.910> paste<00:04:09.980> rotate<00:04:11.360> and<00:04:12.360> usually<00:04:12.720> I

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
rotate copy paste rotate and usually I

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.300 
rotate copy paste rotate and usually I
take<00:04:12.959> one<00:04:13.230> more<00:04:13.910> rotate<00:04:14.910> it<00:04:15.060> in<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.420> middle

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
take one more rotate it in the middle

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:25.150 
take one more rotate it in the middle
such<00:04:17.310> as<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.729> and<00:04:19.250> drag<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.430> backwards<00:04:20.760> and

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.760
