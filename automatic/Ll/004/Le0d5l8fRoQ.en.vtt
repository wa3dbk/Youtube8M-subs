retro<00:04:55.430> looking<00:04:55.760> not<00:04:55.940> personally<00:04:56.330> I<00:04:56.360> really

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
retro looking not personally I really

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.060 
retro looking not personally I really
like<00:04:57.110> it<00:04:57.470> I<00:04:57.680> like<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.370> optical<00:04:58.820> viewfinder<00:04:58.870> I

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
like it I like the optical viewfinder I

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.680 
like it I like the optical viewfinder I
like<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:01.220> fact<00:05:01.400> that<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:01.910> get<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.150> parallax

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
like the fact that you get the parallax

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.030 
like the fact that you get the parallax
errors<00:05:03.050> and<00:05:03.229> sometimes<00:05:03.590> when<00:05:03.710> you<00:05:03.770> take<00:05:04.010> a

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
errors and sometimes when you take a

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.560 
errors and sometimes when you take a
photo<00:05:04.370> if<00:05:04.610> you<00:05:04.729> take<00:05:04.880> a<00:05:04.910> post<00:05:05.120> or<00:05:05.300> something

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
photo if you take a post or something

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.320 
photo if you take a post or something
fairly<00:05:05.960> close<00:05:06.350> you<00:05:06.620> can<00:05:06.979> completely<00:05:07.729> miss<00:05:08.090> it

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
fairly close you can completely miss it

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.680 
fairly close you can completely miss it
and<00:05:08.510> so<00:05:09.410> it's<00:05:09.919> enjoyable<00:05:10.280> thing<00:05:10.729> to<00:05:10.880> use<00:05:11.090> and

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
and so it's enjoyable thing to use and

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.450 
and so it's enjoyable thing to use and
it<00:05:11.900> just<00:05:12.050> takes<00:05:12.260> your<00:05:12.470> photography<00:05:13.160> to<00:05:13.430> a

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
it just takes your photography to a

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.190 
it just takes your photography to a
different<00:05:14.180> level<00:05:14.300> if<00:05:14.540> you're<00:05:14.720> just<00:05:14.870> using<00:05:15.020> a

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
different level if you're just using a

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.080 
different level if you're just using a
point<00:05:15.410> in<00:05:15.500> show<00:05:15.710> it's<00:05:16.040> and<00:05:16.400> it's<00:05:16.610> really<00:05:16.880> good

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
point in show it's and it's really good

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
fun and I'm really enjoying it the

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.469 
fun and I'm really enjoying it the
images<00:05:19.370> are<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:19.550> little<00:05:19.700> bit<00:05:19.880> in<00:05:20.000> my<00:05:20.120> opinion<00:05:20.450> a

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
images are a little bit in my opinion a

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.060 
images are a little bit in my opinion a
little<00:05:20.630> bit<00:05:20.720> noisy<00:05:20.840> and<00:05:21.200> I<00:05:21.229> know<00:05:21.290> they<00:05:21.530> bang<00:05:21.860> on

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
little bit noisy and I know they bang on

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.100 
little bit noisy and I know they bang on
about<00:05:22.190> all<00:05:22.370> this<00:05:22.700> noise<00:05:23.000> reduction<00:05:23.479> it's<00:05:23.870> got

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
about all this noise reduction it's got

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.560 
images are a little bit of the noisy
side<00:05:34.340> so<00:05:34.610> you<00:05:34.700> do<00:05:34.850> have<00:05:34.970> to<00:05:35.090> be<00:05:35.180> a<00:05:35.210> bit<00:05:35.390> careful

wicked burst modes it's got some the

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.360 
wicked burst modes it's got some the
videos<00:05:50.690> reasonably<00:05:51.410> it's<00:05:51.740> not<00:05:52.100> particularly

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.659 
featured it's pretty much auto video but
it<00:05:54.620> works<00:05:54.800> fine<00:05:55.160> I<00:05:56.740> love<00:05:57.740> this<00:05:58.010> little<00:05:58.280> dial<00:05:58.490> on

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
it works fine I love this little dial on

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.629 
it works fine I love this little dial on
the<00:05:58.760> back<00:05:58.910> the<00:05:59.180> system<00:05:59.570> that<00:05:59.870> it<00:05:59.960> uses<00:06:00.580> at<00:06:01.580> the

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
the back the system that it uses at the

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.219 
the back the system that it uses at the
moment<00:06:01.940> I<00:06:01.970> mean<00:06:02.120> aperture<00:06:02.479> priority<00:06:02.690> and<00:06:03.169> to

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
moment I mean aperture priority and to

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.680 
moment I mean aperture priority and to
move<00:06:03.470> change<00:06:03.889> the<00:06:04.010> aperture<00:06:04.220> I<00:06:04.639> can<00:06:05.180> use<00:06:05.419> this

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
move change the aperture I can use this

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.950 
move change the aperture I can use this
dial<00:06:06.020> here<00:06:06.110> or<00:06:06.669> this<00:06:07.669> dial<00:06:07.970> here<00:06:08.240> and<00:06:08.300> this

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
dial here or this dial here and this

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.080 
dial here or this dial here and this
dial<00:06:09.229> is<00:06:09.350> got<00:06:09.530> a<00:06:09.560> press<00:06:09.889> as<00:06:10.160> well<00:06:10.190> so<00:06:10.639> if<00:06:10.700> I<00:06:10.820> mean

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
dial is got a press as well so if I mean

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.640 
dial is got a press as well so if I mean
I've<00:06:11.930> got<00:06:12.110> to<00:06:12.200> manual<00:06:12.590> mode<00:06:12.620> I<00:06:13.900> can<00:06:14.900> change<00:06:15.470> the

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
I've got to manual mode I can change the

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.529 
I've got to manual mode I can change the
aperture<00:06:15.889> with<00:06:16.460> that<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:16.639> can<00:06:16.910> press<00:06:17.180> it<00:06:17.210> and

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 
aperture with that I can press it and

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:20.170 
aperture with that I can press it and
then<00:06:17.780> change<00:06:18.110> the<00:06:18.350> shutter<00:06:18.560> press<00:06:19.550> it<00:06:19.760> back<00:06:20.030> to

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
then change the shutter press it back to

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.700 
then change the shutter press it back to
the<00:06:20.270> aperture<00:06:20.630> or<00:06:20.810> I<00:06:20.870> can<00:06:21.139> change<00:06:21.380> the

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
the aperture or I can change the

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.879 
the aperture or I can change the
aperture<00:06:22.010> and<00:06:22.520> the<00:06:22.580> shutter<00:06:23.479> with<00:06:24.470> that<00:06:24.650> once

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889 
aperture and the shutter with that once

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:27.550 
aperture and the shutter with that once
you've<00:06:25.100> got<00:06:25.220> to<00:06:25.430> dial<00:06:25.639> system<00:06:26.180> but<00:06:27.169> I<00:06:27.200> just

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
you've got to dial system but I just

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.290 
you've got to dial system but I just
tend<00:06:27.710> to<00:06:27.830> use<00:06:27.950> that<00:06:27.979> one<00:06:28.310> with<00:06:28.669> the<00:06:28.760> press<00:06:29.030> and

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
tend to use that one with the press and

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.230 
tend to use that one with the press and
the<00:06:29.389> term<00:06:29.600> it

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
the term it

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.480 
the term it
absolutely<00:06:30.900> brilliantly<00:06:31.289> so<00:06:32.069> it's<00:06:32.190> a<00:06:32.250> lovely

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
absolutely brilliantly so it's a lovely

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.200 
absolutely brilliantly so it's a lovely
thing<00:06:32.639> to<00:06:32.669> use<00:06:34.490> the<00:06:35.490> price<00:06:35.789> at<00:06:36.030> the<00:06:36.090> moment

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
thing to use the price at the moment

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.290 
thing to use the price at the moment
because<00:06:36.539> the<00:06:36.660> x20<00:06:37.319> is<00:06:37.380> sort<00:06:37.740> of<00:06:37.880> coming<00:06:38.880> out<00:06:39.000> is

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
because the x20 is sort of coming out is

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.300 
because the x20 is sort of coming out is
so<00:06:39.599> do<00:06:39.870> I<00:06:39.900> think<00:06:40.229> it's<00:06:40.500> imminent<00:06:40.919> or<00:06:41.009> it's<00:06:41.160> out

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
so do I think it's imminent or it's out

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.980 
so do I think it's imminent or it's out
already<00:06:41.340> I've<00:06:42.000> had<00:06:42.150> a<00:06:42.180> fine<00:06:42.419> with<00:06:42.599> one<00:06:42.780> and

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
already I've had a fine with one and

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.469 
already I've had a fine with one and
again<00:06:43.319> that's<00:06:43.500> a<00:06:43.590> lovely<00:06:43.770> camera<00:06:44.190> but<00:06:44.819> it<00:06:45.270> has

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
again that's a lovely camera but it has

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:47.059 
again that's a lovely camera but it has
caused<00:06:45.750> the<00:06:45.960> price<00:06:46.169> on<00:06:46.380> this<00:06:46.470> to<00:06:46.650> drop<00:06:46.860> quite

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:47.069 
caused the price on this to drop quite

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:48.439 
caused the price on this to drop quite
dramatically<00:06:47.610> I<00:06:47.759> think<00:06:48.000> you<00:06:48.060> can<00:06:48.180> pick<00:06:48.330> this

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:48.449 
dramatically I think you can pick this

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:51.110 
dramatically I think you can pick this
up<00:06:48.599> now<00:06:48.780> for<00:06:49.520> roundness<00:06:50.520> of<00:06:50.789> two<00:06:51.000> hundred

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
up now for roundness of two hundred

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.689 
up now for roundness of two hundred
fifty<00:06:51.509> quid<00:06:51.840> mark<00:06:52.139> I<00:06:52.440> think<00:06:52.830> that's<00:06:53.009> where<00:06:53.580> it

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:53.699 
fifty quid mark I think that's where it

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:55.279 
fifty quid mark I think that's where it
is<00:06:53.819> now<00:06:53.970> maybe<00:06:54.509> a<00:06:54.630> little<00:06:54.720> bit<00:06:54.870> more<00:06:55.050> maybe

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
is now maybe a little bit more maybe

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.749 
is now maybe a little bit more maybe
nevertheless<00:06:55.620> you<00:06:56.039> have<00:06:56.099> to<00:06:56.220> look<00:06:56.340> around<00:06:56.460> but

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 
nevertheless you have to look around but

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:58.700 
nevertheless you have to look around but
yeah<00:06:57.120> it's<00:06:57.690> a<00:06:57.810> great<00:06:57.960> value<00:06:58.169> in<00:06:58.349> your<00:06:58.410> camera

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
yeah it's a great value in your camera

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.110 
yeah it's a great value in your camera
in<00:06:58.889> my<00:06:58.979> opinion<00:06:59.400> so<00:07:00.270> there<00:07:00.449> you<00:07:00.509> go<00:07:00.949> the<00:07:02.120> my
