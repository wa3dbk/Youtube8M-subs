00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.549 

this<00:00:34.699> ball<00:00:34.940> is<00:00:34.969> very<00:00:35.449> valuable<00:00:35.780> and<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:36.410> when

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
this ball is very valuable and so when

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.410 
this ball is very valuable and so when
we<00:00:36.710> get<00:00:36.920> it<00:00:37.039> we<00:00:37.280> like<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:37.579> keep<00:00:37.730> it<00:00:37.910> one<00:00:38.239> of<00:00:38.329> the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
we get it we like to keep it one of the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.150 
we get it we like to keep it one of the
ways<00:00:38.570> that<00:00:38.690> we<00:00:38.809> can<00:00:38.930> keep<00:00:39.140> it<00:00:39.320> is<00:00:39.500> by<00:00:39.890> dribbling

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
ways that we can keep it is by dribbling

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.740 
ways that we can keep it is by dribbling
thing<00:00:40.609> I<00:00:40.730> like<00:00:40.969> to<00:00:41.000> remember<00:00:41.239> when<00:00:41.659> I'm

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
thing I like to remember when I'm

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.020 
thing I like to remember when I'm
dribbling<00:00:41.960> is<00:00:42.350> I'm<00:00:42.829> most<00:00:43.250> dominant<00:00:43.699> with<00:00:43.879> my

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
dribbling is I'm most dominant with my

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.250 
dribbling is I'm most dominant with my
right<00:00:44.210> foot<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:44.780> I'm<00:00:44.870> most<00:00:45.079> comfortable

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
right foot so I'm most comfortable

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.469 
right foot so I'm most comfortable
dribbling<00:00:46.010> with<00:00:46.129> my<00:00:46.339> right<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.120> if<00:00:47.239> worry

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:47.479 
dribbling with my right so if worry

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.450 
dribbling with my right so if worry
comes<00:00:47.839> out<00:00:48.050> here<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:48.350> he's<00:00:48.440> defending<00:00:48.920> me<00:00:49.039> if

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
comes out here and he's defending me if

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.219 
comes out here and he's defending me if
I<00:00:49.640> only<00:00:49.789> have<00:00:50.030> a<00:00:50.059> right<00:00:50.299> foot<00:00:50.570> or<00:00:50.869> he's

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:51.229 
I only have a right foot or he's

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:52.810 
I only have a right foot or he's
obviously<00:00:51.559> going<00:00:51.860> to<00:00:51.949> force<00:00:52.159> me<00:00:52.219> to<00:00:52.489> my<00:00:52.579> left

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
obviously going to force me to my left

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.579 
obviously going to force me to my left
it's<00:00:53.449> going<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.629> become<00:00:53.719> very<00:00:54.079> difficult<00:00:54.559> for

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
it's going to become very difficult for

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.500 
it's going to become very difficult for
me<00:00:54.739> to<00:00:54.860> keep<00:00:54.979> the<00:00:55.129> ball<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:55.940> one<00:00:56.089> thing<00:00:56.239> I<00:00:56.360> like

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.809 
go right to him small touches keep
control<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.289> ball<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.009> sometimes<00:01:25.580> it's<00:01:25.729> not

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
control the ball so sometimes it's not

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.699 
control the ball so sometimes it's not
always<00:01:25.880> about<00:01:26.179> speed<00:01:26.720> so<00:01:27.350> we<00:01:27.380> want<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.590> keep

00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:27.709 
always about speed so we want to keep

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:31.960 
always about speed so we want to keep
control<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.250> ball<00:01:28.429> nice<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:29.420> close<00:01:30.970> so

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
control of the ball nice and close so

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.510 
control of the ball nice and close so
that<00:01:32.209> he<00:01:32.750> can't<00:01:33.020> get<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.289> ball<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:34.250> third

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
that he can't get the ball the third

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.740 
that he can't get the ball the third
point<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.060> finally<00:01:35.899> if<00:01:36.830> when<00:01:37.700> I<00:01:37.729> dribble<00:01:38.239> my

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
point and finally if when I dribble my

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.479 
point and finally if when I dribble my
head<00:01:38.989> is<00:01:39.140> looking<00:01:39.410> at<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.590> ball<00:01:39.739> and<00:01:40.009> I

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:40.489 
head is looking at the ball and I

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:42.580 
head is looking at the ball and I
dribble<00:01:40.849> like<00:01:40.970> this<00:01:41.239> he's<00:01:42.050> going<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.289> come<00:01:42.440> in

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
dribble like this he's going to come in

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.740 
dribble like this he's going to come in
and<00:01:42.679> steal<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.009> ball<00:01:43.129> very<00:01:43.369> easily<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.629> the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
and steal the ball very easily so the

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.779 
and steal the ball very easily so the
third<00:01:44.959> thing<00:01:45.170> we<00:01:45.319> want<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:45.560> remember<00:01:45.800> is<00:01:46.129> head

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
third thing we want to remember is head

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.600 
third thing we want to remember is head
up<00:01:46.970> as<00:01:47.179> you<00:01:48.080> progress<00:01:48.259> in<00:01:48.500> soccer<00:01:48.920> this

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
up as you progress in soccer this

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.309 
up as you progress in soccer this
becomes<00:01:49.970> a<00:01:50.090> lot<00:01:50.209> easier<00:01:50.269> to<00:01:50.660> do<00:01:50.869> this<00:01:51.050> ball

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
becomes a lot easier to do this ball

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.080 
becomes a lot easier to do this ball
becomes<00:01:51.619> second<00:01:52.009> nature<00:01:52.039> and<00:01:52.489> when<00:01:52.970> we

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
becomes second nature and when we

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.150 
becomes second nature and when we
dribble<00:01:53.450> we<00:01:53.750> can<00:01:53.869> keep<00:01:53.989> our<00:01:54.170> head<00:01:54.319> up<00:01:54.470> looking

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
dribble we can keep our head up looking

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.419 
dribble we can keep our head up looking
for<00:01:55.340> other<00:01:55.429> options<00:01:55.700> either<00:01:56.390> a<00:01:56.690> pass<00:01:56.989> or<00:01:57.429> an

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
for other options either a pass or an

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.850 
for other options either a pass or an
opening<00:01:58.819> where<00:01:58.940> we<00:01:59.060> can<00:01:59.239> dribble<00:01:59.479> or<00:01:59.690> shoot<00:01:59.860> so

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
opening where we can dribble or shoot so

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.080 
opening where we can dribble or shoot so
those<00:02:01.069> are<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.190> three<00:02:01.310> things<00:02:01.670> we<00:02:01.879> like<00:02:02.060> to

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
those are the three things we like to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.380 
those are the three things we like to
remember<00:02:02.739> inside<00:02:03.739> outside<00:02:03.769> both<00:02:04.489> feet<00:02:04.789> keep

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
remember inside outside both feet keep

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.449 
remember inside outside both feet keep
the<00:02:05.509> ball<00:02:05.660> close<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.959> us<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.530> finally<00:02:07.280> keep

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
the ball close to us and finally keep

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:17.610 
the ball close to us and finally keep
our<00:02:07.610> head<00:02:07.729> up

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.140 

when<00:02:18.620> we've<00:02:18.769> mastered<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.370> skill<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.670> keeping

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
when we've mastered the skill of keeping

the<00:02:20.209> ball<00:02:20.330> close<00:02:20.629> to<00:02:20.659> us<00:02:20.989> using<00:02:21.650> both<00:02:22.010> feet<00:02:22.340> in

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
the ball close to us using both feet in

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.420 
the ball close to us using both feet in

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
and out there are times when or is going

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.149

to leave me no choice but to throw them
a<00:02:28.189> few<00:02:28.370> moves<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:28.790> we<00:02:28.879> can<00:02:29.000> get<00:02:29.120> past<00:02:29.329> them<00:02:29.629> so

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
a few moves so we can get past them so

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.500
