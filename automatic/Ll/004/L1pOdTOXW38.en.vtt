00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
10 megabytes per track so your 3-minute

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.770 
10 megabytes per track so your 3-minute
song<00:01:46.530> with<00:01:46.830> 5<00:01:47.160> tracks<00:01:47.580> would<00:01:47.970> need<00:01:48.210> at<00:01:48.360> least<00:01:48.390> a

just the final mix down as you can

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.550 
just the final mix down as you can
imagine<00:01:54.090> your<00:01:54.240> project<00:01:54.750> gets<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.380> big

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
imagine your project gets really big

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.380 
imagine your project gets really big
really<00:01:56.040> fast<00:01:56.369> once<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.850> start<00:01:57.150> doing

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
really fast once you start doing

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
multiple takes editing adding effects

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.080 
multiple takes editing adding effects
etc<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.350> your<00:02:01.619> audio<00:02:01.950> drive<00:02:02.250> needs<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.820> big

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
etc so your audio drive needs to be big

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.390 
etc so your audio drive needs to be big
to<00:02:03.900> keep<00:02:04.110> your<00:02:04.350> system<00:02:04.770> working<00:02:05.160> optimally

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
to keep your system working optimally

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.580 
to keep your system working optimally
you'll<00:02:06.000> need<00:02:06.180> at<00:02:06.330> least<00:02:06.360> one<00:02:06.960> third<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.440> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590
