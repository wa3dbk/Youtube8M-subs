00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hi Jim here from k2 concepts we had a

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.869 
hi Jim here from k2 concepts we had a
couple<00:00:03.179> questions<00:00:03.419> about<00:00:03.840> dipping<00:00:04.319> rims<00:00:04.879> so

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
couple questions about dipping rims so

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.309 
couple questions about dipping rims so
we're<00:00:06.120> gonna<00:00:06.210> go<00:00:06.450> ahead<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.600> get<00:00:06.779> started<00:00:07.200> I'm

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
we're gonna go ahead and get started I'm

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.570 
we're gonna go ahead and get started I'm
going<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.470> show<00:00:07.620> you<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.799> couple<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.099> things<00:00:08.160> to

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
going to show you a couple of things to

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.850 
going to show you a couple of things to
watch<00:00:08.610> out<00:00:09.030> for<00:00:09.290> technique<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.500> probably

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
watch out for technique is probably

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.110 
watch out for technique is probably
pretty<00:00:11.130> much<00:00:11.309> straightforward<00:00:11.700> with

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
pretty much straightforward with

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.890 
pretty much straightforward with
anything<00:00:12.509> else<00:00:13.730> some<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.000> guys<00:00:15.269> are<00:00:15.540> held

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
anything else some so you guys are held

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.570 
anything else some so you guys are held
we're<00:00:16.139> thinking<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.590> same<00:00:16.800> main<00:00:17.220> thing<00:00:17.430> you

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
we're thinking the same main thing you

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.820 
we're thinking the same main thing you
got<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.730> remember<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.320> contours<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.619> rim

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
got to remember is contours of the rim

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.800 
got to remember is contours of the rim
and<00:00:20.189> where<00:00:20.400> they're<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.880> go<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.240> flat<00:00:21.600> to

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
and where they're going to go in flat to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.779 
and where they're going to go in flat to
the<00:00:21.840> surface<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.920> get<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> part<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.490> your<00:00:23.640> rim

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the surface you get a part of your rim

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.460 
the surface you get a part of your rim
that's<00:00:23.970> angle<00:00:24.449> like<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.660> which<00:00:25.050> if<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.320> go

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
that's angle like this which if you go

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.290 
that's angle like this which if you go
in<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:25.920> at<00:00:26.039> 45<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.730> going<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:26.970> be<00:00:27.029> flat

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
in and like at 45 it's going to be flat

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.400 
in and like at 45 it's going to be flat
and<00:00:27.330> that's<00:00:27.570> where<00:00:27.810> you're<00:00:27.960> going<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.140> trap

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
and that's where you're going to trap

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.800 
and that's where you're going to trap
air<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.429> may<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> job<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.630> rim

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
air so you may have the job the rim

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.709 
air so you may have the job the rim
around<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:31.289> you're<00:00:31.439> going<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.980> okay<00:00:32.910> those

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
around as you're going in okay those

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.270 
around as you're going in okay those
that's<00:00:34.140> probably<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.559> main<00:00:34.739> thing<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.070> want

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
that's probably the main thing I want

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.680 
that's probably the main thing I want
you<00:00:35.370> guys<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> remember<00:00:36.030> when<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.300> watch<00:00:36.450> me

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
do this but it's pretty much straight

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.860 
do this but it's pretty much straight
forward<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:38.730> far<00:00:38.879> as<00:00:38.940> any<00:00:39.180> other<00:00:39.480> part<00:00:39.660> it's

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
forward as far as any other part it's

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.410 
forward as far as any other part it's
just<00:00:39.930> bigger<00:00:40.230> that's<00:00:40.620> all<00:00:40.800> alright<00:00:41.489> we're

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
just bigger that's all alright we're

just bigger that's all alright we're
going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:43.940> turn<00:00:44.940> off<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> tank<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.989> already

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
going to turn off the tank you already

00:00:46.020 --> 00:01:01.830 
going to turn off the tank you already
have<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> pattern

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.899 

during<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:02.560> water

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.859 

armour

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
armour

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.279 
armour
throughout<00:01:07.469> the<00:01:07.649> rim<00:01:08.329> okay<00:01:09.329> now<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.140> look

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
throughout the rim okay now if you look

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.169 
throughout the rim okay now if you look
at<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.530> rim<00:01:10.799> you'll<00:01:11.039> see<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.460> we've<00:01:12.000> got<00:01:12.149> a

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:12.179 
at this rim you'll see that we've got a

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:15.020 
at this rim you'll see that we've got a
lot<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.509> flat<00:01:12.840> areas<00:01:13.259> in<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.829> I'm<00:01:14.549> not<00:01:14.789> going

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
lot of flat areas in it so I'm not going

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.809 
lot of flat areas in it so I'm not going
to<00:01:15.119> want<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.719> go<00:01:15.899> in<00:01:16.079> flats<00:01:16.409> mistake<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.219> lot<00:01:17.640> of

got about ten seconds here left go ahead
and<00:01:50.640> get<00:01:50.819> this

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:21.770 

tires<00:01:57.770> off

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.740 

move<00:02:22.170> your<00:02:22.350> game<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.920> little<00:02:23.160> bit<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:24.360> balance
