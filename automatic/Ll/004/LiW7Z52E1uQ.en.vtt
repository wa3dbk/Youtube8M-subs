something like that

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.500 
something like that
it's<00:00:19.529> sufficient<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.550> start<00:00:20.789> off<00:00:21.029> with<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.420> of

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
smaller the better in the beginning so

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.890 
smaller the better in the beginning so
the<00:00:26.220> snakes<00:00:26.490> feel<00:00:26.849> comfortable<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.660> their<00:00:27.750> new

boa a green tree python you're gonna
have<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.689> look<00:01:54.869> at<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.200> height<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.100> cage

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
have to look at the height of the cage

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.399 
have to look at the height of the cage
more<00:01:56.850> than<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.420> length<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.200> width

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
more than the length and the width

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.219 
more than the length and the width
because<00:01:59.369> those<00:01:59.700> animals<00:02:00.149> did<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.899> spend

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
because those animals did you spend

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.100 
because those animals did you spend
about<00:02:01.350> 95<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.219> 100<00:02:02.549> percent<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.119> their<00:02:03.540> life<00:02:03.780> in

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
about 95 to 100 percent of their life in

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.199 
about 95 to 100 percent of their life in
branches<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:05.250> do<00:02:05.430> need<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> high<00:02:06.240> cage<00:02:08.209> if

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
branches so they do need a high cage if

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.720 
branches so they do need a high cage if
you're<00:02:09.420> getting<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.780> large<00:02:10.170> colubrid<00:02:11.129> or<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.310> mid

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
you're getting a large colubrid or a mid

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.790 
you're getting a large colubrid or a mid
sized<00:02:12.060> boa<00:02:12.480> or<00:02:12.810> Python

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
sized boa or Python

this<00:02:14.250> cage<00:02:14.580> here<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.540> perfect<00:02:16.170> enclosure

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
this cage here is a perfect enclosure

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.850 
this cage here is a perfect enclosure
for<00:02:17.190> them<00:02:17.400> it's<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:18.060> 55<00:02:18.780> gallon<00:02:19.050> long<00:02:19.470> tank

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
for them it's a 55 gallon long tank

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.280 
for them it's a 55 gallon long tank
that'll<00:02:20.850> work<00:02:21.000> great<00:02:21.420> for<00:02:21.870> those<00:02:21.990> species

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
that'll work great for those species

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.770 
that'll work great for those species
that<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.710> just<00:02:22.950> mentioned<00:02:23.160> we<00:02:23.940> are<00:02:24.210> going<00:02:24.690> to

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
that I just mentioned we are going to

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.660 
that I just mentioned we are going to
use<00:02:24.960> this<00:02:25.170> tank<00:02:25.470> today<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.860> show<00:02:26.250> how<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.460> put

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
use this tank today to show how to put

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.460 
use this tank today to show how to put
it<00:02:26.790> all<00:02:26.940> together<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.810> get<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.960> perfect

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
it all together to get a perfect
