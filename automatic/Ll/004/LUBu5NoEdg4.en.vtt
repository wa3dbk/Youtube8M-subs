take it out so you can see somewhat
helpless<00:00:26.730> works<00:00:29.240> what<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.269> did<00:00:30.720> was<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.679> took<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
helpless works what I did was I took a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.389 
helpless works what I did was I took a
fairly<00:00:33.450> inexpensive<00:00:34.320> bar<00:00:34.559> clamp<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.160> this

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
fairly inexpensive bar clamp like this

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.209 
fairly inexpensive bar clamp like this
one<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.739> I<00:00:37.739> ground<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.820> rivet<00:00:39.300> out<00:00:39.450> and

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
one and I ground the rivet out and

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.660 
one and I ground the rivet out and
remove<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.579> lower<00:00:41.760> shoe<00:00:42.829> that<00:00:43.829> gave<00:00:44.129> me<00:00:44.340> one

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
remove the lower shoe that gave me one

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.880 
remove the lower shoe that gave me one
hole<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.629> bar<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.200> had<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.620> drill<00:00:46.860> another

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
hole in the bar I had to drill another

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.810 
hole in the bar I had to drill another
hole<00:00:47.600> no<00:00:48.600> problem<00:00:49.079> there<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:50.100> then<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.520> might

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
hole no problem there and then I might

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.720 
hole no problem there and then I might
to<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.140> large<00:00:52.410> wood<00:00:52.800> block<00:00:53.160> which<00:00:53.550> is

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
to do to the large wood block which is

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.139 
to do to the large wood block which is
also<00:00:53.940> secured<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.840> base<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.940> did<00:00:56.940> this

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
also secured to the base I did this

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.630 
also secured to the base I did this
because<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.690> having<00:00:57.870> trouble<00:00:58.410> before<00:00:58.890> when

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
because I was having trouble before when

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.380 
because I was having trouble before when
I<00:00:59.670> would<00:00:59.910> glue<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.180> blanks<00:01:00.840> particularly

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
I would glue the blanks particularly

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.630 
I would glue the blanks particularly
when<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.420> want<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.780> add<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:05.060> second<00:01:07.340> camp<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
when I want to add the second camp and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.100 
when I want to add the second camp and
waste<00:01:09.390> block<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:10.580> would<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.850> clamping<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.960> on

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
waste block I would be clamping this on

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.740 
waste block I would be clamping this on
a<00:01:13.140> table<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> bar<00:01:14.880> clamp<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.540> trying<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
a table with a bar clamp and trying to

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.670 
a table with a bar clamp and trying to
eyeball<00:01:18.750> if<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.409> will<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.869> line<00:01:21.869> up<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
eyeball if you will the line up to the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.340 
eyeball if you will the line up to the
lower<00:01:22.920> part<00:01:23.340> all<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.479> while<00:01:24.689> trying<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
lower part all the while trying to

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.130 
lower part all the while trying to
balance<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.430> about<00:01:26.990> three-quarter<00:01:27.990> inch

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
balance on this about three-quarter inch

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.920 
balance on this about three-quarter inch
diameter<00:01:28.470> circle<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.340> wood<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.090> they<00:01:30.570> wanted

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
diameter circle of wood and they wanted

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.399 
diameter circle of wood and they wanted
to<00:01:31.110> tip<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.710> does<00:01:31.770> not<00:01:32.400> secure<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:32.939> all<00:01:33.409> so

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
to tip and does not secure at all so

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.130 
to tip and does not secure at all so
I've<00:01:34.650> decided<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.220> build<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.600> range<00:01:36.930> of

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
I've decided to build this the range of

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.530 
I've decided to build this the range of
it<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.650> within<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.460> range<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:39.030> most<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.420> my

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
it is within the range of most of my

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.080 
it is within the range of most of my
handles<00:01:40.049> if<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.799> want<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.070> do<00:01:41.189> shorter<00:01:41.610> things<00:01:41.850> I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
handles if I want to do shorter things I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.649 
handles if I want to do shorter things I
just<00:01:42.150> stack<00:01:42.960> up<00:01:43.170> some<00:01:43.350> wood<00:01:43.530> blocks<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:44.100> here

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
just stack up some wood blocks up here

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.780 
just stack up some wood blocks up here
you<00:01:45.659> notice<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.500> bar<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.829> mounted<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.670> an

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
you notice that the bar is mounted on an

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.240 
you notice that the bar is mounted on an
angle<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.229> compensate<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
angle and that is to compensate for the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.539 
angle and that is to compensate for the
angle<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.850> they<00:01:51.090> put<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.630> screw<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.549> that

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
angle that they put this screw in that

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.700 
angle that they put this screw in that
is<00:01:53.880> put<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> slight<00:01:55.049> angle<00:01:55.399> because<00:01:56.399> it's

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
is put in on a slight angle because it's

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.200 
is put in on a slight angle because it's
contemplated<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.219> bar<00:01:59.579> clamp<00:01:59.939> is

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
contemplated that as a bar clamp is

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.740 
contemplated that as a bar clamp is
tightened<00:02:00.930> more<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.320> more<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.670> bar<00:02:03.270> will

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
tightened more and more the bar will

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.260 
tightened more and more the bar will
flex<00:02:04.500> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
flex and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.109 
flex and
if<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.350> was<00:02:07.530> not<00:02:07.770> at<00:02:08.220> something<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.000> an

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
if this was not at something of an

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.390 
if this was not at something of an
inward<00:02:09.390> pointing<00:02:10.019> angle<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.979> might<00:02:11.220> actually

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
inward pointing angle it might actually

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.690 
inward pointing angle it might actually
spit<00:02:12.000> out<00:02:12.030> what<00:02:12.510> you're<00:02:12.690> trying<00:02:13.019> to<00:02:13.200> glue<00:02:13.440> I

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
spit out what you're trying to glue I

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.670 
spit out what you're trying to glue I
had<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.819> compensate<00:02:15.180> for<00:02:15.629> that<00:02:15.660> because<00:02:16.080> I'm

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
had to compensate for that because I'm

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.360 
had to compensate for that because I'm
not<00:02:16.860> putting<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.280> much<00:02:17.550> pressure<00:02:17.580> on<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.360> and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
not putting that much pressure on it and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.070 
not putting that much pressure on it and
I'm<00:02:20.370> not<00:02:20.580> flexing<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.390> part<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> bar

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
I'm not flexing this part of the bar

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.680 
I'm not flexing this part of the bar
it's<00:02:22.290> really<00:02:22.560> secured<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.129> wood<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.660> I

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
it's really secured to the wood so I

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.839 
it's really secured to the wood so I
want<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.379> be<00:02:25.560> pretty<00:02:25.920> much<00:02:26.160> straight<00:02:26.700> in

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
want this to be pretty much straight in

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.100 
want this to be pretty much straight in
line<00:02:27.650> now<00:02:28.650> when<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.310> blew<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.269> next<00:02:30.569> piece<00:02:30.840> up

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
line now when I blew the next piece up

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.690 
line now when I blew the next piece up
on<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.620> bottom<00:02:32.299> it<00:02:33.299> will<00:02:33.480> be<00:02:33.599> easy<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.700> simply

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
on the bottom it will be easy to simply

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.259 
on the bottom it will be easy to simply
put<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.599> in<00:02:36.840> place<00:02:37.459> bring<00:02:38.459> this<00:02:38.640> down<00:02:38.940> and

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
put this in place bring this down and

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.339 
put this in place bring this down and
clamp<00:02:40.049> it<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:41.420> right<00:02:42.420> now<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.720> can<00:02:43.110> see<00:02:43.319> that

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
clamp it and right now you can see that

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.979 
clamp it and right now you can see that
everything's<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.220> line<00:02:44.489> because<00:02:44.819> nothing<00:02:45.780> can

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
everything's in line because nothing can

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.860 
everything's in line because nothing can
move<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.590> that's<00:02:47.549> why<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:47.760> built<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.209> up<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:48.840> I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
move and that's why I built this up so I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.809 
move and that's why I built this up so I
wanted<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.349> share<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:49.799> with<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.280> if<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.579> do

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
wanted to share this with you if you do

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.240 
wanted to share this with you if you do
the<00:02:51.690> kind<00:02:52.079> of<00:02:52.260> work<00:02:52.319> where<00:02:52.860> you're<00:02:53.010> putting

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
the kind of work where you're putting

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.839 
the kind of work where you're putting
together<00:02:54.200> assemblies<00:02:55.200> for<00:02:55.680> spindle<00:02:56.459> turning

together assemblies for spindle turning

it's<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:58.019> nice<00:02:58.230> way<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:59.239> make<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.269> production<00:03:00.900> of

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
it if you only get one or two to ever do

you probably don't want to build this
