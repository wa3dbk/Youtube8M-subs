00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:08.730
 very good in this video we present you 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.849
 how to line buttons the materials and 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.130
 utensils that we will occupy is the machine 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.980
 lined with buttons in this case is 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.240
 here are machines to explore buttons 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.630
 a little smaller and less cumbersome 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.210
 we will also occupy being here and we 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.300
 bring the machine that will help us 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.630
 line the buttons the things that is what 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.630
 more important 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.330
 scissors 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:43.610
 color pencil and a good piece of cloth 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.490
 The first thing we will do is 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.320
 take 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.660
 a shell 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.090
 as you can see is in the part of 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.640
 below and this is the part above 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.940
 depends how the button will be 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.879
 big we'll do the circle in the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.879
 well we will make the circle 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.049
 and now we will cut 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.480
 to try although we stay a little 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.480
 circular 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.600
 although it is not necessary that it be so 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.380
 perfect 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.420
 is the shore they go inside the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.189
 button 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:46.759
 well we recommend using two so why 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:50.000
 so I already have this other and what 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.270
 we will have to do is good 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.960
 here are the accessories that you 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.710
 he spoke 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.260
 we will have to put the fabric on top of 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.890
 this accessory 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.890
 run 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.130
 the panning and put this piece here 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.130
 now we push 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.030
 and we wrap 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.040
 as well 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.150
 we have to push in 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.150
 with the help of paleo that attracts integral and 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.150
 Bend 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.200
 in taking with a little strength 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.860
 and then we look for the other accessory and it's 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.340
 where the other piece will go 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.340
 ah 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:13.190
 and it did not come out 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.790
 the pieces we have to go back 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.790
 stern 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:30.810
 we put it this way 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.810
 and then we just go down 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.690
 well to see how we have been and 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.410
 as we can see we already have our 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.560
 button ready to use in any 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.420
 jacket 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.420
 so thank you very much
