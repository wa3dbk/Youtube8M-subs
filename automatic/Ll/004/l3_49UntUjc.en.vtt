00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.570
 Hi, do you remember me? I'm Antonio the new. 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.860
 quartet of material 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.019
 we learned the importance of a 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.490
 map to find the place I've seen 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.500
 also how to guide 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.810
 locate a street or avenue 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.449
 I just realized that this is not enough. Look at the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.460
 What happened to him is here in the square? 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.130
 of the republic and wanted to reach the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.289
 do all right I knew I was 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.480
 the slope would do here on the map 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.640
 But at the time of the interview we did not know if 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.230
 I went left to right up there 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.030
 I asked him to arrive earlier 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.090
 work that was going to give some tips for him 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.640
 how the map is used in practice let's 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.260
 there popular in this telethon you go 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.480
 learn to draw the path between two 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.030
 Places for this you will see that it is 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.260
 necessary a correct orientation who 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.750
 indicate forward 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.590
 direction and direction of the path to be 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.539
 followed 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.129
 so let's go ahead and match 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.590
 Can not wait we have half a 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.059
 time to get all your doubts 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.370
 well aware of our them is already 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.350
 Antônio tells what happened 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.030
 It's what I was saying, I'm here in the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.689
 the Republic Square and that it would 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.689
 down the slope 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.540
 Rio de Janeiro - RJ 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.360
 dear father mother sister 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.550
 I hope everyone is in great health. 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.500
 here I touch the boat and slowly 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.020
 I'm integrating my life in this race. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.190
 city ​​that is in fact a city 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.010
 Wonderful 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.160
 my sales job and oblige us 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.630
 different places and the city guide is 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.270
 the salvation of the crop 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.090
 but even with the guide I still am 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.729
 lost without knowing what course to take 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.410
 I did not know what course to take 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.330
 knowing that I was here in the 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.820
 republic and wanted to come here in the wood 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.150
 of what my problem would be is orientation 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.020
 where do you go from the problem 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.940
 next antônio 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.800
 there are some basic rules that should 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.300
 be followed for you to find the 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.580
 better way of two places 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.520
 the first one is you positioning the 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.470
 map in the same position as the streets but 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.080
 that's just my difficulty 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.200
 I never know if a plant like that 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.120
 so calm or so I get there 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.180
 The important thing is to notice if you put 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.250
 the map in the same position of the streets everything 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.080
 it gets easier because there is a map 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.980
 indicating that the street is in front of you 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.420
 go ahead 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.459
 the map indicates that the street is on the left 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.989
 you turn left and so on 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.700
 It's alright that the local map in it 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.360
 position of the streets but how do I 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.790
 that 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.160
 Okay , you need to use some points. 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.140
 special reference points 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.720
 reference that serves all the evils 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.880
 how is the reference point that 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.590
 It caters for all maps that's right 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.769
 You've never heard of points. 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.769
 cardinals 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.420
 cardinal point common name 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.280
 directions of the compass rose pointing 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.280
 to the north south east and west 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.200
 the reference points used for 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.330
 the orientation of maps that are valid for 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.819
 all places are called points 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.160
 and these cardinal points were 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.830
 defined from the observation of the 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.440
 apparent movement of the sun and by the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.739
 the stars in the sky anywhere on 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.800
 the sun is always born on the same 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.989
 is placed on the opposite side that is why the 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.570
 man has always used the sun to 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.930
 find the direction and direction to follow 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.450
 Do you want to see it only combined? 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.230
 in which the sun rises and is represented 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.430
 by the letters l or is the opposite side west 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.140
 obvious letter 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.260
 so if you point your right hand 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.230
 to the east or to the east 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.500
 in front of it is symbolized north 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:51.150
 by the letter e and its back is the south 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.549
 represented by the letter s 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.470
 with this simple and practical combination 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.650
 orientation work is much more 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.780
 the map normally always has 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.860
 the north direction at the top of the 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.489
 paper sheet 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.519
 East will always be on the right 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.380
 west to the left and the south is below 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.540
 Now just be careful about one thing. 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.130
 there are some maps that for days the notes 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.289
 does not come at the top of the sheet 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.480
 but in these cases not an arrow indicating 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.980
 the north direction 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.230
 and here in Rio de Janeiro for whom 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.090
 Do you know the city you do not need the sun? 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.950
 to determine the cardinal points 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.000
 because the city is divided into zones 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.320
 north south area 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.230
 according to their position in relation to 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.060
 to the center the subway that connects the two zones 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.250
 runs both north and south 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.440
 When are you going from Tijuca to Botafogo and South? 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.180
 north when going from botafogo tijuca 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.190
 and speaking in north south east west 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.890
 much remembering that the other names 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.500
 southeast and northeast are also points of 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.480
 well remembered that they are in the 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.940
 truth from the cardinal points to 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.180
 people can set another four points 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.280
 reference points and to 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.320
 to know about these other four points of 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:04.860
 reference to people will use their heads 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:10.500
 Let's think a little, let's think one 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:12.420
 little leaving the rose of the winds with 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.420
 the four cardinal points 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.330
 I already know the collateral points are 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.950
 located between the cardinal points and their 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.630
 names are formed by the combination of 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:27.720
 points by 2 to 2 between the north and 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:31.530
 east, for example, it is to the northeast and 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:35.780
 is represented by the letters and between the 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:38.640
 south and east is the east s 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:43.020
 now the other side between the north and 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.120
 west is clear the northwest it dust and 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.700
 Finally southwest 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.700
 this route between the south and west
