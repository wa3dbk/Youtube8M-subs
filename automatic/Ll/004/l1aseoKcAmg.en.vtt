00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
important the youthfulness of the other

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.560 
important the youthfulness of the other
two<00:01:34.680> guys<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.460> second<00:01:36.180> car<00:01:36.329> I

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
two guys in the in the second car I

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.910 
two guys in the in the second car I
think<00:01:37.049> those<00:01:37.229> guys<00:01:37.470> are<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.890> be

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
think those guys are going to be

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.950 
think those guys are going to be
realistically<00:01:38.579> looking<00:01:38.790> for<00:01:39.150> sort<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.570> top

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
realistically looking for sort of a top

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.200 
realistically looking for sort of a top
ten<00:01:39.990> maybe<00:01:40.439> even<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.799> top-five<00:01:41.250> finish<00:01:41.640> but

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
ten maybe even a top-five finish but

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.730 
ten maybe even a top-five finish but
again<00:01:42.420> as<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.630> sort<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.930> bathurst<00:01:43.259> last<00:01:43.470> year

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
again as we sort of bathurst last year

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.410 
again as we sort of bathurst last year
anything<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.280> possible<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.909> saw<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> lot<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
anything is possible we saw a lot of

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.840 
anything is possible we saw a lot of
surprises<00:01:45.600> there<00:01:46.170> well<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.369> davison

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
surprises there well the davison

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.280 
surprises there well the davison
brothers<00:01:48.180> actually<00:01:48.479> finished<00:01:48.750> fourth<00:01:48.990> about

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
stronger package than 12 months ago and

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.540 
stronger package than 12 months ago and
hopefully<00:02:30.690> on<00:02:30.930> out<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.410> few<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.950> little

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
hopefully on out a few of the little

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.570 
hopefully on out a few of the little
issues<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.120> we<00:02:33.240> had<00:02:33.390> in<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.630> big<00:02:33.780> races<00:02:34.580> so

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
issues that we had in the big races so

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.310 
issues that we had in the big races so
yeah<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.790> think<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.480> think<00:02:36.810> wearing<00:02:36.959> with<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.200> good

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
yeah I think I think wearing with a good

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.290 
yeah I think I think wearing with a good
shot<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.740> mean<00:02:38.130> you've<00:02:38.250> been<00:02:38.280> really<00:02:38.700> starved

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
shot I mean you've been really starved

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.120 
shot I mean you've been really starved
of<00:02:39.390> competition<00:02:40.020> laps<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:40.440> year<00:02:40.740> which<00:02:40.950> is

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
of competition laps this year which is

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.610 
of competition laps this year which is
pretty<00:02:41.910> much<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.150> leanest<00:02:42.690> year<00:02:43.320> you've<00:02:43.470> had

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
pretty much the leanest year you've had

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.550 
pretty much the leanest year you've had
in<00:02:43.740> you<00:02:43.830> in<00:02:44.070> your<00:02:44.250> career<00:02:44.430> but<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:45.570> must<00:02:46.410> be

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
in you in your career but you must be

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.110 
in you in your career but you must be
sort<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:46.920> nice<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.340> fresh<00:02:47.550> in<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.760> way<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:47.970> guess

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
sort of nice and fresh in a way I guess

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.330 
sort of nice and fresh in a way I guess
for<00:02:48.540> for<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.170> three<00:02:49.380> big<00:02:49.590> ones<00:02:49.620> it's<00:02:50.250> a

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
for for the three big ones it's a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.120 
for for the three big ones it's a
glass-half-full<00:02:51.030> attitude<00:02:51.780> for<00:02:51.989> sure<00:02:52.170> no

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
glass-half-full attitude for sure no

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.770 
glass-half-full attitude for sure no
it's<00:02:53.280> not<00:02:53.340> idea<00:02:53.730> I'd<00:02:53.880> much<00:02:54.060> rather<00:02:54.090> be<00:02:54.450> racing

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
it's not idea I'd much rather be racing

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.350 
it's not idea I'd much rather be racing
every<00:02:54.959> weekend<00:02:55.350> that's<00:02:55.500> for<00:02:55.680> sure<00:02:55.830> but<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.520> know

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
every weekend that's for sure but I know

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.199 
every weekend that's for sure but I know
these<00:02:57.660> cars<00:02:58.320> well<00:02:58.620> enough<00:02:58.890> now<00:02:59.100> and<00:03:00.030> every

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
these cars well enough now and every

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.120 
these cars well enough now and every
time<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.420> hopped<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:00.840> last<00:03:01.320> year<00:03:01.590> even<00:03:01.860> if<00:03:02.040> I

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
time I hopped in last year even if I

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.220 
time I hopped in last year even if I
hadn't<00:03:02.400> driven<00:03:02.520> for<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.820> while<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.270> felt<00:03:04.080> pretty

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
hadn't driven for a while I felt pretty

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.780 
hadn't driven for a while I felt pretty
comfortable<00:03:04.440> straightaway<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.370> tend<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.700> be

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
comfortable straightaway and tend to be

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.120 
comfortable straightaway and tend to be
able<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.180> get<00:03:07.170> down<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.530> reasonable<00:03:07.709> pace

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
able to get down to a reasonable pace

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
part of being in that field like the

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.340 
part of being in that field like the
intensity<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.150> those<00:03:51.269> races<00:03:51.690> is<00:03:51.840> is<00:03:52.049> another
