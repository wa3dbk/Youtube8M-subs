pick up my slipped stitch and then I

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.420 
pick up my slipped stitch and then I
make<00:02:14.190> my<00:02:14.220> yarn<00:02:14.640> over<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.950> then<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.040> hold<00:02:17.250> that

in place while I'm lifting my slipped
stitch<00:02:21.510> over<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:23.239> just<00:02:24.239> find<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.959> be<00:02:25.230> a

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
stitch over I just find that to be a

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.330 
stitch over I just find that to be a
little<00:02:25.890> bit<00:02:26.040> easier<00:02:26.550> than<00:02:27.830> making<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.099> yarn

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
little bit easier than making the yarn

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.309 
little bit easier than making the yarn
over<00:02:29.519> and<00:02:30.000> trying<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.330> keep<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.660> on<00:02:30.780> my<00:02:30.989> needle

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
over and trying to keep it on my needle

while I'm picking up my slip stitch so

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.170 
while I'm picking up my slip stitch so
I've<00:02:34.290> got<00:02:34.470> my<00:02:34.650> left<00:02:35.160> needle<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.910> slipped

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
I've got my left needle in the slipped

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.120 
I've got my left needle in the slipped
stitch<00:02:37.069> make<00:02:38.069> my<00:02:38.220> yarn<00:02:38.489> over<00:02:38.910> hold<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.900> down
