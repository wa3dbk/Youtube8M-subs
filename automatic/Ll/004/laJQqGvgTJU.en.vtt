but just I'm just trying this one here
it<00:00:33.930> seems<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.380> work<00:00:34.410> pretty<00:00:34.559> well<00:00:35.480> you<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.630> see

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
it seems to work pretty well you can see

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.280 
it seems to work pretty well you can see
I<00:00:36.809> put<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.230> on<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.590> end<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.989> scrubber<00:00:39.989> so

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
I put it on the end of the scrubber so

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.799

into<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:13.140> may<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.439> treat<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.770> more

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
into it you may have to treat it more

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.399 
into it you may have to treat it more
than<00:01:14.280> once<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.630> not<00:01:15.810> gonna<00:01:15.960> ruin<00:01:16.170> your

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
another part it didn't ruin it so it's

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.140

fine<00:01:23.270> got<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.509> there

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
about halfway through and you can see a

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.020 
about halfway through and you can see a
difference<00:01:33.470> next<00:01:34.370> time<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:34.580> see<00:01:34.790> it<00:01:34.820> none<00:01:35.000> of

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
this will be here and there's your final

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.060 
this will be here and there's your final
result<00:01:37.970> here<00:01:38.060> this<00:01:38.840> is<00:01:39.560> all<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.830> paint

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.020 
off and some of the little red remnants
or<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.620> paint<00:01:51.920> got<00:01:52.040> scraped<00:01:52.310> off<00:01:52.550> as<00:01:52.730> well<00:01:52.910> and

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
or a paint got scraped off as well and

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.100 
or a paint got scraped off as well and
there's<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.210> little<00:01:53.360> bit<00:01:53.480> of<00:01:53.540> red<00:01:53.690> in<00:01:53.720> there<00:01:53.870> but

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
there's a little bit of red in there but

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.140 
there's a little bit of red in there but
major<00:01:55.100> difference<00:01:55.610> from<00:01:55.700> where<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.060> was

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
major difference from where it was

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.110 
major difference from where it was
before<00:01:56.290> from<00:01:57.290> this<00:01:57.470> point<00:01:57.770> on<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:58.760> this<00:01:58.880> point

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
before from this point on to this point

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.020 
before from this point on to this point
right<00:01:59.240> here<00:01:59.390> so<00:02:00.460> hope<00:02:01.460> it's<00:02:01.640> something<00:02:01.820> that

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
right here so hope it's something that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.260 
right here so hope it's something that
helps<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.720> is<00:02:03.220> just<00:02:04.220> require<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.550> lot<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:04.910> elbow

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
helps it is just require a lot of elbow

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.859 
helps it is just require a lot of elbow
grease<00:02:05.510> but<00:02:06.010> I<00:02:07.270> still<00:02:08.270> managed<00:02:08.480> to<00:02:08.510> keep<00:02:08.690> the

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
grease but I still managed to keep the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.510 
grease but I still managed to keep the
finish<00:02:09.140> there<00:02:09.350> what<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:09.710> would<00:02:09.920> recommend<00:02:10.040> is

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
finish there what I would recommend is

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.080 
finish there what I would recommend is
well<00:02:10.700> though<00:02:10.880> is<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:12.290> test<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:13.010> on<00:02:13.130> some

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
well though is that you test it on some

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.400 
well though is that you test it on some
part<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.360> your<00:02:14.480> finish<00:02:14.750> that's<00:02:14.960> not<00:02:15.110> seen

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
part of your finish that's not seen

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.630 
part of your finish that's not seen
maybe<00:02:15.650> under<00:02:16.610> here<00:02:17.030> or<00:02:17.420> somewhere<00:02:17.840> else<00:02:18.640> so

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
maybe under here or somewhere else so

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.620 
maybe under here or somewhere else so
you<00:02:19.730> can<00:02:19.850> see<00:02:20.000> whether<00:02:20.120> or<00:02:20.240> not<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.450> does

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
you can see whether or not it does

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.660 
you can see whether or not it does
respect<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.410> finish<00:02:21.680> but<00:02:21.890> as<00:02:22.010> far<00:02:22.190> as<00:02:22.220> my<00:02:22.400> car

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
respect to finish but as far as my car

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.290 
respect to finish but as far as my car
goes<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.330> did<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.810> looks<00:02:24.020> fine
