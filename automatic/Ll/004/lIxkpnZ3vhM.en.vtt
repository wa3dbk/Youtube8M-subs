00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.550 
to go to the APA runs for the prowler

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.370 
to go to the APA runs for the prowler
and<00:00:12.880> I<00:00:13.240> want<00:00:13.420> to<00:00:13.480> make<00:00:13.660> a<00:00:13.690> video<00:00:14.019> where<00:00:14.349> I

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.380 
and I want to make a video where I

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.850 
and I want to make a video where I
dedicated<00:00:14.860> to<00:00:15.700> shooting<00:00:16.090> down<00:00:16.240> aircrafts<00:00:17.050> now

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
dedicated to shooting down aircrafts now

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.990 
dedicated to shooting down aircrafts now
I've<00:00:18.040> been<00:00:18.189> shooting<00:00:18.490> down<00:00:18.520> as<00:00:18.759> well

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
I've been shooting down as well

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.730 
I've been shooting down as well
basically<00:00:19.599> for<00:00:20.259> as<00:00:20.320> long<00:00:20.439> as<00:00:20.500> I've<00:00:20.710> been

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
basically for as long as I've been

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.279 
basically for as long as I've been
thanking<00:00:21.310> and<00:00:21.460> it<00:00:22.090> isn't<00:00:22.330> all<00:00:22.390> that<00:00:22.420> hard

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
thanking and it isn't all that hard

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.470 
thanking and it isn't all that hard
what<00:00:23.650> you<00:00:23.740> need<00:00:23.859> to<00:00:23.890> do<00:00:24.070> is<00:00:24.279> to<00:00:24.460> focus<00:00:24.670> on<00:00:25.090> an

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
what you need to do is to focus on an

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.939 
what you need to do is to focus on an
aircraft<00:00:25.900> that<00:00:26.080> is<00:00:26.289> focusing<00:00:26.800> on

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
aircraft that is focusing on

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.130 
aircraft that is focusing on
air-to-ground<00:00:27.400> because<00:00:28.359> normally<00:00:28.720> when<00:00:28.990> they

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
air-to-ground because normally when they

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.929 
air-to-ground because normally when they
are<00:00:29.349> focusing<00:00:29.680> on<00:00:29.830> air-to-ground<00:00:30.099> they<00:00:30.820> are

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
are focusing on air-to-ground they are

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.270 
are focusing on air-to-ground they are
much<00:00:31.119> more<00:00:31.330> predictable<00:00:31.720> than<00:00:32.280> aircrafts

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
much more predictable than aircrafts

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.850 
much more predictable than aircrafts
that<00:00:33.460> are<00:00:33.580> focusing<00:00:34.059> on<00:00:34.239> other<00:00:34.540> aircrafts<00:00:35.350> is

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
that are focusing on other aircrafts is

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.619 
that are focusing on other aircrafts is
also<00:00:36.220> when<00:00:36.370> they<00:00:36.489> hover<00:00:36.729> like<00:00:36.940> this<00:00:37.180> they<00:00:37.600> are

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
also when they hover like this they are

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.509 
also when they hover like this they are
the<00:00:37.750> easiest<00:00:38.110> to<00:00:38.199> hit<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:39.040> the<00:00:39.190> moment<00:00:39.430> they

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
the easiest to hit and the moment they

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.130 
the easiest to hit and the moment they
stop<00:00:39.729> seeing<00:00:39.940> it<00:00:40.299> it<00:00:40.479> is<00:00:40.720> a<00:00:40.750> lot<00:00:41.199> harder<00:00:41.610> Oh

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
stop seeing it it is a lot harder Oh

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:54.740 
stop seeing it it is a lot harder Oh
should<00:00:44.140> I<00:00:44.320> have<00:00:44.530> a<00:00:45.100> a<00:00:46.530> what<00:00:47.530> ah<00:00:47.860> ha<00:00:48.820> European

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:05.700 

yeah<00:00:55.750> that's<00:00:56.049> the<00:00:56.229> my<00:00:56.350> career<00:01:02.820> what<00:01:04.650> did<00:01:05.650> you

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
yeah that's the my career what did you

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.610 
yeah that's the my career what did you
see<00:01:05.979> that<00:01:06.189> he<00:01:07.150> wasn't<00:01:07.540> even<00:01:07.720> flying<00:01:08.049> or<00:01:08.290> maybe

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
see that he wasn't even flying or maybe

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.240 
see that he wasn't even flying or maybe
he<00:01:08.800> thought<00:01:09.040> he<00:01:09.220> was<00:01:09.370> a<00:01:09.520> bad<00:01:09.730> guy<00:01:11.070> that's<00:01:12.070> my

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
he thought he was a bad guy that's my

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.190 
he thought he was a bad guy that's my
feeling

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
feeling

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.900 
feeling
see<00:01:14.200> I'm<00:01:14.380> like<00:01:14.620> with<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.100> other<00:01:15.250> two<00:01:15.550> battle

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
see I'm like with the other two battle

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.700 
see I'm like with the other two battle
tanks<00:01:16.150> you<00:01:16.240> have<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.630> hit<00:01:16.810> with<00:01:17.020> two<00:01:17.260> bullets

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
tanks you have to hit with two bullets

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.040 
tanks you have to hit with two bullets
to<00:01:17.830> take<00:01:18.040> down<00:01:18.460> on<00:01:18.550> es<00:01:18.760> F<00:01:18.910> with<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.240> prowler<00:01:19.840> and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
to take down on es F with a prowler and

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.660 
to take down on es F with a prowler and
for<00:01:20.440> that<00:01:20.560> reason<00:01:20.860> it<00:01:20.950> might<00:01:21.130> seem<00:01:21.370> that<00:01:21.400> it's

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
for that reason it might seem that it's

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.130 
for that reason it might seem that it's
a<00:01:21.760> bit<00:01:21.910> harder<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.300> do<00:01:22.540> with<00:01:22.690> with<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:22.900> prouder

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
a bit harder to do with with a prouder

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.070 
a bit harder to do with with a prouder
than<00:01:23.290> with<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:24.190> other<00:01:24.340> two<00:01:24.580> but<00:01:25.390> I<00:01:25.420> think<00:01:25.900> that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
than with the other two but I think that

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.440 
than with the other two but I think that
because<00:01:26.500> of<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:27.190> deploy<00:01:27.520> mode<00:01:27.790> which<00:01:28.030> is<00:01:28.210> the

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
because of the deploy mode which is the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.250 
because of the deploy mode which is the
Empire<00:01:28.840> specific<00:01:29.440> ability<00:01:30.280> of<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.820> Prowler

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
Empire specific ability of the Prowler

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.770 
Empire specific ability of the Prowler
it<00:01:32.260> makes<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.070> a<00:01:33.190> lot<00:01:33.340> easier<00:01:33.580> due<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.360> the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
it makes it a lot easier due to the

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.780 
it makes it a lot easier due to the
higher<00:01:35.140> velocity<00:01:35.830> and<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.190> higher<00:01:36.310> reload

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
higher velocity and the higher reload

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.149 
higher velocity and the higher reload
speed<00:01:37.150> it<00:01:37.930> just<00:01:38.110> seems<00:01:38.290> quite<00:01:38.530> tricky<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.860> hit

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
speed it just seems quite tricky to hit

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.170 
speed it just seems quite tricky to hit
them<00:01:39.310> when<00:01:39.520> they're<00:01:39.670> moving<00:01:39.850> though

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
them when they're moving though

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.180 
them when they're moving though
especially<00:01:40.450> at<00:01:40.780> this<00:01:40.960> range<00:01:41.260> and<00:01:41.770> I<00:01:41.890> think<00:01:42.100> the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
especially at this range and I think the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.680 
especially at this range and I think the
mistake<00:01:42.460> I'm<00:01:42.610> making<00:01:42.640> here<00:01:43.060> is<00:01:43.120> that<00:01:43.270> I'm<00:01:43.480> not

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
mistake I'm making here is that I'm not

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.540 
mistake I'm making here is that I'm not
bleeding<00:01:43.990> enough<00:01:44.590> meaning<00:01:45.159> that<00:01:45.280> I'm<00:01:45.400> not

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
bleeding enough meaning that I'm not

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.700 
bleeding enough meaning that I'm not
shooting<00:01:45.730> far<00:01:46.240> enough<00:01:46.570> ahead<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.290> targets

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
shooting far enough ahead of the targets

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.190 
shooting far enough ahead of the targets
but<00:01:48.400> even<00:01:48.850> looking<00:01:49.120> back<00:01:49.150> at<00:01:49.420> this<00:01:49.540> footage<00:01:49.900> I

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
but even looking back at this footage I

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.230 
but even looking back at this footage I
am<00:01:50.350> not<00:01:50.530> really<00:01:50.740> sure<00:01:50.830> so<00:01:51.250> here<00:01:51.850> is<00:01:52.030> some<00:01:52.210> of

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
am not really sure so here is some of

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.200 
am not really sure so here is some of
those<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.810> little<00:01:53.140> bit<00:01:53.229> easier<00:01:53.620> shots<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.100> make

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
those a little bit easier shots to make

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.340 
those a little bit easier shots to make
some<00:01:55.210> tankers<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:55.780> I've<00:01:55.990> played<00:01:56.200> with

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
some tankers that I've played with

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.080 
some tankers that I've played with
actually<00:01:56.890> say<00:01:57.010> that<00:01:57.190> it's<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:57.580> easiest<00:01:57.940> to

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
actually say that it's the easiest to

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.270 
actually say that it's the easiest to
shoot<00:01:58.240> on<00:01:58.390> aircrafts<00:01:58.900> with<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.740> Prowler<00:02:00.070> due

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
shoot on aircrafts with the Prowler due

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.500 
shoot on aircrafts with the Prowler due
to<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.670> different<00:02:01.000> weather<00:02:01.150> I<00:02:01.240> just

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
to the different weather I just

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.440 
to the different weather I just
mentioned<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:02.650> I<00:02:02.740> also<00:02:02.890> think<00:02:03.220> that<00:02:03.450> because

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
mentioned and I also think that because

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.320 
mentioned and I also think that because
of<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:05.229> deployed<00:02:05.560> mode<00:02:05.799> itself<00:02:06.159> you<00:02:06.790> put

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
of the deployed mode itself you put

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.809 
of the deployed mode itself you put
yourself<00:02:07.659> in<00:02:07.870> situations<00:02:08.470> where<00:02:09.429> you're<00:02:09.549> more

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
yourself in situations where you're more

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.000 
yourself in situations where you're more
likely<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.330> be<00:02:10.659> able<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.959> hit<00:02:11.200> aircrafts<00:02:11.799> than

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
likely to be able to hit aircrafts than

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.340 
likely to be able to hit aircrafts than
you<00:02:12.159> would<00:02:12.370> if<00:02:12.550> you<00:02:12.819> are<00:02:13.060> in<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.900> bank<00:02:14.050> guard<00:02:14.170> for

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
you would if you are in a bank guard for

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.500 
you would if you are in a bank guard for
example<00:02:14.680> rely<00:02:14.920> on<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.130> shield<00:02:15.490> or<00:02:15.760> if<00:02:16.270> you're<00:02:16.390> in

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
example rely on a shield or if you're in

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.030 
example rely on a shield or if you're in
a<00:02:16.569> Magra<00:02:16.930> where<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.380> most<00:02:17.680> like

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
a Magra where you most like

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.160 
a Magra where you most like
we'll<00:02:18.220> be<00:02:18.370> relying<00:02:18.670> on<00:02:18.790> its<00:02:18.970> mobility<00:02:19.269> for

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
we'll be relying on its mobility for

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.589 
we'll be relying on its mobility for
example<00:02:20.590> being<00:02:21.099> on<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.400> hill<00:02:21.670> like<00:02:21.819> this<00:02:21.879> it

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
example being on a hill like this it

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.410 
example being on a hill like this it
makes<00:02:23.049> most<00:02:23.379> sense<00:02:23.650> where<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.640> Prowler<00:02:25.180> and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
makes most sense where the Prowler and

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.199 
makes most sense where the Prowler and
it<00:02:26.019> really<00:02:26.200> does<00:02:26.409> augment<00:02:26.920> its<00:02:27.310> strength

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
it really does augment its strength

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.630 
it really does augment its strength
however<00:02:28.870> if<00:02:29.439> another<00:02:29.769> tank<00:02:30.069> is<00:02:30.220> able<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.519> get

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
however if another tank is able to get

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.610 
however if another tank is able to get
close<00:02:30.879> to<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.540> are<00:02:31.599> really<00:02:32.170> going<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.470> be

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
close to you you are really going to be

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.830 
close to you you are really going to be
in<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.829> bit<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:32.980> trouble<00:02:33.329> especially<00:02:34.329> if<00:02:34.599> you're

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
in a bit of trouble especially if you're

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.410 
in a bit of trouble especially if you're
on<00:02:34.870> our<00:02:35.110> vamo<00:02:35.319> which<00:02:35.799> is<00:02:35.920> easy<00:02:36.099> to<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:36.430> with<00:02:36.849> the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
on our vamo which is easy to do with the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.680 
on our vamo which is easy to do with the
anchor<00:02:37.810> mode<00:02:37.989> oh<00:02:38.260> oh<00:02:38.769> shit<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.379> bad

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
anchor mode oh oh shit this is bad

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.089 
anchor mode oh oh shit this is bad
yeah<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:46.180> might<00:02:46.390> survive<00:02:46.659> this<00:02:46.870> but<00:02:47.200> we<00:02:47.920> might

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
yeah we might survive this but we might

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:57.479 
yeah we might survive this but we might
not<00:02:54.720> don't<00:02:55.720> worry<00:02:55.780> don't<00:02:56.319> worry<00:02:56.440> I'm<00:02:56.799> really

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
not don't worry don't worry I'm really

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:08.309 
not don't worry don't worry I'm really
good<00:02:57.609> at<00:02:57.730> driving<00:02:57.970> tanks<00:03:06.180> yeah<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.750> see<00:03:07.959> these

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
good at driving tanks yeah you see these

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.809 
good at driving tanks yeah you see these
kind<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.680> skills<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.099> can't<00:03:09.340> learn<00:03:09.519> you<00:03:09.700> have

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
kind of skills you can't learn you have

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.990 
kind of skills you can't learn you have
to<00:03:09.909> be<00:03:10.030> below<00:03:10.359> with<00:03:10.629> this<00:03:11.639> now<00:03:12.639> where<00:03:12.909> the

to be below with this now where the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.430 
to be below with this now where the
fucker<00:03:13.209> would<00:03:13.389> go<00:03:13.540> up<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.930> might<00:03:14.200> be

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
fucker would go up I might be

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.770 
fucker would go up I might be
responsible<00:03:15.040> for<00:03:15.579> you<00:03:15.849> dying<00:03:16.120> as<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.480> virgin

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
responsible for you dying as a virgin

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.699 
responsible for you dying as a virgin
I'm<00:03:17.139> sorry<00:03:18.239> now<00:03:19.239> as<00:03:19.389> much<00:03:19.480> as<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:20.049> Prowler

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
I'm sorry now as much as the Prowler

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.759 
I'm sorry now as much as the Prowler
excels<00:03:21.190> at<00:03:21.489> long-range<00:03:21.930> sniping<00:03:22.930> due<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.590> its

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
excels at long-range sniping due to its

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.939 
excels at long-range sniping due to its
higher<00:03:24.430> velocity<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.389> the<00:03:25.510> bullets<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:26.769> is

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949 
higher velocity of the bullets it is

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:40.950 
higher velocity of the bullets it is
terrible<00:03:27.579> at<00:03:27.790> close<00:03:28.090> range<00:03:28.419> and<00:03:29.250> here's<00:03:30.250> why

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.600 

so<00:03:41.960> another<00:03:42.110> thing<00:03:42.230> about<00:03:42.410> leading<00:03:43.010> like<00:03:43.490> I

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
so another thing about leading like I

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.490 
so another thing about leading like I
mentioned<00:03:43.910> earlier<00:03:44.000> it's<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.810> lot<00:03:44.960> easier<00:03:45.350> as

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
mentioned earlier it's a lot easier as

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.020 
mentioned earlier it's a lot easier as
long<00:03:45.650> as<00:03:45.770> you<00:03:45.860> can<00:03:46.010> see<00:03:46.220> where<00:03:46.430> your<00:03:46.610> shots<00:03:46.850> are

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
long as you can see where your shots are

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.700 
long as you can see where your shots are
going<00:03:47.180> like<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.600> this<00:03:47.720> case<00:03:47.990> where<00:03:48.350> the

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
going like in this case where the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.520 
going like in this case where the
liberator<00:03:49.400> is<00:03:49.550> a<00:03:49.580> lot<00:03:49.820> closer<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.690> still<00:03:51.350> did

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
liberator is a lot closer I still did

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.440 
liberator is a lot closer I still did
miss<00:03:51.740> quite<00:03:52.130> a<00:03:52.160> few<00:03:52.340> shots<00:03:52.520> on<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:52.820> Liberator

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
miss quite a few shots on that Liberator

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.740 
miss quite a few shots on that Liberator
and<00:03:53.980> on<00:03:54.980> this<00:03:55.220> river<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:56.030> same<00:03:56.240> thing

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
and on this river the same thing

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.800 
and on this river the same thing
I<00:03:56.780> only<00:03:57.530> land<00:03:57.890> one<00:03:58.160> of<00:03:58.190> these<00:03:58.430> shots<00:03:58.700> and<00:03:59.030> there

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
I only land one of these shots and there

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.900 
I only land one of these shots and there
might<00:03:59.960> seem<00:04:00.230> like<00:04:00.260> easy<00:04:01.100> shots<00:04:01.430> for<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.760> more

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
might seem like easy shots for the more

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.870 
might seem like easy shots for the more
experienced<00:04:02.810> tankers<00:04:03.680> but<00:04:04.070> I'm<00:04:04.490> fairly<00:04:04.760> new

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
experienced tankers but I'm fairly new

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.480 
experienced tankers but I'm fairly new
to<00:04:05.120> this<00:04:05.270> this<00:04:05.900> is<00:04:06.080> not<00:04:06.230> a<00:04:06.260> hard<00:04:06.530> though

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.430 

now<00:04:10.490> if<00:04:10.670> you're<00:04:10.820> very<00:04:11.000> lucky<00:04:11.150> or<00:04:11.480> if<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:12.110> are

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
now if you're very lucky or if you are

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.170 
now if you're very lucky or if you are
very<00:04:12.980> good<00:04:13.190> at<00:04:13.280> reading<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:13.820> map<00:04:14.030> and

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
very good at reading the map and

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.960 
very good at reading the map and
understanding<00:04:14.900> your<00:04:15.410> enemy's<00:04:15.800> movements<00:04:16.370> you

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
understanding your enemy's movements you

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.460 
understanding your enemy's movements you
can<00:04:17.000> put<00:04:17.299> yourself<00:04:17.390> in<00:04:17.660> situations<00:04:17.810> where<00:04:18.380> you

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
can put yourself in situations where you

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.900 
can put yourself in situations where you
get<00:04:18.620> a<00:04:18.680> lot<00:04:18.919> of<00:04:19.040> easy<00:04:19.280> kills

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
get a lot of easy kills

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.990 
get a lot of easy kills
but<00:04:20.450> and<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:21.019> think<00:04:21.230> that<00:04:21.320> goes<00:04:21.470> for<00:04:21.739> all

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
but and I think that goes for all

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.350 
but and I think that goes for all
vehicles<00:04:23.000> in<00:04:23.410> transit<00:04:24.410> -<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.830> also<00:04:25.730> with<00:04:26.180> the

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
vehicles in transit - and also with the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.870 
vehicles in transit - and also with the
maxes<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.080> certain<00:04:27.740> other<00:04:27.860> infantry<00:04:28.520> weapons
