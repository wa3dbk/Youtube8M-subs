00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
hi my name is Ashley Wickham I'm the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.230 
hi my name is Ashley Wickham I'm the
project<00:00:10.860> director<00:00:11.099> for<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.790> Bentley

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
project director for the Bentley

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.289 
project director for the Bentley
Mulsanne<00:00:12.599> project<00:00:13.200> here<00:00:13.889> at<00:00:13.920> Crewe<00:00:14.340> what<00:00:15.210> I'd

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
Mulsanne project here at Crewe what I'd

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.720 
Mulsanne project here at Crewe what I'd
like<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.480> explain<00:00:15.809> today<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.550> where<00:00:17.550> we've

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
like to explain today is where we've

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.960 
like to explain today is where we've
taken<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:19.310> fundamental<00:00:20.310> design<00:00:20.490> for<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
taken the fundamental design for the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.090 
taken the fundamental design for the
project<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.080> starts<00:00:22.350> very<00:00:22.710> early<00:00:22.859> on

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
project so this starts very early on

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.820 
project so this starts very early on
with<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> doubt<00:00:23.789> design<00:00:24.150> team<00:00:24.420> working<00:00:25.410> from

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
with the doubt design team working from

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.880 
with the doubt design team working from
the<00:00:25.890> style<00:00:26.369> concept<00:00:26.939> making<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.779> designs<00:00:28.170> and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the style concept making the designs and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.700 
the style concept making the designs and
those<00:00:29.010> designs<00:00:29.400> are<00:00:29.609> then<00:00:29.730> converted<00:00:29.939> into

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
those designs are then converted into

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.200 
those designs are then converted into
physical<00:00:31.710> properties<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.579> then<00:00:33.090> ultimately

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
physical properties and then ultimately

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.900 
physical properties and then ultimately
into<00:00:33.840> individual<00:00:34.559> panels<00:00:34.950> what<00:00:35.610> we're<00:00:35.730> doing

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
into individual panels what we're doing

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.330 
into individual panels what we're doing
this<00:00:36.000> facilities<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.840> take<00:00:37.140> those<00:00:37.710> press

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
this facilities we take those press

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.060 
this facilities we take those press
panels<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.420> then<00:00:39.750> start<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.350> process<00:00:40.559> of

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
panels and we then start the process of

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.400 
panels and we then start the process of
building<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.700> Bentley<00:00:41.969> Mulsanne

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.080 

those<00:00:49.410> panels<00:00:49.710> will<00:00:49.980> then<00:00:50.130> be<00:00:50.280> put<00:00:50.460> into<00:00:50.640> sub

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
those panels will then be put into sub

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.450 
those panels will then be put into sub
assembly<00:00:51.510> areas<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.020> they<00:00:52.650> will<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.980> sub

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
assembly areas and they will be sub

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.310 
assembly areas and they will be sub
assembled<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.420> meet<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> right<00:00:54.870> level<00:00:55.260> of

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
assembled to meet the right level of

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.200 
assembled to meet the right level of
specification<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.250> then<00:00:56.790> those<00:00:56.970> sub

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
specification and then those sub

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.430 
specification and then those sub
assemblies<00:00:57.629> will<00:00:57.780> go<00:00:57.870> into<00:00:58.079> our<00:00:58.199> build

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
assemblies will go into our build

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.290 
assemblies will go into our build
process<00:00:58.890> where<00:00:59.370> we<00:00:59.460> will<00:00:59.520> then<00:00:59.730> build<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
process where we will then build the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.079 
process where we will then build the
whole<00:01:00.480> car<00:01:00.809> from<00:01:01.530> basic<00:01:02.010> panel<00:01:02.220> to<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> finished

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
whole car from basic panel to a finished

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:09.830 
whole car from basic panel to a finished
vehicle<00:01:07.580> that<00:01:08.580> process<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.300> this<00:01:09.450> stage<00:01:09.690> of

of the car is exactly as the design
requires<00:01:59.849> it<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:00.899> process<00:02:01.619> will

requires it to be but that process will
then<00:02:01.920> move<00:02:02.099> along<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.580> line<00:02:02.789> and<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.090> car

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
then move along the line and the car

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.719 
then move along the line and the car
will<00:02:03.810> then<00:02:04.050> gradually<00:02:04.739> become<00:02:05.069> a<00:02:05.280> complete

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
will then gradually become a complete

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:14.550 
will then gradually become a complete
vehicle

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.580 

and<00:02:15.790> finally<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.480> finished<00:02:17.810> body<00:02:18.079> white<00:02:18.379> is
