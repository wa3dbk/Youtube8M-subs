know<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> thought<00:00:59.460> his<00:00:59.670> physical<00:01:00.090> Egyptians

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
know I thought his physical Egyptians

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.360 
know I thought his physical Egyptians
might<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> bit<00:01:01.109> better<00:01:01.230> he's<00:01:01.620> only<00:01:01.739> got<00:01:01.920> 75

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
might be a bit better he's only got 75

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.130 
might be a bit better he's only got 75
strength<00:01:02.760> although<00:01:03.090> he<00:01:03.120> does<00:01:03.420> actually<00:01:03.660> feel

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
strength although he does actually feel

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.359 
strength although he does actually feel
a<00:01:04.170> bit<00:01:04.439> stronger<00:01:04.769> than<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.220> game

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
a bit stronger than that in game

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.450 
a bit stronger than that in game
probably<00:01:05.790> more<00:01:05.909> 80<00:01:06.590> start<00:01:07.590> off<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.100> wasn't

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
probably more 80 start off with I wasn't

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.340 
probably more 80 start off with I wasn't
expecting<00:01:08.700> him<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.240> good<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.200> was

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.300 
shot his dribbling is actually pretty
decent<00:01:31.770> for<00:01:32.450> someone<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.720> his<00:01:34.170> size<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
decent for someone of his size what I

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.190 
decent for someone of his size what I
liked<00:01:35.579> about<00:01:35.670> him<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.299> even<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.110> he

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
liked about him is that even if he

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.810 
liked about him is that even if he
doesn't<00:01:37.409> score<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.280> box<00:01:38.490> he's<00:01:38.640> always

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
doesn't score in the box he's always

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.999 
doesn't score in the box he's always
causing<00:01:39.090> trouble<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:40.079> leads<00:01:40.320> he<00:01:40.829> can

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
causing trouble and this leads he can

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.980 
causing trouble and this leads he can
make<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> pass<00:01:41.610> through<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.420> Sentier<00:01:42.750> shirt

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
make a pass through the Sentier shirt

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.359 
make a pass through the Sentier shirt
pattern<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.380> other<00:01:43.530> players<00:01:43.740> you'll<00:01:43.979> see<00:01:44.189> or

pattern to other players you'll see or

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.999 
pattern to other players you'll see or
someone<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.810> knock<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.259> rebounding<00:01:46.829> is

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
someone just like knock on rebounding is

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.219 
someone just like knock on rebounding is
penalties<00:01:47.820> often<00:01:48.090> 99<00:01:48.360> pens<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> best<00:01:48.990> penalty

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229

you<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.390> don't<00:01:51.600> think<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.020> free

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
you can have so I don't think it's free

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.600 
you can have so I don't think it's free
kicks<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.619> good<00:01:52.829> I'd<00:01:53.070> probably<00:01:53.100> leave

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
kicks to that good I'd probably leave

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.460 
kicks to that good I'd probably leave
that<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.880> someone<00:01:54.060> else<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.170> finishing

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
that to someone else but it's finishing

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.980

strong<00:02:29.010> as<00:02:29.160> well<00:02:29.310> obviously<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:29.790> not<00:02:29.820> the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
strong as well obviously it's not the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.820 
strong as well obviously it's not the
fastest<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:30.660> he's<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:31.140> good<00:02:31.320> player<00:02:31.500> so

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
strongly though he's a target man so you

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.600

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.790 
but I still think he's actually a decent
player<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.720> he's<00:02:57.810> worth<00:02:58.050> giving<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.440> go<00:02:58.590> guys
