00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
and back to this we've got the chest

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.160 
and back to this we've got the chest
stomach<00:01:58.159> hips<00:01:59.159> up<00:01:59.460> now<00:02:00.299> here's<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> little

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
stomach hips up now here's a little

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.719 
stomach hips up now here's a little
trick<00:02:01.380> from<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:03.380> sit<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.219> your<00:02:05.369> back<00:02:05.549> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
trick from here sit so your back to

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.310 
trick from here sit so your back to
straight<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.299> still<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.750> central<00:02:07.110> plane

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
straight is still on that central plane

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.020 
straight is still on that central plane
so<00:02:07.500> your<00:02:07.619> hips<00:02:07.770> go<00:02:07.950> back<00:02:08.160> when<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.489> sit<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
then you want to rotate
