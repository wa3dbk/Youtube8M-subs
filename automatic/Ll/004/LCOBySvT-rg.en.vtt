the others you put it this way in you

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.429 
the others you put it this way in you
need<00:00:28.769> another<00:00:29.009> tank<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:30.089> smell<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.960> feel<00:00:31.289> it

need another tank to smell and feel it

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.830 
need another tank to smell and feel it
every<00:00:31.739> day<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.310> and<00:00:32.669> take<00:00:33.000> some<00:00:33.180> temperatures

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
every day and and take some temperatures

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.319 
every day and and take some temperatures
inside<00:00:34.079> if<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.470> are<00:00:34.800> very<00:00:35.430> precise<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.180> want

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
inside if you are very precise you want

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.040 
inside if you are very precise you want
to<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.510> very<00:00:37.170> precise<00:00:37.610> so<00:00:40.130> what's<00:00:41.130> happening

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
to be very precise so what's happening

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.950 
to be very precise so what's happening
there<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.080> many<00:00:43.620> things<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:44.730> if<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.330> you

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
there is many things because if you you

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.340 
there is many things because if you you
can<00:00:46.200> get<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.160> tank<00:00:47.400> to<00:00:47.820> punch<00:00:48.510> down<00:00:48.810> and<00:00:49.110> so

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
can get in the tank to punch down and so

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.750 
can get in the tank to punch down and so
extract<00:00:49.830> some<00:00:49.980> juice<00:00:50.280> during<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
extract some juice during the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.750 
extract some juice during the
fermentation<00:00:52.190> that<00:00:53.190> will<00:00:53.430> say<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.270> f<00:00:54.710> carbonic

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
fermentation that will say it f carbonic

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.150 
fermentation that will say it f carbonic
because<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:56.940> much<00:00:57.270> juice<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.960> produce<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
because as much juice you produce in the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.240 
because as much juice you produce in the
carbonic<00:00:59.670> maceration<00:00:59.700> as<00:01:00.540> much<00:01:03.799> the<00:01:04.799> dynami

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
carbonic maceration as much the dynami

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.300 
carbonic maceration as much the dynami
of<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.640> dynamic<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:07.070> process<00:01:08.070> is

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
of the dynamic of the process is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.220 
of the dynamic of the process is
different<00:01:08.610> where<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.930> are<00:01:10.110> very<00:01:10.409> few<00:01:10.680> choose

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
different where you are very few choose

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.670 
different where you are very few choose
I<00:01:13.230> don't<00:01:14.130> know<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.490> difficult<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.120> talk<00:01:15.870> like

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
I don't know it's difficult to talk like

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.670 
I don't know it's difficult to talk like
that<00:01:16.710> about<00:01:17.190> carbonic<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.780> something<00:01:19.500> you

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that about carbonic it's something you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.310 
that about carbonic it's something you
have<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.860> see<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.390> full<00:01:21.720> grapes<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
have to see because it's full grapes and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.060 
have to see because it's full grapes and
you<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.590> few<00:01:22.890> Jews<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:24.570> don't<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.770> much

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you have few Jews you don't do that much

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.190 
you have few Jews you don't do that much
of<00:01:26.960> taking<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.140> juices<00:01:29.570> from<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.750> bottom<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
of taking the juices from the bottom to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.070 
of taking the juices from the bottom to
the<00:01:31.229> top<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.830> you<00:01:32.159> don't<00:01:32.190> do<00:01:32.550> that<00:01:32.850> naturally

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
the top so you don't do that naturally

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.660 
the top so you don't do that naturally
it's<00:01:34.080> something<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.710> best<00:01:34.920> way<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.280> when<00:01:35.549> you

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
it's something the best way is when you

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.969 
it's something the best way is when you
don't<00:01:35.940> have<00:01:36.120> to<00:01:36.299> do<00:01:36.390> anything<00:01:36.690> so<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.710> grapes

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
don't have to do anything so the grapes

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.060 
don't have to do anything so the grapes
just<00:01:38.520> fermented<00:01:39.299> became<00:01:39.990> wine<00:01:40.260> like<00:01:40.620> and<00:01:40.920> you

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
just fermented became wine like and you

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.399 
just fermented became wine like and you
don't<00:01:41.310> do<00:01:41.909> any<00:01:42.150> intervention<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:43.080> compared

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
don't do any intervention it's compared

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.670 
don't do any intervention it's compared
to<00:01:43.590> explain<00:01:44.090> quiet<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.479> fermentation<00:01:46.260> is

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
to explain quiet the fermentation is

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.700 
to explain quiet the fermentation is
regular<00:01:47.130> everyday<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:48.210> Marcella<00:01:49.170> PR<00:01:49.440> will

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
regular everyday as Marcella PR will

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.100 
regular everyday as Marcella PR will
always<00:01:50.100> say<00:01:50.369> we've<00:01:51.240> done<00:01:51.330> everything<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.990> the

vineyard we don't didn't we don't do

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.390 
vineyard we don't didn't we don't do
anything<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.020> Syrah<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.890> less<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.220> do<00:01:56.369> the

anything to Syrah the less you do the

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.190 
anything to Syrah the less you do the
better

so the purchasing products its we

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.440 
so the purchasing products its we
decided<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.640> press<00:02:02.530> when<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:04.220> density<00:02:04.430> is<00:02:05.119> at

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
decided to press when the density is at

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.990 
decided to press when the density is at
the<00:02:05.600> level<00:02:05.869> we<00:02:06.080> expected<00:02:06.560> but<00:02:06.979> mostly<00:02:07.430> when

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
the level we expected but mostly when

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.500 
the level we expected but mostly when
the<00:02:08.509> color<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.709> third<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.970> same<00:02:11.000> as<00:02:11.480> a

the color of the third is the same as a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.000 
the color of the third is the same as a
