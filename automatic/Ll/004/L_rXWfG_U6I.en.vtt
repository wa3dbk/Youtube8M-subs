been<00:03:40.489> wanting<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.360> get<00:03:41.690> in<00:03:41.959> on<00:03:42.520> not<00:03:43.520> seven

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
been wanting to get in on not seven

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.060 
been wanting to get in on not seven
eight<00:03:44.060> nine<00:03:44.090> but<00:03:44.780> yeah<00:03:45.470> spin<00:03:45.890> up<00:03:46.040> the

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
eight nine but yeah spin up the

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.830 
eight nine but yeah spin up the
spin-offs<00:03:46.610> because<00:03:46.940> obviously<00:03:47.150> he<00:03:47.450> has<00:03:47.810> a

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
spin-offs because obviously he has a

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.229 
spin-offs because obviously he has a
very<00:03:48.200> similar<00:03:48.410> style<00:03:49.040> he<00:03:49.280> would<00:03:49.430> not<00:03:49.730> fit<00:03:50.090> in

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
very similar style he would not fit in

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.729 
very similar style he would not fit in
with<00:03:50.510> seven<00:03:50.840> eight<00:03:51.050> nine<00:03:51.080> where<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:51.530> have<00:03:51.650> to

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
with seven eight nine where you have to

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.949 
with seven eight nine where you have to
be<00:03:51.860> a<00:03:51.890> little<00:03:52.160> bit<00:03:52.310> more<00:03:52.459> restrained<00:03:52.970> doesn't

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
be a little bit more restrained doesn't

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.210 
be a little bit more restrained doesn't
follow<00:03:54.110> some<00:03:54.350> sort<00:03:54.530> of<00:03:54.560> like<00:03:54.739> pattern<00:03:55.070> with

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
follow some sort of like pattern with

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.890 
follow some sort of like pattern with
you<00:03:55.340> haha<00:03:55.550> yeah<00:03:55.970> feat<00:03:56.300> doesn't<00:03:56.450> do<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:56.750> it

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
you haha yeah feat doesn't do that it

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.140 
you haha yeah feat doesn't do that it
operates<00:03:56.989> but<00:03:57.800> for<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.130> spin-offs<00:03:58.640> it's<00:03:58.940> like

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
operates but for the spin-offs it's like

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.990 
operates but for the spin-offs it's like
anything<00:03:59.480> goes<00:04:00.020> um<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:01.100> so<00:04:01.310> I<00:04:01.340> think<00:04:01.430> maybe

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
anything goes um and so I think maybe

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.840 
anything goes um and so I think maybe
this<00:04:02.209> is<00:04:02.420> his<00:04:02.660> way<00:04:02.690> of<00:04:02.959> like<00:04:03.489> announcing<00:04:04.489> his

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
this is his way of like announcing his

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.479 
this is his way of like announcing his
sort<00:04:05.540> of<00:04:05.630> interest<00:04:06.140> at<00:04:06.400> building<00:04:07.400> a

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
translate but and center punch was kind

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.640 
translate but and center punch was kind
of<00:04:51.150> fun<00:04:51.450> but<00:04:51.690> like<00:04:51.870> obviously<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.320> stupid

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
of fun but like obviously the stupid

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.500 
of fun but like obviously the stupid
movie<00:04:52.890> but<00:04:53.070> like<00:04:53.220> it<00:04:53.400> just<00:04:53.610> is<00:04:53.940> like<00:04:54.120> at<00:04:54.390> least

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
movie but like it just is like at least

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.150 
movie but like it just is like at least
that<00:04:54.690> sure<00:04:54.810> is<00:04:54.930> creativity<00:04:55.350> so<00:04:55.800> if<00:04:55.920> he<00:04:56.010> has<00:04:56.040> a

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
that sure is creativity so if he has a

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.650 
that sure is creativity so if he has a
star<00:04:56.640> wars<00:04:56.790> universe<00:04:56.880> /<00:04:57.300> where<00:04:57.450> they<00:04:57.540> can

thought<00:05:45.330> I'd<00:05:45.450> is<00:05:45.660> like<00:05:45.900> very<00:05:46.200> Zack<00:05:46.710> Snyder

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
thought I'd is like very Zack Snyder

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.860 
thought I'd is like very Zack Snyder
esque<00:05:47.280> like<00:05:47.550> filters<00:05:47.940> on<00:05:48.090> everything<00:05:48.480> but<00:05:48.750> you

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
esque like filters on everything but you

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.660 
esque like filters on everything but you
know<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.200> was<00:05:49.290> thought<00:05:49.470> it<00:05:49.620> was<00:05:49.740> good<00:05:49.920> so<00:05:50.310> I

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
know it was thought it was good so I

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.520 
know it was thought it was good so I
think<00:05:50.910> if<00:05:51.240> he<00:05:51.360> had<00:05:51.390> his<00:05:51.690> hands<00:05:52.110> at<00:05:52.230> one<00:05:52.440> of

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
think if he had his hands at one of

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.230 
think if he had his hands at one of
these<00:05:52.620> like<00:05:52.860> sort<00:05:53.070> of<00:05:53.100> Star<00:05:53.340> Wars<00:05:53.370> spin-off<00:05:53.820> it

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
these like sort of Star Wars spin-off it

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.940 
these like sort of Star Wars spin-off it
would<00:05:54.330> it<00:05:54.630> would<00:05:54.660> be<00:05:54.750> stylized<00:05:55.260> I<00:05:55.620> think<00:05:55.890> would

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
would it would be stylized I think would

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.650 
would it would be stylized I think would
be<00:05:56.070> good<00:05:56.100> it<00:05:56.550> was<00:05:56.700> it<00:05:56.820> was<00:05:56.850> not<00:05:57.060> be<00:05:57.240> a<00:05:57.270> great
