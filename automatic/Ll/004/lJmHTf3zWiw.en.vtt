00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
the Queen but not enough I'm going to

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.210 
the Queen but not enough I'm going to
assassinate<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.970> Queen<00:00:06.210> here<00:00:06.710> I've<00:00:07.710> got<00:00:08.010> the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
assassinate the Queen here I've got the

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.360 
assassinate the Queen here I've got the
numerical<00:00:09.059> advantage<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.950> plus<00:00:10.950> it's<00:00:11.160> just

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
numerical advantage and plus it's just

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.060 
numerical advantage and plus it's just
worth<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.820> if<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.179> kill<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.630> Queen<00:00:13.040> you<00:00:14.040> know

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
worth it if you kill the Queen you know

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.840 
worth it if you kill the Queen you know
if<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.690> kill<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.080> Queen<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.830> really<00:00:17.160> set<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
if you kill the Queen you really set the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.630 
if you kill the Queen you really set the
opposing<00:00:18.449> player<00:00:18.690> back<00:00:19.640> economically

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
opposing player back economically

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.519 
opposing player back economically
because<00:00:20.880> they<00:00:21.180> can't<00:00:21.449> get<00:00:21.660> enough<00:00:21.900> larvae<00:00:22.350> out

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
because they can't get enough larvae out

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.250 
because they can't get enough larvae out
and<00:00:23.000> so<00:00:24.000> now<00:00:24.180> I'm<00:00:24.390> feeling<00:00:24.779> very<00:00:24.810> very

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
and so now I'm feeling very very

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.349 
and so now I'm feeling very very
confident<00:00:25.830> because<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.340> upgraded<00:00:26.789> detect<00:00:27.150> too

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
confident because of upgraded detect too

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.040 
confident because of upgraded detect too
and<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:28.320> see<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.650> I've<00:00:28.800> done<00:00:28.949> all<00:00:29.220> this

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
and you see that I've done all this

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.659 
and you see that I've done all this
stupidly<00:00:31.050> without<00:00:31.529> building<00:00:32.070> another

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
stupidly without building another

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.910 
stupidly without building another
harvester<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.110> don't<00:00:34.350> know<00:00:34.469> what's<00:00:34.649> going

hydraulics and it's because I didn't

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.869 
hydraulics and it's because I didn't
have<00:02:29.200> them<00:02:29.379> hotkey<00:02:29.799> properly<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.610> I'm<00:02:30.700> going

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
here and I get enough hydrilla south to

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:08.099 
here and I get enough hydrilla south to
repel<00:03:01.629> the<00:03:01.810> attack<00:03:03.510> okay<00:03:05.099> so<00:03:06.450> I've<00:03:07.450> got<00:03:07.659> drones

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.259 
repel the attack okay so I've got drones
working<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.829> because<00:03:09.640> he's<00:03:09.879> made<00:03:10.120> the

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
working and because he's made the

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.470 
working and because he's made the
investment<00:03:10.810> again<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:12.310> know<00:03:12.430> show<00:03:12.790> like<00:03:13.180> I

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
investment again you know show like I

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.240 
investment again you know show like I
just<00:03:13.750> don't<00:03:14.140> see<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.470> economic<00:03:15.010> efficiency

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
just don't see the economic efficiency

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.369 
just don't see the economic efficiency
of<00:03:15.700> going<00:03:16.000> roaches<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:16.629> investing<00:03:17.079> all<00:03:17.230> that

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
of going roaches and investing all that

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.920 
of going roaches and investing all that
money<00:03:17.560> into<00:03:17.709> roaches<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.669> and<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:19.510> being<00:03:19.750> able

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
money into roaches and and to being able

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.699 
money into roaches and and to being able
to<00:03:20.109> you<00:03:20.980> know<00:03:21.450> heal<00:03:22.450> faster<00:03:23.109> when<00:03:23.290> burrowed

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
to you know heal faster when burrowed

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.640 
to you know heal faster when burrowed
and<00:03:23.950> all<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.220> stuff<00:03:24.870> like<00:03:25.870> because<00:03:26.500> they

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
and all this stuff like because they

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.979 
and all this stuff like because they
don't<00:03:26.829> attack<00:03:27.130> air<00:03:27.430> units<00:03:27.849> and<00:03:28.150> especially

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
don't attack air units and especially

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.539 
don't attack air units and especially
with<00:03:29.349> zerg<00:03:29.590> on<00:03:29.799> zerg<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.879> can<00:03:31.120> get<00:03:32.250> muta<00:03:33.250> lists

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
with zerg on zerg you can get muta lists

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.170 
with zerg on zerg you can get muta lists
out<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.150> fast<00:03:34.919> i<00:03:35.919> just<00:03:36.700> don't<00:03:36.879> see<00:03:36.940> the

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
out so fast i just don't see the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.759 
out so fast i just don't see the
advantage<00:03:37.660> of<00:03:37.810> investing<00:03:38.319> all<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:38.620> money

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
advantage of investing all that money

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.440 
advantage of investing all that money
into<00:03:38.950> roaches<00:03:39.459> when<00:03:39.639> they<00:03:39.910> don't<00:03:40.090> have<00:03:40.239> any

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
into roaches when they don't have any

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.009 
into roaches when they don't have any
air<00:03:40.660> abilities<00:03:41.139> ok<00:03:41.950> so<00:03:42.010> as<00:03:42.599> you'll<00:03:43.599> see<00:03:43.810> here

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
air abilities ok so as you'll see here

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.629 
air abilities ok so as you'll see here
i'm<00:03:44.169> going<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.379> use<00:03:44.590> my<00:03:44.620> zerglings<00:03:45.459> as<00:03:45.609> a

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
i'm going to use my zerglings as a

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:51.809 
i'm going to use my zerglings as a
screen<00:03:46.440> for<00:03:47.440> my<00:03:47.650> hydralisk<00:03:49.889> ok<00:03:50.889> and<00:03:51.280> I'm<00:03:51.669> not

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
screen for my hydralisk ok and I'm not

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.869 
screen for my hydralisk ok and I'm not
going<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.000> build<00:03:52.209> any<00:03:52.359> more<00:03:52.569> hydraulics

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
going to build any more hydraulics

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.119 
going to build any more hydraulics
alright<00:03:55.290> I'm<00:03:56.290> actually<00:03:57.010> saving<00:03:57.639> my<00:03:58.569> money<00:03:58.780> as

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
alright I'm actually saving my money as

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.409 
alright I'm actually saving my money as
you<00:04:00.129> can<00:04:00.250> see<00:04:00.370> I'm<00:04:00.549> pausing<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.060> game<00:04:01.090> I'm

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419 
you can see I'm pausing the game I'm

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.740 
you can see I'm pausing the game I'm
saving<00:04:01.810> my<00:04:01.959> money<00:04:02.109> for<00:04:02.440> when<00:04:03.160> my<00:04:03.750> spire

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
saving my money for when my spire

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.189 
saving my money for when my spire
arrives<00:04:05.230> because<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:06.599> just<00:04:07.599> haven't<00:04:07.870> seen<00:04:08.019> any

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199 
arrives because I just haven't seen any

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.199 
arrives because I just haven't seen any
air<00:04:08.470> units<00:04:08.889> or<00:04:09.040> any<00:04:09.190> indication<00:04:09.760> they<00:04:10.000> have

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
air units or any indication they have

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.150 
air units or any indication they have
them<00:04:10.389> and<00:04:10.629> I<00:04:10.750> think<00:04:11.019> that<00:04:11.199> some<00:04:11.500> muta<00:04:11.769> lyst<00:04:11.949> can

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
them and I think that some muta lyst can

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.280 
them and I think that some muta lyst can
be<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.310> knockout<00:04:12.669> punch<00:04:12.940> ok<00:04:13.359> so<00:04:13.959> we'll<00:04:14.109> go<00:04:14.230> ahead

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
be a knockout punch ok so we'll go ahead

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.050 
be a knockout punch ok so we'll go ahead
and<00:04:14.410> watch<00:04:14.590> this<00:04:14.919> I'm<00:04:15.609> going<00:04:15.819> to<00:04:15.910> use<00:04:16.030> my

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
and watch this I'm going to use my

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.089 
and watch this I'm going to use my
zerglings<00:04:16.750> as<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.900> screen<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:17.680> saw<00:04:17.889> me

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
zerglings as a screen and you saw me

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.670 
zerglings as a screen and you saw me
pull<00:04:18.310> them<00:04:18.519> back<00:04:18.699> there<00:04:19.049> when<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.079> was<00:04:20.650> a

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
pull them back there when I was a

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.070 
pull them back there when I was a
superior<00:04:21.400> force<00:04:21.840> you

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
superior force you

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.260 
superior force you
your<00:04:23.229> units<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.830> arrive<00:04:24.129> all<00:04:24.520> together<00:04:24.789> keep

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
your units to arrive all together keep

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
constantly you're building them okay so

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.950 
constantly you're building them okay so
I've<00:05:07.629> got<00:05:07.810> zerglings<00:05:08.229> moving<00:05:08.530> across<00:05:08.710> the<00:05:09.009> map

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.740 

and<00:05:14.340> I'm<00:05:15.340> pretty<00:05:15.610> confident<00:05:16.120> now<00:05:16.300> because

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
and I'm pretty confident now because

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.230 
and I'm pretty confident now because
I've<00:05:16.900> got<00:05:17.080> two<00:05:17.529> upgrades<00:05:18.129> versus<00:05:18.759> their<00:05:19.000> one

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
I've got two upgrades versus their one

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.629 
I've got two upgrades versus their one
and<00:05:19.539> I<00:05:19.960> just<00:05:20.139> annihilate<00:05:20.710> that<00:05:20.740> force<00:05:21.189> with

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
and I just annihilate that force with

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.589 
and I just annihilate that force with
with<00:05:21.909> two<00:05:22.150> upgrades<00:05:22.689> right<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:24.550> I'm<00:05:25.509> just

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
with two upgrades right and I'm just

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.450 
with two upgrades right and I'm just
going<00:05:25.750> to<00:05:25.779> go<00:05:25.930> to<00:05:25.990> town<00:05:26.289> on<00:05:26.319> the<00:05:26.740> drones<00:05:27.039> to

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
going to go to town on the drones to

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.360 
going to go to town on the drones to
stop<00:05:27.729> the<00:05:27.969> production<00:05:28.150> of<00:05:28.539> minerals<00:05:29.190> which<00:05:30.190> is

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
stop the production of minerals which is

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.510 
stop the production of minerals which is
good<00:05:31.440> whenever<00:05:32.440> you<00:05:32.620> can<00:05:32.800> pull<00:05:32.979> drones<00:05:33.279> off

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
good whenever you can pull drones off

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.580 
good whenever you can pull drones off
creating<00:05:33.819> minerals<00:05:34.389> and<00:05:34.690> now<00:05:35.319> i'm<00:05:35.409> going<00:05:35.529> to

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
creating minerals and now i'm going to

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.040 
creating minerals and now i'm going to
go<00:05:35.740> with<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:35.979> five<00:05:36.190> needle<00:05:36.550> escs<00:05:36.879> and<00:05:37.210> this

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
go with the five needle escs and this

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.240 
go with the five needle escs and this
will<00:05:38.229> end<00:05:38.409> up<00:05:38.560> being<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:38.860> knockout<00:05:39.219> punch

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
will end up being the knockout punch

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.360 
will end up being the knockout punch
because<00:05:39.699> aside<00:05:40.120> from<00:05:40.180> two<00:05:40.599> queens<00:05:41.129> the<00:05:42.129> player

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
because aside from two queens the player

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.779 
because aside from two queens the player
doesn't<00:05:42.639> have<00:05:42.909> any<00:05:43.089> anti-air<00:05:44.550> roaches<00:05:45.550> can't

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
doesn't have any anti-air roaches can't

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.409 
doesn't have any anti-air roaches can't
attack<00:05:46.270> air<00:05:46.509> units<00:05:46.930> and<00:05:47.440> so<00:05:47.710> I<00:05:48.300> pretty<00:05:49.300> much

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
attack air units and so I pretty much

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:55.129 
attack air units and so I pretty much
have<00:05:49.719> the<00:05:49.750> advantage<00:05:50.319> on<00:05:50.440> everything<00:05:50.919> now<00:05:53.759> and

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
have the advantage on everything now and

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.579 
have the advantage on everything now and
that's<00:05:56.139> that<00:05:57.029> okay<00:05:58.029> so<00:05:58.599> this<00:05:58.779> is<00:05:59.020> this<00:05:59.349> is<00:05:59.560> a

00:05:59.579 --> 00:05:59.589 
that's that okay so this is this is a

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:03.629 
that's that okay so this is this is a
common<00:06:00.190> strategy<00:06:00.400> that<00:06:00.940> I<00:06:00.969> use<00:06:02.310> against<00:06:03.310> zerg

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 
common strategy that I use against zerg

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.570 
common strategy that I use against zerg
on<00:06:03.940> small<00:06:04.300> maps<00:06:04.599> like<00:06:04.960> steep<00:06:05.469> savour<00:06:05.889> steppes

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
on small maps like steep savour steppes

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.240 
on small maps like steep savour steppes
of<00:06:06.789> war<00:06:07.110> again<00:06:08.110> help<00:06:08.560> me<00:06:08.710> out<00:06:08.860> with<00:06:09.039> that<00:06:09.190> I

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
of war again help me out with that I

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.469 
of war again help me out with that I
don't<00:06:09.520> know<00:06:09.610> how<00:06:09.699> to<00:06:09.789> pronounce<00:06:09.909> that<00:06:10.330> I'm

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
don't know how to pronounce that I'm

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.930 
don't know how to pronounce that I'm
curious<00:06:10.949> I<00:06:11.949> guess<00:06:12.339> I<00:06:12.460> could<00:06:12.610> open<00:06:12.729> a

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
curious I guess I could open a

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.730 
curious I guess I could open a
dictionary<00:06:13.360> but<00:06:13.629> I'd<00:06:14.050> like<00:06:14.229> to<00:06:14.349> hear<00:06:14.500> your

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
dictionary but I'd like to hear your

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.219 
dictionary but I'd like to hear your
opinion<00:06:15.449> but<00:06:16.449> this<00:06:16.599> is<00:06:16.719> a<00:06:16.750> common<00:06:17.080> strategy

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
opinion but this is a common strategy

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.129 
opinion but this is a common strategy
that<00:06:17.650> I<00:06:17.740> use<00:06:17.949> when<00:06:18.310> the<00:06:18.639> Zerg<00:06:18.909> player<00:06:19.330> attempts

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
that I use when the Zerg player attempts

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.760 
that I use when the Zerg player attempts
to<00:06:20.379> spam<00:06:20.860> roaches<00:06:21.490> right<00:06:22.289> just<00:06:23.289> go<00:06:23.469> air

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
to spam roaches right just go air

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.159 
to spam roaches right just go air
because<00:06:24.550> if<00:06:25.449> you<00:06:25.659> can<00:06:25.870> get<00:06:26.080> air<00:06:26.259> out<00:06:26.469> sooner

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
because if you can get air out sooner

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.189 
because if you can get air out sooner
you're<00:06:29.169> going<00:06:29.379> to<00:06:29.440> be<00:06:29.589> well<00:06:30.009> off<00:06:30.250> and<00:06:30.639> again

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
you're going to be well off and again

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.230 
you're going to be well off and again
keep<00:06:32.199> saying<00:06:32.889> control<00:06:33.279> your<00:06:33.490> circlings<00:06:33.969> for

keep saying control your circlings for
God's<00:06:34.389> sakes<00:06:34.750> don't<00:06:35.229> lose<00:06:35.469> control<00:06:35.889> of<00:06:35.919> them

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
God's sakes don't lose control of them

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.909 
God's sakes don't lose control of them
