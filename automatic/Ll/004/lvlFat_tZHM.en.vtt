00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
controller is actually very

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.389 
controller is actually very
straightforward<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.960> simply<00:01:46.290> peel<00:01:46.619> off<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
straightforward you simply peel off the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.999 
straightforward you simply peel off the
sticky<00:01:48.030> back<00:01:48.240> plastic<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.320> back<00:01:49.470> to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
sticky back plastic on the back to

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.450 
sticky back plastic on the back to
reveal<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> adhesive<00:01:51.890> then<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.070> grab<00:01:53.310> your

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
reveal the adhesive then you grab your

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.789 
reveal the adhesive then you grab your
controller<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:55.590> very

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
controller like so and it's very

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.190 
controller like so and it's very
important<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.369> line<00:01:56.729> up<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.240> little<00:01:57.390> gap<00:01:57.719> with

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
important to line up the little gap with

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.800 
important to line up the little gap with
the<00:01:58.229> seam<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.250> controller<00:01:59.780> you<00:02:00.780> can

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
the seam of the controller you can

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.139 
the seam of the controller you can
always<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.530> adjust<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.520> if<00:02:02.729> you

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
always just adjust it like so if you

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.990 
always just adjust it like so if you
don't<00:02:03.360> get<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.630> right<00:02:03.780> very<00:02:04.170> first<00:02:04.380> time

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
don't get it right very first time

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.190 
don't get it right very first time
slowly<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.180> surely<00:02:06.240> place<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.960> onto<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
slowly but surely place it onto the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.139 
slowly but surely place it onto the
controller<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.829> then<00:02:08.190> be<00:02:08.340> sure<00:02:08.580> not<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.030> get

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
controller and then be sure not to get

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.839 
controller and then be sure not to get
any<00:02:09.420> air<00:02:09.660> bubbles<00:02:09.800> into<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> adhesive<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.700> get

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
any air bubbles into the adhesive to get

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.070 
any air bubbles into the adhesive to get
a<00:02:11.879> nice<00:02:12.209> smooth

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
