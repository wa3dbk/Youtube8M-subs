00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.830
 We present a pedometer about the new 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.290
 generations based on unique 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.870
 technology application can simultaneously 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.389
 use gps and accelerometer 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.429
 thanks to this measurement error 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.369
 minimal since special 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.340
 The algorithm combines this hero metro gps 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.810
 in real time 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.750
 the application guarantees high accuracy 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.119
 step distance measurement speed 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.890
 training time is also recorded 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.650
 calculated average speed on 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.600
 route and calories spent 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.450
 your weight 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.329
 grass pedometer remembers your your and 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.800
 displays it on the map and in history 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.540
 accurate calibration available 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.969
 under your individual parameters 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.440
 you can set the length of your step when 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.360
 walking + c and running especially it can 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.210
 useful for areas with him standing signal 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.250
 gps in these places the program will be 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.609
 use on celeron itr parameters 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.489
 whose pedometer can be fine tuned 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.610
 Pro is also the perfect tool for 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.930
 increase motivation 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.390
 you can set yourself goals by 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.369
 distance traveled spent 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.830
 calories or just plan 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.670
 Duration of employment indicator on 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.070
 home screen 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.500
 will show your address and help raise 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.450
 motivation to achieve the set 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.580
 goals 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.409
 besides this application the tracker is included 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.250
 a figure that automatically 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.290
 counts 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.810
 body mass index allows you to fix 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.810
 parameters of your figure and apology 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.159
 can track your status on 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.990
 route and also your pulse for your 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.780
 convenience of the application on the finger and 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.460
 built-in music player 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.530
 complete training history is stored 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.130
 unlimited time and maybe 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.600
 csv format exported 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.069
 built-in support for Facebook twitching 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.929
 twitter or e-mail 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.990
 gives you the opportunity to share your 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.479
 achievements right from the app into one 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.270
 touch start using the app 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.170
 right now and your classes will become more 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.840
 more productive 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.829
 pedometer about measurement accuracy 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.829
 guaranteed
