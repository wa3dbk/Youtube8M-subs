using the accelerometer you can see that

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.009 
using the accelerometer you can see that
it's<00:02:24.670> saying<00:02:24.939> hello<00:02:25.239> now<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.480> can<00:02:25.629> go<00:02:25.689> quicker

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
it's saying hello now you can go quicker

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
read it so another example you know you

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.890 
read it so another example you know you
do<00:02:42.879> multiple<00:02:43.299> colors<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.629> can<00:02:43.719> really

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
do multiple colors you can really

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.199

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.640 
customize the way the message you know
sends<00:02:46.569> out<00:02:46.689> so<00:02:46.840> I'm<00:02:46.900> going<00:02:47.049> to<00:02:47.109> hold<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.409> here

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
sends out so I'm going to hold it here

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
and you know as you see there you can

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.550 
and you know as you see there you can
read<00:02:51.129> it<00:02:51.280> quick<00:02:51.459> enough<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.840> says<00:02:53.079> happy

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
read it quick enough it says happy

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.530

birthday<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:54.220> I'm<00:02:54.280> trying<00:02:54.549> to<00:02:54.730> swing<00:02:55.239> it<00:02:55.359> at<00:02:55.510> a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
birthday so I'm trying to swing it at a

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.129 
birthday so I'm trying to swing it at a
metronome<00:02:56.019> happy<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:57.629> it's<00:02:58.629> really<00:02:58.870> cool<00:02:59.079> how

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
metronome happy and it's really cool how

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.050 
metronome happy and it's really cool how
it<00:02:59.500> takes<00:02:59.650> advantage<00:03:00.099> of<00:03:00.219> the<00:03:00.370> accelerometer

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
it takes advantage of the accelerometer

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.250 
it takes advantage of the accelerometer
in<00:03:01.359> such<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.870> way<00:03:02.370> happy<00:03:03.370> birthday<00:03:04.329> so<00:03:04.719> you<00:03:05.139> know

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
in such a way happy birthday so you know

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.080 
in such a way happy birthday so you know
your<00:03:05.739> hand<00:03:06.219> as<00:03:06.310> multiple<00:03:06.669> words<00:03:06.790> very<00:03:06.969> well

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
your hand as multiple words very well

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.699 
your hand as multiple words very well
and<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.659> can<00:03:07.750> hear<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:08.079> sound<00:03:08.349> you<00:03:08.469> can<00:03:08.530> turn

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
and you can hear that sound you can turn

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.929 
and you can hear that sound you can turn
that<00:03:08.799> off<00:03:08.980> my<00:03:09.359> mask<00:03:10.359> but<00:03:10.540> not<00:03:10.659> least<00:03:10.810> again<00:03:11.409> um

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
that off my mask but not least again um

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.250 
that off my mask but not least again um
you<00:03:12.939> know<00:03:13.030> they'll<00:03:13.359> turn<00:03:13.510> some<00:03:13.659> double-sided

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
you know they'll turn some double-sided

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.309 
you know they'll turn some double-sided
on<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.919> turn<00:03:15.849> off<00:03:15.969> the<00:03:16.000> audio<00:03:16.419> feedback<00:03:16.690> and

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
on it turn off the audio feedback and

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.099 
on it turn off the audio feedback and
i'll<00:03:17.409> turn<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.620> mirror<00:03:17.949> effect<00:03:18.250> on<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.900> way

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
i'll turn the mirror effect on that way

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.689 
i'll turn the mirror effect on that way
when<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.530> do<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.859> now<00:03:21.040> you'll<00:03:21.699> see<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:23.699> the

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
when you do it now you'll see that the

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.460 
when you do it now you'll see that the
double-sided<00:03:25.239> where'd<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.720> cut<00:03:25.870> it's<00:03:26.139> much

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
double-sided where'd it cut it's much

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.740 
double-sided where'd it cut it's much
smaller<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:27.180> smeared<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:28.479> it's<00:03:28.629> actually

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
smaller and smeared so it's actually

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.929 
smaller and smeared so it's actually
backwards<00:03:29.260> so<00:03:29.889> you<00:03:29.979> can<00:03:30.069> change<00:03:30.280> that<00:03:30.430> change

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
backwards so you can change that change

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:36.659 
backwards so you can change that change
mirrored<00:03:31.359> off<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:32.159> hit<00:03:33.159> run<00:03:33.280> again<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:35.669> again

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
mirrored off and hit run again and again

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.119 
mirrored off and hit run again and again
double-sided<00:03:37.299> so<00:03:37.689> you<00:03:38.470> can<00:03:38.560> see<00:03:38.709> that<00:03:38.739> effect

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
double-sided so you can see that effect

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.189 
double-sided so you can see that effect
it<00:03:39.310> is<00:03:39.579> going<00:03:39.819> to<00:03:39.970> buy<00:03:40.060> pretty<00:03:40.329> quick<00:03:40.569> so<00:03:40.840> maybe

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
it is going to buy pretty quick so maybe

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.289 
it is going to buy pretty quick so maybe
i<00:03:41.290> might<00:03:41.470> want<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.799> i<00:03:41.979> might<00:03:42.790> want<00:03:42.939> to<00:03:43.060> do<00:03:43.150> is

i might want to i might want to do is

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.509 
i might want to i might want to do is

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
this one is actually the speed zone much

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.259 
this one is actually the speed zone much
faster<00:04:14.290> so<00:04:14.530> swing<00:04:15.310> it<00:04:15.430> like<00:04:15.459> a<00:04:15.549> metronome<00:04:15.790> as

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
faster so swing it like a metronome as

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.210 
faster so swing it like a metronome as
it<00:04:16.389> says<00:04:16.539> here<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:17.889> kind<00:04:18.039> of<00:04:18.070> like<00:04:18.190> a

it says here so it kind of like a

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.159 
it says here so it kind of like a
pendulum<00:04:18.639> type<00:04:18.970> swing<00:04:19.329> you<00:04:19.509> know<00:04:19.599> left<00:04:19.840> right
