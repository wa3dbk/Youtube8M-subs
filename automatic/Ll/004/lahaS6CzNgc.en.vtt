the benefit of kids I was very

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.609 
the benefit of kids I was very
interested<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.010> idea<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.600> brain

interested in the idea of brain

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.099 
interested in the idea of brain
development<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.890> how<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.369> related<00:00:26.820> to

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
development and how that related to

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.009 
development and how that related to
learning<00:00:28.109> anything<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.189> can<00:00:29.400> do<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:30.019> understand

basic<00:00:35.850> facts<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.600> pretty<00:00:37.469> declarative<00:00:37.980> of

basic facts is pretty declarative of
course<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.520> want<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.850> kids<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.149> understand

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
course we want the kids to understand

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.110 
course we want the kids to understand
the<00:00:40.559> conceptual<00:00:40.950> pieces<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.790> be<00:00:41.910> able<00:00:41.969> to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the conceptual pieces to be able to

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.299 
the conceptual pieces to be able to
deeply<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:42.750> about<00:00:43.020> what's<00:00:43.410> going<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.829> but

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
deeply think about what's going on but

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.619 
deeply think about what's going on but
at<00:00:44.430> some<00:00:44.579> point<00:00:44.610> three<00:00:45.000> times<00:00:45.180> four<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.420> just

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
at some point three times four is just

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.110 
at some point three times four is just
12<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:46.500> because<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.460> know<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
12 just because it is you know the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.580 
12 just because it is you know the
experiment<00:00:48.570> went<00:00:48.780> like<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.260> ended<00:00:49.500> up

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
experiment went like this we ended up

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.439 
experiment went like this we ended up
with<00:00:49.739> ten<00:00:49.950> classrooms<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.610> third<00:00:51.090> graders

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
with ten classrooms of third graders

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.840 
with ten classrooms of third graders
involved<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.739> study<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.219> they<00:00:53.579> would<00:00:53.730> go

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
involved in this study and they would go

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.459 
involved in this study and they would go
through<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.120> normal<00:00:54.210> unit<00:00:54.870> during<00:00:55.230> their

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
through the normal unit during their

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.189 
through the normal unit during their
math<00:00:55.710> class<00:00:56.070> time<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:57.120> within<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.840> believe<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
math class time then within I believe it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.020 
math class time then within I believe it
was<00:00:58.320> 120<00:00:58.829> minutes<00:00:59.219> because<00:00:59.370> that's<00:00:59.609> what<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
was 120 minutes because that's what the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.279 
was 120 minutes because that's what the
the<00:01:00.210> brain<00:01:00.390> rule<00:01:00.600> says<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.989> needs<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.199> be

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the brain rule says it needs to be

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.200 
the brain rule says it needs to be
within<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.559> time<00:01:01.770> frame<00:01:02.010> they<00:01:02.699> would<00:01:02.940> receive

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
within a time frame they would receive

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.350 
within a time frame they would receive
additional<00:01:03.930> instruction<00:01:05.240> revolving<00:01:06.240> around

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
additional instruction revolving around

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.109 
additional instruction revolving around
the<00:01:06.689> basic<00:01:07.080> math<00:01:07.320> facts<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:08.520> learned<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.909> lot<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the basic math facts we learned a lot of

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.120 
the basic math facts we learned a lot of
stuff<00:01:09.420> about<00:01:09.869> how<00:01:10.110> our<00:01:10.260> brains<00:01:10.409> function<00:01:10.770> and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
stuff about how our brains function and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.789 
stuff about how our brains function and
about<00:01:11.340> memory<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:12.000> doing<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.990> study<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.770> was

do a little extra math really will make

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.380 
do a little extra math really will make
a<00:01:41.009> difference<00:01:41.130> for<00:01:41.400> kids<00:01:41.520> when<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.880> comes<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
a difference for kids when it comes to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.969 
a difference for kids when it comes to
you<00:01:42.899> know<00:01:42.990> declarative<00:01:43.500> knowledge<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.950> think

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
you know declarative knowledge I think

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.469 
you know declarative knowledge I think
that's<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.460> powerful<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.270> think

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
that's really powerful and I think

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.539 
that's really powerful and I think
something<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:45.899> brain<00:01:46.649> research<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.340> fact

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
something like brain research the fact

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.090 
something like brain research the fact
that<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.790> was<00:01:48.030> done<00:01:48.390> by<00:01:48.630> researchers<00:01:49.100> will

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
that this was done by researchers will
