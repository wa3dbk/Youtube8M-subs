get something done here it looks like I

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.979 
get something done here it looks like I
mean<00:03:57.610> just<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.849> snag<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.090> few<00:03:58.390> creep<00:03:58.599> kills<00:03:58.840> in

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
that top lane but just no gold income he

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.449 
that top lane but just no gold income he
isn't<00:04:01.930> able<00:04:02.019> to<00:04:02.260> really<00:04:02.470> sustain<00:04:02.650> anything<00:04:03.280> to

isn't able to really sustain anything to
solid<00:04:03.879> at<00:04:03.970> this<00:04:04.150> point<00:04:04.390> he<00:04:04.900> is<00:04:05.019> one<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.230> three

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
solid at this point he is one and three

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.589 
solid at this point he is one and three
only<00:04:05.830> 47<00:04:06.400> creep<00:04:06.640> kills<00:04:06.819> at<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.030> 13<00:04:07.360> minute

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
only 47 creep kills at the 13 minute

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.800 
only 47 creep kills at the 13 minute
mark<00:04:07.810> so<00:04:08.080> he's<00:04:09.069> definitely<00:04:09.280> hurt<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.690> it

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
mark so he's definitely hurt and it

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.509 
mark so he's definitely hurt and it
looks<00:04:10.959> like<00:04:11.050> Bob<00:04:11.860> were<00:04:12.040> just<00:04:12.190> going<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.370> come

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
looks like Bob were just going to come

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.820 
looks like Bob were just going to come
and<00:04:12.640> snag<00:04:12.910> a<00:04:12.940> free<00:04:13.150> kill<00:04:13.450> here<00:04:13.720> or<00:04:14.620> maybe

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
and snag a free kill here or maybe

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.920 
and snag a free kill here or maybe
attempt<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.459> but<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.299> Chronos<00:04:16.630> sleep<00:04:16.780> is<00:04:16.900> the

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
attempt to but the Chronos sleep is the

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.449 
attempt to but the Chronos sleep is the
farther<00:04:17.260> than<00:04:17.380> hers<00:04:17.590> so<00:04:17.739> that's<00:04:18.130> going<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.340> be

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
farther than hers so that's going to be

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.640 
farther than hers so that's going to be
the<00:04:18.579> difference<00:04:18.910> I<00:04:19.060> think<00:04:19.090> anyways<00:04:19.650> just

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
the difference I think anyways just

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.230 
the difference I think anyways just
looking<00:04:20.889> to<00:04:20.950> snag<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:21.190> sneaky<00:04:21.700> arrow<00:04:21.850> here<00:04:22.090> from

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
looking to snag a sneaky arrow here from

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.280 
looking to snag a sneaky arrow here from
the<00:04:22.330> back<00:04:22.540> so<00:04:22.840> he's<00:04:22.960> not<00:04:23.050> going<00:04:23.200> to<00:04:23.229> be

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
the back so he's not going to be

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.010 
the back so he's not going to be
expecting<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:24.510> well<00:04:25.510> when<00:04:25.660> that<00:04:25.780> actually

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
expecting it well when that actually

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.900 
expecting it well when that actually
ends<00:04:26.110> up<00:04:26.200> hitting<00:04:26.410> five<00:04:26.770> seconds<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.430> that's

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
ends up hitting five seconds and that's

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.280 
ends up hitting five seconds and that's
probably<00:04:28.240> going<00:04:28.479> to<00:04:28.540> be<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.720> end<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.930> Chronos

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
probably going to be the end of Chronos

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.650 
probably going to be the end of Chronos
but<00:04:29.500> there's<00:04:29.710> some<00:04:29.860> great<00:04:30.370> rewinds<00:04:31.120> there<00:04:31.300> for

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
but there's some great rewinds there for

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.150 
but there's some great rewinds there for
him<00:04:31.780> it's<00:04:31.960> going<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.139> be<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.740> reason<00:04:33.070> he

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
him it's going to be the reason he

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.430 
him it's going to be the reason he
escapes<00:04:33.520> that<00:04:33.810> but<00:04:34.810> wretched<00:04:35.110> is<00:04:35.169> probably

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
escapes that but wretched is probably

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.020 
escapes that but wretched is probably
going<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.620> be<00:04:35.680> able<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:35.979> cut<00:04:36.100> them<00:04:36.250> off<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.610> don't

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
going to be able to cut them off I don't

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.120 
going to be able to cut them off I don't
know<00:04:37.180> how<00:04:37.620> acronis<00:04:38.620> is<00:04:38.710> going<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:38.889> be<00:04:38.950> able<00:04:39.010> to

yeah<00:05:04.720> but<00:05:04.930> down<00:05:05.080> bottom<00:05:05.439> looks<00:05:05.830> like<00:05:05.979> a<00:05:06.009> curse

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
yeah but down bottom looks like a curse

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.089 
yeah but down bottom looks like a curse
just<00:05:06.490> barely<00:05:06.759> snagging<00:05:07.360> away<00:05:07.539> there<00:05:08.099> from
