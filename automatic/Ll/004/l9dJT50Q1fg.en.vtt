in<00:00:52.239> that<00:00:52.300> record<00:00:52.570> but<00:00:53.079> he<00:00:53.140> actually<00:00:53.260> gets<00:00:53.469> a

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
in that record but he actually gets a

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.770 
in that record but he actually gets a
fair<00:00:53.829> amount<00:00:54.129> of<00:00:54.190> solo<00:00:54.460> time<00:00:54.850> which<00:00:55.570> i<00:00:55.719> think

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
fair amount of solo time which i think

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.590 
fair amount of solo time which i think
is<00:00:56.079> pretty<00:00:56.739> hip<00:00:57.010> so<00:00:57.370> it's<00:00:57.969> a<00:00:58.000> great<00:00:58.180> record<00:00:58.390> to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
is pretty hip so it's a great record to

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.690 
is pretty hip so it's a great record to
check<00:00:58.840> out<00:00:59.050> this<00:00:59.530> lit<00:00:59.829> comes<00:01:00.190> from<00:01:00.489> that

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
check out this lit comes from that

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.260 
check out this lit comes from that
record<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:02.140> basic<00:01:02.739> lick<00:01:03.070> before<00:01:03.520> we<00:01:03.940> kind

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
record the the basic lick before we kind

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.889 
record the the basic lick before we kind
of<00:01:05.310> hip<00:01:06.310> it<00:01:06.460> up<00:01:06.550> a<00:01:06.670> little<00:01:06.789> bit<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.270> just

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
of hip it up a little bit is just

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.529 
of hip it up a little bit is just
alternating<00:01:08.710> triplets<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:10.330> fairly

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
alternating triplets it's a fairly

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.340 
alternating triplets it's a fairly
common<00:01:10.899> pattern<00:01:11.470> and<00:01:12.100> it<00:01:12.250> goes<00:01:12.399> like<00:01:12.490> this<00:01:12.789> 1<00:01:13.240> 2

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
common pattern and it goes like this 1 2

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:23.399 
common pattern and it goes like this 1 2
3<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.860> it's<00:01:21.010> all<00:01:21.189> alternating<00:01:21.970> that<00:01:22.840> your

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
3 so it's all alternating that your

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.350 
3 so it's all alternating that your
right<00:01:23.680> is<00:01:23.860> going<00:01:24.010> to<00:01:24.070> start<00:01:24.369> on<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.880> end<00:01:25.060> of

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
right is going to start on the end of

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.450 
right is going to start on the end of
one<00:01:25.570> it<00:01:26.409> is<00:01:26.650> either<00:01:26.770> gonna<00:01:27.040> start<00:01:27.189> at<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.310> end

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
one it is either gonna start at the end

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.399 
one it is either gonna start at the end
of<00:01:27.640> one<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.150> then<00:01:28.360> your<00:01:28.510> left<00:01:28.720> will<00:01:28.960> start<00:01:29.320> on

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
of one and then your left will start on

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.649 
of one and then your left will start on
the<00:01:29.439> end<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:29.860> three<00:01:30.130> so<00:01:30.759> it's<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.150> beat<00:01:31.390> lick

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
the end of three so it's a to beat lick

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.810 
the end of three so it's a to beat lick
you<00:01:32.500> can<00:01:32.619> also<00:01:32.710> flip<00:01:33.070> it<00:01:33.220> around<00:01:33.310> so<00:01:33.610> this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
you can also flip it around so this

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.240 
you can also flip it around so this
starts<00:01:34.150> on<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.420> end<00:01:34.659> of<00:01:34.900> four<00:01:35.259> and<00:01:35.530> this

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
starts on the end of four and this

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.850 
starts on the end of four and this
starts<00:01:36.610> on<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.090> end<00:01:37.270> of<00:01:37.450> two<00:01:37.659> I'll<00:01:38.409> play<00:01:38.650> it<00:01:38.770> on

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
starts on the end of two I'll play it on

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:47.030 
starts on the end of two I'll play it on
the<00:01:38.979> end<00:01:39.159> of<00:01:39.280> one<00:01:39.520> on<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.759> end<00:01:39.909> of<00:01:40.060> 3<00:01:40.270> 1

the way Karine plays them is remember we
talked<00:02:37.269> about<00:02:37.330> how<00:02:37.510> important<00:02:37.870> those

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
talked about how important those

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.289 
talked about how important those
accented<00:02:38.680> notes<00:02:38.709> are<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.640> accented<00:02:40.239> notes

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
accented notes are the accented notes

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.920 
accented notes are the accented notes
stay<00:02:41.110> single<00:02:41.799> stroke<00:02:42.100> accents<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.690> two

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
stay single stroke accents the two

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.470 
stay single stroke accents the two
triplets<00:02:44.560> in<00:02:44.739> between<00:02:45.280> which<00:02:46.150> are<00:02:46.330> two

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
triplets in between which are two

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.000 
triplets in between which are two
strokes<00:02:46.900> we're<00:02:47.290> going<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.560> we're<00:02:47.830> going<00:02:47.950> to

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
strokes we're going to we're going to

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.330 
strokes we're going to we're going to
double<00:02:48.340> both<00:02:48.730> of<00:02:48.910> those<00:02:49.030> strokes<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:51.280> I

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
double both of those strokes so I

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.920 
double both of those strokes so I
suppose<00:02:52.140> it's

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.930 

slow<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.080> down<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.680> then<00:02:59.040> we<00:02:59.130> reverse<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.490> as

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
slow it down and then we reverse that as

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:09.650 
slow it down and then we reverse that as
opposed<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:08.880> obviously<00:03:09.150> move<00:03:09.420> those

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
opposed to you can obviously move those

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.710 
opposed to you can obviously move those
around<00:03:10.400> once<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.550> gets<00:03:11.730> comfortable<00:03:12.000> you

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
around once that gets comfortable you

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.180 
around once that gets comfortable you
could<00:03:12.870> also<00:03:13.020> actually<00:03:13.320> just<00:03:13.680> repeat<00:03:14.040> the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
could also actually just repeat the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.790 
could also actually just repeat the
pattern<00:03:14.400> all<00:03:14.880> rights<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:15.960> right<00:03:16.260> left<00:03:16.680> right

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
pattern all rights so right left right

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.010 
pattern all rights so right left right
would<00:03:17.220> be<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.460> accent<00:03:17.850> pattern<00:03:18.270> and<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.780> keep

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
would be the accent pattern and you keep

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.750 
would be the accent pattern and you keep
going<00:03:19.200> right<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.740> left<00:03:19.920> right<00:03:20.130> right<00:03:20.340> left

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
going right and left right right left

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.820 
going right and left right right left
right<00:03:21.060> right<00:03:21.360> right<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:22.260> can<00:03:22.410> kind<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.650> move

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
right right right you can kind of move

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.640 
right right right you can kind of move
it<00:03:22.950> around<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.280> drums<00:03:24.140> just<00:03:25.140> with<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.410> same

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
it around the drums just with the same

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.240 
it around the drums just with the same
sticking<00:03:29.540> like<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.800> however<00:03:31.800> fast<00:03:32.070> the

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
sticking like that however fast the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.710 
sticking like that however fast the
finger<00:03:32.490> works<00:03:32.700> well<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.060> alternate<00:03:33.480> right

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
finger works well to alternate right

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.690 
finger works well to alternate right
left<00:03:34.050> right<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.470> then<00:03:34.590> left<00:03:34.710> right<00:03:35.160> left

try<00:03:36.210> both<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.630> those<00:03:36.750> patterns<00:03:37.340> at<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.520> fast

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
try both of those patterns at a fast

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.330 
try both of those patterns at a fast
tempo<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:40.110> take<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.530> doubles<00:03:40.890> out<00:03:41.070> it

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
tempo you can take the doubles out it

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.340 
tempo you can take the doubles out it
works<00:03:41.670> really<00:03:41.970> well<00:03:42.120> just<00:03:42.570> with<00:03:43.050> that<00:03:43.080> little

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
works really well just with that little

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.440 
works really well just with that little
alternating<00:03:44.070> triplet<00:03:44.490> pattern<00:03:44.910> at<00:03:45.210> an

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
alternating triplet pattern at an

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.240 
alternating triplet pattern at an
up-tempo<00:03:45.780> but<00:03:46.470> if<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.650> gets<00:03:46.800> kind<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.070> that

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
up-tempo but if it gets kind of that

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.370 
up-tempo but if it gets kind of that
medium<00:03:47.730> area<00:03:47.970> it's<00:03:48.450> nice<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.960> add<00:03:49.110> a<00:03:49.140> little

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
medium area it's nice to add a little

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.130 
medium area it's nice to add a little
something<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.310> by<00:03:50.760> doubling<00:03:51.630> those<00:03:51.900> on

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
something to it by doubling those on

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.160 
something to it by doubling those on
accent<00:03:52.740> a<00:03:52.800> triplet<00:03:53.190> notes<00:03:53.400> in<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.670> middle

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
accent a triplet notes in the middle

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.780 
accent a triplet notes in the middle
it's<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.290> hip<00:03:55.650> flick<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:56.100> think<00:03:56.340> it's<00:03:56.430> relatively

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
it's a hip flick I think it's relatively

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.140 
it's a hip flick I think it's relatively
easy<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.270> play<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:58.280> has<00:03:59.280> actually<00:03:59.490> quite<00:04:00.120> a

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
easy to play and has actually quite a

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.790 
easy to play and has actually quite a
few<00:04:00.360> applications<00:04:00.480> at<00:04:01.350> a<00:04:01.380> bunch<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.740> different

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
few applications at a bunch of different

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.490 
few applications at a bunch of different
tempo<00:04:02.430> ranges<00:04:02.850> so<00:04:03.090> hope<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.720> enjoy<00:04:04.020> that<00:04:04.260> go

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
tempo ranges so hope you enjoy that go
