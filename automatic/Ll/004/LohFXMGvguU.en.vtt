00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
here which is lit up because my room is

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.469 
here which is lit up because my room is
really<00:05:57.560> dark<00:05:57.919> and<00:05:58.219> without<00:05:59.000> the<00:05:59.149> studio

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479

really dark and without the studio
lights<00:05:59.719> my<00:05:59.930> room<00:06:00.110> would<00:06:00.229> be<00:06:00.289> pitch<00:06:00.620> dark
