00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello I am santiago boots without birds and 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.770
 I'm in a building in the neighborhood of 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.590
 almagro where we put a network 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.880
 twisted knotted polyethylene 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.810
 translucent with 5 x 5 rhombuses 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.050
 centimeters 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.930
 this network resists approximately 15 years 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.480
 out in the open and well this is just 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.910
 installation that is behind me was 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.400
 made two years ago 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.400
 and this building has a total of 6 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.190
 wells of air and light the client was very 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.710
 consistent with the results and we 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.760
 hired a new well they do not do all 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.430
 the wells at the same time for a 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.610
 Budget question is a building 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.610
 that has a very low budget and does not 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.280
 they may be doing it but well here 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.490
 is the network that was finished a while ago 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.160
 no more 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.730
 and in the same network same characteristics 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:03.490
 and good is placed horizontally 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:07.580
 and forming a roof but is also 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.170
 vertical to completely cover the well 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.130

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.890

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.610
 it's a job 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.950
 seven stories high 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.800
 horizontal network being as 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.600
 we show and the network that already appears in 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.600
