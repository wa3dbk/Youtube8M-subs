let's get them up three two one go so
you<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.520> each<00:00:50.730> device<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.210> loading

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you can see that each device is loading

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.049 
you can see that each device is loading
right<00:00:51.750> now<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:54.289> I<00:00:55.289> bet<00:00:55.920> four<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> fastest

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
right now and I bet four is the fastest

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.590 
right now and I bet four is the fastest
one<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.570> by<00:00:57.750> iPhone<00:00:58.109> 5<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.710> all<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.219> others

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
one for by iPhone 5 and all the others

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.810 
one for by iPhone 5 and all the others
only<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.899> iPad<00:01:01.289> first<00:01:01.770> generation<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.520> taking

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
only the iPad first generation is taking

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.160 
only the iPad first generation is taking
its<00:01:03.149> time<00:01:03.890> it's<00:01:05.360> taking<00:01:06.360> considerably<00:01:06.900> long

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
its time it's taking considerably long

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.120 
its time it's taking considerably long
but<00:01:07.710> let's<00:01:08.070> understandable<00:01:08.850> given<00:01:08.970> their

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
but let's understandable given their

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.260 
but let's understandable given their
given<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.450> first<00:01:12.450> generation<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.320> yeah<00:01:14.270> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
given the first generation of it yeah so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.550 
given the first generation of it yeah so
the<00:01:15.659> next<00:01:15.869> app<00:01:17.750> will<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.780> overkill<00:01:20.780> three<00:01:21.780> two

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the next app will be overkill three two

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.109 
the next app will be overkill three two
one<00:01:23.490> go<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:25.799> loading<00:01:26.070> time<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.430> quite<00:01:26.700> much

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
one go the loading time is quite much

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.890 
one go the loading time is quite much
shorter<00:01:30.110> yeah<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.310> last<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.869> will<00:01:33.869> be

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
shorter yeah and the last one will be

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.600 
shorter yeah and the last one will be
Google<00:01:34.320> Earth<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.860> will<00:01:35.220> see<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
Google Earth and you will see the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.289 
Google Earth and you will see the
smoothness<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.420> animation<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:38.299> three

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
smoothness of the animation and three

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:48.029 
smoothness of the animation and three
two<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.829> go

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.800 

again<00:01:49.039> I<00:01:49.340> thought<00:01:49.969> first<00:01:50.240> generation

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
again I thought first generation

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.230 
again I thought first generation
speaking<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:51.649> time<00:01:51.920> but<00:01:52.280> here<00:01:52.520> we<00:01:52.640> go<00:01:52.670> you

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
speaking it's time but here we go you

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.120 
speaking it's time but here we go you
can<00:01:53.299> see<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.600> animation<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.259> not<00:01:54.289> that<00:01:54.770> smooth

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
can see the animation is not that smooth

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.810 
can see the animation is not that smooth
and<00:01:57.070> that<00:01:58.070> will<00:01:58.219> be<00:01:58.310> all

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
and that will be all

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.789 
and that will be all
so<00:01:59.030> you<00:01:59.090> can<00:01:59.479> see<00:01:59.689> we<00:01:59.810> have<00:01:59.929> these<00:02:00.110> devices<00:02:00.289> if

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
so you can see we have these devices if

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.510 
so you can see we have these devices if
you<00:02:00.979> want<00:02:01.159> any<00:02:01.340> test<00:02:01.869> down<00:02:02.869> them<00:02:03.289> just<00:02:03.710> comment

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
you want any test down them just comment

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.760 
you want any test down them just comment
tell<00:02:05.450> us<00:02:05.479> what<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.840> do<00:02:05.960> with<00:02:06.140> them<00:02:06.289> and<00:02:06.530> we<00:02:06.710> will

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
tell us what to do with them and we will

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.790 
tell us what to do with them and we will
do<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.130> so<00:02:07.909> thanks<00:02:08.509> for<00:02:08.599> watching<00:02:08.739> have<00:02:09.739> a
