00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.990
 following the crisis of 2009 many of 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.030
 the big business schools 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.920
 especially the top business school 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.160
 of the world like harvard wharton it 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.130
 they questioned the result of their 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.050
 programs that I had generated admitted 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.489
 who were very trained in issues of 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.430
 management that all the 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.779
 seemingly developed competencies 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.460
 among our acquisition of 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.649
 knowledge and that fit both 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.470
 when they come or when they have 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.329
 differentiate their companies had done 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.280
 adequately but always 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:45.390
 orienting and only results 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:47.670
 financial being that process of 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.589
 learning there had been some failure 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.149
 that had effectively formed very 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.440
 good as decisions but 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.269
 encouraged results only 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.730
 financial but they had neglected 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.469
 other aspects of managing their 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.089
 organizations as they were for example 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.320
 social results with the impact 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.920
 social activity 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.929
 develop 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.400
 as with the environmental impact of 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:08.310
 activities that has developed social 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.720
 topics that were not generally considered 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.030
 as important or as impact 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:18.990
 within the curricular averages in that 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:20.670
 moment when they are in a competition 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.799
 developed from knowledge but 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.869
 also develop the skill and 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.289
 also develop the attitude what is 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.869
 know as knowing the doing and being 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.119
 it's a lot of focus is focused 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.830
 in knowing they know the subjects very well 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.869
 they know the courses very well 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.569
 part hard but you forget your 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.190
 Soft or soft skills that have 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.110
 what to do with how is it that you relate 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.049
 how to manage what is ethical 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.539
 which is what is unethical or if they brought 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.970
 a law or if I do not respect it then 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.950
 many times we say good no matter 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.380
 the means counting to arrive at the end do not enter 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.270
 yes, but this should not be the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.270
 philosophy of a well-formed businessman 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.840
 it is difficult that in a program of 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:11.000
 postgraduate lasts maximum 24 months you can 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.950
 train a professional because the day 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.540
 comes with a wagon from the University of 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.940
 your professional experience since your 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.310
 childhood probably but if there is a 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.660
 commitment in the schools of or should 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.220
 exist with professions improvement of 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.209
 business of 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.010
 Strive as much as you can in 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.330
 develop over all this part of the 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.620
 do and being within a student and 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.129
 Well, you just have to develop 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.129
 within a course
