that's<00:02:11.550> pretty<00:02:11.760> cool<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.180> don't<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.569> um<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:15.209> so

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
that's pretty cool I don't know um so so

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.640 
that's pretty cool I don't know um so so
you<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:16.980> make<00:02:17.790> your<00:02:17.940> way<00:02:18.030> over<00:02:18.060> here<00:02:18.650> this

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
you so you make your way over here this

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.870 
you so you make your way over here this
is<00:02:19.830> quicksand<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.459> it's<00:02:20.550> going<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.730> make<00:02:20.790> you

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
is quicksand so it's going to make you

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.780 
is quicksand so it's going to make you
go<00:02:20.970> slower<00:02:21.330> um<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:23.220> yeah<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.340> get<00:02:23.490> over<00:02:23.610> here

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
go slower um so yeah I get over here

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.150 
go slower um so yeah I get over here
then<00:02:24.110> basically<00:02:25.110> two<00:02:25.500> people<00:02:25.770> cover<00:02:25.950> this

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
then basically two people cover this

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.720 
then basically two people cover this
side<00:02:27.500> do<00:02:28.500> people<00:02:28.739> cover<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.069> side<00:02:29.220> zombies

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
side do people cover this side zombies

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.660 
side do people cover this side zombies
will<00:02:29.849> spawn<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.330> from<00:02:31.020> right<00:02:31.500> here<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.160> up

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
will spawn in from right here and up

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.050 
will spawn in from right here and up
here<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.150> then<00:02:33.840> two<00:02:34.140> people<00:02:34.440> cover<00:02:34.650> down<00:02:35.459> two

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
here and then two people cover down two

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.000 
here and then two people cover down two
people<00:02:36.180> cover<00:02:36.450> down<00:02:36.690> here<00:02:36.720> from<00:02:37.620> over<00:02:37.860> there

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
people cover down here from over there

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.850 
people cover down here from over there
and<00:02:38.280> right<00:02:38.760> here<00:02:39.319> so<00:02:40.319> that's<00:02:40.530> basically<00:02:40.620> our

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
strat so apparently this guy we're

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.810 
strat so apparently this guy we're
playing<00:04:07.100> with<00:04:07.250> it's<00:04:07.340> got<00:04:07.490> it<00:04:07.580> working<00:04:07.790> like

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
playing with it's got it working like

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.230 
playing with it's got it working like
four<00:04:08.120> hours<00:04:08.150> which<00:04:08.570> that's<00:04:08.750> for<00:04:08.960> him<00:04:10.210> so<00:04:11.210> I
