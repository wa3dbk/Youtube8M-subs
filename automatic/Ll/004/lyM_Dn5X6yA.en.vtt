yes that would be a great experience so

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.750 
yes that would be a great experience so
why<00:01:45.550> why<00:01:45.970> I<00:01:46.740> think<00:01:47.740> it's<00:01:47.920> really<00:01:48.130> important

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
why why I think it's really important

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.240 
why why I think it's really important
that<00:01:48.820> urban<00:01:49.420> students<00:01:50.320> understand<00:01:50.980> about

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
that urban students understand about

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.690 
that urban students understand about
farms<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.230> where<00:01:53.230> food<00:01:53.530> comes<00:01:53.560> from<00:01:54.070> I<00:01:54.430> think

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
farms and where food comes from I think

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.640 
farms and where food comes from I think
sometimes<00:01:55.090> what<00:01:55.420> happens<00:01:55.450> in<00:01:56.050> urban

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
sometimes what happens in urban

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.350 
sometimes what happens in urban
environments<00:01:56.790> at<00:01:57.790> least<00:01:57.940> from<00:01:58.060> what<00:01:58.240> the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
environments at least from what the

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.910 
environments at least from what the
children<00:01:58.570> have<00:01:58.840> told<00:01:59.080> me<00:01:59.229> during<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.560> last<00:01:59.770> 30

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
children have told me during the last 30

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.980 
children have told me during the last 30
years<00:02:00.100> or<00:02:00.430> so<00:02:00.610> is<00:02:00.880> that<00:02:01.510> most<00:02:01.690> of<00:02:01.840> their

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
years or so is that most of their

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.870

experience the animals is aligned with
many<00:02:25.690> of<00:02:25.840> our<00:02:25.990> classrooms<00:02:26.710> that<00:02:26.950> have<00:02:27.220> done

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
many of our classrooms that have done

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.300 
many of our classrooms that have done
nutrition<00:02:28.240> units<00:02:28.800> particularly<00:02:29.800> at<00:02:29.920> second

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
nutrition units particularly at second

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.780 
nutrition units particularly at second
and<00:02:30.400> third<00:02:30.550> grade<00:02:32.130> now<00:02:33.130> they<00:02:33.310> get<00:02:33.460> to<00:02:33.490> look<00:02:33.700> at

and third grade now they get to look at

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.910 
and third grade now they get to look at
the<00:02:33.940> triangle<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.780> see<00:02:34.990> how<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.290> applies<00:02:35.620> in

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
the triangle and see how it applies in

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.030 
the triangle and see how it applies in
real<00:02:36.100> real<00:02:36.990> life<00:02:37.990> and<00:02:38.350> one<00:02:38.770> of<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.920> things

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
real real life and one of the things

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.530 
real real life and one of the things
that<00:02:39.130> we<00:02:39.280> try<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:39.580> do<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:39.880> why<00:02:39.970> we're<00:02:40.150> outside

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
that we try to do and why we're outside

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.900 
that we try to do and why we're outside
so<00:02:40.780> much<00:02:40.960> is<00:02:41.170> because<00:02:41.530> we<00:02:41.950> try<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.190> apply<00:02:42.520> math

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
so much is because we try to apply math

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.900 
so much is because we try to apply math
and<00:02:43.210> reading<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.950> science<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.430> we<00:02:45.490> learn<00:02:45.700> in

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
and reading and science that we learn in

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.610
