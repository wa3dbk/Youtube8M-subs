00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.699
 left the conveyor machine which 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.920
 personified the whole era of samara 2 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.480
 or more simply nine here are two words 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.130
 Good about this car at the same time 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.469

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.280

 on the family of cars vaz was born in 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.230
 1984 when in Togliatti with the support 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.530
 porsche specialists were made vaz 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.539

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.710
 named nugget lasted on 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.390
 the longest conveyor is that for not 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.489
 spoiled by the Soviet car enthusiast 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.260
 this car was personified 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.780
 all the most progressive 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.949
 even if you want this particular module 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.989
 the car gave a push 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.750
 motor racing from the birth of such a thing 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.119
 how tuning yes what's there in the early 90 group 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.060
 the combination even wrote a song about how 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.210
 a young guy bought a VAZ 2109 and lost interest 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.210
 to his 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.159
 totally vaz cars of course 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.289
 produced more than any cars but 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.799
 here we are on the first street in 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.700
 Moscow 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:34.100
 kia honda mazda was ford mazda again 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.229
 Sharply so that you are on the nine yet 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.539
 rather than such an endangered species 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.990
 but I do not despair for sure we will find Ilyenko 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.609
 me so audio is ready but it's a car 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.039
 came out so successful that in our country 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:47.539
 she practically does not need advertising 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.670
 what is the porridge of western europe 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.470
 because the bourgeois senate was to explain what 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:02:03.140
 lada samara is better than local wine 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:06.469
 opel contributed to the hero to have tion of 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.569
 nines introduced and our magazine in 1989 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.360
 crew durules cypher on nine of 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.310
 Moscow to Lisbon flew 45 hours 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.239
 almost a world record we will return to ours 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.560
 days again equestrian god and where are the beds 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.670
 renault 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.090
 o dodge the car does not set correctly 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.049
 nine Samara well, two trimmed sidebars 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.049
 follow me 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.790
 here it is but true Samara 2 late 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.660
 option but differed on the very Ardvi 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.330
 to a large extent 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.730
 from nine well how do you see the shape of the body 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.190
 almost such but the main difference here 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.290
 which wing see he opened for you on 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.330
 mine long native 9 was first 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.400
 the wing is short and you know some pathetic 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.590
 disputes were in those days there was no such 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.510
 understand how restyled but people Jerome 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.420
 discussed than briefly wing and nine 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.180
 better or worse than wing length and so 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.690
 feed the car that from the nines that in 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.430
 Samara 2 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.260
 it's almost identical to the story here 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.420
 these beautiful lights here it all remains 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.400
 Well, except that a little form of the rear 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.019
 The bumper was changed to surprise anyone 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.510
 more so modest without this 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.069
 beautiful saying but that's great 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.220
 beauty wing appeared later 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.630
 At first it was established production 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.030
 every possible cooperative on all 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.280
 space then soviet union 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.709
 later cis could see which 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.459
 anywhere in the size and styles and colors 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.310
 also 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.160
 later a good thought came to mind from 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.610
 it chanmy they have done here is just a 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.859
 small 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.540
 rear wing did not release it standard 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.910
 straight from the factory another visit 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.890
 car card and certainly deaf 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.320
 toning is of course people people themselves 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.170
 without any intervention car factory well 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.760
 find a car in Soviet times nine 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.489
 so she did not have toned back 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.950
 the glass was almost impossible but here 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.870
 Well there is the same dashboard low 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.760
 panel and high panel could be up 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.440
 wheeze and to mac a fight than one is better 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.019
 another low panel was somehow 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.280
 ugly and daughter-in-law of the subway and the magicians he was 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.739
 the very bottom where the switch boxes 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.019
 gears and growling a high panel she 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.730
 there was a euro there was a tachometer 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.160
 the location of the magnets it was on top 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.900
 but on the other hand and the distribution 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.489
 air flow was terrible sound and 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.620
 ineptly and the whole panel personally 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.049
 rumbled like a false jaw now we 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.820
 in the library magazine driving here it is in 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.250
 Odessa thoughts all that we ourselves wrote a 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.980
 incidentally all that wrote to us too 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.630
 of course the car on that 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.640
 Naturally, as soon as I was born 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.280
 car VAZ 2109 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.490
 we wrote them, not only in the magazine and our 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.710
 Book Publishers admit to 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.630
 internal auto primer collect disassemble 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.890
 the car itself and serviced because in 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.740
 those times with the element will persuade 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:49.440
 it was easy to follow such a booklet 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:51.810
 understand how to disassemble how to care 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.700
 everything else and so nine became part 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.950
 stories as it should be with the truth on 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.250
 retirement of our employees remembered 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.430
 car only good nine is mine 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.160
 youth is 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.830
 moses nighttime pursuit and pursuit 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.300
 speed girls fine how 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.160
 andryukha trofimova my 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.780
 I tested my school friend 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.850
 incredibly jealous because she loved with 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.950
 one and a half liter engine deal to have 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.380
 I was 1 and 3 eight 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.850
 despite the fact that 10 cars so to speak 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.090
 I got through this local machine 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:28.200
 which recall cars which 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.950
 somehow brought us closer to the European 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.930
 of the prague 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.400
 nine is a bit unfinished 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.790
 eight because no see her 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.360
 the doors 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.970
 the car that was driving fast was already 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.180
 something like nine normal 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.680
 car traveling 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.010
 quite by the way satisfying 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.800
 adequate driver demand let's say 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.440
 so faster quieter and better managed 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.140
 post fiction then I was young and 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.940
 money was not particularly considered at all 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:01.980
 car premium mid premium 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:06.180
 nine for those times it's cool on 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:08.100
 in fact, this machine is the enemy for me 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.380
 nine is the first car in which 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.430
 soviet dude looked wrong of course 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.430
 like sixes five
