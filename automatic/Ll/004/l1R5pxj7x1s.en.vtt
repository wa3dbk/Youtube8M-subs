00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
so let's go out and we get put a road

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.640 
so let's go out and we get put a road
cone<00:02:14.200> down<00:02:14.500> if<00:02:14.710> we<00:02:14.890> wanted<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:16.440> for<00:02:17.440> instance

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
cone down if we wanted to for instance

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.900 
cone down if we wanted to for instance
let's<00:02:18.400> go<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.610> stop<00:02:18.970> honking<00:02:20.550> there's<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.640> road

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
let's go a stop honking there's a road

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:29.559 
let's go a stop honking there's a road
cone<00:02:22.180> on<00:02:23.020> top<00:02:23.350> of<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.620> vehicle

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.959 

obviously<00:02:30.569> that's<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.989> little<00:02:31.469> buggy<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.790> road

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
obviously that's a little buggy the road

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.270 
obviously that's a little buggy the road
cones

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
cones

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.569 
cones
road<00:02:35.280> code<00:02:35.459> being<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:36.480> seems<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:37.019> work<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:38.340> put

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
road code being be seems to work and put

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.720 
road code being be seems to work and put
those<00:02:38.730> down<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:39.329> you<00:02:39.480> want<00:02:39.689> to<00:02:40.370> mark<00:02:41.370> off<00:02:41.549> your

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
those down if you want to mark off your

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.160 
those down if you want to mark off your
beak<00:02:41.909> I<00:02:42.120> see<00:02:42.480> what<00:02:42.629> it<00:02:42.749> is

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
beak I see what it is

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.099 
beak I see what it is
I<00:02:43.549> think<00:02:44.549> wanted<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:44.879> detect<00:02:45.389> something<00:02:45.689> under

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
I think wanted to detect something under

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.940 
I think wanted to detect something under
there<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.650> will<00:02:47.900> not<00:02:48.900> let<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.409> put<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.799> down

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
there it will not let you put it down

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.699 
there it will not let you put it down
let's<00:02:50.219> see<00:02:50.340> what<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.489> barrier<00:02:50.939> looks<00:02:51.299> like

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
let's see what a barrier looks like

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.559 
let's see what a barrier looks like
that's<00:02:52.709> pretty<00:02:52.859> cool<00:02:53.129> and<00:02:53.909> then<00:02:54.060> we<00:02:54.090> got<00:02:54.540> a

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
that's pretty cool and then we got a

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.399 
that's pretty cool and then we got a
road<00:02:55.230> cone<00:02:55.500> F<00:02:56.299> so<00:02:57.299> just<00:02:57.510> all<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.079> different

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
road cone F so just all the different

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.349 
road cone F so just all the different
types<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.739> road<00:02:58.919> cones<00:02:59.159> I<00:02:59.459> believe<00:03:00.120> that

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
types of road cones I believe that
