little<00:01:58.160> button<00:01:58.400> here<00:01:58.490> called<00:01:58.700> pulse<00:01:59.060> which

little button here called pulse which

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.800 
little button here called pulse which
can<00:01:59.420> go<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:01.610> just<00:02:01.820> pulse<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.480> out<00:02:02.570> of<00:02:02.720> it
