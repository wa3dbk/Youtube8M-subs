00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.319
 so guns us straight from the warehouse boxes 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.950
 grade gun 12 enough 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:15.530
 standard actually guns 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.530
 1 bid to increase stock length 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.940
 76 cm chair 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.449
 a set of muzzles one of which 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.510
 already installed in the trunk that is just 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:37.940
 their five times the rate to adjust by 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:40.890
 Butt bending and key for installation 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.450
 gas semiautomatic device complete set 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:50.820
 generally similar 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:53.449
 guns instruction box in the house 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.449
 constriction 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:05.740
 the barrel but there is one interesting nuance 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.490
 instead of the butt extension 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.659
 Kit includes piston for 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.420
 use with heavy weights 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.790
 piston and exhaust system 21 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.470
 used for light on scales up to 38 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.310
 gran 2 for heavy 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:24.700
 38 40 42 4650 and so on as seen 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.440
 outside the gun is very similar only 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.800
 the difference in the eye is that the handguard 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.950
 the inertial semi-automatic is noticeable 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.140
 thinner but the most significant difference 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.850
 between them inside how it works 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.250
 gas semiautomatic lift raises 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.860
 Probably all three charging happens for 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.440
 powder gas energy account 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.649
 here from this hole when fired 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.520
 powder gases are discharged and the barrel 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.210
 fall on the piston porsche opens 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.140
 shutter back 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.460
 the shutter throws in and the pig sleeve and 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.910
 return spring cocks and 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.750
 will send a new cartridge now see 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.630
 on inertial already in inertial system 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.910
 when shot gun under the effect of recoil 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.200
 start to move back bolts then 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.099
 time tends to stay in place 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.280
 internal inertial compressed springs 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:22.080
 after she shrank to end of turn 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.790
 and and the action shutter opens or type 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.030
 back we compress this time already returnable 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.040
 the spring which is located in the butt 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.349
 after that the bolt throwing out the shot 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.239
 the sleeve comes back picks up 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.420
 A new cartridge is being sent to the chamber and 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.420
 securely lock it there 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.390
 scales by inertial system theoretically 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:47.580
 there are fewer moving parts 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:50.040
 less fussing when cleaning and in theory again 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.170
 there must be a sharper battle but 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.110
 a little more tangible impact because 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.350
 that all the energy of powder gases here 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.660
 consumed to disperse the charge but war 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.610
 diet and have their own nuances is considered that 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.640
 such a gun and only works reliably 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.910
 being well nested in the shoulder shooter 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.910
 and not very fond of light from sample 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.489
 gas exhaust system thicker forearm 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.530
 slightly different balance need 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.140
 thorough and regular cleaning 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.430
 gas exhaust system of the tooth and such a gun 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.799
 omnivorous enough 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.110
 and shoots from any positions outside 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.799
 whichever 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.799
 super key tones
