00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 how was it possible to buy xbox one they 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.960
 playstation 4 is exactly the question i am 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.179
 I get most often in this video I 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.070
 I will tell about new box from microsoft 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.250
 sometimes affecting the information in differences 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.020
 with ps4 and xbox 360 x box delivered 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.300
 straight from the hill using the service 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.640
 parcel after all almost 10 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.140
 years since the release of the previous box 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.140
 sure there is something to see 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.680
 kinds 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.320
 so on our miracle media booth 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.970
 ixbox black one 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.070
 flowers while he is inside 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.110
 drive for 500 gigabytes others bye 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.150
 also there is no appearance from boxing 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.660
 as close as possible to this 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.920
 boxing 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.199
 that is, it's just a black box 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.180
 half glossy half ribbed 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.220
 you can put it only horizontally 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.990
 as hot air blows from here 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.420
 in front there is blue rain and drive type 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.610
 Finnish slide and touch switch button 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.619
 on one side port yuesbi on the other 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.350
 empty behind a whole bunch of connectors 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.840
 compared to the xbox 360, the console has become 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.910
 more on all axes a little harder block 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.920
 food has become more beautiful now it fits 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.710
 by style from boxing but again 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.690
 got bigger and heavier compared to 360 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.369
 I doubt that such an increase in size 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.440
 for someone will be critical but 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.250
 specifically and noise reduction from consoles 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.350
 noticeable plus 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.240
 now even in the hottest moments of the game 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.890
 noise from the cooling system of the console 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.140
 I could not hear it right 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.000
 striking difference past box rustled 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.890
 so at some points it was dumb 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.840
 that he will explode the most important thing is that 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.790
 microsoft was important not to screw it up 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.009
 gamepad and thank god they handled on 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.110
 great the whole internet calls this 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.360
 evolutionary development of this one 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.700
 also so call this gamepad got 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.990
 evolutionary development input and will not tell 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.479
 that in ergonomics something cardinally 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.729
 changed it still lies comfortably in 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.250
 hand this is certainly a matter of habit on Sonya 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.409
 less comfortable for me visually seams and 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.390
 all kinds of grooves become less and 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.000
 it means they will not collect fat and 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.040
 the dirt of my friends ur triggers became 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.470
 bigger and look somehow more aggressive 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.750
 sticks got a winter car 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.070
 protector but in short you understand here 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.110
 now should not slide 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.390
 Yes, and this rubber should be killed less 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.260
 the location of all the elements did not change 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.570
 not a millimeter 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.239
 their number is also as microsoft says 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.130
 cross dofiga reworked and improved 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.959
 but until I actually noticed it 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.000
 it's the same gamepad but a little 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.920
 upgraded however compatibility 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.959
 old and new unfortunately not 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.459
 complete headset also changed 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.410
 it turned out a hefty remote 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.640
 management and in itself became easier and 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.500
 more comfortable to sit on your head 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.510
 most changes happened with 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.950
 universal tracking sensor 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.180
 movements in space or 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.790
 short for convenient and simple kinect now 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.329
 sensor equipped with a 1080 camera 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.579
 it used to be 480 viewing angle increased 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.109
 by 60 percent and now recognize 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.689
 cola pony and in the nose he can on 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.969
 distance from meter 40 used to be meter 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.129
 eighty the whole system became more accurate 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:12.470
 faster and smarter with a few 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.840
 factors kinect recognizes users 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.150
 and login and without a single button click 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.769
 it is convenient yes and Skype is now real 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.900
 can use from useful 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.000
 of course fitness and arcade applications 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.829
 games but adults are already starting tightly 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.019
 take advantage of the sensor 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.269
 For example, the game before the threat you need to behave 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.549
 quiet as any noise in the room can 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.950
 attract zombies now about software features 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.959
 Dashboard significantly updated and became 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.970
 faster or rather it is updated and 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.500
 becomes fast literally every time 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.780
 when i turn on tv box one he 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.870
 updated every time flies by 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.669
 400 500 megabytes and I'm waiting for 10-15 minutes 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.919
 then i don't want to play i go 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.810
 dashboard footwork whole consists of 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:53.599
 cell store games and applications 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.669
 beautiful and informative battlefield 4 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.919
 who bought the incentive I need to buy 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:00.680
 again to play console well ok 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:02.060
 no damn this is ok ok ok xbox one can 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.430
 work in two modes 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.139
 one it is completely off and when you 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.299
 decide to play will need to be sympathetic 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.069
 wait for him to join in another 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.290
 mode, he is constantly in mode 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.120
 sleep kinect works and as soon as you 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.519
 Gopnik any team type 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.409
 Xbox play FIFA he immediately launches 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.970
 play or cut the telly or open 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:21.919
 skype and so on if you are avid 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.229
 letplayer now you can stream 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:28.010
 straight to twitch or youtube by the way x-box 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:30.470
 one stream 720p with a bitrate of 30 fps at 5 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.010
 megabits per second while ps4 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.110
 Only 960 streams at 540 dots 30 fps and 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.030
 17 megabits per second and 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.470
 And about the TV there is a bunch 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.630
 all sorts of innovations for 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.880
 cable tv set-top box interactions 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.060
 x-box one but our countries don't 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.400
 we work just above it why do we 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.979
 full hd channels with interesting serials 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.870
 we'd better go out for air or 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.880
 we won't go out and play more time 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.159
 in short, to fully embrace the philosophy 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.530
 Microsoft which sees x-box one as 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.840
 one media center in your living room 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.330
 we won't succeed it's still gaming 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.560
 the prefix is ​​only now cooler than the new xbox 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.050
 became more beautiful quieter more powerful 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.990
 gamepad just got better though 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.580
 All the same, such a new kinect is just a bomb 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.680
 which will surprise for a long time 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.169
 it remains to wait for the reissue of some 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.120
 fresh games and release new you watched 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.560
 x-box one video review at keddr.com 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.270
 My name is Semen Like 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.070
 subscribe to the channel and I went to look 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.070
 playstation 4 to take indoor
