00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
it you can also use an expression gate

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.260 
it you can also use an expression gate
and<00:01:57.260> all<00:01:57.830> those<00:01:57.950> other<00:01:58.190> things<00:01:58.430> but<00:01:58.670> those<00:01:59.060> are

exactly too sure how to do it I've known

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.800 
exactly too sure how to do it I've known
a<00:02:04.310> guy<00:02:04.520> who's<00:02:04.760> really<00:02:04.820> good<00:02:05.210> with<00:02:05.330> wire<00:02:05.540> Mata

a guy who's really good with wire Mata

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.600 
a guy who's really good with wire Mata
he<00:02:06.440> knew<00:02:06.560> how<00:02:06.650> to<00:02:06.710> do<00:02:06.830> all<00:02:07.010> of<00:02:07.040> this<00:02:07.330> but<00:02:08.330> um<00:02:08.720> I

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
he knew how to do all of this but um I

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.980 
the laser machine gun and I have it um I
have<00:02:40.070> it<00:02:40.280> selected<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.120> custom<00:02:41.540> model<00:02:41.840> just

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
have it selected to a custom model just

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.600 
have it selected to a custom model just
cuz<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.260> don't<00:02:42.320> like<00:02:42.440> any<00:02:42.740> of<00:02:42.830> these<00:02:42.980> models<00:02:43.430> and

cuz I don't like any of these models and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.670 
cuz I don't like any of these models and

have my own custom models which are

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.650 
have my own custom models which are
these<00:02:47.780> little<00:02:47.959> stingray<00:02:48.739> like<00:02:48.950> items<00:02:49.660> which

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
these little stingray like items which

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.270 
these little stingray like items which
they<00:02:50.690> actually<00:02:51.320> fit<00:02:51.530> in<00:02:51.680> really<00:02:52.010> well<00:02:52.130> with

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
they actually fit in really well with

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.490 
they actually fit in really well with
this<00:02:52.610> thing<00:02:52.880> right<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:54.080> can<00:02:54.260> get<00:02:54.320> your

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
this thing right and you can get your

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.810 
this thing right and you can get your
own<00:02:54.560> props<00:02:54.950> if<00:02:55.070> you<00:02:55.160> download<00:02:55.489> them<00:02:55.610> from

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
own props if you download them from

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.460 
own props if you download them from
somewhere<00:02:56.300> I<00:02:56.450> just<00:02:56.720> got<00:02:56.870> these<00:02:57.050> prompts<00:02:57.410> from

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
somewhere I just got these prompts from

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.540 
somewhere I just got these prompts from
the<00:02:57.620> SBP<00:02:58.250> community<00:02:58.760> section<00:02:59.030> and<00:03:00.340> it's<00:03:01.340> kind

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
the SBP community section and it's kind

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.130 
the SBP community section and it's kind
of<00:03:01.580> like<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.730> lineup<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:04.600> when<00:03:05.600> I'm<00:03:05.690> aligning

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
of like a lineup and when I'm aligning

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.990 
of like a lineup and when I'm aligning
it<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.410> just<00:03:06.440> like<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.770> make<00:03:06.890> sure<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:07.730> is

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
it I just like to make sure that this is

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.690 
it I just like to make sure that this is
like<00:03:08.390> a<00:03:08.630> frozen<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.650> there<00:03:10.430> are<00:03:10.520> a<00:03:10.550> lot<00:03:10.670> of

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
like a frozen and there are a lot of

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.160 
like a frozen and there are a lot of
different<00:03:11.060> ways<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.209> actually<00:03:11.480> do<00:03:11.959> what<00:03:12.080> you

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
different ways to actually do what you

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.290 
different ways to actually do what you
can<00:03:12.320> manually<00:03:12.680> use<00:03:13.459> this<00:03:13.700> type<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.000> welding

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
can manually use this type of welding

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.240 
can manually use this type of welding
which<00:03:14.600> is<00:03:14.630> to<00:03:15.440> me<00:03:15.590> it's<00:03:15.770> kind<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.100> lot<00:03:16.190> harder

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
which is to me it's kind of a lot harder

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.949 
which is to me it's kind of a lot harder
because<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.209> don't<00:03:17.360> really<00:03:17.510> know<00:03:17.630> where<00:03:17.810> your

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
because you don't really know where your

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.380 
because you don't really know where your
welding<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.709> but<00:03:18.980> um<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.730> can<00:03:19.880> try<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.150> always

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
welding it but um you can try to always

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.680 
welding it but um you can try to always
try<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:20.989> align<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:21.970> this<00:03:22.970> all<00:03:23.209> right<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:23.480> it's<00:03:23.630> a

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
try to align it this all right so it's a

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.980 
try to align it this all right so it's a
line<00:03:23.840> like<00:03:23.989> this<00:03:24.310> now<00:03:25.310> let's<00:03:25.489> go<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.730> this<00:03:25.850> one

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
line like this now let's go to this one

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.080 
line like this now let's go to this one
try<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.470> get<00:03:27.740> it<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.220> see<00:03:28.730> if<00:03:28.820> we<00:03:28.970> actually

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
try to get it and see if we actually

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.230 
try to get it and see if we actually
align<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:30.580> it's<00:03:31.580> not<00:03:31.730> going<00:03:31.820> to<00:03:31.910> be<00:03:31.970> perfect

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
align it it's not going to be perfect

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.020 
align it it's not going to be perfect
that's<00:03:32.720> for<00:03:32.870> sure<00:03:33.140> I<00:03:33.410> believe<00:03:34.130> this<00:03:34.580> one's<00:03:34.910> a

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
that's for sure I believe this one's a

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.520 
that's for sure I believe this one's a
little<00:03:35.120> bit<00:03:35.330> of<00:03:35.420> head<00:03:35.600> of<00:03:35.690> this<00:03:35.810> one<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:36.320> if<00:03:36.410> we

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
little bit of head of this one and if we

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.610 
little bit of head of this one and if we
look<00:03:36.710> at<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:38.840> looks<00:03:38.900> actually<00:03:39.260> not<00:03:39.590> that

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
look at it it looks actually not that

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.300 
look at it it looks actually not that
bad<00:03:40.120> all<00:03:41.120> right<00:03:41.240> so<00:03:41.560> now<00:03:42.560> that<00:03:42.740> we've<00:03:42.890> done

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
bad all right so now that we've done

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.770 
bad all right so now that we've done
with<00:03:43.460> that<00:03:43.580> we<00:03:43.700> can<00:03:43.790> actually<00:03:43.940> wire<00:03:44.270> all<00:03:44.510> of<00:03:44.660> it

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
with that we can actually wire all of it

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.210 
with that we can actually wire all of it
and<00:03:45.160> also<00:03:46.360> um<00:03:47.360> yeah<00:03:48.260> pretty<00:03:48.470> much<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:48.860> if<00:03:49.070> you

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
and also um yeah pretty much it if you

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.590 
and also um yeah pretty much it if you
don't<00:03:49.370> know<00:03:49.460> how<00:03:49.580> to<00:03:49.610> use<00:03:49.730> life<00:03:50.000> support<00:03:50.360> go

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
don't know how to use life support go

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.630 
don't know how to use life support go
and<00:03:50.750> wash<00:03:50.870> my<00:03:50.900> editorial<00:03:51.620> but<00:03:51.800> don't<00:03:52.460> use<00:03:52.610> a

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
and wash my editorial but don't use a

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.270 
and wash my editorial but don't use a
resource<00:03:53.060> cash<00:03:53.330> for<00:03:53.810> instance<00:03:54.110> like<00:03:54.280> take

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
resource cash for instance like take

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.890 
resource cash for instance like take
like<00:03:55.490> i'm<00:03:55.850> going<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.210> show<00:03:56.300> you<00:03:56.330> an<00:03:56.450> example<00:03:56.540> if

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
like i'm going to show you an example if

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.140 
like i'm going to show you an example if
you<00:03:56.960> go<00:03:57.020> to<00:03:57.080> your<00:03:57.260> CAF<00:03:57.820> instead<00:03:58.820> of<00:03:58.910> using<00:03:59.030> a

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
you go to your CAF instead of using a

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.210 
you go to your CAF instead of using a
research<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.780> resource<00:04:00.470> cash<00:04:00.770> you're<00:04:01.040> going<00:04:01.160> to

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
research a resource cash you're going to

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.120 
research a resource cash you're going to
use<00:04:01.370> like<00:04:01.960> oxygen<00:04:02.960> tanks<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:03.740> stuff<00:04:03.890> because

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
use like oxygen tanks and stuff because

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.860 
use like oxygen tanks and stuff because
as<00:04:04.490> you<00:04:04.610> can<00:04:04.640> see<00:04:04.760> austin<00:04:05.180> tanks<00:04:05.510> are<00:04:05.630> pretty

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
as you can see austin tanks are pretty

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.520 
as you can see austin tanks are pretty
small<00:04:06.170> like<00:04:06.380> look<00:04:06.530> at<00:04:06.590> this<00:04:07.390> small<00:04:08.390> tank<00:04:08.720> these

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
small like look at this small tank these

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.960 
small like look at this small tank these
are<00:04:09.710> extremely<00:04:10.250> small<00:04:10.550> so<00:04:10.700> you<00:04:10.730> can<00:04:10.850> like

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
are extremely small so you can like

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.850 
are extremely small so you can like
let's<00:04:11.150> say<00:04:11.210> pull<00:04:11.480> like<00:04:11.630> one<00:04:11.900> here<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.350> my<00:04:12.530> one

here it'll last you a really really long
time<00:04:15.110> but<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:16.010> was<00:04:16.040> back<00:04:16.280> into<00:04:16.580> our<00:04:16.850> wire

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
time but it was back into our wire

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.060 
time but it was back into our wire
actually<00:04:17.750> gonna<00:04:18.110> have<00:04:18.290> to<00:04:18.380> wire<00:04:18.590> all<00:04:18.860> this

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
actually gonna have to wire all this

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.890 
actually gonna have to wire all this

oops let's undo that all right forward
on<00:04:32.560> w<00:04:33.560> it's<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.730> usual<00:04:34.880> stuff<00:04:35.180> like<00:04:35.510> backwards

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
on w it's the usual stuff like backwards

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.150 
on w it's the usual stuff like backwards

on s move left on a and move right song
d<00:04:43.160> you<00:04:43.670> wouldn't<00:04:43.940> really<00:04:44.030> need<00:04:44.420> them<00:04:44.570> move<00:04:44.810> up

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
d you wouldn't really need them move up

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.650 
d you wouldn't really need them move up
and<00:04:45.140> down<00:04:45.310> since<00:04:46.310> we're<00:04:46.610> is<00:04:46.820> already<00:04:47.330> linked

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
to the mouse we're going to go to our

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.970 
to the mouse we're going to go to our
level<00:04:51.520> with<00:04:52.520> that<00:04:52.720> shift<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:54.050> that's<00:04:54.860> pretty

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
level with that shift and that's pretty

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.680 
level with that shift and that's pretty
much<00:04:55.070> all<00:04:55.310> we<00:04:55.490> need<00:04:55.640> so<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.210> we're<00:04:56.540> going<00:04:56.570> to

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
much all we need so and we're going to

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.820 
much all we need so and we're going to
fire<00:04:57.050> on<00:04:57.620> oops<00:04:58.130> not<00:04:58.730> that<00:04:59.500> i'm<00:05:00.500> going<00:05:00.620> to<00:05:00.710> click

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
fire on oops not that i'm going to click

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.470 
fire on oops not that i'm going to click
fire<00:05:01.220> on<00:05:01.580> mouse<00:05:02.480> one<00:05:03.640> step<00:05:04.640> if<00:05:04.790> this<00:05:04.970> one<00:05:05.150> fire

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
fire on mouse one step if this one fire

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.940 
fire on mouse one step if this one fire
on<00:05:07.030> mouse<00:05:08.030> one<00:05:08.540> and<00:05:08.810> so<00:05:09.560> we're<00:05:09.680> going<00:05:09.770> to<00:05:09.860> do

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
on mouse one and so we're going to do

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.770 
on mouse one and so we're going to do
also<00:05:10.340> if<00:05:10.580> you<00:05:10.700> find<00:05:10.910> that<00:05:10.970> that<00:05:11.150> this<00:05:11.420> is<00:05:11.600> too

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
also if you find that that this is too

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.690 
also if you find that that this is too
sensitive<00:05:12.040> what<00:05:13.040> you<00:05:13.190> can<00:05:13.280> do<00:05:13.370> is<00:05:13.430> you<00:05:13.520> get<00:05:13.670> a

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
sensitive what you can do is you get a

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.430 
sensitive what you can do is you get a
constant<00:05:14.180> value<00:05:14.300> and<00:05:14.720> set<00:05:15.050> it<00:05:15.170> something

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
constant value and set it something

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.040 
constant value and set it something
lower<00:05:15.620> than<00:05:15.860> one<00:05:16.100> that<00:05:16.760> will<00:05:17.030> make<00:05:17.690> the

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
lower than one that will make the

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.530 
lower than one that will make the
sensitivity<00:05:19.040> lower<00:05:19.250> because<00:05:20.240> this<00:05:20.420> is

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
sensitivity lower because this is

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.040 
sensitivity lower because this is
actually<00:05:20.660> really<00:05:20.900> really<00:05:21.320> sensitive

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
actually really really sensitive

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.100 
actually really really sensitive
yeah<00:05:23.770> so<00:05:24.129> here's<00:05:24.639> the<00:05:24.789> ship<00:05:25.030> it's<00:05:25.900> kind<00:05:25.990> of

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
yeah so here's the ship it's kind of

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.110 
yeah so here's the ship it's kind of
sensitive<00:05:26.500> but<00:05:26.800> as<00:05:27.129> you<00:05:27.400> can<00:05:27.490> see<00:05:27.639> dust<00:05:27.909> fire

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
sensitive but as you can see dust fire

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.930 
sensitive but as you can see dust fire
and<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:29.770> sound<00:05:29.979> effects<00:05:30.250> seem<00:05:30.490> pretty<00:05:30.699> cool

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
and the sound effects seem pretty cool

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.570 
and the sound effects seem pretty cool
but<00:05:31.090> it<00:05:31.210> yet<00:05:31.300> it<00:05:31.569> fires<00:05:31.840> lasers<00:05:32.349> I'll<00:05:33.129> freaking

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
but it yet it fires lasers I'll freaking
