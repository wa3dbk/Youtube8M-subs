the screws came out and it fell apart it

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.880 
the screws came out and it fell apart it
was<00:00:29.070> basically<00:00:29.550> compressed<00:00:30.210> cardboard<00:00:30.890> so

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
was basically compressed cardboard so

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.190 
was basically compressed cardboard so
she<00:00:31.949> asked<00:00:32.369> us<00:00:32.460> if<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.759> would<00:00:32.880> build<00:00:33.059> one<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
she asked us if we would build one the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.780 
she asked us if we would build one the
old-fashioned<00:00:34.770> way<00:00:34.920> out<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.250> real<00:00:35.489> wood<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
old-fashioned way out of real wood and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.580 
old-fashioned way out of real wood and
make<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.210> extra<00:00:36.540> strong<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.170> survive<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
make it extra strong to survive a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.160 
make it extra strong to survive a
two-year-old<00:00:38.059> so<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.270> way<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.570> chose<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
build it is we're using a half inch

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.680 
build it is we're using a half inch
birch<00:00:43.079> plywood<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:44.850> when<00:00:45.059> you're<00:00:45.149> using<00:00:45.329> glue

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
blocks to make the connections they're

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.590 
blocks to make the connections they're
screwed<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.800> glue<00:00:50.149> really<00:00:51.149> strong

bottom we did a lap joint of the back
piece<00:01:08.510> and<00:01:09.510> got<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.930> glued<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.830> will

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
piece and got it glued in so it will

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.359 
piece and got it glued in so it will
survive<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.970> kid<00:01:12.810> playing<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.710> survived
