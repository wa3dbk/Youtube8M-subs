00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
that's one of the reasons the computer

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.800 
that's one of the reasons the computer
verifies<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.820> if<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:44.090> guys<00:02:44.210> have<00:02:44.420> Mac<00:02:44.600> OS

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
this is another 20 gigabytes so this

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.680 
this is another 20 gigabytes so this
game<00:03:21.800> is<00:03:21.980> gonna<00:03:22.190> take<00:03:22.430> up<00:03:22.580> 28<00:03:23.060> bytes<00:03:23.300> from<00:03:23.540> your

file but I'm gonna clarify that up

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.310 
file but I'm gonna clarify that up
usually<00:03:31.670> when<00:03:31.820> I<00:03:31.880> say<00:03:32.090> that<00:03:32.300> I<00:03:32.480> only<00:03:32.780> mean<00:03:33.140> it

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
usually when I say that I only mean it

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.800 
usually when I say that I only mean it
for<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:34.040> games<00:03:34.310> that<00:03:34.550> are<00:03:34.610> cider<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.690> our

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
for the games that are cider that our

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.930 
for the games that are cider that our
cider<00:03:36.050> ports<00:03:36.470> or<00:03:36.650> that<00:03:37.160> are<00:03:37.280> ported<00:03:37.670> over<00:03:37.760> from

cider ports or that are ported over from

cider ports or that are ported over from
windows<00:03:38.570> onto<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.960> Mac<00:03:39.140> because<00:03:39.500> those<00:03:40.010> are

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
windows onto the Mac because those are

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.590 
windows onto the Mac because those are
the<00:03:40.310> games<00:03:40.460> that<00:03:40.670> are<00:03:40.760> gonna<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.090> know<00:03:41.180> stop

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
the games that are gonna you know stop

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.210 
the games that are gonna you know stop
working<00:03:42.140> or<00:03:42.230> they're<00:03:42.380> gonna<00:03:42.440> crash<00:03:42.890> more

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
working or they're gonna crash more

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.750 
working or they're gonna crash more
often

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
often

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.610 
often
therefore<00:03:44.540> it's<00:03:44.720> nice<00:03:44.990> to<00:03:45.170> have<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.320> backup

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
therefore it's nice to have a backup

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.230 
therefore it's nice to have a backup
rather<00:03:46.070> than<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.400> redownload<00:03:47.030> in<00:03:47.150> the

rather than the redownload in the

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.010 
rather than the redownload in the
torrent<00:03:48.910> anyways<00:03:49.910> once<00:03:50.240> you've<00:03:50.450> copied<00:03:50.750> it

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
torrent anyways once you've copied it

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.040 
torrent anyways once you've copied it
over<00:03:51.610> everything<00:03:52.610> else<00:03:53.030> should<00:03:53.660> be<00:03:53.870> good

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
over everything else should be good

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.680 
over everything else should be good
because<00:03:54.770> since<00:03:55.160> it's<00:03:55.340> not<00:03:55.730> a<00:03:55.790> cyber<00:03:56.060> cider

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.970 
because since it's not a cyber cider
pool<00:03:56.930> you<00:03:57.020> don't<00:03:57.170> have<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.380> do<00:03:57.500> anything<00:03:57.770> in
