00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you will need just a little blade or an

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.340 
you will need just a little blade or an
exacto<00:01:26.729> knife<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:26.970> peel<00:01:27.570> off<00:01:28.350> stickers<00:01:30.350> and

to<00:02:50.380> peel<00:02:50.590> off<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:50.770> stickers<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.550> then<00:02:52.120> you're

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
to peel off the stickers and then you're

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.210 
to peel off the stickers and then you're
going<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.750> glue<00:02:53.080> pieces<00:02:54.070> or<00:02:54.640> bandage<00:02:55.240> them<00:02:56.220> so

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
going to glue pieces or bandage them so

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.810 
going to glue pieces or bandage them so
you<00:02:58.030> take<00:02:58.270> these<00:02:58.570> four<00:02:59.530> pieces<00:02:59.740> and<00:03:00.280> bandaged

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
you take these four pieces and bandaged

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.190 
you take these four pieces and bandaged
them<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:02.370> will<00:03:03.370> by<00:03:03.760> gluing<00:03:04.209> them<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:05.050> do

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
them and will by gluing them and you do

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.030 
them and will by gluing them and you do
that<00:03:05.350> here<00:03:05.680> here<00:03:06.640> here<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.690> then<00:03:08.500> also<00:03:08.680> on<00:03:09.010> the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
that here here here and then also on the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.720 
that here here here and then also on the
backs<00:03:09.490> on<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.390> bottom<00:03:10.720> here<00:03:11.320> here<00:03:11.980> here<00:03:12.610> and

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
backs on the bottom here here here and

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.880 
backs on the bottom here here here and
here<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.980> have<00:03:15.340> 8<00:03:15.610> of<00:03:15.790> them<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.900> then<00:03:17.739> what

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
here so you have 8 of them and then what

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.840 
here so you have 8 of them and then what
you'll<00:03:18.100> do<00:03:18.340> is<00:03:19.230> you'll<00:03:20.230> bandage<00:03:23.580> these<00:03:24.580> 3

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
you'll do is you'll bandage these 3

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.300 
you'll do is you'll bandage these 3
pieces<00:03:25.120> right<00:03:25.600> here<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.650> you'll<00:03:26.980> do<00:03:27.130> that

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
pieces right here and you'll do that

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.180 
pieces right here and you'll do that
here<00:03:27.880> here<00:03:28.769> here<00:03:29.769> here<00:03:30.310> here<00:03:30.610> here<00:03:31.980> here<00:03:32.980> and

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
here here here here here here here and

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.320 
here here here here here here here and
here

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
here

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.410 
here
so<00:03:35.170> then<00:03:35.440> you'll<00:03:35.650> have<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:36.190> 2<00:03:36.310> by<00:03:36.790> 2<00:03:36.820> square

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
so then you'll have a 2 by 2 square

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.140 
so then you'll have a 2 by 2 square
because<00:03:37.959> they'll<00:03:38.350> be<00:03:38.470> enforced<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.459> then

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
because they'll be enforced and then

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.530 
because they'll be enforced and then
you'll<00:03:40.300> have<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:42.120> 4<00:03:43.120> I<00:03:43.150> 2<00:03:43.410> 2<00:03:44.410> by<00:03:44.650> 4<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:46.330> then

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
you'll have a 4 I 2 2 by 4 so then

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.270 
you'll have a 4 I 2 2 by 4 so then
you'll<00:03:46.720> have<00:03:47.019> a<00:03:47.410> 2<00:03:47.500> by<00:03:48.100> 2<00:03:48.370> by<00:03:49.030> 4<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:50.709> will<00:03:51.130> be

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
you'll have a 2 by 2 by 4 so you will be

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.570 
you'll have a 2 by 2 by 4 so you will be
able<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.880> turn<00:03:52.150> it<00:03:52.360> in<00:03:52.720> halves<00:03:53.620> in<00:03:54.160> any

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
able to turn it in halves in any

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.240 
able to turn it in halves in any
direction<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.540> you'll<00:03:55.780> be<00:03:55.989> able<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.860> turn<00:03:57.070> it

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
direction and you'll be able to turn it

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.140 
direction and you'll be able to turn it
in<00:03:57.370> fourths<00:03:57.910> along<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.959> S<00:03:59.170> axis<00:04:00.040> over<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.910> e

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
in fourths along the S axis over the e

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.290 
in fourths along the S axis over the e
they<00:04:01.870> eat<00:04:02.110> so<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.100> could<00:04:03.489> turn<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.880> in<00:04:04.180> the

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
they eat so you could turn it in the

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.870 
they eat so you could turn it in the
middle<00:04:04.540> this<00:04:04.750> way<00:04:05.019> like<00:04:05.709> this<00:04:05.950> when<00:04:06.760> you're

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
middle this way like this when you're

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.120 
middle this way like this when you're
done<00:04:07.080> but<00:04:08.080> you<00:04:08.170> could<00:04:08.440> not<00:04:08.590> turn<00:04:08.799> it<00:04:08.950> like<00:04:09.070> that

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
done but you could not turn it like that

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:18.199 
done but you could not turn it like that
this<00:04:09.700> way<00:04:10.140> or<00:04:15.209> this<00:04:16.209> way

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
this way or this way

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.970 
this way or this way
so<00:04:19.209> that's<00:04:19.540> what<00:04:19.930> that<00:04:20.139> you<00:04:20.320> guys<00:04:20.500> do<00:04:20.620> by<00:04:20.769> four

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
so that's what that you guys do by four

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.080 
so that's what that you guys do by four
is<00:04:21.100> going<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.400> be<00:04:21.519> like<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:24.070> first<00:04:24.370> step<00:04:24.639> is<00:04:24.850> to

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
is going to be like the first step is to

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.890 
is going to be like the first step is to
peel<00:04:25.389> off<00:04:25.570> all<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.110> stickers<00:04:26.760> you<00:04:27.900> probably

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
peel off all the stickers you probably

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.470 
peel off all the stickers you probably
know<00:04:29.050> how<00:04:29.290> to<00:04:29.350> already<00:04:29.740> do<00:04:30.040> that<00:04:30.150> if<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.360> don't

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
know how to already do that if you don't

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.940 
know how to already do that if you don't
just<00:04:31.950> stick<00:04:32.950> your<00:04:33.100> blade<00:04:34.230> under<00:04:35.230> the<00:04:35.440> edge<00:04:36.210> and

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
just stick your blade under the edge and

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.409 
just stick your blade under the edge and
just<00:04:38.950> push<00:04:39.690> and<00:04:41.490> until<00:04:42.490> you<00:04:42.610> have<00:04:42.639> a<00:04:42.760> corner

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
just push and until you have a corner

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.379 
just push and until you have a corner
lift<00:04:43.600> up<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.350> peel<00:04:44.620> it<00:04:44.650> off<00:04:44.889> I'll<00:04:45.850> do<00:04:45.970> this<00:04:46.150> for

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
lift up and peel it off I'll do this for

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.090 
lift up and peel it off I'll do this for
the<00:04:46.510> whole<00:04:46.540> entire<00:04:46.930> cube<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:49.630> then<00:04:50.010> after<00:04:51.010> you

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
the whole entire cube and then after you

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.180 
the whole entire cube and then after you
peel<00:04:51.610> off<00:04:51.639> all<00:04:52.240> of<00:04:52.389> your<00:04:52.510> stickers<00:04:52.930> I<00:04:53.260> will<00:04:53.979> see

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
peel off all of your stickers I will see

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.240 
peel off all of your stickers I will see
you<00:04:54.310> in<00:04:54.520> part<00:04:54.940> 2<00:04:55.360> which<00:04:56.020> will<00:04:56.229> be<00:04:56.290> bandaging

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
you in part 2 which will be bandaging

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:06.410 
you in part 2 which will be bandaging
the<00:04:57.880> pieces

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.480 

you
