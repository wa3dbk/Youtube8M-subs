00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.400
 boy greetings 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.599
 today we are going to talk about a subject 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.790
 which left yesterday, March 27, 2013 and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.619
 that until then I have 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.920
 this news as a sign of one of the most 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.689
 important so far in oil 2014 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.640
 and I'm going to put our trail here 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.609
 so we can start 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.609
 to matter then it's that personal let's go there 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.329
 in the late afternoon of March 27 to 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.870
 dafra made the official announcement and closed 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.750
 partnership with the Austrian premium brand 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.329
 called ktm the very reputed brand 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.340
 world and dafra made the announcement 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.590
 informing you that you have a 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.260
 agreement reached with the company that will 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.420
 pass to import and assemble models 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.129
 here in the Brazilian market doing 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.539
 also the representation 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.190
 the only doubt with regard to 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.770
 representation here not knowing well 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.320
 the rate will open dealerships 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.119
 specific to ktm that in brazil or 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.680
 it simply introduces the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.350
 branded models in their 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.930
 dealerships will already be in the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.760
 the agreement has already been signed both marks 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.860
 already have all the processes 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.840
 administrative procedures in progress and 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.659
 promises that this year will be 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.600
 introducing the first models of ktm 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.070
 here in the brazilian market 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.409
 dafra initially intends to bring the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.659
 off-road models in the domestic market 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.340
 undoubtedly also very good taking into account 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.610
 view that our market is suffering 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.890
 with the lack of these deaths that ktm is 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.979
 a brand that has been recognized and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.290
 reference in the motorcycle market 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.869
 until the end of 2014 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.750
 the date promises is showing there the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.390
 first off-road models of ktm that 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.540
 national market and in addition to the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.149
 and 2015 will be announcing there 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.020
 the entire ktm line of products that the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.509
 brazilian market 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.549
 good because it prevents that ktm also has 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.829
 different urban models there that call 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.310
 enough attention we have there the family 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:12.310
 duke such as the 200 and the duke 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.680
 390 cranks are a bonus modes one 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.230
 sports style that are considered as 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.599
 dream of consumption and then a lot of people to 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.640
 dafra also promises in 2015 is 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.450
 presenting these models in our 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.040
 Marketplace 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.840
 without a doubt that this is a 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.819
 very important information that our 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.040
 Brazilian market in an interview that will 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.900
 there is a significant improvement in 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.540
 competition since the products which 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.680
 shall be deemed to be 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.510
 lived award 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.940
 Let's hope there is a good 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.739
 implementation of logistics and price 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.470
 products so that the Brazilian really 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.500
 can have good quality products with 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.549
 accessible to everyone at my point of 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.590
 personal view 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.799
 this action still gives for nothing more is 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.769
 that a response in reaction to bramont 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.810
 will represent here and benelli 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.180
 here in the Brazilian market and they 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.290
 announced today that they intend to 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.260
 quickly reach third place 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.359
 in the national market and how do we know 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.180
 current third-party market 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.040
 The national dafra is then more than 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.620
 expected that they actually have this 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.680
 posture and more aggressive to 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.810
 consolidate in position also gain more 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.239
 market then certainly the sensation is of 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.579
 close partnership with ktm is already a 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.340
 reply to the bravos that will represent the 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.750
 eike that benelli undoubtedly more 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.569
 It's time we win. 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.060
 since we will have more products 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.829
 more quality options 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.709
 competitive we expect to 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.810
 sure all this is very welcome 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.269
 So that's it folks let's hope that 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.459
 my models in ktm start to emerge 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.500
