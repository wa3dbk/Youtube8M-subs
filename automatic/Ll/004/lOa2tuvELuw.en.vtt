00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.680
 teach how to get fast food and 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.800
 infinite very easily creating a 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.200
 farm all we need is 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.519
 wood like the one I have since I 've 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.609
 wooden boards 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:23.109
 we need to make sticks to make 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:27.160
 others as above choose and put 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:29.439
 two tables do well and sticks makes 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.980
 what to do enough I always do 64 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.230
 I always make you farms 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.720
 in something the values you choose in the row 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.560
 central from left to right 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.850
 Then you put the akp and the one below 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.859
 same 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.910
 catch we put like that and we're going to put 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:46.910
 example 10 in each 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.090
 and now we take the berries 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.190
 alright 20 and now to make a door of 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.350
 fence that will continue to open and 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.940
 close we are going to put the clubs like this 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.390
 from the center and from below from left to 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.630
 right and now put two tables like this 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.590
 and we got a beige fence rope 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.290
 very well 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.250
 now 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.360
 we take it 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.360
 and let's see 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.860
 now let's find a gap myself 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.860
 I left an egg balance 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.730
 in cancer, it is 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.550
 place 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.550
 the berry well stand in a row 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.590
 A) Yes 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.470
 you have to leave a gap always for the 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.940
 door size and size is not 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.160
 important is how you want it 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.700
 and if they want to put many animals 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.640
 bigger so that you all get in and 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.350

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.510
 Anal can be opened close with the button 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.510
 right mouse you see 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.250

 I have chickens here next to me so what 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.170
 what we need are seeds 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:27.280
 normal seeds the greens that are 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:30.450

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.019
