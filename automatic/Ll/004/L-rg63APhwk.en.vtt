00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hi everyone today i'm going 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.180
 show you how to play the solo of 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.490
 bad guys da pink floyd a pretty solo 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.139
 short rather easy in the sense that he 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.580
 there is no art does not need a 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.020
 extraordinary speed when I played 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.160
 to adjust small agafous ben etc 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.810
 I have costs in three parts 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.150
 and so well and I will start with 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.850
 the first so the first particles 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.869
 on the bone displays 12 a first time I 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.869
 wanted components more 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.180
 so we will start 15-12 on accor of 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:52.290
 ground then we 'll make a band a tone 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.290
 castrais do this three times the pen 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.910
 the third time Tuesday without one will make a 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:14.070
 bolt crate 12 and that will end up on 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:14.070
 the one from the beginning last time 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:28.400
 then we will do 14 13 14 50 degrees with 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:32.350
 the annular is major so then we have 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.350
 had this live case that agreement 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:41.800
 after 15.5 on the ground rope is like 4 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:48.820
 he arranges or local dry 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:51.550
 these islets will end up on the rope of the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.470
 cyclone case of the boat like that so 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.470
 this part with the slide in case of 7 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.340
 and so the last little section of 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.400
 this first part we will do 3 on 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.940
 accor of the ball offers 2 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.940
 and amr 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.340
 52 still has it 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:20.120
 then to have a little ben three breaks 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.120
 buttons so he will have to head the other 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:30.430
 and we go back right now so 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:33.660
 it's 3 but we're back 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.660
 so from the beginning 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.210
 I spent a second part so the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.170
 second part of this solo I wanted a 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:59.210
 first time I wanted to be asked 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:03:02.780
 then and therefore we begin with 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:06.740
 threshold of 15.9 soil load afterwards 8 10 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:13.190
 has made it so we're going to make three tipper date 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:18.230
 so have ten times testers once two 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:25.630
 times the third time jma rise like 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.630
 we will see a pull off 8th from the beginning 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:35.920
 and the 3d is refueling and we will also 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.920
 box 8.5 in 2008 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.580
 then nine or the leak does not 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.989
 so a little thing it's a real 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.840
 we will come to place our index casdis 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:08.060
 on bark folder half our major in 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.050
 cause on the ground rope and we go with 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.890
 we're going to choke the strings 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:17.510
 you see we're going down this is a 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.100
 little thing like that is called eric and 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.500
 so have put the finger like that one 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.570
 goes down that he's going to do a manant box 12 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.010
 years follows so we place a little trick there 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:30.770
 eleven of the ten and we are there quickly because our 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.610
 bnq h 12 for athens of tone so when 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.610
 you did not expect me 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:45.310
 then we do it again nine so 1st 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:50.740
 May then another ben with a name 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.840
 missteps of Toulouse also makes 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.650
 we're going to the second but we're going back 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.400
 their drawing and we will play the box 10 which 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.400
 the beginning is sure rake 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:13.270
 in faith and so remained the second 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.800
 part I go on the third part 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.330
 in the third part we will do the same 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.650
 principle that rec doubt just now 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:24.770
 that we will go down two boxes so 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:28.520
 we are almost 8 and 9 we will do the 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:32.690
 same principle except that such 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.810
 band have trouble moving around so we 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:43.120
 does the same thing with crec 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:50.520
 then two beautiful occasions figuration 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:50.520
 at 15.8 so sometimes 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:06:01.360
 and we'll finish 108 some 2008 bull of 7 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:04.129
 a second time then 15.8 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.500
 Then what is this agreement balances 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:09.620
 binds to me is linehan k5 then 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:21.020
 still a solid break 4 and a finish to 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:30.949
 4.5 of a core 2 e so without deceiving 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:43.340
 when he will end up with a little trick 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:45.020
 dry kulov 4,7 the 400 kg 4 this is a 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.969
 little trick in the end so I recommend 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:52.670
 from the beginning with the right name with the 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:58.160
 poolers 15.8 so 8 9 was him 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:07:01.210
 it was the 4c ​​is still a little trick 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.210
 it's blurry 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.590
 one last time this third part 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:07.590
 in slow motion 

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:13.249
 1 

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:33.629
 and so that's for this little pink solo 

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:35.610
 floyd really are therefore accessible 

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:37.439

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.099
