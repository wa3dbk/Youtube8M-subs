00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the seeds I could just go right into the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.590 
the seeds I could just go right into the
garden<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.189> plant<00:01:11.490> some<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.820> these<00:01:11.909> seeds<00:01:12.210> in

garden and plant some of these seeds in
April<00:01:13.320> May<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:14.130> make<00:01:14.310> sure<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.210 
April May and just make sure that the
weeds<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.810> been<00:01:15.990> pulled<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.950> good

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
weeds have been pulled and it's a good

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.160 
weeds have been pulled and it's a good
usable<00:01:17.700> Earth<00:01:18.180> good<00:01:18.479> compost<00:01:18.990> or<00:01:19.110> potting

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
usable Earth good compost or potting

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.140 
usable Earth good compost or potting
soil<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.310> could<00:01:20.490> plant<00:01:20.729> them<00:01:20.790> right<00:01:21.000> into

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
soil and I could plant them right into

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.820 
soil and I could plant them right into
the<00:01:21.420> dirt<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.840> they<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:21.990> really<00:01:22.350> well<00:01:22.530> they

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the dirt and they do really well they

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.310 
the dirt and they do really well they
probably<00:01:23.040> come<00:01:23.310> right<00:01:23.520> up<00:01:23.750> but<00:01:24.750> because<00:01:25.140> my

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
probably come right up but because my

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.810 
probably come right up but because my
Gardens<00:01:25.650> kept<00:01:25.830> them<00:01:25.950> kind<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.220> crowded<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.759> I

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
Gardens kept them kind of crowded and I

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.149 
Gardens kept them kind of crowded and I
want<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> control<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:27.930> bit<00:01:28.170> I'm

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
want to control it a little bit I'm

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.560 
want to control it a little bit I'm
gonna<00:01:29.369> start<00:01:29.670> them<00:01:29.820> probably

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
gonna start them probably

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.380 
gonna start them probably
indoors<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.590> an<00:01:31.860> easy<00:01:32.070> trick<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.700> found<00:01:33.060> is

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
indoors and an easy trick I found is

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.310 
indoors and an easy trick I found is
just<00:01:34.350> put<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.890> napkin<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.850> plate<00:01:36.180> put<00:01:37.079> some

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
just put a napkin on a plate put some

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.200 
just put a napkin on a plate put some
seeds<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.009> napkin<00:01:38.250> put<00:01:38.700> another<00:01:38.939> napkin

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
seeds on that napkin put another napkin

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.410

dark warm location and the seeds will

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.340 
dark warm location and the seeds will
start<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.970> sprout<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.810> as<00:01:45.960> soon<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.200> they

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
start to sprout and as soon as they

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
your garden where you want them to grow

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.450 
your garden where you want them to grow
we're<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.720> container<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.439> that's<00:01:53.009> easy<00:01:53.250> as

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
we're in a container and that's easy as

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.850 
we're in a container and that's easy as
well<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.299> could<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:54.869> put<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.380> seeds<00:01:55.649> into

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
well or I could just put the seeds into

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.410 
well or I could just put the seeds into
some<00:01:56.189> paper<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.729> put<00:01:56.850> them<00:01:56.909> into<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.210> plastic

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
some paper and put them into a plastic

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.810 
some paper and put them into a plastic
bag<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.680> found<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.130> works<00:01:59.399> really<00:01:59.549> well

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
bag and I found that works really well

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.389 
bag and I found that works really well
too<00:02:00.149> cuz<00:02:00.329> then<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.630> never<00:02:00.840> dries<00:02:01.110> out<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:02.040> I

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
too cuz then that never dries out and I

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.770 
too cuz then that never dries out and I
just<00:02:02.430> check<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:02.939> them<00:02:03.090> every<00:02:03.180> day<00:02:03.329> or<00:02:03.659> every

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
just check on them every day or every

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.060 
just check on them every day or every
couple<00:02:04.020> days<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.530> as<00:02:04.619> soon<00:02:04.740> as<00:02:04.829> they<00:02:04.979> have

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
couple days and as soon as they have

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.249 
couple days and as soon as they have
sprouts<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.610> throw<00:02:05.850> them<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.090> ground<00:02:06.270> I've

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
sprouts I throw them in the ground I've

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.770 
sprouts I throw them in the ground I've
also<00:02:07.530> used<00:02:07.979> different<00:02:08.459> seed<00:02:08.729> starter<00:02:09.209> kits<00:02:09.479> so

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
also used different seed starter kits so

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.559 
also used different seed starter kits so
you<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:10.259> use<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:11.129> lot<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.819> soil<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.300> you

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
you can use a lot of the soil that you

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.130 
you can use a lot of the soil that you
use

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
use

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.260 
use
start<00:02:13.380> seeds<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.920> high<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.220> vermiculite<00:02:14.730> so

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
start seeds is high in vermiculite so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.199 
start seeds is high in vermiculite so
it's<00:02:15.450> got<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.050> lot<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.380> Airy<00:02:16.850> kind<00:02:17.850> of<00:02:17.940> peat<00:02:18.180> moss

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
it's got a lot of Airy kind of peat moss

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.500 
it's got a lot of Airy kind of peat moss
soil<00:02:18.990> in<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:21.000> I'll<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.150> put<00:02:21.480> some

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
soil in it and so I'll just put some

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.510 
soil in it and so I'll just put some
soil<00:02:21.990> in<00:02:22.110> here<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.500> put<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.709> seeds<00:02:22.980> about<00:02:23.190> one

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
soil in here and put the seeds about one

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.430 
soil in here and put the seeds about one
or<00:02:23.640> two<00:02:23.670> inches<00:02:23.940> deep<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.600> keep<00:02:25.020> watering

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
or two inches deep and keep watering

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.290 
or two inches deep and keep watering
them<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:25.980> tree<00:02:26.160> trick<00:02:26.580> with<00:02:26.760> seeds<00:02:27.060> is

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
them and the tree trick with seeds is

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.840 
them and the tree trick with seeds is
don't<00:02:27.569> throw<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.500> water<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.800> heavily<00:02:29.459> kind<00:02:29.790> of

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
don't throw the water on heavily kind of

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.410 
don't throw the water on heavily kind of
miss<00:02:30.090> them<00:02:30.330> or<00:02:30.600> put<00:02:31.290> cloth<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.980> top<00:02:32.310> or<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.000> sheet

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
miss them or put cloth on top or a sheet

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.100 
miss them or put cloth on top or a sheet
or<00:02:33.810> any<00:02:34.650> type<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.040> cheesecloth<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.900> water

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
or any type of cheesecloth and the water

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.630 
or any type of cheesecloth and the water
will<00:02:37.260> go<00:02:37.410> right<00:02:37.620> through<00:02:37.800> without<00:02:38.100> disturbing

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
will go right through without disturbing

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.220 
will go right through without disturbing
the<00:02:38.790> soil<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.390> then<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.630> seeds<00:02:39.900> will<00:02:40.050> grow

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
the soil and then the seeds will grow

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.650 
the soil and then the seeds will grow
real<00:02:40.470> easily<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.820> there's<00:02:42.000> lots<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.330> different

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
real easily so there's lots of different

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.120 
real easily so there's lots of different
methods<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:43.170> grow<00:02:43.319> seeds<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.770> can<00:02:43.890> put<00:02:44.040> them

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
methods to grow seeds you can put them

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.500 
methods to grow seeds you can put them
right<00:02:44.280> into<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.640> ground<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.150> can<00:02:45.209> start

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
right into the ground and you can start

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.870 
right into the ground and you can start
them<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.840> seed<00:02:46.050> starter<00:02:46.470> kit<00:02:46.709> or<00:02:47.250> start<00:02:47.700> them

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
them in a seed starter kit or start them

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.030 
them in a seed starter kit or start them
in<00:02:48.000> paper<00:02:48.209> towels<00:02:48.570> but<00:02:49.230> anyway<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.650> start

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
in paper towels but anyway you start

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.979 
in paper towels but anyway you start
them<00:02:50.160> they're<00:02:50.370> easy<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.880> grow<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.810> best

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
them they're easy to grow and the best

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.830 
them they're easy to grow and the best
time<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.410> grow<00:02:52.560> them<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:52.950> after<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.370> last

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
time to grow them is after the last

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.810 
time to grow them is after the last
heavy<00:02:54.840> frost<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.530> spring<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.790> can

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
heavy frost in the spring and you can

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.320 
heavy frost in the spring and you can
also<00:02:57.120> plant<00:02:57.570> them<00:02:57.690> through<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.110> fall
