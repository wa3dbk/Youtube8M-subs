00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
insane so if we do go ahead and look at

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.880 
insane so if we do go ahead and look at
the<00:02:48.420> whole<00:02:48.660> entire<00:02:48.930> score<00:02:49.230> itself<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.769> just

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
the whole entire score itself it's just

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.849 
the whole entire score itself it's just
basically<00:02:50.579> a<00:02:50.700> hundred<00:02:50.940> percent<00:02:51.859> destruction

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
basically a hundred percent destruction

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.599
