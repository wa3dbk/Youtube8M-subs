now I'm not sure which ones are true

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:59.189 
now I'm not sure which ones are true
stereo<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:57.789> which<00:00:57.879> ones<00:00:58.059> are<00:00:58.179> just<00:00:58.210> mono<00:00:58.539> I'm

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
stereo and which ones are just mono I'm

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.599 
stereo and which ones are just mono I'm
gonna<00:00:59.379> let<00:00:59.499> the<00:00:59.589> system<00:00:59.769> figure<00:01:00.129> that<00:01:00.249> out<00:01:00.399> for

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
gonna let the system figure that out for

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.259 
gonna let the system figure that out for
us<00:01:02.100> by<00:01:03.100> selecting<00:01:03.489> all<00:01:03.579> the<00:01:03.609> clips<00:01:03.879> in<00:01:03.999> the<00:01:04.089> bin

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
us by selecting all the clips in the bin

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.330

the<00:01:10.510> option<00:01:10.780> I'll<00:01:10.870> use<00:01:10.990> for<00:01:11.170> modifying<00:01:11.620> is<00:01:11.890> the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
the option I'll use for modifying is the

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.000 
the option I'll use for modifying is the

can see it only takes up one track on
the<00:01:34.150> source<00:01:34.360> side<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:34.900> I'll<00:01:35.650> just<00:01:35.770> cut<00:01:36.010> it<00:01:36.040> in

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
the source side and I'll just cut it in

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.560 
the source side and I'll just cut it in

most people here I'm a thinker that's

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.630 
most people here I'm a thinker that's
just<00:02:18.409> the<00:02:18.470> beginning<00:02:18.530> because<00:02:19.340> now<00:02:19.489> we<00:02:19.549> can

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
just the beginning because now we can

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.059

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
actually expand the track control panel

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.390 
actually expand the track control panel
to<00:02:22.610> show<00:02:22.790> even<00:02:23.239> more<00:02:23.510> new<00:02:23.780> audio<00:02:24.079> features<00:02:24.470> for

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
example I can choose to engage a

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.710 
example I can choose to engage a

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
waveform on each individual track so

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.330 
waveform on each individual track so

with all the different waveforms I could

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.509 
with all the different waveforms I could
select<00:02:33.140> which<00:02:33.379> tracks<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.829> want<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.159> waveform

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
select which tracks I want the waveform

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.030 
select which tracks I want the waveform
on<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:35.659> can<00:02:35.780> also<00:02:35.900> go<00:02:36.109> in<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.409> choose<00:02:36.799> whether

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
on you can also go in and choose whether

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.220 
on you can also go in and choose whether
or<00:02:37.099> not<00:02:37.159> to<00:02:37.310> show<00:02:37.430> clip<00:02:37.730> gain<00:02:37.939> Auto<00:02:38.659> gain<00:02:38.959> or

finally<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.940> have<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.150> deactivate<00:02:43.750> button

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
finally you have the deactivate button

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.600 
finally you have the deactivate button
which<00:02:44.350> actually<00:02:44.740> turns<00:02:45.010> off<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.370> entire

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
which actually turns off the entire

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.490 
which actually turns off the entire
track<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.780> system<00:02:47.020> isn't<00:02:47.140> using<00:02:47.440> any

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
track so the system isn't using any

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.160

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
resources to play it back I'll do that

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.210 
resources to play it back I'll do that
