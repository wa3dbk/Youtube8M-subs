00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.370
 today we talk about slow travel or yes 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.219
 could also be defined as a race 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.300
 aerobics because it must be developed 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.730
 of low intensities of low speeds 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.550
 this wanting to make a reference 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.880
 cardiac means staying on the 130 140 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.500
 beats per minute but giving reference 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.990
 a little bit wider because then 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.160
 obviously the frequencies fluctuate from 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.980
 subject to subject 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.019
 I would say that under 150 you can 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.000
 consider that a race takes place 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.729
 aerobics a slow run 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.760
 this data is very important and often 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:47.000
 is underestimated by the runner because i 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.530
 most tend to run a race 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.080
 so called slow but in fact slow not 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.600
 it's never too fast to give an example 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.320
 we can talk about marathon runners 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.119
 comes to my mind going back to the past 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.229
 gelindo bordin who ran the marathon 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:06.930
 301 per km and slow on some of his 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.810
 training programs then published 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.290
 it was clear that he ran it around 347 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.300
 about 45 seconds above the marathon rhythm 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.640
 now I wonder why so many runners 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.340
 actually the slow run at the pace 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.890
 marathon as if to say bordin knows this 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.980
 run the slow at 3 km this is the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.590
 question that I sometimes ask and from this yes 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.620
 should understand that even the amateur who 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.680
 runs the marathon in 3 hours and 30 that is 5 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.720
 at km as never before, then the 5-inch lenses run 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.520
 kilometer and do not happen then 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.530
 improvements but it is obvious why it is a 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.900
 runner who always runs at speed 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.270
 medium-high and never stages the stage 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.940
 pure aerobics then what the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.070
 main mechanism for running the 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.560
 marathon and then meets the 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.360
 failure and the problem after that is not that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.680
 when it goes into crisis 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.900
 at the thirty-fifth to the thirty-seventh e 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.630
 he believes that machines km kilometers do not 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.760
 is missing is that it has burned much more 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.959
 much more fuel energy in the first 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.650
 run phase because the is not used to the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.770
 body to consume little gasoline 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.230
 this is 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.170
 the most important phase then the race 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.060
 Aerobics Slow running is very useful 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.440
 like a repeated training because 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.300
 educates the body and muscle fiber a a 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.240
 consume in the right way that is a 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.670
 optimize consumption therefore by one 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.730
 part of the training must improve the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.650
 speed speeds up the pace and must 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.200
 improve but at the same time useless 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.850
 have more gasoline available 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.240
 if then in the unity of time it is done 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.520
 burn in little then you have one 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.910
 machine a powerful engine but at the time 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.300
 same economic and this and must 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.010
 always remember it and to optimize the 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.610
 heritage and robicheaux is precisely the 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.690
 slow travel that serves this 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.160
 therefore closing I would say that it is necessary 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.550
 use this medium 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.280
 if a heart rate monitor is valid 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.230
 under 150 beats per minute 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.670
 if instead reference is made to 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.000
 a running pace 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.400
 you have to run it around 45 50 seconds in 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.980
 some cases that a beginner even a 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.260
 minute above or slower 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.690
 I respect the money or no rhythm at all 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.380
 a simple rhythm of a 10 race 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.380
 km
