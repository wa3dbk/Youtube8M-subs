00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:20.910
 0105 then 01 series but in general it does not matter 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:25.730
 four goals conceded in the minority 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.050
 it certainly disappoints us 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.590
 pay much attention to not 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.239
 It turned out all the same in general, I wait from 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.910
 guys so that they still play all the same 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.750
 heart all the same we have a lot of young 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.520
 players who have never played 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.340
 playoffs but I will say it again 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.270
 give a little more give more 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.510
 nothing more terrible here in general 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.510
 not 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.780
 so after the first game 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.780
 a lot and what to say honestly effort 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.780
 fit 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.070
 bible yourself look in 2 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.910
 thinks massive Slovaks 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.980
 I didn't see us all a few hands aboard 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.980
 lose 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.980
 look 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:07.100
 that life is chrome believe no 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.060
 installations even players hurt the player 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.470
 I can do an intro 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.830
 what on 100 is not there if you please 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:21.370
 3 numbers question did not seem that. that 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.370
 did the captain old men design said 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.069
 emotional hair pass machine 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.700
 help and could zaytsev and 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:50.500
 why most 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.420
 further boy need if there is 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.810
 cable shielded street soccer and 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.730
 beat it all along course disciplines 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:04.269
 can not what we are with Sarah to the teams 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:06.780
 channel hangar but most of us time to 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:11.350
 Unfortunately, our majority 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.819
 also leaves much to be desired again . 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.590
 although very little said more 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.590
 I hope for research 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.060
 low will become 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.150
 Sergey of course but somehow more power 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.150
 this 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:53.469
 why no comment on this 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.260
 will just try to play his nose 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:58.260
 so very much boy more 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:13.209
 but arena and gusev or romanova 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.209
 behind the air is impressive beads and 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.209
 effects 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:37.190
 just like cowards 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.940
 I do not know yet is not talking 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.460
 now doctor 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:47.210
 one but he can play but while I 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:49.970
 have not received it yet 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.510
 as we saw their puck match match 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.510
 regular season 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:33.479
 Do you need a sharp ar machine ? 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.819
 olga 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:39.340
 discount and hard answer this question 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:42.909
 Today, only the first game in the series 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.470
 so today's limiting 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:46.210
 shows can not do any 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.530
 preliminary conclusions therefore 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.530
 let's stay
