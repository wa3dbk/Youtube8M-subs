00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.160 
and if you've opened the application
which<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.500> recommend<00:00:43.950> doing<00:00:44.480> so<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.020> open

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
which I recommend doing so if you open

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.090 
which I recommend doing so if you open
the<00:00:46.350> game<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.770> recently<00:00:47.120> it'll<00:00:48.120> come<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.450> here

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
so you want to go and open it up and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
so you want to go and open it up and

you do have a different graphics card
not<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> Radeon<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.360> basically

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
not a Radeon one you can just basically

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.640 
not a Radeon one you can just basically
go<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> your<00:01:15.960> control<00:01:16.380> panel<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:18.650> find

you<00:01:50.340> did<00:01:51.329> something<00:01:51.600> stupid<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.049> me<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.590> had

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you did something stupid like me and had

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.090 
you did something stupid like me and had
to<00:01:52.950> start<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.820> game<00:01:53.970> up<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.299> safe<00:01:54.540> mode<00:01:55.100> or

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
to start the game up in safe mode or

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.649 
to start the game up in safe mode or
just<00:01:56.430> muck<00:01:56.610> around<00:01:56.759> with<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> settings<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
just muck around with the settings and

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.219 
just muck around with the settings and
it's<00:01:57.810> not<00:01:57.960> working<00:01:58.290> properly<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.079> gonna

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
