ergonomics are showing how effectively
our<00:00:54.400> shoes<00:00:54.730> spread<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.390> load<00:00:55.570> out<00:00:55.900> as<00:00:56.170> a

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
our shoes spread the load out as a

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.840 
our shoes spread the load out as a
person<00:00:56.710> stands<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:57.460> walks<00:00:59.040> load<00:01:00.040> leveling<00:01:00.610> is

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
person stands and walks load leveling is

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.350 
person stands and walks load leveling is
the<00:01:01.480> ability<00:01:01.809> of<00:01:02.199> a<00:01:02.290> material<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:03.000> take<00:01:04.000> the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
the ability of a material to take the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.270 
the ability of a material to take the
high<00:01:04.540> pressure<00:01:04.900> points<00:01:05.350> away<00:01:05.650> from<00:01:05.890> your<00:01:06.040> foot

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
high pressure points away from your foot

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.040 
high pressure points away from your foot
and<00:01:06.310> spread<00:01:06.850> them<00:01:07.060> out<00:01:07.150> over<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.540> broader<00:01:07.810> area

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
and spread them out over a broader area

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.530 
and spread them out over a broader area
so<00:01:08.890> when<00:01:09.100> we<00:01:09.220> talk<00:01:09.430> about<00:01:09.729> cross<00:01:10.030> light<00:01:10.300> we're

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
so when we talk about cross light we're

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.359 
so when we talk about cross light we're
talking<00:01:10.960> really<00:01:11.290> about<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.680> science<00:01:12.190> that

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
talking really about the science that

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.760 
talking really about the science that
goes<00:01:12.550> into<00:01:12.880> all<00:01:13.060> of<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.300> crop<00:01:13.540> shoes<00:01:13.869> one<00:01:14.650> of

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
goes into all of the crop shoes one of

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.990 
goes into all of the crop shoes one of
the<00:01:14.830> things<00:01:15.040> that<00:01:15.190> makes<00:01:15.400> cross<00:01:15.729> light

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
the things that makes cross light

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.730 
the things that makes cross light
material<00:01:16.509> unique<00:01:16.810> is<00:01:16.990> its<00:01:17.289> ability<00:01:17.710> to

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
material unique is its ability to

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.160 
material unique is its ability to
perform<00:01:18.250> both<00:01:18.610> as<00:01:18.850> an<00:01:18.970> open<00:01:19.300> cell<00:01:19.539> and<00:01:19.810> a

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
perform both as an open cell and a

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.350 
perform both as an open cell and a
closed<00:01:20.380> cell<00:01:20.649> phone<00:01:20.920> this<00:01:21.490> is<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:21.729> typical<00:01:22.210> open

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
closed cell phone this is a typical open

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.840 
closed cell phone this is a typical open
cell<00:01:22.750> phone<00:01:23.050> it's<00:01:23.590> very<00:01:23.890> lightweight<00:01:24.190> it's

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
cell phone it's very lightweight it's

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.550

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
very soft and very flexible and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.590 
very soft and very flexible and
comfortable<00:01:27.009> to<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.310> field<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:28.240> problem

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
comfortable to the field the problem

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.749 
comfortable to the field the problem
with<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.780> is<00:01:29.050> it<00:01:29.289> compresses<00:01:29.770> very<00:01:30.130> easily<00:01:30.340> and

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
with it is it compresses very easily and

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.480 
with it is it compresses very easily and
it<00:01:31.450> absorbs<00:01:31.570> water<00:01:32.050> so<00:01:32.590> when<00:01:33.039> you<00:01:33.130> put<00:01:33.369> this

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
it absorbs water so when you put this

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.389 
it absorbs water so when you put this
material<00:01:34.000> in<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.149> shoe<00:01:34.420> it<00:01:34.990> very<00:01:35.410> quickly<00:01:35.679> gets

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
closed cell foam the benefit is that you

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.520 
closed cell foam the benefit is that you
get<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.149> material<00:01:46.600> that's<00:01:46.690> much<00:01:46.899> more<00:01:47.080> durable

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
get a material that's much more durable

how that golf ball is going right

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.860 
how that golf ball is going right
through<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:42.099> open<00:02:42.610> cell<00:02:42.819> foam<00:02:42.870> compressing

through the open cell foam compressing
it<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.170> making<00:02:44.680> contact<00:02:45.160> with<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> table<00:02:45.790> if

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
it and making contact with the table if

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.960 
it and making contact with the table if
I<00:02:46.660> go<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.989> closed<00:02:47.230> cell<00:02:47.530> phone<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:48.730> hear

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
I go to the closed cell phone you hear

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.490 
I go to the closed cell phone you hear
that<00:02:49.090> it's<00:02:49.239> not<00:02:49.390> going<00:02:49.690> through<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.080> table

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
that it's not going through to the table

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.930 
that it's not going through to the table
but<00:02:50.680> because<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.190> foam<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.550> hard<00:02:51.790> it's

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
but because the foam is hard it's

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.720 
but because the foam is hard it's
bouncing<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.510> shock<00:02:52.719> right<00:02:52.989> back<00:02:53.200> up

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
bouncing the shock right back up

when you tap the combination of the two

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.790 
when you tap the combination of the two
you'll<00:02:57.390> hear<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.200> there<00:02:58.349> isn't<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> lot<00:02:58.769> of

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
you'll hear that there isn't a lot of

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.380 
you'll hear that there isn't a lot of
difference<00:02:59.250> between<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.670> regular<00:02:59.940> closed

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
to the cross light material what you'll

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.979 
to the cross light material what you'll
hear<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.519> definite<00:03:09.180> dampening<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.840> the
