00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.370
 welcome to the announcement of the patch le goff 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.139
 legends and africa next to me lead 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.509
 champion designer morello 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.450
 together we will discuss some changes 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.010
 gameplay next patch 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.230
 note that in this video not 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.150
 will be told about all the changes 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.850
 but we will explain from our thoughts in 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.369
 some of them are the biggest 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.820
 changes relate to elimination longer as 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.949
 one of the gaming characteristics behind this 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.230
 should be significant processing jax 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.059
 although dodging will be generally removed from 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.950
 games jones will get unique 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.890
 short-term ability 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.050
 one hundred percent chance of dodging if you 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.809
 interested in the details see the review 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.300
 Jax on the link in the video description that we 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.219
 We want to achieve a result and so when we 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.520
 removed dodging many wondered 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.110
 question and what's more jaxon we 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.789
 approached this problem by several 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.010
 ways and think that the players will be 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.649
 happy especially lovers jax 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.080
 first dodging still remains 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.180
 a business card jax we mean 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.400
 that counter-strike is now on small 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.010
 time span gives one hundred percent 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.229
 chance of dodging compared to how 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.600
 you used to be dodging and hoping 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.270
 that it will work this ability has become 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.490
 more reliable now jaxx can torment 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.820
 her at the moment when the greatest is expected 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.580
 damage 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.259
 it is especially physically easy to survive. 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.680
 then break in with your crown 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.600
 mass stunning this ability is not 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.670
 will only require mastery of treatment 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.829
 but will separate the good jax under 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.049
 very good last will 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.090
 maximally reduce incoming damage and 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.049
 also wait the perfect moment for 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.659
 stunning 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.869
 we really want to see how the players 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.759
 will handle this one more 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.189
 change is equally about time 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.100
 recovery ability of persons trike m 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.140
 power is a matter of jaxx mile wrapper 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.390
 than a fighter with permanent damage 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.060
 so in this patch we made a cooldown 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.159
 m-power is much smaller that allows 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.909
 use the ability much more often and 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.160
 make damage more stable 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.780
 One change jax in this patch is 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.640
 his passive ability 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.740
 we removed the old version 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.290
 converting characteristics it becomes 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.090
 fat before the start of the love game and when 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.160
 This applied a lot of damage and 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.590
 the enemy could do almost nothing 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.350
 we have done it for Jax 100 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.480
 penitent woman on attack speed this 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.450
 allow it to apply more steady 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.120
 the damage you talked about earlier as well 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.160
 very effective jungle we are very pleased 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.239
 see jax both on the line and in the forest 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.980
 and the opportunity 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.980
 given the elimination of deviations nejat both 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.690
 also awaiting change instead of dodging 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.180
 they will now give a percentage 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.630
 damage reduction from all auto attacks except 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.239
 bash 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.160
 what role will they play now we 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.080
 expect him to have a concise look 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.660
 useful in the former role as veroni 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.760
 if not more we wanted to save and 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.800
 as a cheap boot to protect against 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.200
 physical damage this will be achieved 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.300
 reduced damage to shoes 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.040
 the same recipe will remain 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.170
 well, the last item of the program 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.269
 is the sword of divine which 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.400
 let your champion on a few 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.310
 seconds ignore enemy dodging 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.380
 what will become of this artifact looking at 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.510
 this subject we are thinking and what is it 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.519
 will now make and the result of our 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.950
 work became a subject very similar to and and 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.110
 alex spark ev dominion instead 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.239
 to make almost identical artifacts 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.310
 we allowed players to buy and onyx 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.860
 the park itself is not a font and twister triline 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.260
 this interesting item also has a use 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.150
 on attack speed and is pretty 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.250
 extraordinary so we thought why 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.790
 wouldn't move a funny thing out 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.829
 dominion classic time in this 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.780
 the patch is driven by slight changes and 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.910
 and health regeneration is somewhat 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.579
 will decrease and part of the damage will be shifted to 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.860
 side wrapping paper why are we not fim 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.040
 riven secondly why are we shifting the freak 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.110
 broccoli and and change concerns her strength 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.269
 on line we continue to observe the picture 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.489
 when arimin dominates practically on 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.769
 any line we change and and level 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.480
 health recovery up like guys 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.519
 there is a shield then you stand show 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.500
 recovery of health in combination with 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.840
 it meant that the damage was not 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.910
 to break through the shield 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.310
 so hard damage must persist 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.039
 we changed the theme of pumping broken 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.510
 wings and fibers you should pump 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.280
 whales if you want in 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.060
 or often use stun and 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.170
 reduce it during recovery 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.380
 leveling broken wings should be 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.940
 alternative to increase damage 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.100
