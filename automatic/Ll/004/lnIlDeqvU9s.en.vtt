where<00:01:50.549> there<00:01:50.700> are<00:01:50.759> little<00:01:50.939> boiled<00:01:51.390> puddings

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
where there are little boiled puddings

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.969 
where there are little boiled puddings
they're<00:01:52.110> very<00:01:52.290> small<00:01:52.530> they<00:01:52.649> don't<00:01:52.680> take

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
they're very small they don't take

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.240 
they're very small they don't take
nearly<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:54.030> long<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.420> cook<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.829> amount

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
nearly as long to cook so the the amount

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.800 
nearly as long to cook so the the amount
of<00:01:56.399> time<00:01:56.640> really<00:01:56.880> has<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.149> do<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.329> how<00:01:57.450> big

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
of time really has to do with how big

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.249 
of time really has to do with how big
the<00:01:58.350> ball<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.369> the<00:02:00.240> fact<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.899> does

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the ball is and the fact that it does

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.679 
the ball is and the fact that it does
take<00:02:01.500> quite<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.890> while<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.280> these<00:02:03.090> the
