start typing CMD to open the command

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.300 
start typing CMD to open the command
prompt<00:02:06.290> now<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.469> here<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.190> need<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.729> locate

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
prompt now in here you need to locate

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.050 
prompt now in here you need to locate
the<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.550> model<00:02:11.940> file

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
the you model file

so<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.050> do<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:15.040> need<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.190> change<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.819> the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
so to do that you need to change to the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.770 
so to do that you need to change to the
right<00:02:16.650> drive<00:02:17.650> some<00:02:18.520> lines<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.910> E<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.360> put<00:02:19.630> a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
right drive some lines in E I put a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.979 
right drive some lines in E I put a
double<00:02:20.020> dot<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:20.650> put<00:02:21.489> CD<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.510> change<00:02:22.810> the

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
double dot and put CD to change the

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.949 
double dot and put CD to change the
directory<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.880> we<00:02:25.270> just<00:02:25.480> copy<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.840> directory

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
directory so we just copy the directory

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.940 
directory so we just copy the directory
there<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.860> paste<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.880> direct<00:02:28.239> in<00:02:28.360> here<00:02:28.599> and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
there and paste the direct in here and

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
so now we're in this directory here we

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.290 
so now we're in this directory here we
can<00:02:34.000> load<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.269> model<00:02:34.630> so<00:02:34.989> we<00:02:35.140> go<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.590> Maru<00:02:36.300> and

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300
