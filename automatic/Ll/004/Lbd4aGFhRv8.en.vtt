the<00:02:04.979> food<00:02:05.219> without<00:02:06.409> just<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.530> food<00:02:07.680> itself

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the food without just the food itself

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.619

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
because sometimes it's just a little bit

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.619 
because sometimes it's just a little bit
too<00:02:09.869> strong<00:02:10.200> for<00:02:10.950> him<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.280> eat<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:12.090> basically

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
texture to it so again you could do this

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.600

which I use five and then i weaned down
and<00:05:47.920> it<00:05:48.160> also<00:05:48.310> makes<00:05:48.460> it<00:05:48.730> thinner<00:05:49.150> so<00:05:49.750> you<00:05:50.080> know

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
and it also makes it thinner so you know

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.020 
and it also makes it thinner so you know
if<00:05:50.500> you<00:05:50.680> if<00:05:51.040> the<00:05:51.220> baby<00:05:51.400> just<00:05:51.700> started<00:05:51.940> eating

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
if you if the baby just started eating

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.030 
if you if the baby just started eating
you<00:05:52.360> can<00:05:52.480> add<00:05:52.630> more<00:05:52.810> milk<00:05:52.990> to<00:05:53.200> it<00:05:53.230> water<00:05:53.770> or

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
you can add more milk to it water or

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.940 
you can add more milk to it water or
breasts<00:05:54.370> or<00:05:54.490> formula<00:05:55.320> and<00:05:56.320> then<00:05:56.530> kind<00:05:56.830> of

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
breasts or formula and then kind of

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.830 
breasts or formula and then kind of
weaned<00:05:57.400> off<00:05:57.430> so<00:05:57.910> what<00:05:58.060> I'm<00:05:58.180> doing<00:05:58.210> is<00:05:58.600> right

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
weaned off so what I'm doing is right

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.750 
weaned off so what I'm doing is right
now<00:05:59.350> I<00:05:59.620> put<00:05:59.860> five<00:06:00.100> in<00:06:00.280> there<00:06:00.400> today<00:06:00.690> but<00:06:01.690> I<00:06:02.760> wind

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
now I put five in there today but I wind

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.760 
now I put five in there today but I wind
them<00:06:03.880> down<00:06:03.910> to<00:06:04.180> 4<00:06:04.510> tablespoons<00:06:05.050> of<00:06:05.590> breast

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
them down to 4 tablespoons of breast

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:06.239 
them down to 4 tablespoons of breast
milk<00:06:05.830> and<00:06:06.100> then

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:06.249 
milk and then

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:07.559 
milk and then
go<00:06:06.429> down<00:06:06.579> three<00:06:06.909> and<00:06:06.939> then<00:06:07.179> I'll<00:06:07.269> go<00:06:07.359> down<00:06:07.539> to

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569 
go down three and then I'll go down to

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.599 
go down three and then I'll go down to
two<00:06:07.809> so<00:06:08.319> this<00:06:08.439> way<00:06:08.619> he's<00:06:08.769> gets<00:06:08.979> the<00:06:09.129> real<00:06:09.309> taste

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:09.609 
two so this way he's gets the real taste

00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:11.879 
two so this way he's gets the real taste
of<00:06:09.789> the<00:06:09.939> food<00:06:10.119> but<00:06:10.359> it's<00:06:10.509> a<00:06:10.539> great<00:06:10.809> way<00:06:11.019> for<00:06:11.709> him

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
of the food but it's a great way for him

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:13.379 
of the food but it's a great way for him
to<00:06:11.919> eat<00:06:12.279> more<00:06:12.549> because<00:06:12.729> he's<00:06:12.969> familiar<00:06:13.149> with

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
to eat more because he's familiar with

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:14.549 
to eat more because he's familiar with
the<00:06:13.479> breast<00:06:13.719> milk<00:06:13.929> and<00:06:14.049> he's<00:06:14.139> familiar<00:06:14.319> with

00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:14.559 
the breast milk and he's familiar with

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:17.519 
the breast milk and he's familiar with
the<00:06:14.679> rice<00:06:14.859> cereal<00:06:15.269> so<00:06:16.269> I<00:06:16.299> think<00:06:16.629> the<00:06:16.839> creamy

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529 
the rice cereal so I think the creamy

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:18.899 
the rice cereal so I think the creamy
purees<00:06:17.919> and<00:06:18.129> vegetables<00:06:18.489> work<00:06:18.669> better

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
purees and vegetables work better

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:22.019 
purees and vegetables work better
because<00:06:19.419> he<00:06:19.599> wasn't<00:06:19.809> really<00:06:20.079> eating<00:06:20.819> the<00:06:21.819> baby

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:22.029 
because he wasn't really eating the baby

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:24.179 
because he wasn't really eating the baby
food<00:06:22.269> without<00:06:22.509> anything<00:06:23.169> extra<00:06:23.589> added<00:06:23.949> to<00:06:24.069> it

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:24.189 
food without anything extra added to it

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:26.309 
food without anything extra added to it
so<00:06:24.489> if<00:06:25.149> you<00:06:25.239> have<00:06:25.329> a<00:06:25.389> finicky<00:06:25.689> baby<00:06:25.929> I<00:06:26.139> would

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 
so if you have a finicky baby I would

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.599 
so if you have a finicky baby I would
definitely<00:06:26.439> recommend<00:06:26.679> you<00:06:27.009> try<00:06:27.159> the<00:06:27.279> creamy

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:27.609

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:13.779 
milk or water and then I just kind of

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:15.269 
milk or water and then I just kind of
leaned<00:07:13.989> it<00:07:14.139> out<00:07:14.229> to<00:07:14.469> where<00:07:14.619> it's<00:07:14.739> just<00:07:14.949> a<00:07:15.069> pure

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:15.279 
leaned it out to where it's just a pure

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:17.009

vegetable maybe with a little bit of
rice<00:07:17.229> cereal<00:07:17.259> so<00:07:17.889> it's<00:07:18.429> a<00:07:18.519> good<00:07:18.699> variation<00:07:19.389> on

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:19.929

food so this way he's getting his dairy
he's<00:07:22.209> getting<00:07:22.449> his<00:07:22.539> grains<00:07:22.839> he's<00:07:23.139> getting<00:07:23.439> his

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:23.529 
he's getting his grains he's getting his

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:25.379 
he's getting his grains he's getting his
vegetable<00:07:24.039> also<00:07:24.789> and<00:07:24.969> again<00:07:25.179> you<00:07:25.299> could

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:25.389 
vegetable also and again you could
