ability actually activate which makes it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.770 
ability actually activate which makes it
impossible<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.820> bonus<00:01:30.180> damage<00:01:30.420> that

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
impossible is that the bonus damage that

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.200 
impossible is that the bonus damage that
is<00:01:31.020> infamous<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.710> hitting<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.460> enemies<00:01:33.060> with

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
so the second hit marker let's say you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.330 
so the second hit marker let's say you
hit<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.450> thousand<00:01:39.990> damage<00:01:40.259> very<00:01:40.530> critical<00:01:40.950> and
