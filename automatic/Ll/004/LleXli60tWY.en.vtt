so we could sort of meet privately but

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.969 
so we could sort of meet privately but

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.560 

I<00:01:46.560> think<00:01:47.400> for<00:01:47.580> both<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.730> us<00:01:48.000> when<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.270> know<00:01:48.450> we

knew when we met we both wanted kids

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.960 
knew when we met we both wanted kids
that<00:01:51.570> was<00:01:51.720> something<00:01:52.050> that<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:53.340> was<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.880> know

that was something that it was you know
in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.120> future<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:54.600> we've<00:01:54.750> learned<00:01:54.870> a<00:01:55.050> couple

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
in the future but we've learned a couple

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.469 
in the future but we've learned a couple
of<00:01:55.350> years<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.800> us<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:56.190> able<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.420> sort<00:01:57.420> of

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and sort of be a little bit

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.230 
and sort of be a little bit
irresponsible<00:02:01.520> right<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:02.850> two<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.150> us

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
irresponsible right just the two of us

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.660 
I think that we really sort of got
serious<00:02:07.740> about<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.310> can't<00:02:08.550> remember

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
serious about it and I can't remember

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.960 
serious about it and I can't remember
the<00:02:08.940> year<00:02:09.709> we<00:02:10.709> were<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:10.920> Phoenix<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.640> remember

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
the year we were in Phoenix I remember

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.720 
the year we were in Phoenix I remember
laying<00:02:12.270> out<00:02:12.420> by<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.959> pool<00:02:13.290> at<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.800> Marriott

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
laying out by the pool at the Marriott

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.940 
laying out by the pool at the Marriott
Desert<00:02:14.910> Ridge<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.690> thinking<00:02:16.440> okay<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:16.800> it

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
Desert Ridge and thinking okay is it

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.729 
Desert Ridge and thinking okay is it
time<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.340> maybe<00:02:17.520> start<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.420> then<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:19.530> thought

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
time to maybe start and then we thought

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.910 
time to maybe start and then we thought
well<00:02:19.920> no<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:21.120> then<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.930> think<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.500> was<00:02:22.650> Lynn

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
well no and then I think it was Lynn

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.420 
well no and then I think it was Lynn
Zach's<00:02:23.250> brother<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.360> his<00:02:25.050> wife<00:02:25.220> got<00:02:26.220> pregnant

that we're like okay we have to go ahead

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.699 
that we're like okay we have to go ahead
now<00:02:29.489> too<00:02:29.550> because<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.600> timings<00:02:30.989> right<00:02:31.260> and

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
now too because the timings right and

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.810 
now too because the timings right and
it's<00:02:32.520> uh<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:33.840> know<00:02:34.340> we're<00:02:35.340> not<00:02:35.430> getting<00:02:35.610> any

younger
and<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.459> had<00:02:38.640> always<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.630> know<00:02:39.750> kind<00:02:39.989> of

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
and we had always you know kind of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.400 
and we had always you know kind of
wondered<00:02:40.620> because<00:02:41.330> I'm<00:02:42.330> always<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:43.110> kind<00:02:43.260> of

wondered because I'm always the kind of

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.050 
wondered because I'm always the kind of
person<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:45.170> thinks<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.470> all<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
person that thinks of all the the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.610 
person that thinks of all the the
scenarios<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.090> possibilities<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:49.350> may

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
scenarios and possibilities that we may

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.110 
scenarios and possibilities that we may
have<00:02:49.830> trouble<00:02:50.160> getting<00:02:50.459> pregnant<00:02:50.760> for

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
have trouble getting pregnant for

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.400 
have trouble getting pregnant for
whatever<00:02:51.360> reason<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.519> as<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.760> turns<00:02:53.970> out<00:02:54.410> it

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
whatever reason and as it turns out it

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.640 
whatever reason and as it turns out it
was<00:02:55.650> three<00:02:56.280> years<00:02:56.549> later<00:02:57.350> you<00:02:58.350> know<00:02:58.440> after

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
was three years later you know after

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.190 
was three years later you know after
really<00:02:59.150> deciding<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.720> we<00:03:00.840> were<00:03:00.959> ready

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
really deciding that that we were ready

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.490 
really deciding that that we were ready
to<00:03:01.440> start<00:03:01.709> trying<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:03.480> was<00:03:03.959> over<00:03:04.260> three

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
to start trying that it was over three

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.220 
to start trying that it was over three
years<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:05.280> we<00:03:05.430> finally<00:03:05.940> got<00:03:06.840> our<00:03:07.019> little

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
years that we finally got our little

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:24.610 
years that we finally got our little
miracle

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.980 

getting<00:03:25.620> pregnant<00:03:25.860> ended<00:03:26.790> up<00:03:26.940> being<00:03:27.210> a<00:03:27.540> much

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
getting pregnant ended up being a much

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.320 
getting pregnant ended up being a much
longer<00:03:28.470> process<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.430> much<00:03:29.580> more<00:03:29.790> expensive

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
longer process and a much more expensive

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.890 
longer process and a much more expensive
process<00:03:31.230> than<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.740> think<00:03:31.980> either<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.340> us<00:03:32.900> would

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
process than I think either of us would

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.600 
process than I think either of us would
have<00:03:34.080> desired<00:03:34.470> were<00:03:35.130> expected<00:03:37.280> all's<00:03:38.280> well

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
have desired were expected all's well

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.550 
have desired were expected all's well
that<00:03:38.640> ends<00:03:39.030> well<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:39.330> we<00:03:40.080> do<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.410> all<00:03:40.530> over

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
that ends well and we do it all over

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.630 
that ends well and we do it all over
again<00:03:41.510> yeah<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.690> was<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:43.260> was<00:03:43.440> patience<00:03:44.340> trying

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
again yeah it was it was patience trying

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.500 
again yeah it was it was patience trying
at<00:03:44.910> times<00:03:45.150> but<00:03:45.570> we<00:03:46.320> had<00:03:47.120> you<00:03:48.120> can't<00:03:48.360> say<00:03:48.480> enough

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
at times but we had you can't say enough

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.960 
at times but we had you can't say enough
good<00:03:48.750> things<00:03:48.810> about<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.380> doctors<00:03:49.800> about<00:03:50.730> the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
good things about the doctors about the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.300 
good things about the doctors about the
nurses<00:03:51.510> about<00:03:51.660> all<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.960> people<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.310> we

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
nurses about all the people that we

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.080 
nurses about all the people that we
worked<00:03:53.580> with<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:54.390> it<00:03:54.720> got<00:03:54.960> us<00:03:55.110> to<00:03:55.140> this<00:03:55.350> point

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
worked with and it got us to this point

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.240 
worked with and it got us to this point
it<00:03:57.090> really<00:03:57.300> ended<00:03:57.690> up<00:03:57.810> feeling<00:03:58.020> like<00:03:58.250> family

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
it really ended up feeling like family

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.010 
it really ended up feeling like family
yeah<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.790> guess<00:04:00.120> that's<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.390> good<00:04:00.480> side<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.840> it

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
yeah I guess that's the good side of it

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.660 
yeah I guess that's the good side of it
as<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.230> do<00:04:01.380> see<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.890> see<00:04:02.070> a<00:04:02.100> lot<00:04:02.310> of<00:04:02.340> good<00:04:02.520> in

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
as you do see you see a lot of good in

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.320 
as you do see you see a lot of good in
people<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.590> you<00:04:04.590> see<00:04:04.830> how<00:04:05.150> what<00:04:06.150> they<00:04:06.270> do

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
people and you see how what they do

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.810 
people and you see how what they do
really<00:04:06.600> helps<00:04:07.050> right<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.250> helps<00:04:08.520> make

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
really helps right it helps make

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.080 
really helps right it helps make
people's<00:04:08.850> lives<00:04:09.390> better<00:04:09.690> so<00:04:10.080> for<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.820> course

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
people's lives better so for the course

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.870 
people's lives better so for the course
of<00:04:12.270> about<00:04:12.390> three<00:04:12.750> years<00:04:13.650> we<00:04:14.280> tried<00:04:14.720> I<00:04:15.720> know<00:04:16.880> you

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
of about three years we tried I know you

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.190 
of about three years we tried I know you
know<00:04:17.970> we<00:04:18.090> tried<00:04:18.359> just<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.870> fertility

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
know we tried just the fertility

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.510 
know we tried just the fertility
medicines<00:04:20.100> for<00:04:20.690> months<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.900> months<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.560> the

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
medicines for months and months and the

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.570 
medicines for months and months and the
inner<00:04:23.820> uterine<00:04:24.320> inseminations<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.770> think<00:04:26.460> we

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
inner uterine inseminations I think we

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.020 
inner uterine inseminations I think we
did<00:04:26.760> 10<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.210> those<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:30.650> finally<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:32.610> was<00:04:32.730> time

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
did 10 of those and finally it was time

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:40.780 
did 10 of those and finally it was time
to<00:04:33.480> move<00:04:34.080> on<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.730> IVF<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:38.210> timing<00:04:39.210> sort<00:04:39.840> of

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
to move on to IVF and the timing sort of

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.830 
to move on to IVF and the timing sort of
we<00:04:41.790> didn't<00:04:42.000> know<00:04:42.090> if<00:04:42.180> it<00:04:42.210> was<00:04:42.390> a<00:04:42.450> good<00:04:42.570> or<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.720> bad

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
we didn't know if it was a good or a bad
