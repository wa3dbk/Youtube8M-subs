and<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:36.420> couple<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.720> you<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:36.900> been<00:00:37.110> telling<00:00:37.320> me

and a couple of you have been telling me

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.950 
and a couple of you have been telling me
how<00:00:37.560> difficult<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.850> sometimes<00:00:39.270> find<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
how difficult you sometimes find it to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.960 
how difficult you sometimes find it to
improvise<00:00:40.500> riffs<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.250> what<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.730> play

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
improvise riffs and what do you play

improvise riffs and what do you play
next<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.930> think<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> start<00:00:44.040> Bowie

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
next and I think that if you start Bowie

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.340 
next and I think that if you start Bowie
with<00:00:44.970> the<00:00:45.090> idea<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.420> don't<00:00:45.809> know<00:00:45.930> what<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.170> play

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
improvising one way to get around this

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.280 
improvising one way to get around this
just<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> forget<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.930> start
