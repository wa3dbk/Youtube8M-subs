hi here's my video on how to lock the
savage<00:00:19.039> dip<00:00:19.720> so<00:00:20.720> first<00:00:21.020> you<00:00:21.230> want<00:00:21.380> to<00:00:21.470> unscrew

savage dip so first you want to unscrew

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:30.189 
savage dip so first you want to unscrew
all<00:00:23.930> of<00:00:24.110> these<00:00:24.289> screws<00:00:24.910> in<00:00:25.910> the<00:00:27.189> dip<00:00:28.960> of<00:00:29.960> course

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
all of these screws in the dip of course

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.870 
all of these screws in the dip of course
you<00:00:30.289> gotta<00:00:30.500> have<00:00:30.619> taken<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.070> dip<00:00:31.279> out<00:00:31.460> before

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
you gotta have taken the dip out before

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.689 
you gotta have taken the dip out before
you<00:00:32.000> do<00:00:32.180> this<00:00:32.650> if<00:00:33.650> you<00:00:33.860> can't<00:00:34.100> stop<00:00:34.370> it<00:00:34.489> yet

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
you do this if you can't stop it yet

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:36.450 
you do this if you can't stop it yet
this<00:00:35.030> is<00:00:35.180> quite<00:00:35.449> easy

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
this is quite easy

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.009 
this is quite easy
the<00:00:37.460> reason<00:00:37.760> I'm<00:00:37.879> gonna<00:00:38.120> lock<00:00:38.360> my<00:00:38.570> death<00:00:38.780> is

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
the reason I'm gonna lock my death is

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:46.630 
the reason I'm gonna lock my death is
because<00:00:39.440> I<00:00:41.290> keep<00:00:42.290> stripping<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.970> diff<00:00:45.640> inners

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
because I keep stripping the diff inners

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.439 
because I keep stripping the diff inners
and<00:00:47.559> this<00:00:48.559> is<00:00:48.979> gonna<00:00:49.159> be<00:00:49.309> a<00:00:49.339> cheap<00:00:49.610> way<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:50.089> stop

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
and this is gonna be a cheap way to stop

00:00:50.449 --> 00:01:03.630 
and this is gonna be a cheap way to stop
that<00:00:50.479> happening

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.910 

so<00:01:04.640> once<00:01:04.879> you've<00:01:05.120> done<00:01:05.330> this<00:01:05.540> you<00:01:06.200> simply<00:01:06.590> pull

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
so once you've done this you simply pull

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.400 
so once you've done this you simply pull
off<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:08.330> top<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:10.460> you<00:01:10.850> left<00:01:11.270> with<00:01:11.540> your<00:01:11.570> diff

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
off the top and you left with your diff

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:26.380 
off the top and you left with your diff
gear<00:01:19.690> then<00:01:23.050> what<00:01:24.050> we<00:01:24.200> do<00:01:24.410> walk<00:01:25.400> through<00:01:25.700> so

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
gear then what we do walk through so

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.080 
gear then what we do walk through so
you're<00:01:26.540> gonna<00:01:26.690> need<00:01:27.790> 240<00:01:28.790> millimeter<00:01:29.420> hex<00:01:31.090> for

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
you're gonna need 240 millimeter hex for

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.990 
you're gonna need 240 millimeter hex for
the<00:01:32.210> wheels<00:01:32.450> hopes<00:01:33.080> I<00:01:33.440> have<00:01:34.340> these<00:01:34.520> left<00:01:34.790> over

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
the wheels hopes I have these left over

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.130 
the wheels hopes I have these left over
because<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.479> bought<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:36.080> set<00:01:37.009> of<00:01:37.040> new<00:01:37.930> nuts<00:01:38.930> and

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
because I bought a set of new nuts and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.330 
because I bought a set of new nuts and
also<00:01:39.560> my<00:01:39.619> wheels<00:01:39.920> I<00:01:41.229> got<00:01:42.229> these<00:01:42.560> from<00:01:42.800> Ikea

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
also my wheels I got these from Ikea

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.160 
also my wheels I got these from Ikea
these<00:01:44.150> are<00:01:45.670> in<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.790> bag<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.210> spare<00:01:47.570> items<00:01:48.050> if

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
these are in a bag of spare items if

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.700 
these are in a bag of spare items if
it's<00:01:48.410> just<00:01:49.300> washes

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:02.260 

so<00:01:59.710> what<00:02:00.710> you'll<00:02:00.890> find<00:02:01.160> is<00:02:01.490> when<00:02:01.520> you<00:02:01.850> take<00:02:02.090> all

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
so what you'll find is when you take all

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.110 
so what you'll find is when you take all
the<00:02:02.390> internals<00:02:02.930> out<00:02:03.050> of<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.290> dish

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
the internals out of the dish

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:14.260 
the internals out of the dish
yeah<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:10.310> have<00:02:10.490> a<00:02:10.900> little<00:02:12.430> pin<00:02:13.430> holding<00:02:14.090> in

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
yeah you have a little pin holding in

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.460 
yeah you have a little pin holding in
the<00:02:14.590> axle<00:02:15.590> on<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.830> difficult<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:17.780> pin<00:02:18.110> fits

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
the axle on the difficult this pin fits

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.770 
the axle on the difficult this pin fits
the<00:02:18.770> normal<00:02:19.520> hex<00:02:20.030> hub<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.730> put<00:02:23.180> our<00:02:23.360> hex<00:02:23.540> will

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
the normal hex hub so put our hex will

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:34.030 
the normal hex hub so put our hex will
be<00:02:25.600> nuts<00:02:26.600> against<00:02:26.959> it<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:30.160> then<00:02:33.010> fit<00:02:34.010> the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
be nuts against it you then fit the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:42.800 
be nuts against it you then fit the
washers

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.020 

this<00:02:43.810> can<00:02:44.020> be<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> bit<00:02:44.380> fiddly<00:02:44.650> but<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.730> want<00:02:45.940> to

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
this can be a bit fiddly but you want to

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:54.390 
this can be a bit fiddly but you want to
fit<00:02:49.020> enough<00:02:50.020> washes<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:52.420> make<00:02:52.600> sure<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.400> this

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
fit enough washes to make sure that this

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:03.930 
fit enough washes to make sure that this
hex<00:02:55.300> is<00:02:55.540> not<00:02:55.720> going<00:02:55.960> spin

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:12.870 

I<00:03:06.840> think<00:03:07.840> seven<00:03:08.230> in<00:03:08.380> like<00:03:09.100> that

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.140 

then<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.960> just<00:03:14.560> chopped<00:03:14.860> up<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.130> bit<00:03:15.310> plastic<00:03:15.940> of

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
then I just chopped up a bit plastic of

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:28.190 
then I just chopped up a bit plastic of
an<00:03:16.450> old<00:03:16.690> mug<00:03:16.960> guard<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.850> use<00:03:19.270> that<00:03:19.480> spaces<00:03:22.380> so

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.720 

for<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.290> plastic<00:03:29.530> spaces<00:03:30.280> in<00:03:30.460> between<00:03:32.730> in

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
for the plastic spaces in between in

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.940 
for the plastic spaces in between in
between<00:03:34.530> on<00:03:35.530> top<00:03:35.830> of<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.130> all<00:03:36.310> pegs<00:03:37.800> then<00:03:38.800> get

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
between on top of that all pegs then get

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.490 
between on top of that all pegs then get
your<00:03:39.100> next<00:03:39.310> tags<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:40.270> place<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.380> other

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
your next tags and place it the other

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.680 
your next tags and place it the other
way<00:03:41.680> around<00:03:41.710> in<00:03:42.520> the<00:03:43.270> hub<00:03:45.240> what<00:03:46.240> so<00:03:48.480> now<00:03:49.480> you've

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
way around in the hub what so now you've

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.110 
way around in the hub what so now you've
got<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.930> lock<00:03:50.230> stiff<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.520> just<00:03:51.820> need<00:03:51.970> to

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
got a lock stiff and I just need to

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:13.580 
got a lock stiff and I just need to
reassemble<00:03:52.540> it<00:03:53.880> so<00:03:54.880> you<00:03:54.940> get<00:03:56.190> this<00:03:57.190> fifth<00:03:57.760> year

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.120 

you<00:04:14.430> get<00:04:14.580> you<00:04:14.700> did<00:04:14.880> get<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.780> replace<00:04:16.170> a<00:04:17.750> pin

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
you get you did get and replace a pin

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:30.800 
you get you did get and replace a pin
like<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:21.320> then<00:04:22.580> replace<00:04:23.580> this<00:04:23.850> gear<00:04:29.660> you<00:04:30.660> will

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
like so then replace this gear you will

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:38.870 
like so then replace this gear you will
find<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:32.220> death<00:04:32.430> is<00:04:32.820> now<00:04:35.810> then<00:04:37.639> simply<00:04:38.639> pull

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880
