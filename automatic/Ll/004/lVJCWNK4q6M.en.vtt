build since this morning I added finally
my<00:00:10.389> fpv<00:00:10.870> gear<00:00:11.110> I've<00:00:11.440> been<00:00:11.559> kind<00:00:11.710> of<00:00:11.740> going<00:00:11.830> in

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.130 
my fpv gear I've been kind of going in

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.499 
my fpv gear I've been kind of going in
stages<00:00:12.549> first<00:00:12.730> gets<00:00:12.969> a<00:00:13.030> thing<00:00:13.179> in<00:00:13.299> the<00:00:13.389> air

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:13.509 
stages first gets a thing in the air

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.990 
stages first gets a thing in the air
then<00:00:14.380> get<00:00:14.559> a<00:00:14.589> camera<00:00:14.830> mounted<00:00:15.070> now<00:00:15.790> that<00:00:15.940> the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
then get a camera mounted now that the

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.940 
then get a camera mounted now that the
cameras<00:00:16.390> mounted<00:00:16.540> go<00:00:17.170> ahead<00:00:17.290> and<00:00:17.320> add<00:00:17.470> fpv

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
cameras mounted go ahead and add fpv

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.580 
cameras mounted go ahead and add fpv
capability<00:00:18.640> so<00:00:19.480> i'm<00:00:19.780> using<00:00:19.930> the<00:00:20.020> gopro<00:00:20.350> for

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
capability so i'm using the gopro for

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.880 
capability so i'm using the gopro for
recording<00:00:21.390> fpv<00:00:22.390> footage<00:00:22.960> but<00:00:23.710> i'm<00:00:23.800> actually

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
recording fpv footage but i'm actually

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.410 
recording fpv footage but i'm actually
using<00:00:24.070> an<00:00:24.370> 808<00:00:24.700> cam<00:00:25.320> number<00:00:26.320> 16<00:00:26.830> with<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:27.610> deal

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
using an 808 cam number 16 with the deal

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.890 
using an 808 cam number 16 with the deal
ends<00:00:28.660> as<00:00:28.930> my<00:00:29.260> fpv<00:00:29.860> camera<00:00:30.430> and<00:00:30.750> I've<00:00:31.750> got<00:00:31.870> a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
ends as my fpv camera and I've got a

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.560 
ends as my fpv camera and I've got a
boscombe<00:00:32.430> video<00:00:33.430> transmitter<00:00:34.120> that<00:00:34.330> I<00:00:34.390> have

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
boscombe video transmitter that I have

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.860 
boscombe video transmitter that I have
on<00:00:34.780> there<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.640> let's<00:00:37.330> take<00:00:37.450> a<00:00:37.480> look<00:00:37.600> at<00:00:37.690> what

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
on there so let's take a look at what

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.710 
on there so let's take a look at what
that<00:00:37.900> looks<00:00:38.020> like<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:39.370> here<00:00:39.520> it<00:00:39.610> is<00:00:39.720> basically

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
that looks like so here it is basically

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.170 
that looks like so here it is basically
the<00:00:40.840> 808<00:00:41.380> camera<00:00:41.740> is<00:00:41.980> velcroed<00:00:42.580> to<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.820> top<00:00:43.000> of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
the 808 camera is velcroed to the top of

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.420 
the 808 camera is velcroed to the top of
my<00:00:43.270> receiver<00:00:43.660> and<00:00:43.990> it's<00:00:44.320> peeking<00:00:44.740> through<00:00:45.070> my

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
my receiver and it's peeking through my

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.950 
my receiver and it's peeking through my
two<00:00:45.490> antennas<00:00:46.210> that<00:00:46.240> I<00:00:46.360> have<00:00:46.540> their<00:00:46.720> looks

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
two antennas that I have their looks

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.250 
two antennas that I have their looks
like<00:00:47.110> a<00:00:47.500> bug<00:00:47.980> in<00:00:48.150> antennas<00:00:49.150> but<00:00:49.300> those<00:00:50.050> are<00:00:50.170> my

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
like a bug in antennas but those are my

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.490 
like a bug in antennas but those are my
receiver<00:00:50.590> antennas<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:52.480> of<00:00:52.840> course<00:00:53.050> a<00:00:53.140> rubber

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
receiver antennas and of course a rubber

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.920 
receiver antennas and of course a rubber
band<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:53.860> hold<00:00:54.040> it<00:00:54.190> snug<00:00:54.730> and<00:00:55.450> then<00:00:55.570> I<00:00:55.600> figured

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
band to hold it snug and then I figured

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.220 
band to hold it snug and then I figured
I'd<00:00:56.590> wire<00:00:56.860> up<00:00:57.130> a<00:00:57.310> balance<00:00:58.180> plug<00:00:58.450> adapter<00:00:59.020> on

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
I'd wire up a balance plug adapter on

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.870 
I'd wire up a balance plug adapter on
the<00:00:59.440> tail<00:00:59.620> boom<00:00:59.860> I<00:01:00.100> used<00:01:00.340> hot<00:01:00.520> glue<00:01:00.550> to<00:01:00.850> hold

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
the tail boom I used hot glue to hold

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.240 
the tail boom I used hot glue to hold
that<00:01:01.180> little<00:01:01.329> adapter<00:01:01.630> in<00:01:02.020> and<00:01:02.290> that<00:01:02.770> powers

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
that little adapter in and that powers

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.399 
that little adapter in and that powers
my<00:01:03.930> fpv<00:01:04.930> camera<00:01:05.440> and<00:01:05.650> my<00:01:06.450> fpv<00:01:07.450> transmitter<00:01:08.140> and

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
my fpv camera and my fpv transmitter and

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.860 
my fpv camera and my fpv transmitter and
then<00:01:09.070> of<00:01:09.159> course<00:01:09.190> I<00:01:09.460> have<00:01:09.610> that<00:01:10.330> separate<00:01:10.750> from

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
then of course I have that separate from

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.540 
then of course I have that separate from
the<00:01:10.960> battery<00:01:11.290> power<00:01:11.470> that<00:01:11.680> powers<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.280> rest

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
the battery power that powers the rest

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.000 
the battery power that powers the rest
of<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.450> unit<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.810> kk<00:01:14.110> board<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.890> all

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
of the the unit the kk board and all

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.280 
of the the unit the kk board and all
that<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.770> let's<00:01:17.770> take<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:17.950> look<00:01:18.130> at<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:19.180> video

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that so let's take a look at the video

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.760 
that so let's take a look at the video
my<00:01:20.290> ghetto<00:01:21.420> fpv<00:01:22.420> monitor<00:01:22.960> I<00:01:23.200> don't<00:01:23.650> have

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
my ghetto fpv monitor I don't have

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.710 
my ghetto fpv monitor I don't have
goggles<00:01:24.159> yet<00:01:24.490> so<00:01:24.760> I<00:01:24.790> rigged<00:01:25.120> this<00:01:25.299> up<00:01:25.479> with<00:01:25.690> a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
goggles yet so I rigged this up with a

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.399 
goggles yet so I rigged this up with a
little<00:01:26.260> philips<00:01:26.530> DVD<00:01:26.680> player<00:01:27.490> one<00:01:27.729> time<00:01:28.409> I've

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
little philips DVD player one time I've

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.219 
little philips DVD player one time I've
got<00:01:29.530> videos<00:01:29.799> on<00:01:29.950> that<00:01:30.210> back<00:01:31.210> back<00:01:31.869> in<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.020> past

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
got videos on that back back in the past

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.570 
got videos on that back back in the past
so<00:01:32.409> you<00:01:32.470> can<00:01:32.590> look<00:01:32.710> at<00:01:32.799> that<00:01:32.830> if<00:01:33.040> you<00:01:33.100> want<00:01:33.310> but

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
so you can look at that if you want but

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.450 
so you can look at that if you want but
that's<00:01:34.450> basically<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:34.869> so<00:01:35.140> now<00:01:35.290> i<00:01:35.320> am<00:01:35.590> got

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
that's basically it so now i am got

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.070 
that's basically it so now i am got
video<00:01:36.729> I<00:01:37.000> can<00:01:37.270> fly<00:01:37.510> bye<00:01:37.750> bye<00:01:38.650> bye<00:01:38.830> video

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
video I can fly bye bye bye video

video I can fly bye bye bye video
alright<00:01:41.080> so<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.500> last<00:01:41.619> thing<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:41.890> did<00:01:42.070> was<00:01:42.369> add

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
alright so the last thing I did was add

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.179 
alright so the last thing I did was add
to<00:01:42.729> limit<00:01:43.299> or<00:01:43.390> capability<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.189> basically

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
to limit or capability and basically

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.859 
to limit or capability and basically
what<00:01:45.369> I<00:01:45.400> did<00:01:45.490> is<00:01:45.760> using<00:01:46.060> that<00:01:46.090> same<00:01:46.420> balance

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
what I did is using that same balance

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.490 
what I did is using that same balance
port<00:01:47.320> on<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.250> tail<00:01:48.520> boom<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.750> taking<00:01:50.320> the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
port on the tail boom it's taking the

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.100 
port on the tail boom it's taking the
battery<00:01:51.040> voltage<00:01:51.100> for<00:01:51.700> me<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.810> keeping

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
battery voltage for me and I keeping

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.950 
battery voltage for me and I keeping
track<00:01:53.290> of<00:01:53.350> that<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:55.119> what<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.360> see<00:01:55.570> here<00:01:55.600> on<00:01:55.840> my

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
track of that so what you see here on my

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.950 
track of that so what you see here on my
telemetry<00:01:56.229> screen<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:57.009> a<00:01:57.330> top<00:01:58.330> left<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.780> my

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
telemetry screen is a top left is my

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.960 
telemetry screen is a top left is my
battery<00:01:59.560> for<00:01:59.860> my<00:01:59.890> transmitter<00:02:00.580> that's<00:02:00.820> for

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
battery for my transmitter that's for

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.499 
battery for my transmitter that's for
the<00:02:01.030> Tyranus<00:02:01.420> itself<00:02:01.750> 8.4<00:02:02.409> volts<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.950> 2<00:02:03.520> is<00:02:04.119> my

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
the Tyranus itself 8.4 volts a 2 is my

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.289 
the Tyranus itself 8.4 volts a 2 is my
overall<00:02:05.380> pack<00:02:05.650> voltage<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.369> 12.4<00:02:07.119> it's<00:02:07.240> a

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
overall pack voltage so 12.4 it's a

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.729 
overall pack voltage so 12.4 it's a
fully<00:02:07.540> charged<00:02:08.069> 3s<00:02:09.069> lipo<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.759> 1<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:10.779> my<00:02:11.169> receiver

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
fully charged 3s lipo a 1 is my receiver

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.680 
fully charged 3s lipo a 1 is my receiver
voltage<00:02:12.279> so<00:02:12.430> that's<00:02:12.609> the<00:02:12.760> voltage

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
voltage so that's the voltage

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.260 
voltage so that's the voltage
getting<00:02:14.140> from<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:15.070> kk<00:02:15.490> board<00:02:15.730> four<00:02:16.030> point

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
getting from the kk board four point

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.020 
getting from the kk board four point
nine<00:02:16.330> six<00:02:16.690> or<00:02:16.930> five<00:02:17.260> volts<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.490> i<00:02:18.760> can

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
nine six or five volts so i can

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.820 
nine six or five volts so i can
basically<00:02:19.240> tell<00:02:19.720> with<00:02:20.020> those<00:02:20.230> two<00:02:20.500> different

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
basically tell with those two different

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.100 
basically tell with those two different
values<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:22.090> status<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.870> my<00:02:23.280> kk<00:02:24.280> board<00:02:25.110> itself

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
values the status of my kk board itself

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.800 
values the status of my kk board itself
and<00:02:26.500> its<00:02:26.800> getting<00:02:27.100> power<00:02:27.550> which<00:02:28.540> would<00:02:28.720> be

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
and its getting power which would be

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.510 
and its getting power which would be
through<00:02:29.020> motor<00:02:29.260> one<00:02:30.330> BBC<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.680> i<00:02:33.130> can<00:02:33.340> also

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
through motor one BBC and i can also

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.140 
through motor one BBC and i can also
tell<00:02:33.720> my<00:02:34.720> overall<00:02:35.320> pack<00:02:35.560> voltage<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:37.030> i've<00:02:37.120> got

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
tell my overall pack voltage so i've got

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.370 
tell my overall pack voltage so i've got
two<00:02:37.420> different<00:02:37.570> data<00:02:37.870> points<00:02:37.960> therefore

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
two different data points therefore

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.260 
two different data points therefore
voltage<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.400> essentially<00:02:39.760> if<00:02:39.970> i<00:02:40.060> have<00:02:40.240> a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
voltage so essentially if i have a

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.020 
voltage so essentially if i have a
failure<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:40.990> flight<00:02:41.380> i<00:02:41.620> can<00:02:41.830> determine<00:02:42.730> based

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
failure in flight i can determine based

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.090 
failure in flight i can determine based
on<00:02:43.270> pack<00:02:43.570> voltage<00:02:43.990> or<00:02:44.140> kk<00:02:44.500> voltage<00:02:44.890> where<00:02:45.070> i

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
on pack voltage or kk voltage where i

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.070 
on pack voltage or kk voltage where i
might<00:02:45.250> want<00:02:45.460> to<00:02:45.520> focus<00:02:45.730> my<00:02:46.570> troubleshooting

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
might want to focus my troubleshooting

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.170 
might want to focus my troubleshooting
the<00:02:47.470> other<00:02:48.010> thing<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.220> see<00:02:48.490> there<00:02:48.700> on<00:02:48.910> the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
relative signal strength basically tells

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.350 
relative signal strength basically tells
me<00:02:53.770> how<00:02:53.890> good<00:02:54.070> my<00:02:54.250> signal<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:54.880> with<00:02:55.150> my

two<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.310> don't<00:03:06.520> even<00:03:06.580> have<00:03:06.700> set<00:03:06.970> up<00:03:07.090> yet<00:03:07.270> but

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
two I don't even have set up yet but

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.420 
two I don't even have set up yet but
i'll<00:03:07.510> use<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:07.810> for<00:03:07.960> something<00:03:08.190> but<00:03:09.190> anyway

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
i'll use it for something but anyway

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.460 
i'll use it for something but anyway
that's<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.940> just<00:03:10.150> wanted<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.570> give<00:03:11.320> you<00:03:11.350> the

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
that's it just wanted to give you the

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.060 
that's it just wanted to give you the
latest<00:03:11.770> it's<00:03:12.430> miserable<00:03:13.390> outside<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:14.320> so<00:03:14.950> i'm

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
latest it's miserable outside and so i'm

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.400 
latest it's miserable outside and so i'm
not<00:03:15.220> able<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.520> fly<00:03:15.700> but<00:03:16.510> as<00:03:16.930> soon<00:03:17.110> as<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.320> clears

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
not able to fly but as soon as it clears

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.070 
not able to fly but as soon as it clears
up<00:03:17.590> I'm<00:03:18.040> gonna<00:03:18.160> go<00:03:18.310> get<00:03:18.430> some<00:03:18.610> video<00:03:18.790> so<00:03:19.360> anyway

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
up I'm gonna go get some video so anyway

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.449 
up I'm gonna go get some video so anyway
