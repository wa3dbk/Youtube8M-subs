 Red Army man Superman Fedor dry 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.610
 although in his creative biography was 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.800
 more than a hundred very bright convincing 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.330
 cinema today moscow says goodbye to 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.040
 People's Artist Russia Natalia

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.539
 he himself is a chef like anatolia kuznetsova 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.160
 viewers probably didn't even know him 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.900
 Comrade Sukhov became for many almost 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.570
 family members a good smile 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.760
 characteristic squint of this particular hero and 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.739
 made the white sun of the desert a masterpiece 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.690
 this was recognized even by the director Vladimir 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.280
 bloodworm and after all initially on role was 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.230
 approved completely different actor 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.970
 George yumatov just on the day of the beginning 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.809
 filming his face was broken 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.180
 after the fight 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.220
 blacksmiths came to the rescue and a stas 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.860
 stories from such wells and cranes 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:56.180
 shelves are being done deliver water yes 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.640
 Here such a crane was made and planted 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.100
 then we made a cradle planted operator 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.190
 on this arm like that on the rope 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.470
 and now they stayed very smoothly up and 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.960
 lower well there to trained guys 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.460
 already the crane was not anatoly smiths not 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.070
 considered himself an actor of one role 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.930
 He starred in 150 films far from 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.360
 everyone can be called a masterpiece recognizes 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.010
 critics but many memorable this 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.689
 my friend is hot snow yes and 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.880
 movie last years turkish gambit 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.009
 Kuznetsovâ€™s plot has none 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.380
 passing works he just did not know how 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.250
 play poorly remembers knees well 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:35.400
 you used to be still silent 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.400
 I thought just to visit 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.080
 a cup of tea could be a classic 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.780
 the movie hero of blue eyes slightly upturned 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.790
 nose open beautiful face but became 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.340
 characteristic actor Anatoly Kuznetsov 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.500
 could humanize any role from the miners 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.600
 conductor dota hero soviet i 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.020
 a country 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.020
 2 hours 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.900
 Anatoly Kuznetsov settled long ago 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.330
 honestly in acting career not 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.430
 dreamed not when he was sure that he would 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.170
 a singer like his father and even studied 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.210
 two vocal courses 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.979
 but it is strange that the teachers convinced 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.320
 Anatolia Kuznetsova his place on 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.360
 the theatrical scene however and there he is not 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.300
 delayed after the first job in 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.580
 the movie it became clear the screen will not let me go 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.590
 theatrical pupil actually but how 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.990
 I was then invited here in two 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.360
 pictures so i'm stuck in cinema a 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.640
 still Anatoly Kuznetsov was exclusively 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.230
 good man was true to friendship all 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.480
 life lived with the only wife and 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.730
 never participated in backroom games 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.040
 a word colleagues say a real man 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.060
 this quality probably did 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.640
 his comrade sukhova 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.730
