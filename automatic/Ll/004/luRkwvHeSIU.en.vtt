what I like it and it didn't it didn't

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.729 
what I like it and it didn't it didn't
work<00:00:37.300> it<00:00:37.420> out<00:00:37.480> a<00:00:37.539> qualifying<00:00:38.109> but<00:00:38.350> we<00:00:38.469> know<00:00:38.559> we

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
work it out a qualifying but we know we

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.529 
work it out a qualifying but we know we
need<00:00:38.829> to<00:00:38.949> do<00:00:39.070> in<00:00:39.160> the<00:00:39.250> race<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:39.699> that's<00:00:40.449> what

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
need to do in the race and that's what

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.299 
need to do in the race and that's what
we<00:00:40.660> gonna<00:00:40.780> do<00:00:40.870> we<00:00:41.350> don't<00:00:41.379> want<00:00:41.679> to<00:00:41.800> let<00:00:42.070> him

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
we gonna do we don't want to let him

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.970 
we gonna do we don't want to let him
take<00:00:42.879> more<00:00:43.149> points<00:00:43.690> to<00:00:44.140> escape<00:00:44.679> from<00:00:44.829> the

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
take more points to escape from the

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.329 
take more points to escape from the
championship<00:00:45.449> certainly<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:47.739> doesn't<00:00:48.190> help

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
championship certainly it doesn't help

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.799 
championship certainly it doesn't help
let<00:00:49.210> him<00:00:49.719> start<00:00:50.140> in<00:00:50.289> front<00:00:50.589> but<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:52.449> race<00:00:52.629> is<00:00:52.780> a

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
let him start in front but the race is a

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.689 
let him start in front but the race is a
long<00:00:53.050> race<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:53.710> I<00:00:53.890> think<00:00:54.280> there's<00:00:54.429> gonna<00:00:54.489> be

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
long race and I think there's gonna be

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.630 
long race and I think there's gonna be
three<00:00:54.879> stops<00:00:55.300> and<00:00:55.629> they<00:00:56.589> we<00:00:57.010> still<00:00:57.219> have<00:00:57.339> a<00:00:57.370> lot

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
three stops and they we still have a lot

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.889 
three stops and they we still have a lot
of<00:00:57.670> points<00:00:58.059> in<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.239> game<00:00:58.269> and<00:00:58.539> that's<00:00:58.629> what<00:00:58.749> we

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
of points in the game and that's what we

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.720 
of points in the game and that's what we
gotta<00:00:59.050> go<00:00:59.230> after<00:00:59.559> it's<00:00:59.890> been<00:01:00.100> done<00:01:00.309> they<00:01:00.550> may

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
gotta go after it's been done they may

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.610

competitive as we need to be so it's

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.399 
competitive as we need to be so it's
disappointing<00:01:18.490> but<00:01:18.880> you<00:01:19.810> can<00:01:19.930> only<00:01:19.960> do<00:01:20.259> what

disappointing but you can only do what
you<00:01:20.439> can<00:01:20.500> do<00:01:20.740> with<00:01:20.979> with<00:01:21.369> what<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:21.640> have<00:01:21.790> at

I was happy with my lap but it's just
not<00:01:25.840> enough<00:01:26.110> so<00:01:26.320> we<00:01:26.439> need<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.680> find<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.820> way<00:01:27.909> to

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
not enough so we need to find a way to

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.819 
not enough so we need to find a way to
go<00:01:28.119> through<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:28.360> field<00:01:28.570> tomorrow<00:01:28.689> I<00:01:29.110> don't

go through the field tomorrow I don't

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.560 
go through the field tomorrow I don't
really<00:01:29.920> have<00:01:30.070> a<00:01:30.100> choice<00:01:30.189> I<00:01:30.610> mean<00:01:30.759> I<00:01:31.180> need<00:01:31.360> to<00:01:31.450> go

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
really have a choice I mean I need to go

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.600 
really have a choice I mean I need to go
forward<00:01:31.780> or<00:01:32.110> what<00:01:32.979> nothing's<00:01:33.280> gonna<00:01:33.430> happen

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
forward or what nothing's gonna happen

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.789 
forward or what nothing's gonna happen
for<00:01:33.969> me<00:01:34.090> so<00:01:34.360> you<00:01:34.600> know<00:01:34.960> at<00:01:35.170> this<00:01:35.289> point<00:01:35.409> I<00:01:35.740> think

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
we need to be aggressive with strategy

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.050 
we need to be aggressive with strategy

and see a co-worker comes up come up a
little<00:01:40.210> bit<00:01:40.420> of<00:01:40.479> luck<00:01:40.659> would<00:01:41.079> be<00:01:41.170> necessary

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
little bit of luck would be necessary

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.730 
little bit of luck would be necessary
but<00:01:42.670> we<00:01:42.789> certainly<00:01:42.969> don't<00:01:43.270> have<00:01:43.359> the<00:01:43.509> base<00:01:43.740> its

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
but we certainly don't have the base its

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.289 
but we certainly don't have the base its

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
championship as a good day I mean it's

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.620 
championship as a good day I mean it's
it's<00:01:48.460> not<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.670> bad<00:01:48.939> day<00:01:49.119> when<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.359> start<00:01:49.539> at<00:01:49.600> the

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
it's not a bad day when you start at the

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.120 
it's not a bad day when you start at the
front<00:01:49.750> row<00:01:49.990> but<00:01:50.229> we<00:01:50.350> obviously<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:50.950> know<00:01:51.039> we

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
front row but we obviously you know we

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.249 
front row but we obviously you know we
come<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.369> these<00:01:51.490> events<00:01:51.549> we<00:01:52.030> want<00:01:52.210> to<00:01:52.270> be<00:01:52.390> first

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
come to these events we want to be first

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.359 
come to these events we want to be first
when<00:01:53.560> we're<00:01:53.680> doing<00:01:53.799> things<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:54.250> know

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
when we're doing things you know

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.069 
when we're doing things you know
everyone<00:01:54.640> does<00:01:54.939> and<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:55.509> seems<00:01:55.780> like<00:01:55.930> we're

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
everyone does and it seems like we're

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.719 
everyone does and it seems like we're
always<00:01:56.109> just<00:01:56.679> there<00:01:56.950> we're<00:01:57.250> either<00:01:57.369> third

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
always just there we're either third

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.609 
always just there we're either third
fourth<00:01:58.060> second<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:59.020> know<00:01:59.109> we<00:01:59.200> can't<00:01:59.439> quite

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
fourth second you know we can't quite

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.219 
fourth second you know we can't quite
get<00:01:59.799> that<00:01:59.859> top<00:02:00.250> spot<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:01.020> hopefully<00:02:02.020> we<00:02:02.109> can

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
get that top spot and hopefully we can

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.179 
get that top spot and hopefully we can
figure<00:02:02.380> out<00:02:02.469> how<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.679> do<00:02:02.799> that<00:02:02.890> tomorrow

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
figure out how to do that tomorrow

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.560 
figure out how to do that tomorrow
that's<00:02:03.490> what<00:02:03.609> we've<00:02:03.759> been<00:02:03.789> working<00:02:04.000> on<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.479> I

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
that's what we've been working on and I

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.910 
that's what we've been working on and I
think<00:02:04.600> we've<00:02:04.869> been<00:02:04.990> close<00:02:05.229> and<00:02:05.590> we're

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
think we've been close and we're

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.800 
think we've been close and we're
knocking<00:02:06.219> on<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.399> door<00:02:06.579> and<00:02:06.820> we're<00:02:07.600> hoping

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
knocking on the door and we're hoping

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.390 
knocking on the door and we're hoping
eventually<00:02:07.929> that<00:02:08.320> door<00:02:08.500> opens<00:02:08.830> for<00:02:09.040> us<00:02:09.160> and

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 
eventually that door opens for us and

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.500 
eventually that door opens for us and
you<00:02:09.670> never<00:02:09.820> know<00:02:09.940> when<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.120> day<00:02:10.270> is<00:02:10.330> gonna<00:02:10.420> be

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
consistently up front and consistently

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.590 
consistently up front and consistently
winning<00:02:27.950> races<00:02:28.190> so<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:29.060> know<00:02:29.120> we<00:02:29.240> got<00:02:29.270> to<00:02:29.480> do

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
winning races so you know we got to do

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.990 
winning races so you know we got to do
the<00:02:29.900> first<00:02:30.290> job<00:02:30.590> first<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.070> in<00:02:31.280> getting<00:02:31.610> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
the first job first and in getting the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.460 
the first job first and in getting the
first<00:02:32.240> one<00:02:32.420> out<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.690> way<00:02:32.750> but<00:02:33.050> I<00:02:33.110> think<00:02:33.380> if

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
first one out of the way but I think if

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.840 
first one out of the way but I think if
we're<00:02:33.590> able<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:33.860> do<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.130> being<00:02:34.670> up<00:02:34.730> here

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
we're able to do that being up here

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.010 
we're able to do that being up here
consistently<00:02:35.240> is<00:02:35.480> what<00:02:35.630> we're<00:02:35.750> trying<00:02:35.900> to

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
consistently is what we're trying to

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.170 
consistently is what we're trying to
achieve
