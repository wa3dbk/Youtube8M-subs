hawk like this they're taking the knife

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.810 
hawk like this they're taking the knife
down<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.290> fill<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.710> way<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
down like this and I fill that way the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.310 
down like this and I fill that way the
biggest<00:01:15.090> problem<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.390> having<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.900> rattle<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
biggest problem of having a rattle a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
biggest problem of having a rattle a
compound<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.799> not<00:01:16.979> having<00:01:17.159> enough<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:18.299> we've

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
compound is not having enough so we've

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.940 
compound is not having enough so we've
got<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.630> ugly<00:01:18.900> cool<00:01:19.200> all<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.350> from<00:01:19.710> top<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
got this ugly cool all right from top to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.440 
got this ugly cool all right from top to
bottom<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.610> we're<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.939> make<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.240> hole

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
bottom and we're going to make this hole

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.090 
bottom and we're going to make this hole
able<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:21.960> taped<00:01:22.200> able<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.680> worked<00:01:22.860> with

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
able to be taped able to be worked with

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.340 
able to be taped able to be worked with
so<00:01:23.729> we<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:24.000> as<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.240> go<00:01:24.360> fill<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> hole<00:01:25.110> like

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
so we do as we go fill the hole like

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.700 
so we do as we go fill the hole like
this<00:01:25.970> pretty<00:01:26.970> much<00:01:27.180> all<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> way<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.750> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
this pretty much all the way up and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.020 
this pretty much all the way up and
you'll<00:01:28.920> see<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.310> second<00:01:29.700> why<00:01:29.820> it's

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
you'll see in a second why it's

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.460 
you'll see in a second why it's
important<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.049> thickness<00:01:31.229> of

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
important but this is the thickness of

a filling product dries in about 90

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.660 
a filling product dries in about 90
minutes<00:01:45.960> that's<00:01:46.380> why<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.619> called<00:01:46.770> sheetrock

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
minutes that's why it's called sheetrock

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.359 
minutes that's why it's called sheetrock
90<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.780> work<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> sandable

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
90 you can work it it is a sandable

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.249 
90 you can work it it is a sandable
product<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:51.149> Darabont<00:01:51.869> if<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.110> get

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
product so it's not Darabont if you get

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.080 
product so it's not Darabont if you get
Darabont<00:01:52.850> durmond

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
Darabont durmond

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.330 
Darabont durmond
is<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.360> little<00:01:54.689> harder<00:01:55.049> but<00:01:55.950> you're<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.280> to

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
is a little harder but you're going to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.819 
is a little harder but you're going to
find<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.820> dura<00:01:57.030> bond<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.409> little<00:01:58.710> more

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
find that dura bond is a little more

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.639 
find that dura bond is a little more
difficult<00:01:59.310> for<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> amateur<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.030> work<00:02:00.180> with

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
difficult for the amateur to work with

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.429 
difficult for the amateur to work with
so<00:02:01.649> what<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:01.890> want<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.430> this

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
so what we want to do in this

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.380 
so what we want to do in this
let's<00:02:03.770> go<00:02:03.920> down<00:02:04.070> this<00:02:04.280> line<00:02:04.460> first<00:02:04.880> like<00:02:05.179> that

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
let's go down this line first like that

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.209 
let's go down this line first like that
just<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.899> fill<00:02:06.109> the<00:02:06.140> hole<00:02:06.409> is<00:02:06.859> we're<00:02:07.039> going<00:02:07.159> to

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
just to fill the hole is we're going to

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.490 
just to fill the hole is we're going to
tape<00:02:07.460> this<00:02:07.729> wall<00:02:07.999> and<00:02:08.780> we'd<00:02:08.869> like<00:02:09.050> something

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
tape this wall and we'd like something

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.250

for<00:02:09.649> our<00:02:09.769> tape<00:02:10.069> to<00:02:10.580> work<00:02:10.819> with<00:02:11.060> something<00:02:12.049> for

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
for our tape to work with something for

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.050 
for our tape to work with something for
our<00:02:12.379> tape<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.920> grip<00:02:13.160> into<00:02:13.370> rather<00:02:13.700> than<00:02:14.000> the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
our tape to grip into rather than the

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.539 
our tape to grip into rather than the
tape<00:02:14.269> falling<00:02:15.200> into<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.500> wall<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:16.340> you'll

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
tape falling into the wall and you'll

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.479 
tape falling into the wall and you'll
see<00:02:16.730> as<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:17.030> go<00:02:17.209> if<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.959> work<00:02:18.170> fairly<00:02:18.830> quickly

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
see as you go if you work fairly quickly

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.559 
see as you go if you work fairly quickly
with<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.480> sandable<00:02:20.900> 90<00:02:21.260> product<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.799> CGC<00:02:22.569> the

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
with a sandable 90 product to CGC the

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.360 
with a sandable 90 product to CGC the
reason<00:02:23.900> is<00:02:24.019> it<00:02:24.170> sets<00:02:24.379> up<00:02:24.530> in<00:02:24.650> about<00:02:24.830> 15<00:02:25.160> minutes

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
reason is it sets up in about 15 minutes

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.400 
reason is it sets up in about 15 minutes
or<00:02:25.549> so<00:02:25.730> now<00:02:26.420> because<00:02:26.840> this<00:02:27.049> is<00:02:27.110> between

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
or so now because this is between

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.259 
or so now because this is between
between<00:02:28.040> two<00:02:28.280> sheets<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:28.790> it's<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.060> butt<00:02:29.239> joint

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
between two sheets and it's a butt joint
