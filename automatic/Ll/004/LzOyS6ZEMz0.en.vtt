get your boxes in and you actually

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.950 
get your boxes in and you actually
shadow<00:00:32.790> box<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.450> actually<00:00:33.600> go<00:00:33.930> through

recommended<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> said<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> lot

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
recommended and like I said it's a lot

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.130 
recommended and like I said it's a lot
of<00:00:43.680> products<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.309> know<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.870> see<00:00:45.870> them<00:00:46.020> out

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
of products I know you see them out

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.549 
of products I know you see them out
there<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.340> not<00:00:47.670> something<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:49.110> have

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
there this is not something that I have

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.139 
there this is not something that I have
ever<00:00:49.710> used<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:50.190> any<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.460> my<00:00:50.520> fighters<00:00:50.910> it's

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
ever used with any of my fighters it's

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.119 
ever used with any of my fighters it's
not<00:00:51.329> something<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.590> integrated

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
not something that is integrated

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.490 
not something that is integrated
performance<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.850> training<00:00:54.690> philosophy<00:00:54.989> it's

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
performance you training philosophy it's

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.020 
performance you training philosophy it's
actually<00:00:55.770> something<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.370> recommend

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
actually something that I recommend

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.470 
actually something that I recommend
against<00:00:57.570> here's<00:00:58.469> why<00:01:00.170> when<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.320> are<00:01:02.480> punching

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
against here's why when you are punching

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.050 
against here's why when you are punching
there's<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.199> lot<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.559> accuracy<00:01:05.189> timing

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
there's a lot of accuracy timing

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.020 
there's a lot of accuracy timing
involved<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.340> general<00:01:08.729> rules

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
involved so one of the general rules

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.640 
involved so one of the general rules
that<00:01:09.659> I've<00:01:09.780> always<00:01:09.930> told<00:01:10.200> people<00:01:10.350> about

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
that I've always told people about

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.719 
that I've always told people about
loading<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.880> you're<00:01:12.720> loading<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.460> power<00:01:14.460> of

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
loading is if you're loading a power of

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.120 
loading is if you're loading a power of
force<00:01:14.970> production<00:01:15.330> pattern<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> jump

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
force production pattern like a jump

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.280 
force production pattern like a jump
like<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> squat<00:01:18.450> jump<00:01:18.479> or<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.110> want<00:01:19.259> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
like a squat jump or if you want to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.570 
like a squat jump or if you want to
improve<00:01:19.560> your<00:01:19.680> vertical<00:01:19.860> leap<00:01:20.100> let's<00:01:20.430> say

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
improve your vertical leap let's say

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.850 
improve your vertical leap let's say
that<00:01:21.150> most<00:01:21.420> faith<00:01:21.659> coaches<00:01:22.110> would<00:01:22.229> agree<00:01:22.560> that

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
that most faith coaches would agree that

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.760 
that most faith coaches would agree that
doing<00:01:23.430> barbell<00:01:23.909> squats<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:25.200> good<00:01:25.560> way<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
doing barbell squats is a good way to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.499 
doing barbell squats is a good way to
strengthen<00:01:26.100> your<00:01:26.280> legs<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.909> similar<00:01:27.240> force

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
strengthen your legs in a similar force

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.319 
strengthen your legs in a similar force
production<00:01:27.840> pattern<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.700> many<00:01:29.700> athletes<00:01:30.090> can

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
production pattern and many athletes can

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.240 
production pattern and many athletes can
attest<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.829> increase<00:01:32.100> your

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
attest to that can increase your

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.069 
attest to that can increase your
vertical<00:01:32.400> leap<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.060> there's<00:01:33.210> some<00:01:33.869> science

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
vertical leap and there's some science

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.960 
vertical leap and there's some science
I've<00:01:34.320> seen<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:35.340> back<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:36.829> but<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.820> when

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
I've seen to back that up but so when

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.670 
I've seen to back that up but so when
you<00:01:39.030> say<00:01:39.180> go<00:01:39.299> low<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.509> skill<00:01:39.930> honestly<00:01:40.560> you

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
you say go low to skill honestly you

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.620 
you say go low to skill honestly you
know<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.979> call<00:01:41.250> jumping<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.909> skill<00:01:42.270> because

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
know if you call jumping a skill because

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.030 
know if you call jumping a skill because
there's<00:01:42.780> really<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.079> much<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.320> an<00:01:43.530> accuracy

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
there's really not much of an accuracy

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.940 
there's really not much of an accuracy
component<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.060> an<00:01:45.149> explosive

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
component it's just an explosive

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.440 
component it's just an explosive
component<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:47.369> when<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.790> accuracy

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
component but when we have accuracy

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.630 
component but when we have accuracy
involved<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> lot<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.740> fine-tuning<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
involved like a lot of fine-tuning and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789 
involved like a lot of fine-tuning and
timing<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.299> certain<00:01:51.780> distancing<00:01:52.439> let's<00:01:52.649> say

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
timing in a certain distancing let's say

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.550 
timing in a certain distancing let's say
a<00:01:52.829> punch<00:01:53.250> or<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.880> basketball<00:01:54.509> shot<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.290> when

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
a punch or a basketball shot that's when

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.289 
a punch or a basketball shot that's when
I<00:01:55.590> have<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.159> big<00:01:56.700> problem<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:58.100> overloading

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
I have a big problem with overloading

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.130 
I have a big problem with overloading
here's<00:02:00.299> why<00:02:00.509> let<00:02:00.689> me<00:02:00.750> give<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:00.990> an<00:02:01.049> example

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
shots over the backboard well you're

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.110 
shots over the backboard well you're
gonna<00:02:55.040> throw<00:02:55.250> them<00:02:55.340> way<00:02:55.490> too<00:02:55.520> hard<00:02:55.940> they're

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
gonna throw them way too hard they're

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.520 
gonna throw them way too hard they're
going<00:02:56.240> to<00:02:56.330> hit<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.540> top<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.959> back<00:02:57.080> workouts

going to hit the top and back workouts
on<00:02:57.740> the<00:02:57.890> back<00:02:58.070> foot<00:02:58.310> now<00:02:58.430> why<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:58.970> the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
on the back foot now why is that the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.860 
on the back foot now why is that the
movement<00:03:00.500> pattern<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.459> same<00:03:01.690> but<00:03:02.690> the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
movement pattern is the same but the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.090 
movement pattern is the same but the
fine-tuning<00:03:04.180> based<00:03:05.180> on<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.510> accuracy

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
fine-tuning based on the accuracy

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.030 
fine-tuning based on the accuracy
changes<00:03:07.100> because<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.990> weight<00:03:09.260> was<00:03:09.560> different

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
changes because the weight was different

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.420 
changes because the weight was different
well<00:03:10.790> we<00:03:11.510> can<00:03:11.660> say<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.930> same<00:03:12.110> thing<00:03:12.410> here<00:03:12.769> when

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
well we can say the same thing here when

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.840 
well we can say the same thing here when
I'm<00:03:13.580> throwing<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:14.120> punch<00:03:14.390> whether<00:03:14.959> it<00:03:15.110> be<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.260> jab

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
I'm throwing a punch whether it be a jab

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.479 
I'm throwing a punch whether it be a jab
cross<00:03:16.850> whatever<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:18.080> don't<00:03:18.920> have<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.130> band

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
cross whatever I don't have a band

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.900 
cross whatever I don't have a band
attached<00:03:19.850> down<00:03:20.120> here<00:03:20.420> ripping<00:03:21.050> me<00:03:21.200> back<00:03:21.910> the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
attached down here ripping me back the

attached down here ripping me back the
momentum<00:03:23.300> is<00:03:23.390> still<00:03:23.630> carry<00:03:24.380> me<00:03:24.590> forward<00:03:24.970> so

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
momentum is still carry me forward so

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.820 
momentum is still carry me forward so
there's<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.180> different<00:03:26.630> force<00:03:27.050> production

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
there's a different force production

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
they're just doing this just to build up

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.340 
they're just doing this just to build up
their<00:04:14.030> shoulder<00:04:14.420> endurance<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.050> that<00:04:15.140> really

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
their shoulder endurance and that really

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.050 
their shoulder endurance and that really
throwing<00:04:15.740> punches<00:04:15.980> they're<00:04:16.700> just<00:04:16.880> kind<00:04:17.030> of

shoulder endurance you know kind of

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.530 
shoulder endurance you know kind of
standing<00:04:22.160> here<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.550> things<00:04:22.730> like<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:22.970> I'm

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.740 
totally cool that I used all that kind
of<00:04:25.250> stuff<00:04:25.460> but<00:04:25.970> we're<00:04:26.180> looking<00:04:26.330> at<00:04:26.600> building

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
of stuff but we're looking at building

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.240 
of stuff but we're looking at building
endurance<00:04:27.170> therefore<00:04:27.770> it<00:04:27.920> looks<00:04:28.040> at

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
endurance therefore it looks at

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.710 
endurance therefore it looks at
resisting<00:04:28.940> when<00:04:29.240> we're<00:04:29.360> talking<00:04:29.510> about

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
resisting when we're talking about

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.930
