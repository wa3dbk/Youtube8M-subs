00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.170 

so<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:22.200> reason<00:04:22.590> why<00:04:22.800> I'm<00:04:23.190> creating<00:04:23.760> the

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
so the reason why I'm creating the

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.740 
so the reason why I'm creating the
series<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:25.650> seasonal<00:04:26.490> trend<00:04:27.150> funny<00:04:27.390> every

series of seasonal trend funny every

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.320 
series of seasonal trend funny every
summer<00:04:28.050> is<00:04:28.350> because<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.830> fact<00:04:29.040> that<00:04:29.220> many<00:04:29.580> or

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
summer is because the fact that many or

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.600 
summer is because the fact that many or
maybe<00:04:30.720> one<00:04:30.930> or<00:04:31.050> two<00:04:31.170> of<00:04:31.290> my<00:04:31.410> episodes<00:04:31.620> have<00:04:32.010> not

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
maybe one or two of my episodes have not

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.980 
maybe one or two of my episodes have not
really<00:04:32.880> been<00:04:32.910> funny<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.510> haven't<00:04:33.840> been

produced in a sloppy stupid manner and
the<00:04:38.460> jokes<00:04:38.700> really<00:04:39.060> aren't<00:04:39.240> that<00:04:39.360> funny<00:04:39.720> and

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020

the Gio quit the cxs and Conwell that

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.580 
the Gio quit the cxs and Conwell that
was<00:04:56.280> actually<00:04:56.670> a<00:04:56.880> filler<00:04:57.600> because<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.080> couldn't

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
was actually a filler because I couldn't

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.350 
was actually a filler because I couldn't
really<00:04:58.830> find<00:04:59.220> anything<00:04:59.550> else<00:04:59.820> that<00:04:59.970> was<00:05:00.060> funny

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
really find anything else that was funny

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.990 
really find anything else that was funny

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
enough so these seasons are going to

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.630 
enough so these seasons are going to
allow<00:05:03.150> me<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.690> go<00:05:04.020> out<00:05:04.050> create<00:05:05.040> and<00:05:05.310> find
