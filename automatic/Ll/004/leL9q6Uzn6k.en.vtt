00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 - let's talk now with the minority pension company supervia 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.500
 Good night, living with the passenger saying that this was not the 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.070
 first time that scenes like this that today is the guy we all happen to 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.289
 this would say on skis this repetition of acts of vandalism as is 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.770
 this action is past only fight unacceptable mind by the company 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.970
 the company does not agree with this is against the company code of ethics 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.970
 these people were also 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.649
 Forgive me for your use of the word control the control that the supervia 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.460
 have about these employees that they have cameras 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.460
 supervise their work 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.410
 We only have cameras in some stations but we do not have cameras in all 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.580
 seasons we have some seasons 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.590
 and their work loosed can only score the goal the passengers they 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.960
 use the whistle 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.689
 for technician and go 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.909
 people go beyond the yellow line that is 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.490
 the passenger who were not show more clearly prepared for the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.490
 complex as this gives 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.070
 strike their support and want to overcrowded with 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 this matters with many open doors 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.420
 your right to a surprise then proscribe this action this way 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.780
 how did these agents 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.570
 absolute surprise 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.700
 he this form of food formation of other times in which the agents 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.160
 is the paula reacted violently against passengers is more than that 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.219
 speaks in a lack of preparation to be responsible for the preparation of these 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.090
 employees 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.810
 I'm sure you're responsible for preparing 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.000
 the supervia 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.270
 is the company that is responsible for the squad and regret of these people 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.769
 we train these people sober by system we train on standards of 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.580
 we train on the relationship with the customer then it is 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.190
 time to change the training system apparently not only to live with the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.910
 grandmother training way seems not to be very efficient by what we see in the 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.769
 still not enough pictures 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.620
 I can have the absolute reason for years we have to review the training system already 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.829
 that allowed 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.159
 is that four people totally lose control is this the people 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.159
 They were not prepared for this moment. 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.509
 of our training system 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.760
 do not act like 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.370
 against the company's code of ethics so that it will never 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.449
 repeat 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:05.719
 Thank you, then, that we have indeed such usefulness. 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.659
 images that we just saw thank you for your partipation 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:09.299
 in the newspaper
