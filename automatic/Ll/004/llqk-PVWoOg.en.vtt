00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.009
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.350
 my youtube channel 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:19.920
 Today 's a short update to my 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.920
 kuhlbrodt we have today 12 day after 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.810
 matching the fish and me 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.039
 start now, so to speak, always with the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.570
 first selection with this selection 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.950
 It is completely automatic and that is what I have 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.890
 here from an overflow of rubble 7 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.440
 removed over the filter stocking and there 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.180
 will now be by itself 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.769
 weak fish from a strong 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:52.489
 fish selected think you can here 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:54.260
 a little bit of a recognition that one 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.539
 the stronger co 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.149
 these fish have no problem and 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:03.049
 no effort against this flow of 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.299
 overflowing water to be different 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.220
 it looks at either already 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.690
 dead features clearly the 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.860
 are then sorted out or 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:16.909
 just like fish that are too weak 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.850
 the degut are simply those of 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.310
 body structure does not fit 100 percent 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.470
 they will be here or can be here 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.220
 not this flowing water 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.740
 oppose 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.140
 then it will be up in the end 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.140
 natural more or less natural 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.759
 sorted out the same way and times 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.560
 this saves me the work that he now 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:42.380
 in retrospect, all concerns and then of 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.240
 hand sorted out by the fish now 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.289
 crowned are the malformations 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.879
 or that are just too weak 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:53.030
 I already have cannibalism here 

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:57.229
 they can draw in this baby pool 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:02.560
 Just start the bigger baby fish 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.879
 to feed the very small editor 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.770
 that's different, of course , somewhere else 

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:11.840
 it really wants one here 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.150
 already at a very early stage 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.040
 everything has to be done instead of training 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.730
 He could also see that happening 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.810
 water slowly turns green certainly 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.150
 also not or no disadvantage that here 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.409
 something is what happens to float 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.829
 again as food serves so much for 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:38.129
 today's farewell to my grandma 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:42.530
 visited and I 'll be back soon 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.530
 the whole thing will evolve
