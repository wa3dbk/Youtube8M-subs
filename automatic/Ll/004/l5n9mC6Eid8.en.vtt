 month in France in september 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.619
 so it will be declined on screen 4 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.769
 concepts 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:25.199
 it's the screen I have here and also for 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.949
 big screen lovers 5 25 inches 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.899
 So here are played well in the shot 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.670
 they just came out j 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.340
 protector reinvent me ultra resistant 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.530
 which perfectly suited for age 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.450
 to sex 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.270
 these new 11 beds so I want 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.700
 tell very quickly what are his 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.840
 characteristics 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.170
 so it's a very insistent film 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.949
 on I had 20 votes 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.219
 here I am not going to do the installation 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.730
 complete I showed you very 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.730
 quickly 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.659
 quan was also a version of 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.689
 hard work of classic movies 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.430
 protection 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.750
 Here it is the armored version is 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.840
 at least five times stronger than 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.119
 the film 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.850
 by month I will not do you the 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.469
 big demo with a mechanical hammer 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.270
 we will not do under the tax screen at 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:29.560
 do it just quickly talk about it 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.979
 here already first with the glass 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.340
 hardened 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:37.630
 no loss of meaning and there quickly and that 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.990
 walk it work like unlike 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.799
 normal model of gymnastics 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.119
 so the funds this touch to a sound 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.170
 perfectly preserved I can not you 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.060
 show a demo with a real model 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.969
 saas and 1/2 because we do not have 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.640
 still the fault 6 at the beginning of the month 2 2 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.579
 September 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.890
 here are high level touch functions 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.869
 of the device are normally reserved 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.530
 the touch is similar so it's 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:13.410
 exactly the same it touched impeccable 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.310
 we specify a use of course 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.560
 basic property is so a 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.049
 increased protection against scratches 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.380
 against shock because it's realizing 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:25.180
 advanced technology 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.370
 what else to say is holophonic 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.700
 so that resists him 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.799
 fingerprint interesting thing 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.379
 it's much easier to put it 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:38.620
 are not the bubbles wrong step not stuck 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:41.170
 arises very very simply interview 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.450
 is also much simpler a lot more 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.069
 simple as traditional films in 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.060
 plastic 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.400
 we can see that cutting and 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.340
 impeccable perfectly adapted to 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.239
 the shape of the iphone 6 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.379
 So here there are seven movies 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.500
 tempered glass protectors 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.650
 it's for ultra users 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:07.590
 demanding who want the top 1 in terms 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:11.170
 screen protector and it's a glass 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.989
 soaked that works very well between 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.459
 north that has been deployed on many 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.190
 models and I think that is said in 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.239
 convinced that it works a lot with 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.970
 with the iphone 6 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.780
 so for the users to whom 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.980
 is really the top 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.140
 in terms of screen protection there is this 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.599
 this protection a very technology 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.970
 performant that works very well 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.109
 that's all for today I 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.109
 thank you for providing me
