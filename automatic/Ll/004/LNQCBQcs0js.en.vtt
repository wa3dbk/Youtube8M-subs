00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
lot of times our upgraded aluminum ones

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.340 
lot of times our upgraded aluminum ones
we<00:00:18.060> make<00:00:18.240> skid<00:00:18.690> plates<00:00:18.900> as<00:00:19.020> well

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
we make skid plates as well

we make skid plates as well
now<00:00:19.710> these<00:00:19.800> came<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> lot<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.369> different

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
purpose of them is pretty much all the

one<00:00:57.239> here<00:00:57.269> let's<00:00:57.570> talk<00:00:57.690> about<00:00:57.870> some<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
one here let's talk about some of the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.169 
one here let's talk about some of the
common<00:00:58.499> failures<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.039> why<00:00:59.219> these<00:00:59.280> break<00:00:59.640> if

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
common failures and why these break if

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:01.220 
common failures and why these break if
you<00:01:00.239> look<00:01:00.480> around<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.780> perimeter<00:01:01.140> here

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
you look around the perimeter here

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.750 
you look around the perimeter here
you'll<00:01:01.409> see<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> couple<00:01:01.739> holes<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.519> and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you'll see a couple holes like this and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.729 
you'll see a couple holes like this and
these<00:01:03.269> are<00:01:03.390> all<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> bolt<00:01:03.809> holes<00:01:04.050> and<00:01:04.290> over

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
these are all the bolt holes and over

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.440 
these are all the bolt holes and over
time<00:01:04.949> as<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> plastic<00:01:05.460> brittles<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.210> if<00:01:06.330> this

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
time as the plastic brittles or if this

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.240 
time as the plastic brittles or if this
takes<00:01:06.720> some<00:01:06.840> impact<00:01:07.230> then<00:01:07.800> those<00:01:08.010> little

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
takes some impact then those little

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.680 
takes some impact then those little
pieces<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.670> break<00:01:08.850> off<00:01:09.000> sometimes<00:01:09.600> these

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
pieces can break off sometimes these

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.180 
pieces can break off sometimes these
little<00:01:09.750> flanges<00:01:10.200> will<00:01:10.350> break<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.740> will<00:01:10.920> drag

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
little flanges will break this will drag

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.710 
little flanges will break this will drag
I'll<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.550> flapping<00:01:11.820> around<00:01:12.030> under<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> car

I'll be flapping around under the car

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.120 
I'll be flapping around under the car
and<00:01:12.870> it's<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.590> simple<00:01:13.860> matter<00:01:14.040> of

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
and it's just a simple matter of

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.130 
and it's just a simple matter of
unbolting<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> old<00:01:15.120> one<00:01:15.330> taking<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> pieces

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
unbolting the old one taking the pieces

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.020 
unbolting the old one taking the pieces
off<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:16.580> reinstalling<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.760> new<00:01:17.880> one

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
off and then reinstalling the new one

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.730 
off and then reinstalling the new one
and<00:01:18.120> bolting<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.450> back<00:01:18.540> together<00:01:18.690> very<00:01:19.500> easy

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and bolting it back together very easy

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
and bolting it back together very easy
not<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.400> very<00:01:20.670> expensive<00:01:21.000> thing<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.360> buy<00:01:21.540> either

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
not a very expensive thing to buy either

so one of the distinct advantages of it
of<00:01:30.420> course<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:30.990> aluminum<00:01:31.490> it

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
of course is that it's aluminum it

want to change your oil you have to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.140 
want to change your oil you have to
remove<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.830> factory<00:02:14.430> plastic<00:02:14.550> belly<00:02:14.970> pan

remove the factory plastic belly pan

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.790 
remove the factory plastic belly pan
well<00:02:15.599> that's<00:02:15.780> not<00:02:15.930> hard<00:02:16.170> it's<00:02:16.470> kind<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.709> a

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
well that's not hard it's kind of a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.650 
well that's not hard it's kind of a
nuisance<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.519> when<00:02:17.670> we<00:02:17.790> redesign<00:02:18.300> them<00:02:18.540> and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
nuisance so when we redesign them and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.030 
nuisance so when we redesign them and
did<00:02:18.750> our<00:02:18.810> heavy<00:02:18.989> duty<00:02:19.050> aluminum<00:02:19.319> ones<00:02:19.739> we<00:02:19.890> made

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
did our heavy duty aluminum ones we made

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.770 
did our heavy duty aluminum ones we made
cut<00:02:20.310> outs<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.760> get<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.090> drain<00:02:21.300> plug<00:02:21.480> for

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
cut outs to get to the drain plug for

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.080 
cut outs to get to the drain plug for
the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.850 
the
and<00:02:22.270> also<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.930> get<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.230> oil<00:02:23.380> filter<00:02:23.590> on

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
and also to get to the oil filter on

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.309 
and also to get to the oil filter on
this<00:02:24.400> one<00:02:24.640> here<00:02:24.880> you<00:02:25.209> can<00:02:25.270> see<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.720> we<00:02:26.170> have<00:02:26.290> a

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
this one here you can see that we have a

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.050 
this one here you can see that we have a
cutout<00:02:26.530> right<00:02:26.860> here<00:02:27.040> for<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.250> oil<00:02:27.430> filter<00:02:27.610> so

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
cutout right here for the oil filter so

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.370 
cutout right here for the oil filter so
that<00:02:28.090> means<00:02:28.330> when<00:02:28.660> you're<00:02:28.840> changing<00:02:29.230> your<00:02:29.349> oil

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
that means when you're changing your oil

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.380 
that means when you're changing your oil
all<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.040> have<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.310> do<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.610> just<00:02:31.060> take<00:02:31.209> your<00:02:31.239> oil

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
all you have to do is just take your oil

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.300 
all you have to do is just take your oil
filter<00:02:31.599> off<00:02:31.810> drain<00:02:32.380> plugs<00:02:32.620> here<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.010> you

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
filter off drain plugs here and you

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.589 
filter off drain plugs here and you
don't<00:02:33.459> even<00:02:33.550> have<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.730> remove<00:02:33.940> this<00:02:34.120> plate<00:02:34.360> so

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
don't even have to remove this plate so

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.630 
don't even have to remove this plate so
it's<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.230> nice<00:02:35.349> added<00:02:35.830> piece<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.130> convenience
