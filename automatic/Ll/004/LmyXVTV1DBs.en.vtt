secrets his working technique would be
not<00:00:29.970> such<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> mystery<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.199> would<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> process

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.600 

in<00:01:13.509> the<00:01:13.750> next<00:01:14.110> step<00:01:14.320> he<00:01:14.560> would<00:01:14.680> take<00:01:14.920> some<00:01:15.369> of

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
in the next step he would take some of

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.139 
in the next step he would take some of
these<00:01:16.000> symbols<00:01:16.780> that<00:01:17.409> he<00:01:17.590> collected<00:01:18.190> and<00:01:18.430> put

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
it together to some scratchers the

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.210 
it together to some scratchers the
scriptures<00:01:22.090> are<00:01:22.330> not<00:01:22.530> picture<00:01:23.530> of<00:01:23.649> like<00:01:23.860> like

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
full of meaning because first he was

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.430 
full of meaning because first he was
collecting<00:01:30.100> not<00:01:30.850> things<00:01:31.270> but<00:01:31.810> symbols

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
symbols with a meaning and this meanings

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.760 
symbols with a meaning and this meanings
are<00:01:35.950> put<00:01:36.340> together<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:37.390> a<00:01:37.420> new<00:01:37.509> context<00:01:38.440> in<00:01:38.590> a

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
are put together to a new context in a

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:52.270 
are put together to a new context in a
new<00:01:38.950> picture

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.760 

in<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.640> next<00:01:53.940> step<00:01:54.270> he<00:01:54.600> will<00:01:54.780> try<00:01:55.140> some<00:01:55.470> color

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
in the next step he will try some color

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.250 
in the next step he will try some color
designs<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.640> color<00:01:56.910> designs<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.840> doing

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
designs this color designs is doing

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.490 
designs this color designs is doing
mostly<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:59.430> watercolors<00:02:00.300> because<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.320> a

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
mostly with watercolors because it's a

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.219 
mostly with watercolors because it's a
quick<00:02:01.770> way<00:02:02.010> to<00:02:02.040> find<00:02:02.250> out<00:02:02.730> which<00:02:03.060> colors<00:02:03.780> are

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
quick way to find out which colors are

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.240 
quick way to find out which colors are
working<00:02:05.010> together<00:02:05.220> which<00:02:06.150> not<00:02:06.510> and<00:02:06.780> also<00:02:07.440> you

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
working together which not and also you

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.580 
working together which not and also you
can<00:02:08.459> see<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.910> structure<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.140> picture

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
can see the structure of the picture

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:28.220 
can see the structure of the picture
very<00:02:10.830> well<00:02:11.459> already<00:02:12.360> with<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.959> watercolors

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.610 

the<00:02:28.800> next<00:02:29.370> step<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.849> unusually<00:02:30.840> acrylic

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
the next step is unusually acrylic

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.339 
the next step is unusually acrylic
because<00:02:32.040> he<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.790> putting<00:02:33.150> over<00:02:33.720> his<00:02:33.930> design

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
because he is putting over his design

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.850 
because he is putting over his design
and<00:02:34.620> get<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.780> transforming<00:02:36.780> his<00:02:37.319> first

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
and get and transforming his first

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.990 
and get and transforming his first
scratches<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.209> canvas<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.370> then<00:02:41.370> all<00:02:41.640> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
scratches to the canvas and then all the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.290 
scratches to the canvas and then all the
outlines<00:02:42.599> are<00:02:42.930> made<00:02:43.500> again<00:02:44.130> with<00:02:44.489> protion

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
outlines are made again with protion

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:59.880 
outlines are made again with protion
blue

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.880 

the<00:03:00.430> next<00:03:00.820> step<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.630> work<00:03:01.780> all<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.410> colors

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
the next step is to work all the colors

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.910 
the next step is to work all the colors
that<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.220> already<00:03:03.730> have<00:03:04.270> in<00:03:04.480> my<00:03:04.510> color<00:03:05.380> designs

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
that I already have in my color designs

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.090 
that I already have in my color designs
I'm<00:03:06.280> working<00:03:07.030> not<00:03:07.630> with<00:03:07.900> big<00:03:08.140> spaces<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.980> make

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
I'm working not with big spaces to make

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.830 
I'm working not with big spaces to make
the<00:03:09.390> sky<00:03:10.390> blue<00:03:10.750> but<00:03:11.320> from<00:03:11.920> one<00:03:12.310> focus<00:03:12.880> point<00:03:12.910> to

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
the sky blue but from one focus point to

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:26.460 
the sky blue but from one focus point to
the<00:03:13.990> outside<00:03:24.450> now<00:03:25.450> I'm<00:03:25.660> finishing<00:03:26.170> the

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
the outside now I'm finishing the

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.590 
the outside now I'm finishing the
picture<00:03:26.650> but<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.250> best<00:03:27.430> part<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.270> Google

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
picture but the best part of the Google

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.350 
picture but the best part of the Google
picture<00:03:29.110> is<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.860> has<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.400> be<00:03:30.550> unfinished

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
picture is that it has to be unfinished

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.140 
picture is that it has to be unfinished
