tuning in so today we're going to be
doing<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.910> bit<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.120> review<00:00:15.450> on<00:00:16.940> this<00:00:18.260> which<00:00:19.260> is

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
doing a bit of a review on this which is

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.370 
doing a bit of a review on this which is
muscle<00:00:20.760> pharm<00:00:21.439> combat<00:00:22.439> powder<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:24.380> Vance

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380

time-release<00:00:26.189> protein<00:00:26.789> chocolate<00:00:27.180> little

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
time-release protein chocolate little

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.089 
time-release protein chocolate little
over<00:00:28.550> so<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.789> got<00:00:30.029> given<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.949> literally<00:00:31.949> have

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
over so I got given this literally have

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.420 
over so I got given this literally have
no<00:00:32.250> idea<00:00:32.930> what<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:35.100> I'm<00:00:35.190> gonna<00:00:35.309> go

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
no idea what it's like so I'm gonna go

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.959 
no idea what it's like so I'm gonna go
give<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.760> go<00:00:37.160> first<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.280> all<00:00:38.340> gonna<00:00:38.520> stop<00:00:38.790> I

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
give it a go first of all gonna stop I

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.389 
give it a go first of all gonna stop I
have<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> look<00:00:39.390> at<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.719> nutritional<00:00:40.590> info<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
have a look at the nutritional info and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.920 
have a look at the nutritional info and
we'll<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.670> how<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.270> guys<00:00:42.450> so

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
we'll see how it is for you guys so

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.660 
we'll see how it is for you guys so
again<00:00:43.649> I've<00:00:43.770> never<00:00:43.920> read<00:00:44.129> any<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.579> I'm

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
again I've never read any of this so I'm

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.020 
again I've never read any of this so I'm
not<00:00:44.850> really<00:00:45.000> sure<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:46.129> scoop<00:00:47.129> size<00:00:47.340> has<00:00:47.579> 35

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
not really sure so scoop size has 35

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.470 
not really sure so scoop size has 35
grams<00:00:49.219> 1<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.579> what<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.730> get<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.120> so

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
grams 1 this is what you get for it so

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.689 
grams 1 this is what you get for it so
130<00:00:52.469> calories<00:00:53.239> 15<00:00:54.239> calories<00:00:54.629> from<00:00:54.960> fat<00:00:55.050> so

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
130 calories 15 calories from fat so

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.979 
130 calories 15 calories from fat so
it's<00:00:56.699> pretty<00:00:56.910> good<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.329> want<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.600> low<00:00:57.750> fat

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
it's pretty good if you want in low fat

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.049 
it's pretty good if you want in low fat
again<00:00:58.170> that's<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.010> same<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.489> most<00:00:59.609> proteins

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
again that's the same for most proteins

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.009 
again that's the same for most proteins
though<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:02.210> it<00:01:03.210> some<00:01:03.390> love<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.809> what's

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
though to do it some love to see what's

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.890 
though to do it some love to see what's
actually<00:01:04.140> important<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.330> get<00:01:06.420> five<00:01:06.630> grams

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
actually important so we get five grams

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.600 
actually important so we get five grams
of<00:01:07.080> carbs<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:08.340> gram<00:01:08.580> which<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.470> for<00:01:10.470> fiber<00:01:10.770> two

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
of carbs one gram which is for fiber two

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.020 
of carbs one gram which is for fiber two
grams<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.000> sugar<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.570> 24<00:01:13.350> grams<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.680> protein

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
grams of sugar and 24 grams of protein

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.039 
grams of sugar and 24 grams of protein
it's<00:01:15.030> pretty<00:01:15.240> good<00:01:15.390> there's<00:01:15.689> not<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> lot

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it's pretty good there's not a lot

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.510 
it's pretty good there's not a lot
really<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:16.979> apart<00:01:17.729> from<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:19.710> it

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
really in there apart from that so so it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.890 
really in there apart from that so so it
looks<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.090> pretty<00:01:21.150> good<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.780> would

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
looks like it's pretty good as you would

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.899 
looks like it's pretty good as you would
expect<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.100> thing<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
expect but the thing with this is that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.760 
expect but the thing with this is that
this<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.150> all<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.810> little<00:01:25.229> bit<00:01:25.409> different<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
this is all a little bit different to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.640 
this is all a little bit different to
normal<00:01:25.890> puts<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:27.000> as<00:01:27.210> micro<00:01:28.080> filtered<00:01:28.500> whey

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
normal puts it as micro filtered whey

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.539 
normal puts it as micro filtered whey
protein<00:01:29.100> blend<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:31.320> has<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.799> trademark

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
protein blend and it has the trademark

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.319 
protein blend and it has the trademark
of<00:01:32.700> combat<00:01:33.390> powder<00:01:33.860> propriety<00:01:34.860> time<00:01:35.759> release

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
of combat powder propriety time release

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.590 
of combat powder propriety time release
system<00:01:36.950> now<00:01:37.950> we've<00:01:38.729> got<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.909> understand<00:01:39.299> that

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
system now we've got to understand that

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.990 
system now we've got to understand that
that's<00:01:39.960> basically<00:01:40.290> lingo<00:01:40.770> for<00:01:41.009> will<00:01:41.759> power

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
that's basically lingo for will power

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.639 
that's basically lingo for will power
over<00:01:42.210> much<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.420> whatever<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.930> want<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> but

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
over much of whatever we want in it but

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.719 
over much of whatever we want in it but
we<00:01:43.770> live<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> look<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.310> what's<00:01:44.610> actually

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
we live a look and see what's actually

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.340 
we live a look and see what's actually
in<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.299> we've<00:01:45.450> got<00:01:45.600> whey<00:01:45.780> protein<00:01:46.200> isolate

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
in it so we've got whey protein isolate

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.530 
in it so we've got whey protein isolate
which<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.689> very<00:01:48.689> good<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:50.610> chances<00:01:51.000> are<00:01:51.119> not<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
which is very good the chances are not a

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.630 
which is very good the chances are not a
lot<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.079> we'll<00:01:52.229> go<00:01:52.350> through<00:01:52.640> partially

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
lot of it but we'll go through partially

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.240 
lot of it but we'll go through partially
hydrolyzed<00:01:54.149> whey<00:01:54.390> protein<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:56.009> means

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
hydrolyzed whey protein so that means

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.760 
hydrolyzed whey protein so that means
that<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.880> absorbs<00:01:57.689> even<00:01:57.899> faster<00:01:58.350> than<00:01:58.500> whey

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
that it absorbs even faster than whey

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.709 
that it absorbs even faster than whey
protein<00:01:59.159> isolate<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.210> absorbs<00:02:00.570> faster

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
protein isolate and that absorbs faster

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.109 
protein isolate and that absorbs faster
than<00:02:00.990> whey<00:02:01.079> protein<00:02:01.469> concentrate<00:02:01.969> it's<00:02:02.969> got

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
than whey protein concentrate it's got

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.870 
than whey protein concentrate it's got
micellar<00:02:03.540> casein<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.740> that's<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.399> slow

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
micellar casein so that's a slow

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.930 
micellar casein so that's a slow
digesting<00:02:06.619> protein<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.280> need<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.580> get<00:02:08.670> milk

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
digesting protein so we need to get milk

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.479 
digesting protein so we need to get milk
the<00:02:09.179> protein<00:02:09.569> eighty<00:02:09.899> percent<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.530> way<00:02:10.770> twenty

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
the protein eighty percent is way twenty

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.800 
the protein eighty percent is way twenty
percent<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.819> casein<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.870> slow<00:02:13.080> release<00:02:13.319> in

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
percent is casein to slow release in

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.990 
percent is casein to slow release in
then<00:02:14.200> you've<00:02:14.319> got<00:02:14.440> whey<00:02:14.560> protein<00:02:14.920> concentrate

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
then you've got whey protein concentrate

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.390 
then you've got whey protein concentrate
which<00:02:16.000> we've<00:02:16.330> already<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:16.720> just<00:02:17.500> said<00:02:17.739> and

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
which we've already this just said and

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.050 
which we've already this just said and
egg<00:02:18.849> albumen<00:02:19.810> which<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:20.860> basically<00:02:21.400> egg

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
egg albumen which is basically egg

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.970 
egg albumen which is basically egg
protein<00:02:22.569> so<00:02:23.110> that's<00:02:23.290> pretty<00:02:23.440> good<00:02:23.650> that's

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
protein so that's pretty good that's

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.309 
protein so that's pretty good that's
most<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.310> medium<00:02:24.670> release<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.900> idea<00:02:26.050> is

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
most of medium release so the idea is

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.020 
most of medium release so the idea is
that<00:02:26.560> you're<00:02:27.430> going<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.610> have<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> steady

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
that you're going to have a steady

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.839 
that you're going to have a steady
stream<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:28.420> protein<00:02:28.959> now<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.830> haven't<00:02:30.250> yet<00:02:30.580> read

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
stream of protein now I haven't yet read

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.400 
stream of protein now I haven't yet read
enough<00:02:31.180> studies<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.720> really<00:02:31.989> show<00:02:32.170> whether

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
enough studies that really show whether

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.350 
enough studies that really show whether
it<00:02:32.500> makes<00:02:32.650> too<00:02:32.920> much<00:02:33.069> of<00:02:33.220> an<00:02:33.310> impact<00:02:33.610> I've<00:02:34.030> read

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
it makes too much of an impact I've read

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.140 
it makes too much of an impact I've read
quite<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:35.530> few<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.130> essentially<00:02:36.730> they<00:02:36.970> say

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
quite a few and essentially they say

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.100 
quite a few and essentially they say
that<00:02:37.420> having<00:02:38.140> protein<00:02:38.500> helps<00:02:39.599> but<00:02:40.599> whether

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
that having protein helps but whether

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.990 
that having protein helps but whether
it's<00:02:41.319> time<00:02:41.530> for<00:02:41.709> these<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:42.160> little<00:02:42.790> bit<00:02:42.880> unsure

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
it's time for these a little bit unsure

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.640 
it's time for these a little bit unsure
I<00:02:43.150> mean<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:43.989> pretty<00:02:44.170> good<00:02:44.349> if<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.470> want<00:02:44.590> to

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
I mean it's pretty good if you want to

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.910 
I mean it's pretty good if you want to
tick<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.800> boxes<00:02:45.220> now<00:02:46.120> I'll<00:02:46.900> put<00:02:47.080> it<00:02:47.170> on<00:02:47.319> on<00:02:47.650> the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
tick the boxes now I'll put it on on the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.940 
tick the boxes now I'll put it on on the
video<00:02:48.130> afterwards<00:02:48.430> just<00:02:49.000> just<00:02:49.330> here<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:50.319> I<00:02:50.350> say

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
video afterwards just just here so I say

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.830 
video afterwards just just here so I say
how<00:02:51.160> much<00:02:51.370> this<00:02:51.970> have<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.269> cast<00:02:52.480> because<00:02:52.690> i

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
how much this have to cast because i

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.500 
how much this have to cast because i
don't<00:02:53.080> know<00:02:53.200> i<00:02:53.230> didn't<00:02:53.500> pay<00:02:53.620> for<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:54.510> but

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
don't know i didn't pay for it but

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.300 
don't know i didn't pay for it but
getting<00:02:55.750> there<00:02:55.930> go<00:02:56.049> so<00:02:56.350> like<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.769> said<00:02:56.830> it's

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
getting there go so like I said it's

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.330 
getting there go so like I said it's
chocolate<00:02:57.790> milk<00:02:58.000> flavor<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.950> it's<00:02:59.950> meant<00:03:00.250> to

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
chocolate milk flavor and it's meant to

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.960 
chocolate milk flavor and it's meant to
be<00:03:00.370> mixed<00:03:00.730> with<00:03:01.410> 8<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.739> 12<00:03:03.010> fluid<00:03:03.400> ounces<00:03:03.519> of

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
be mixed with 8 to 12 fluid ounces of

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.039 
be mixed with 8 to 12 fluid ounces of
cold<00:03:04.180> water<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:06.099> don't<00:03:06.340> know<00:03:06.430> what<00:03:06.519> that<00:03:06.549> is

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
cold water and I don't know what that is

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.520 
cold water and I don't know what that is
so<00:03:08.049> with<00:03:08.709> using<00:03:09.489> 300<00:03:10.330> milliliters<00:03:10.900> of<00:03:10.930> semi<00:03:11.380> to

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
so with using 300 milliliters of semi to

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.370 
so with using 300 milliliters of semi to
get<00:03:11.680> milk<00:03:12.630> let's<00:03:13.630> have<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.810> look<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.110> increase

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
get milk let's have a look to increase

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.780 
get milk let's have a look to increase
your<00:03:14.440> protein<00:03:14.680> intake<00:03:14.920> per<00:03:15.280> serving<00:03:15.700> and

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
your protein intake per serving and

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.940 
your protein intake per serving and
achieve<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.150> delicious<00:03:16.690> milkshake<00:03:17.019> tastes<00:03:17.380> you

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
achieve a delicious milkshake tastes you

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.250 
achieve a delicious milkshake tastes you
skip<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.250> low-fat<00:03:18.670> milk<00:03:18.850> instead<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.209> water<00:03:19.299> so

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
skip a low-fat milk instead of water so

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.090 
skip a low-fat milk instead of water so
we've<00:03:20.769> done<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:22.150> let's<00:03:22.299> give<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.570> go

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
we've done that so let's give it a go

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.360 
we've done that so let's give it a go
okay<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.220> is<00:03:28.140> quite<00:03:29.140> a<00:03:29.290> big<00:03:29.560> scoop<00:03:29.799> most

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
okay so it is quite a big scoop most

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.620 
okay so it is quite a big scoop most
protein<00:03:30.790> is<00:03:30.970> 25<00:03:31.600> gram<00:03:32.109> scoop<00:03:32.470> or<00:03:33.390> so<00:03:34.390> as<00:03:34.510> you

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
protein is 25 gram scoop or so as you

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.500 
protein is 25 gram scoop or so as you
can<00:03:34.720> see<00:03:34.900> it's<00:03:35.049> pretty<00:03:35.200> large<00:03:36.239> forget<00:03:37.239> that<00:03:37.390> in

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
can see it's pretty large forget that in

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.479 
can see it's pretty large forget that in
the<00:03:37.690> going<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.260> do<00:03:38.350> that<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.799> five<00:03:39.010> shake<00:03:39.250> test

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
the going to do that the five shake test

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:46.050 
the going to do that the five shake test
is<00:03:39.640> normal<00:03:40.000> we'll<00:03:40.690> see<00:03:40.840> how<00:03:40.900> that<00:03:41.019> goes<00:03:45.060> so

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
is normal we'll see how that goes so

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.280 
is normal we'll see how that goes so
hopefully<00:03:46.239> if<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:46.510> guys<00:03:46.660> are<00:03:46.840> watching<00:03:46.930> this

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
hopefully if you guys are watching this

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.140 
hopefully if you guys are watching this
you<00:03:47.950> rather<00:03:48.069> just<00:03:48.220> interested<00:03:48.819> to<00:03:48.880> see<00:03:49.030> what

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
you rather just interested to see what

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.750 
you rather just interested to see what
sort<00:03:49.359> of<00:03:49.420> proteins<00:03:50.410> are<00:03:50.560> good<00:03:50.739> all<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.609> want

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
sort of proteins are good all you want

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.550 
sort of proteins are good all you want
to<00:03:51.790> know<00:03:51.910> whether<00:03:52.180> this<00:03:52.480> specific<00:03:53.139> muscle

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
to know whether this specific muscle

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.580 
to know whether this specific muscle
file<00:03:53.769> combat<00:03:54.280> powder<00:03:54.549> is<00:03:55.109> you<00:03:56.109> know<00:03:56.260> what

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
file combat powder is you know what

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.530 
file combat powder is you know what
matters<00:03:56.980> as<00:03:57.160> in<00:03:58.030> so<00:03:59.700> as<00:04:00.700> I<00:04:00.850> said<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.060> don't<00:04:01.150> yet

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
matters as in so as I said I don't yet

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.120 
matters as in so as I said I don't yet
know<00:04:01.569> what<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.290> price<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.799> is<00:04:02.950> because

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
know what the the price of it is because

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.129 
know what the the price of it is because
I<00:04:03.280> haven't<00:04:03.430> looked<00:04:03.760> but<00:04:04.750> we're<00:04:04.870> going<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.019> see

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
I haven't looked but we're going to see

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:10.020 
I haven't looked but we're going to see
what<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.319> taste<00:04:05.530> is<00:04:05.739> like<00:04:05.920> so<00:04:06.310> again<00:04:09.030> five

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
what the taste is like so again five

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.520 
what the taste is like so again five
shapes<00:04:10.420> that's<00:04:10.900> just<00:04:11.049> to<00:04:11.200> see<00:04:11.350> how<00:04:11.410> it

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
shapes that's just to see how it

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.990
