00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
you a failed artist in my opinion to the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.150 
you a failed artist in my opinion to the
next<00:02:59.120> step<00:02:59.299> would<00:02:59.630> be<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.810> cut<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.470> hole<00:03:00.830> right

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
next step would be to cut a hole right

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.610 
next step would be to cut a hole right
here<00:03:01.790> in<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.450> painting<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.819> rig<00:03:04.819> up<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.180> hose

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
here in the painting and rig up a hose

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.949 
here in the painting and rig up a hose
behind<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:07.310> come<00:03:07.640> out<00:03:07.910> right<00:03:08.450> where<00:03:08.750> you're

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
behind to come out right where you're

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.470 
behind to come out right where you're
cutting<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.500> hole<00:03:09.799> and<00:03:10.130> then<00:03:10.519> just<00:03:10.760> turn<00:03:11.150> the

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
cutting that hole and then just turn the

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.170 
cutting that hole and then just turn the
hose<00:03:11.720> on<00:03:11.959> full<00:03:12.380> blast<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:13.430> there<00:03:13.670> will<00:03:13.820> always

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
hose on full blast so there will always

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.020 
hose on full blast so there will always
be<00:03:14.390> water<00:03:15.230> flowing<00:03:16.010> out<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.489> river<00:03:16.700> and

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
be water flowing out of the river and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.539 
be water flowing out of the river and
then<00:03:17.299> you<00:03:17.450> will<00:03:17.570> have<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:18.530> true<00:03:19.100> art<00:03:21.400> there<00:03:22.400> you

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
then you will have a true art there you

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.310 
then you will have a true art there you
go<00:03:23.290> they<00:03:24.290> went<00:03:24.500> go<00:03:24.799> ahead<00:03:24.950> now<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:26.230> don't<00:03:27.230> know

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
go they went go ahead now I don't know

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.650 
go they went go ahead now I don't know
about<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.650> but<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.859> believe<00:03:28.370> there<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.329> actual

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
about you but I believe there is actual

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:38.140 
about you but I believe there is actual
water<00:03:30.019> flowing<00:03:30.590> from<00:03:30.769> this<00:03:30.980> Creek<00:03:35.829> well<00:03:37.150> Adam

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
water flowing from this Creek well Adam

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.690 
water flowing from this Creek well Adam
I<00:03:38.390> think<00:03:38.660> that<00:03:38.780> this<00:03:39.260> painting<00:03:39.799> uh<00:03:39.829> should

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
I think that this painting uh should

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.880 
I think that this painting uh should
look<00:03:40.850> familiar<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.269> you<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:42.140> certainly<00:03:42.410> does

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
look familiar to you it certainly does

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.150 
look familiar to you it certainly does
