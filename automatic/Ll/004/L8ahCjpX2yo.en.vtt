00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.010 
I think that's what excites us the most
is<00:01:10.860> getting<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.020> expressing

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
is getting out there and expressing

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.539 
is getting out there and expressing
ourselves<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.979> pressure<00:01:14.250> of

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
ourselves it's not the pressure of

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.920 
ourselves it's not the pressure of
competition<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:16.229> know<00:01:16.640> how<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.060> take<00:01:18.900> a
