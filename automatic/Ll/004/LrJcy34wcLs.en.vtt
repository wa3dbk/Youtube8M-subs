so that I can flip it later I'm going to

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.129 
so that I can flip it later I'm going to
do<00:04:32.370> a<00:04:32.400> straight<00:04:32.850> stitch<00:04:33.090> that<00:04:33.570> goes<00:04:33.630> in<00:04:33.960> and

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.939 
pieces on the same side and you can tie
a<00:05:13.680> knot

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:26.159
