00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:08.559
 Yes is a Hi Hideyuki Kamoshita you talk about the need for hopping brake today 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:14.230
 I will do 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:15.639
 It is whether it is necessary whether it is necessary in the first place, but from the conclusion 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.180
 I would like to say 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:24.830
 Pumping brakes are not orthodox now 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.240
 If I think whether it is better to be modified, which is attached habit I still 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:33.030
 Though it is a pumping brake 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.690
 Forget the time being gone was better to for those who are not your Zonchi running and keep the death car 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.280
 is not it 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:43.690
 When I used to go to bed when I was moving forward toward the stop line 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.180
 Brake several times 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:56.820
 Take a step and stay on the following car 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:01:02.220
 In prompting Yes I think I know but I was art methods say that I please stop and I do not even driving school 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:07.020
 It was about 15 years ago when I got a license, but it's over 15 years ago 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.439
 Time to tell him today I mean that I please use this pumping brake of 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.640
 We just below the 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:14.190
 The 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:19.140
 The cars in the current behavior are pretty rare if you take this approach 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:26.360
 Now that's why if you do something like this 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:30.680
 That 's what I want to do that car many times in the petapeta brakes 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:36.730
 It means that there are many people who seem strange cars 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.730
 It is Toshimashite now approach if so stay 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:44.360
 Take your foot off the accelerator as soon as possible when the previous signal turns red 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.120
 this 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.190
 Is against the stop position hey yeah 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:59.120
 At body deceleration 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:02:03.470
 Gently put the foot on the brake and there is also a head at a constant speed 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:09.680
 It becomes standard to say 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:14.360
 Though it is strange story that way of thinking is different from now on and now and now 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.310
 As it is very long and fast in the current behavior 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.500
 It is in this way 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:25.730
 When I do a technique such as stopping the brakes and the brakes 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.870
 After all there is that you can not take on the battle of the code 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:33.480
 In the driver too 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.040
 Signal is red it is also becoming far downy war would I have become I you better than the old days ahead 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.250
 It was like that 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:46.390
 Ah-this car has started to apply the brakes will turn ahead in the future 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.880
 I think that it has come to be able to predict in 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:55.660
 I'm stopping at a certain brake 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:59.560
 It is not because the stay and Gyu' it this is it I went a while without the pumping 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:05.410
 I though this is the same thing as Well implications also only 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:08.870
 It will stop by the fixed principle 5 instead of dividing sentences 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:14.330
 If I am stopped at the I tread the way, such as Tteyuu aj 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:19.610
 I think it will be easier to ride the whole flow so now this pumping brake 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:25.280
 We will talk today by say I'm low as much need right under 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:27.579
 I went raised brew I was allowed to talk about the need for more pumping brake 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.579
 Could
