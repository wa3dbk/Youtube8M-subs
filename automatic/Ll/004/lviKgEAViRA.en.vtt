00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.330
 presents the temple of the fire phoenix 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.560
 the legend of lego schemas that promises 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.510
 full of beautiful things there are seven 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.010
 characters inside I'm showing you 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.830
 this is the front of the box attention 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.600
 look at the back of the box 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.070
 promises a lot to climb everything from 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.020
 next I propose to see what he 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:36.350
 is inside and proceed to 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:39.140
 mounting inside the box low on 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.280
 There are 9 bags numbered 1 2 3 4 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.289
 5 6 7 8 9 pepper so there is also a 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.050
 little paper with the little ones 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:53.179
 stickers and 3 nautiz installations 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:58.339
 the first so for the sachets of 1 and 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:01:00.139
 2 the second for the 3rd to the 5th and the 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.389
 third from 6 to 9 

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:04.400
 so it promises nice hours of 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:11.690
 perspective editing 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:13.970
 I'll start right now 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.220
 so our fire phoenix temple then 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.300
 this is it is really beautiful you 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.400
 can see it there are plenty of things 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.690
 it's wonderful I think it's 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.060
 a very nice success in any case of 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.390
 lego me it took me about three 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.760
 hours to ride anyway a little sport 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.070
 family with children all that stuff 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.050
 can put maybe more but hey 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.600
 is part of the game too it's a bit 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.490
 like a big scale model if we can so 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.360
 we mean it's already the first steps 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.070
 in model making 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.680
 so I like that so it falls 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.840
 well so I present to you and already then 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.950
 there are seven characters on this temple 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.340
 in this box in fact so that's it 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:57.080

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.470

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.940
 here we can open the doors like that 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.590
 the grids 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.500
 here it is beautiful there are plenty of 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.670
 mussels of fire that can be pulled I 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.040
 will show you a clear example 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.800

 it's fantastic it's used to that 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.370
 attackers just have to stand 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.730
 what else do we have to this vehicle 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.010
 who also turns look up 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.340
 the heavy stuff I do it 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.340
 to take off 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.230
 he is able to throw his balls of 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.230
 ice too a pure it's the same 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.540

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.280
 also show what does his 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.310
 small off-road vehicles it's 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.890
 able by pressing there you go 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.510
 attack his opponents 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.280
 just press this key here 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.270
 I'm going to pick up my glider and I'm going 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.650
 show you two three little things 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.990
 klein on the glider what we can 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.940
 to do when the glider and ben that's 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.480
 simple we can lower the front like that 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.180
 to extract the character our pilot 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.520
 is he also going so that he can 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.470
 hover it will beat these parts 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:41.250
 that's where he really has a form of 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:43.290
 glider that can fly thiriez and aim 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.380
 his enemies that's great 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.680
 so I rested on his vehicle in 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.019
 two tigers pif 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.980
 that's it and now we're going 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.810
 switch to fire chi mode then the mochi 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.459
 of fire passed with our phoenix one 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.739
 so to do that already I'm going 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:07.470
 put my pilot at the helm of the crime 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:11.070
 is a pilot the paleo take off 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:14.760
 ok alas here in this part down I 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:18.720
 will reload my bow thrower 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.560
 fire I added a lila document there 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.340
 already has a lot 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.030
 it will have to be dumped is ready to 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.700
 lift-off 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.000
 be careful then to do this I take 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.770
 my phoenix like this and here already first 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.490
 transformation then 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.860
 I'm pushing here forward to complete 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.810
 his transformation look at this not 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.320
 wonderful 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.320
 he is magnificent 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.780
 tell the glider inside well 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.910
 to hold because with that opposite no then 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.650
 it exists to drop small 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.580
 fireballs eh ben there here a part 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.060
 on which to support 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.460
 alas the fireball falling for example 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.900
 I was going on Lille and towards the 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.610
 camp in the game gets a little scared that 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.740
 his grave but no it is very resistant 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:12.509
 still be careful i'll tell you 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:15.330
 the enemy and that's it I dropped my ball 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.889
 fire on the enemy is very easy and 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.620
 it's great it works very well there 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.690
 can launch the cannons and you ok I'll 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.580
 rest that part my finish I him 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.770
 put aside the history of the internet 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.729
 a bit about other elements of the decor 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.000
 this part 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.530
 so good inside we had I know 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.599
 more how many fireballs we have at 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.930
 total chuck still not bad a 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:39.840
 about ten is here it's gone from a 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.000
 we can modify it like that to make 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.360
 true ramparts true fortress one 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.130
 time our phoenix took off 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.199
 story of resisting the invader 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.560
 Well, here I am, I think I did 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:55.979
 turn on the flying phoenix temple 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.260
 lego it's really great me i want 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.650
 say I really like the models 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.030
 lego too and for me it was a little 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.180
 Well, it's a bit of both at the same time 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.650
 it's legos of model making it's 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.190
 really great 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.320
 in fact the kids will love even the 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.240
 big because frankly that's 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.690
 beautiful beautiful lights beautiful 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.590
 colors 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:22.159
 there are plenty of details that's fine 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:24.330
 articulated good finally here I recommend 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:26.340
 otherwise if you want to see two demos 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.810
 other toys it's always on 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.810
