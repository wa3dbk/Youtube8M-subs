like that and usually had a pretty
intricate<00:03:30.010> backstory<00:03:30.850> now<00:03:31.480> there<00:03:31.600> were<00:03:31.690> two

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.060 
the game now I've never actually been a
gamer<00:03:37.660> but<00:03:37.960> it's<00:03:38.260> certainly<00:03:38.440> not<00:03:38.680> for<00:03:38.860> lack<00:03:39.040> of

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
gamer but it's certainly not for lack of

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.150 
gamer but it's certainly not for lack of
interest<00:03:39.670> more<00:03:40.060> lack<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:40.870> exposure<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.740> never

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.980 
interest more lack of exposure I never
knew<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.430> these<00:03:42.670> types<00:03:42.940> of<00:03:43.030> games<00:03:43.090> existed

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
knew that these types of games existed

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.380 
knew that these types of games existed
but<00:03:44.140> I<00:03:44.200> did<00:03:44.530> enjoy<00:03:44.740> playing<00:03:45.400> games<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:46.150> the

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.290 
same sort and I also enjoyed making up
characters<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:50.230> creating<00:03:51.010> things<00:03:51.730> like<00:03:52.090> that

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
characters and creating things like that

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.120 
characters and creating things like that
and<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.960> second<00:03:53.320> thing<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:53.620> loved<00:03:53.890> about

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
and the second thing that I loved about

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.280 
and the second thing that I loved about
this<00:03:54.310> book<00:03:54.550> was<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:55.180> house<00:03:55.420> which<00:03:55.870> of<00:03:56.230> course

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
this book was the house which of course

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.210 
this book was the house which of course
is<00:03:56.890> haunted<00:03:57.430> and<00:03:57.580> I<00:03:57.900> love<00:03:58.900> haunted<00:03:59.800> houses<00:04:00.160> I

think<00:04:00.400> that's<00:04:00.550> my<00:04:00.700> favorite<00:04:00.840> aspect<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:01.960> any

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
think that's my favorite aspect of any

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.920 
think that's my favorite aspect of any
horror<00:04:03.010> story<00:04:03.430> is<00:04:03.730> a<00:04:04.000> haunted<00:04:04.480> house<00:04:04.630> if<00:04:04.810> it's

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
horror story is a haunted house if it's

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.720

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
love it and it's no coincidence that

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.320 
love it and it's no coincidence that
many<00:04:08.740> of<00:04:08.920> my<00:04:09.070> early<00:04:09.490> stories<00:04:09.820> that<00:04:10.090> i<00:04:10.120> wrote

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
many of my early stories that i wrote

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.570 
many of my early stories that i wrote
around<00:04:10.660> this<00:04:10.810> time<00:04:11.080> were<00:04:11.530> focused<00:04:12.460> around

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
around this time were focused around

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.760 
around this time were focused around
haunted<00:04:13.030> houses<00:04:13.450> now<00:04:13.900> there's<00:04:14.050> not<00:04:14.140> quite<00:04:14.620> as

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
haunted houses now there's not quite as

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.530 
haunted houses now there's not quite as
much<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:15.100> this<00:04:15.220> novel<00:04:15.550> as<00:04:15.670> there<00:04:15.790> is<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:16.120> some

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
much to this novel as there is to some

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.789 
much to this novel as there is to some
of<00:04:16.630> his<00:04:16.750> other<00:04:16.900> as<00:04:17.080> part<00:04:17.410> of<00:04:17.500> that<00:04:17.650> is<00:04:17.770> because

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
of his other as part of that is because

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.340 
of his other as part of that is because
instead<00:04:18.730> of<00:04:18.790> having<00:04:19.030> only<00:04:19.270> one<00:04:19.630> protagonist

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
instead of having only one protagonist

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.560 
instead of having only one protagonist
there<00:04:20.680> are<00:04:20.830> actually<00:04:21.250> six<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.270> story<00:04:22.510> is

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
there are actually six and the story is

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.630 
there are actually six and the story is
kind<00:04:22.780> of<00:04:22.840> spread<00:04:23.200> out<00:04:23.350> between<00:04:23.560> them<00:04:24.040> and<00:04:24.220> so

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
kind of spread out between them and so

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.940 
kind of spread out between them and so
we<00:04:24.880> really<00:04:25.090> don't<00:04:25.540> get<00:04:25.870> as<00:04:26.020> much<00:04:26.410> character

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
we really don't get as much character

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.830 
we really don't get as much character
development<00:04:27.460> out<00:04:27.700> of<00:04:27.940> them<00:04:28.150> but<00:04:28.600> that's<00:04:28.690> not

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
development out of them but that's not

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.750 
development out of them but that's not
really<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.290> point<00:04:29.320> of<00:04:29.920> this<00:04:30.070> story<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.520> point

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
really the point of this story the point

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.130 
really the point of this story the point
of<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:30.970> stories<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:31.330> introduced<00:04:31.900> us<00:04:32.110> to

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
of the stories that introduced us to

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.830 
of the stories that introduced us to

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
characters and it kind of give us a

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.270
