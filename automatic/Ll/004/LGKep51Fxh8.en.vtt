00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.950 

so<00:00:07.550> the<00:00:07.910> sport<00:00:08.149> of<00:00:08.240> snowboarding<00:00:08.330> is<00:00:08.840> all

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
so the sport of snowboarding is all

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.200 
so the sport of snowboarding is all
about<00:00:09.260> pushing<00:00:09.920> the<00:00:10.190> limits<00:00:10.550> and<00:00:10.700> trying<00:00:11.150> to

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
about pushing the limits and trying to

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.000 
about pushing the limits and trying to
raise<00:00:11.389> the<00:00:11.570> bar<00:00:11.750> go<00:00:12.200> bigger<00:00:12.440> than<00:00:12.680> the<00:00:12.770> next

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
raise the bar go bigger than the next

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.670 
raise the bar go bigger than the next
guy<00:00:13.040> and<00:00:13.600> recently<00:00:14.600> a<00:00:14.690> couple<00:00:15.110> snowboarders

guy and recently a couple snowboarders

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.590 
guy and recently a couple snowboarders
have<00:00:15.860> been<00:00:16.039> granted<00:00:16.340> their<00:00:16.640> own<00:00:16.789> private<00:00:17.420> half

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
have been granted their own private half

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.020 
have been granted their own private half
bites<00:00:17.960> in<00:00:18.289> order<00:00:18.560> to<00:00:18.710> practice<00:00:18.920> going<00:00:19.699> bigger

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.030 
bites in order to practice going bigger

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.099 
bites in order to practice going bigger
going<00:00:20.570> higher<00:00:20.810> and<00:00:20.859> doing<00:00:21.859> more<00:00:21.980> rotation<00:00:22.550> and

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.109 
going higher and doing more rotation and

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.919 
going higher and doing more rotation and
we<00:00:24.109> just<00:00:24.320> thought<00:00:24.500> what's<00:00:25.310> holding<00:00:25.730> us<00:00:25.880> down

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
we just thought what's holding us down

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.050 
we just thought what's holding us down
what's<00:00:26.929> preventing<00:00:27.589> us<00:00:27.890> from<00:00:27.919> taking<00:00:28.669> it<00:00:28.939> to

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
what's preventing us from taking it to

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.410 
what's preventing us from taking it to
that<00:00:29.089> next<00:00:29.390> level<00:00:30.189> gravity

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.650 

so<00:00:35.899> naturally<00:00:36.679> we<00:00:36.829> figured<00:00:37.239> time<00:00:38.239> to<00:00:38.390> build<00:00:38.539> a

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
so naturally we figured time to build a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.750 
so naturally we figured time to build a
halfpipe<00:00:38.809> on<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.379> moon<00:00:42.010> when<00:00:43.010> season<00:00:43.430> TV

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
halfpipe on the moon when season TV

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.700 
halfpipe on the moon when season TV
first<00:00:44.030> approached<00:00:44.390> he<00:00:44.690> had<00:00:44.839> to<00:00:44.989> get<00:00:45.109> past<00:00:45.350> the

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
first approached he had to get past the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.110 
first approached he had to get past the
stench<00:00:46.460> of<00:00:46.729> urine<00:00:47.479> and<00:00:47.839> whiskey<00:00:48.320> but<00:00:48.649> I

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
stench of urine and whiskey but I

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.729 
stench of urine and whiskey but I
realized<00:00:50.120> that<00:00:50.329> these<00:00:50.659> guys<00:00:50.929> are<00:00:50.989> crazy<00:00:51.409> and

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
realized that these guys are crazy and

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.490 
realized that these guys are crazy and
this<00:00:52.010> is<00:00:52.129> actually<00:00:52.549> going<00:00:52.699> to<00:00:52.760> happen<00:00:53.500> super

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
this is actually going to happen super

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.310 
this is actually going to happen super

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.359 
there on the ship there's just like this
little<00:01:07.940> pipe<00:01:08.330> in<00:01:08.600> this<00:01:08.720> big<00:01:09.080> Minj<00:01:09.409> looks<00:01:10.190> like

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
little pipe in this big Minj looks like

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.279 
little pipe in this big Minj looks like
it<00:01:10.520> didn't<00:01:10.819> belong<00:01:11.090> but<00:01:11.509> it<00:01:11.630> was<00:01:11.720> cool<00:01:11.990> at<00:01:12.200> the

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
it didn't belong but it was cool at the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.740 
it didn't belong but it was cool at the
same<00:01:12.350> time<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.310> know<00:01:13.429> what<00:01:13.490> I'm<00:01:13.640> saying<00:01:14.090> we

same time you know what I'm saying we

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.270 
same time you know what I'm saying we
all<00:01:14.869> knew<00:01:15.049> that<00:01:15.229> at<00:01:15.350> some<00:01:15.380> point<00:01:15.619> man<00:01:16.100> with

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
all knew that at some point man with

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.719 
all knew that at some point man with
Trevor<00:01:16.549> that's<00:01:17.390> just<00:01:17.659> to<00:01:17.840> give<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.170> so<00:01:19.159> we<00:01:19.580> just

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
Trevor that's just to give it so we just

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.430 
Trevor that's just to give it so we just
hit<00:01:19.819> the<00:01:19.880> fast-forward<00:01:20.270> button<00:01:20.569> and<00:01:20.959> made<00:01:21.319> it

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
hit the fast-forward button and made it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.460 
hit the fast-forward button and made it
happen<00:01:21.560> now<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.209> we<00:01:23.209> were<00:01:23.330> able<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.690> take<00:01:23.959> moon

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
happen now so we were able to take moon

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.609 
happen now so we were able to take moon
dust<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:25.240> mix<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:26.390> with<00:01:26.509> lunar<00:01:26.840> soil<00:01:27.080> to

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
dust and mix it with lunar soil to

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.919 
dust and mix it with lunar soil to
create<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.039> perfect<00:01:28.369> surface<00:01:29.030> for<00:01:29.509> this<00:01:29.659> pipe

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
create the perfect surface for this pipe

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.080 
create the perfect surface for this pipe
I<00:01:30.259> mean<00:01:30.890> it<00:01:31.009> was<00:01:31.100> a<00:01:31.159> lot<00:01:31.280> like<00:01:31.429> man-made<00:01:31.850> snow

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
I mean it was a lot like man-made snow

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.710 
I mean it was a lot like man-made snow
but<00:01:33.020> had<00:01:33.319> little<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:34.310> no<00:01:34.340> friction<00:01:35.030> it's<00:01:35.539> got

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
but had little to no friction it's got

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:45.540 
but had little to no friction it's got
this<00:01:35.869> chocky<00:01:36.679> feel<00:01:38.200> so<00:01:39.200> sick

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.310 

nASA<00:01:46.150> has<00:01:46.300> been<00:01:46.510> keeping<00:01:46.690> an<00:01:46.930> eye<00:01:47.020> on<00:01:47.050> this

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
nASA has been keeping an eye on this

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.650 
nASA has been keeping an eye on this
thing<00:01:47.530> for<00:01:47.770> us<00:01:47.940> 24-7<00:01:48.940> and<00:01:49.150> they're<00:01:49.330> able<00:01:49.450> to

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
thing for us 24-7 and they're able to

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.230 
thing for us 24-7 and they're able to
maintain<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:50.110> lunar<00:01:50.530> surface<00:01:50.710> perfectly<00:01:51.550> so

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
maintain the lunar surface perfectly so

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.990 
maintain the lunar surface perfectly so
in<00:01:52.600> june<00:01:52.810> of<00:01:53.020> 2009<00:01:53.770> they<00:01:54.010> contacted<00:01:54.640> us<00:01:54.790> and

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
said they were about to fire a missile

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.560 
said they were about to fire a missile
at<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.560> moon<00:01:56.800> it<00:01:57.520> was<00:01:57.640> known<00:01:57.850> as<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.030> l<00:01:58.270> cross

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
at the moon it was known as the l cross

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.100 
at the moon it was known as the l cross
mission<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.410> the<00:01:59.530> public<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.550> can<00:02:00.700> google<00:02:00.820> it

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.380 

obviously<00:02:05.110> this<00:02:05.530> pipe<00:02:05.890> is<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.970> much<00:02:07.150> different

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
obviously this pipe is so much different

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.240 
obviously this pipe is so much different
