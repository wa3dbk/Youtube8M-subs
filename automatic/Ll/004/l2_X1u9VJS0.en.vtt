the<00:00:32.940> wheel<00:00:33.120> which<00:00:33.780> obviously<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.440> research

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the wheel which obviously you research

the wheel which obviously you research
the<00:00:35.309> wheel<00:00:35.489> very<00:00:35.790> early<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.630> game<00:00:37.160> so

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
the wheel very early on in the game so

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.470 
the wheel very early on in the game so
essentially<00:00:38.489> what<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.760> means<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.300> you

do want to sprawl out you want to go

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.130 
do want to sprawl out you want to go
lots<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.120> cities<00:00:42.329> kind<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.649> saying

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
lots of cities kind of what it's saying

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.290 
lots of cities kind of what it's saying
the<00:00:46.140> trade<00:00:46.350> routes<00:00:46.590> will<00:00:46.920> be<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.700> about<00:00:47.850> free

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
usually their starter star bias is going

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.590 
usually their starter star bias is going

then<00:01:51.140> but<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.259> only<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.680> certain<00:01:53.159> time

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
then but it's only for that certain time

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.810 
then but it's only for that certain time
and<00:01:53.729> that's<00:01:53.970> really<00:01:54.149> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.420> dominate<00:01:55.820> so

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and that's really going to dominate so

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.969 
and that's really going to dominate so
scientific<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.740> can

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
scientific because you can you can

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.069 
scientific because you can you can
sprawl<00:01:59.579> out<00:01:59.640> you<00:02:00.030> can<00:02:00.240> branch<00:02:00.570> out<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.930> can

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
sprawl out you can branch out you can

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.230 
sprawl out you can branch out you can
make<00:02:01.229> tons<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.560> cities<00:02:01.860> without<00:02:02.030> much<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.060> a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
make tons of cities without much of a

make tons of cities without much of a
penalty<00:02:03.659> again<00:02:03.960> there's<00:02:04.200> always<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
penalty again there's always the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.200 
penalty again there's always the
happiness<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.100> money<00:02:05.369> aspects<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.030> you're

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
happiness and money aspects that you're

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.089 
happiness and money aspects that you're
gonna<00:02:06.329> have<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.540> watch<00:02:06.630> out<00:02:06.899> for<00:02:07.009> but<00:02:08.009> you'll

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
gonna have to watch out for but you'll

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.240 
gonna have to watch out for but you'll
save<00:02:08.310> money<00:02:08.489> because<00:02:09.379> we<00:02:10.379> should<00:02:10.590> ease<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.160> as

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
save money because we should ease so as

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.770 
save money because we should ease so as
long<00:02:11.370> as<00:02:11.520> you're<00:02:11.610> connected<00:02:11.790> through<00:02:12.239> forests

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
long as you're connected through forests

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.370 
long as you're connected through forests
you<00:02:12.900> won't<00:02:13.080> need

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
you won't need

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.690 
you won't need
build<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:14.300> roads<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.660> then<00:02:16.470> also<00:02:17.100> with

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
build the roads and then also with

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.340 
build the roads and then also with
science<00:02:18.150> again<00:02:18.780> you'll<00:02:18.960> have<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> lot<00:02:19.320> of

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
science again you'll have a lot of

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.230 
science again you'll have a lot of
cities<00:02:19.740> when<00:02:20.460> you<00:02:20.520> have<00:02:20.640> lots<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:21.000> cities

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
cities when you have lots of cities

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.540 
cities when you have lots of cities
young<00:02:21.810> lots<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.260> sight<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:23.010> kind<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.400> goes<00:02:23.520> hand

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
young lots of sight so kind of goes hand

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.200 
young lots of sight so kind of goes hand
in<00:02:23.760> hand<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.930> then<00:02:25.320> what<00:02:25.500> domination<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.310> would

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
in hand and then what domination I would

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.810 
in hand and then what domination I would
recommend<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.810> because<00:02:28.460> again<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.580> have<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
recommend it because again you have the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.670 
recommend it because again you have the
Mohawk<00:02:30.210> warrior<00:02:30.630> which<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:30.930> extremely<00:02:31.440> strong

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
Mohawk warrior which is extremely strong

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.180 
Mohawk warrior which is extremely strong

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
unit they will move through the forest

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
because of that he just runs around like

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.520 
because of that he just runs around like
a<00:02:44.100> ninja<00:02:44.370> it's<00:02:44.940> those<00:02:45.150> stupid<00:02:45.840> Mohawk

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
a ninja it's those stupid Mohawk

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.070 
a ninja it's those stupid Mohawk
warriors<00:02:46.980> they<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:47.850> be<00:02:47.970> killer<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.630> if<00:02:48.930> you

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
warriors they can be killer and if you

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.710 
warriors they can be killer and if you
play<00:02:49.290> as<00:02:49.500> Hiawatha<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.640> can<00:02:50.880> use<00:02:51.060> them<00:02:51.330> to

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
play as Hiawatha you can use them to

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.190 
play as Hiawatha you can use them to
your<00:02:51.840> advantage<00:02:51.900> it's<00:02:52.710> very<00:02:53.040> very<00:02:53.400> good<00:02:54.200> then

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
your advantage it's very very good then

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.400 
your advantage it's very very good then
diplomatic<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.570> win<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.780> diplomatic

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
diplomatic you can win a diplomatic

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.140 
diplomatic you can win a diplomatic
victory<00:02:58.590> but<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.370> would<00:02:59.550> say<00:02:59.700> it's<00:02:59.790> more<00:02:59.880> or

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
victory but I would say it's more or

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.030 
victory but I would say it's more or
less<00:03:00.180> challenging<00:03:00.530> because<00:03:01.530> again<00:03:01.920> you're

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
less challenging because again you're

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.340 
less challenging because again you're
going<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.340> be<00:03:02.460> a<00:03:02.490> sprawling<00:03:02.940> empire<00:03:03.210> but<00:03:04.110> you

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
going to be a sprawling empire but you

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.660 
going to be a sprawling empire but you
generally<00:03:04.620> that's<00:03:04.890> what<00:03:05.100> we're<00:03:05.220> going<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.520> do

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
generally that's what we're going to do

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.240 
generally that's what we're going to do
and<00:03:06.020> sprawling<00:03:07.020> empires<00:03:07.470> are<00:03:07.890> not<00:03:08.070> really

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
and sprawling empires are not really

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.730 
and sprawling empires are not really
liked<00:03:08.460> by<00:03:08.670> AI<00:03:08.910> too<00:03:09.120> much<00:03:09.480> considering<00:03:10.050> you're

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
liked by AI too much considering you're

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.010 
liked by AI too much considering you're
taking<00:03:11.220> land<00:03:11.400> if<00:03:11.610> they<00:03:11.760> want<00:03:12.030> or<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.510> land<00:03:12.870> that

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
taking land if they want or a land that

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.640 
taking land if they want or a land that
they<00:03:13.230> covet<00:03:13.620> as<00:03:13.830> they<00:03:14.040> normally<00:03:14.190> have<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:15.650> so

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
they covet as they normally have it so

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.900 
they covet as they normally have it so
it'll<00:03:16.890> be<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.070> little<00:03:17.160> bit<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.460> challenge<00:03:17.670> in

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
it'll be a little bit of a challenge in

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.430 
it'll be a little bit of a challenge in
terms<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.210> that<00:03:18.390> it's<00:03:18.930> definitely<00:03:19.080> possible

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
terms of that it's definitely possible

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.980 
terms of that it's definitely possible
but<00:03:19.890> again<00:03:20.160> I<00:03:20.370> would<00:03:21.030> really<00:03:21.240> only<00:03:21.420> recommend

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
but again I would really only recommend

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.470 
but again I would really only recommend
a<00:03:22.260> diplomatic<00:03:23.130> or<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.340> cultural<00:03:23.850> victory<00:03:24.030> if

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
a diplomatic or a cultural victory if

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.890 
a diplomatic or a cultural victory if
you<00:03:24.930> have<00:03:25.320> not<00:03:25.830> many<00:03:26.670> forest<00:03:27.060> tiles<00:03:27.480> because

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
you have not many forest tiles because

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.360 
you have not many forest tiles because
we<00:03:28.140> know<00:03:28.200> how<00:03:28.320> many<00:03:28.410> four<00:03:28.710> styles<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.220> don't

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
we know how many four styles you don't

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.530 
we know how many four styles you don't
really<00:03:29.520> want<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.820> expand<00:03:30.150> too<00:03:30.300> quickly

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
really want to expand too quickly

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.120 
really want to expand too quickly
because<00:03:31.110> you're<00:03:31.350> not<00:03:31.500> much<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.800> benefit

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
because you're not much of a benefit

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.610 
because you're not much of a benefit
anymore<00:03:32.570> and<00:03:33.570> that<00:03:33.870> also<00:03:34.020> goes<00:03:34.230> with<00:03:34.290> saying

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
anymore and that also goes with saying

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.640 
anymore and that also goes with saying
culturally<00:03:35.610> would<00:03:36.060> say<00:03:36.180> is<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.360> worst

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
culturally would say is the worst

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.810 
culturally would say is the worst
unfortunately<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.710> Iroquois<00:03:38.190> as<00:03:38.640> they

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
unfortunately the Iroquois as they

because again all these forests tiles

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.380 
because again all these forests tiles
are<00:05:58.290> connected<00:05:58.740> up<00:05:58.860> will<00:05:59.610> become<00:06:00.060> a<00:06:00.090> trade

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
are connected up will become a trade

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.690 
are connected up will become a trade
group<00:06:00.419> which<00:06:01.110> is<00:06:01.290> very<00:06:01.590> very<00:06:02.160> good<00:06:02.400> and<00:06:02.640> you
