00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
much we were on the XEX of the black ops

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.540 
much we were on the XEX of the black ops
2<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.719> pretty<00:00:43.469> much<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:43.770> found<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.250> that

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
2 and pretty much we found out that

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.920 
2 and pretty much we found out that
where<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> zombie<00:00:45.719> map<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.710> called<00:00:47.010> ZM

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
where the zombie map is it's called ZM

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.170 
where the zombie map is it's called ZM
underscore<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.250> zombie<00:00:50.670> map<00:00:50.910> now

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
underscore and then the zombie map now

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.180 
underscore and then the zombie map now
that<00:00:51.390> was<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.840> black<00:00:52.050> ops<00:00:52.260> 2<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.770> world<00:00:53.039> at

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
that was for black ops 2 and world at

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.369 
that was for black ops 2 and world at
war<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.640> pretty<00:00:54.239> much<00:00:54.360> now<00:00:54.780> i'm<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.170> going<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
here you're looking at a screen shot now

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.090 
here you're looking at a screen shot now
this<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> screenshot<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.140> XEX<00:01:04.589> heat<00:01:04.890> we

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
this is a screenshot of the XEX heat we

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.679 
this is a screenshot of the XEX heat we
did<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> search<00:01:05.519> up<00:01:05.700> that's<00:01:05.909> why<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.119> first<00:01:06.450> one

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
did a search up that's why the first one

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.500 
did a search up that's why the first one
is<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.960> highlighted<00:01:07.530> yellow<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.490> now<00:01:09.479> that

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
is like highlighted yellow so now that

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.820 
is like highlighted yellow so now that
you<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.409> you're<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> see<00:01:11.479> zem

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
you see that you're going to see zem

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.590 
you see that you're going to see zem
underscore<00:01:14.330> transit<00:01:15.350> underscore<00:01:16.350> dr<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
underscore transit underscore dr and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.649 
underscore transit underscore dr and
you're<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> see<00:01:19.880> ZM<00:01:20.880> underscore

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
you're going to see ZM underscore

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.590 
you're going to see ZM underscore
transit<00:01:22.530> you're<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.729> see<00:01:23.909> zem

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
transit you're going to see zem

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.499 
transit you're going to see zem
underscore<00:01:25.530> newt<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.159> then<00:01:27.090> you're<00:01:27.299> going<00:01:27.450> to

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
underscore newt and then you're going to

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.670 
underscore newt and then you're going to
see<00:01:27.780> ZM<00:01:28.350> underscore<00:01:29.009> highrise<00:01:30.290> now<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.350> guys

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
see ZM underscore highrise now you guys

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.190 
see ZM underscore highrise now you guys
were<00:01:31.890> probably<00:01:32.130> thinking<00:01:32.600> ok<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.960> know

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
were probably thinking ok so I know

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.100 
were probably thinking ok so I know
transit<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:34.979> newt<00:01:35.850> sounds<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.780> lot<00:01:36.930> like

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
transit and newt sounds a lot like

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.410 
transit and newt sounds a lot like
Newtown<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.549> could<00:01:38.700> get<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.240> now<00:01:39.360> we

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
Newtown so we could get that but now we

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.090 
Newtown so we could get that but now we
have<00:01:39.540> transit<00:01:40.320> underscores<00:01:41.310> dr<00:01:42.119> and

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
have transit underscores dr and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.940 
have transit underscores dr and
high-rise<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.509> what<00:01:45.810> do<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:45.990> guys<00:01:46.140> think<00:01:46.200> now

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
high-rise so what do you guys think now

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.749 
high-rise so what do you guys think now
I<00:01:47.220> think<00:01:47.840> my<00:01:48.840> personal<00:01:49.380> opinion<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.920> going<00:01:50.700> to

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
I think my personal opinion is going to

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.109 
I think my personal opinion is going to
be<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.270> transit<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.799> actually<00:01:53.640> going<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.939> be

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
be that transit is actually going to be

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.359 
be that transit is actually going to be
like<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.689> transit<00:01:55.200> underscore<00:01:55.680> dr<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.189> one

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
like the transit underscore dr that one

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.850 
like the transit underscore dr that one
it's<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> part<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.659> transit<00:01:58.380> you're<00:01:58.740> going

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
it's like a part to transit you're going

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.620 
it's like a part to transit you're going
to<00:01:58.950> go<00:01:59.100> somewhere<00:01:59.490> else<00:01:59.549> that's<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.509> my

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
to go somewhere else that's just my
