definitely<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.160> cost<00:02:29.400> maybe<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.880> can<00:02:30.030> get<00:02:30.180> that

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
definitely a cost maybe you can get that

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.000 
definitely a cost maybe you can get that
free<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.870> can<00:02:30.930> park<00:02:31.290> somewhere<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.920> you

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
free and you can park somewhere and you

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.580 
free and you can park somewhere and you
can<00:02:32.190> do<00:02:32.310> some<00:02:32.780> caretaker<00:02:33.780> work<00:02:34.080> or<00:02:34.290> something

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
can do some caretaker work or something

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.710 
can do some caretaker work or something
like<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.890> whose<00:02:35.130> security<00:02:35.670> work<00:02:35.820> but<00:02:36.600> you

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
like that whose security work but you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.240 
like that whose security work but you
definitely<00:02:37.230> need<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.410> consider<00:02:37.590> what<00:02:38.220> that

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
definitely need to consider what that

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.840 
definitely need to consider what that
will<00:02:38.760> cost<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.420> or<00:02:40.459> alternatively<00:02:41.459> you're

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
will cost you or alternatively you're

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.910 
will cost you or alternatively you're
going<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.269> boondock<00:02:42.780> now<00:02:43.440> if<00:02:43.590> you're<00:02:43.709> going<00:02:43.830> to

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
going to boondock now if you're going to

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.880 
going to boondock now if you're going to
boondock<00:02:44.400> all<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.790> time<00:02:45.000> that's<00:02:45.890> wonderful

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
boondock all the time that's wonderful

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.650 
boondock all the time that's wonderful
but<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.190> will<00:02:47.280> cost<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:47.730> more<00:02:48.000> for<00:02:48.239> propane

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
but it will cost you more for propane

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.449 
but it will cost you more for propane
for<00:02:48.840> heating<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.830> will<00:02:49.950> definitely<00:02:50.100> cost

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
for heating and it will definitely cost

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.670 
for heating and it will definitely cost
you<00:02:50.610> more<00:02:50.790> for<00:02:50.970> gasoline<00:02:51.180> right<00:02:52.140> now<00:02:52.350> I'm<00:02:52.530> not

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
you more for gasoline right now I'm not

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.740 
you more for gasoline right now I'm not
driving<00:02:53.070> around<00:02:53.220> much<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:53.760> my<00:02:53.940> fuel<00:02:54.239> costs<00:02:54.690> are

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
driving around much so my fuel costs are

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.860 
driving around much so my fuel costs are
very<00:02:55.440> negligible<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.310> my<00:02:57.030> propane<00:02:57.450> costs<00:02:57.810> are

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
very negligible and my propane costs are

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.690 
very negligible and my propane costs are
very<00:02:58.049> negligible<00:02:58.530> because<00:02:58.739> I<00:02:59.010> heat<00:02:59.340> with

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
very negligible because I heat with

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.340 
very negligible because I heat with
electricity<00:03:00.209> because<00:03:00.600> I'm<00:03:00.780> plugged<00:03:01.170> into

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
electricity because I'm plugged into

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.759 
electricity because I'm plugged into
30-amp<00:03:02.480> going<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:04.080> terms<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.620> your

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
30-amp going on in terms of your

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.289 
30-amp going on in terms of your
expenses<00:03:05.310> you're<00:03:05.489> also<00:03:05.700> going<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.030> have<00:03:06.180> to

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
expenses you're also going to have to

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.080 
expenses you're also going to have to
consider<00:03:06.660> maintenance<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.830> a<00:03:08.400> contingency

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
consider maintenance and a contingency

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.470 
consider maintenance and a contingency
fund<00:03:09.480> if<00:03:10.170> something<00:03:10.830> should<00:03:11.040> go<00:03:11.100> wrong<00:03:11.250> now<00:03:12.180> if

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
fund if something should go wrong now if

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.630 
fund if something should go wrong now if
you<00:03:12.690> have<00:03:12.840> an<00:03:12.959> older<00:03:13.350> RV<00:03:13.769> I<00:03:13.980> definitely

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
you have an older RV I definitely

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.150 
you have an older RV I definitely
suggest<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:15.269> larger<00:03:15.989> contingency<00:03:16.890> fund

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
suggest a larger contingency fund

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.580 
suggest a larger contingency fund
because<00:03:17.610> things<00:03:18.480> are<00:03:18.660> going<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.870> go<00:03:18.959> wrong<00:03:19.230> at

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
because things are going to go wrong at

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.030 
because things are going to go wrong at
a<00:03:19.680> larger<00:03:20.280> expense<00:03:20.810> ratio<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.500> expect

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
a larger expense ratio that you expect

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.530 
a larger expense ratio that you expect
than<00:03:23.700> if<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:23.940> have<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.090> newer<00:03:24.360> RV<00:03:24.840> like<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.350> do

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
than if you have a newer RV like I do

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.990 
than if you have a newer RV like I do
also<00:03:27.739> medical<00:03:29.120> insurance

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
also medical insurance

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.360 
also medical insurance
and<00:03:31.090> dental<00:03:31.900> insurance<00:03:32.100> prescription<00:03:33.100> plans

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
and dental insurance prescription plans

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.740 
and dental insurance prescription plans
things<00:03:33.730> like<00:03:33.850> that<00:03:34.030> you're<00:03:34.420> going<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.570> have

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
things like that you're going to have

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.120

that cost no matter where you're living

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.330 
that cost no matter where you're living
but<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.300> need<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.600> factor<00:03:37.750> that<00:03:38.080> in<00:03:38.260> now<00:03:39.190> if

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
but you need to factor that in now if

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.730 
but you need to factor that in now if
you're<00:03:39.490> moving<00:03:39.640> from<00:03:40.000> brick<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.690> sticks<00:03:41.200> like
