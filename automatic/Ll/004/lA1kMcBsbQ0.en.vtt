00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:09.269
 Hello everyone, and our most bloomed 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.870
 The first bush of peonies and the video today will be 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.740
 how to do it yourself 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.869
 Here is a stand under the bush so that 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.500
 time of rain and while they are blowing 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.490
 winds 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.630
 the bush did not fall apart and the flowers did not break 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.630
 flower stalks did not break 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.340
 [music] 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.530
 [music] 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.579
 let's see how to do this 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.519
 simple but at the same time very necessary and 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.890
 device for making this 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.430
 designs we need nothing at all 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.570
 Here is such a pipe metal-plastic 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.140
 plumbing which can be found in 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:14.020
 any hardware store like that 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:17.430
 trim from the wall paneling screwdriver further us 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.899
 you will need an ordinary garden hose 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.720
 about these are the pieces we need 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:26.319
 will be for making our designs 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.149
 but see that the hose diameter is 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.850
 larger than pipe diameter 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.600
 so we can do like this 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.850
 tightly put it on the pipe and connect 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.850
 then you will see everything and screw 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:02:18.930
 [music] 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.590
 and our ring is ready at an angle of 120 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.610
 degrees 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.099
 divided turned out here 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.940
 mersedesovsky wheel three points most 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:44.000
 steady support 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:48.349
 And from three points on 2 and 3 points further 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.970
 that white legs 400 millimeters 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:57.410
 cut the tubing further 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.130
 chopped up blades from the remaining lining 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.060
 farther 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.060
 shut up 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:13.189
 [music] 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:19.459
 further and cut in 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:22.489
 and twist that is, we beat the wood 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.530
 in order to screw there lame 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.459
 drive a screw that googol and 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.459
 steady 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.350
 [music] 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.790
 and now we will wear the bottom ring 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.419
 [music] 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:04.680
 Here the screw fastens simply in 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:11.239
 pipe to metal to aluminum wood 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:13.800
 I put here turned out a peony stand 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.220
 so now we will now wear 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.340
 this stand but we do it in order 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.470
 so that when our rainy season starts and 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.090
 they fall after the rain and break for your 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.050
 when they bloom and they generally get 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.290
 very heavy therefore we do supports 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:39.380
 so that the hust does not fall apart with health 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:42.380
 make it in a bunch 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.380
 for example 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:05:03.270
 two neatly dressed so as not to 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:05:06.779
 damage our buds about we remove 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.210
 like so about all and our peonies 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:12.360
 turned out like in a vase and now no wind 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.370
 no rain he's not scary even when they 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.710
 bloom will become heavy they are not 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.270
 fall and not fall apart thanks for 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:23.150
 attention and see you again at my 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.150
 channel don't forget to subscribe bye
