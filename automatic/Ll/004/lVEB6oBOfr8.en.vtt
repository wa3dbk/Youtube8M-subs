the<00:00:45.210> same<00:00:45.239> thing<00:00:45.950> recognizing<00:00:46.950> patterns<00:00:47.219> and

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
the same thing recognizing patterns and

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.779 
the same thing recognizing patterns and
of<00:00:48.000> course<00:00:48.270> making<00:00:49.110> your<00:00:49.379> fingers<00:00:49.800> move<00:00:50.489> in

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
of course making your fingers move in

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.020 
of course making your fingers move in
those<00:00:51.180> patterns<00:00:51.949> as<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:54.420> may<00:00:54.660> know<00:00:56.030> by

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
those patterns as you may know by

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.209 
those patterns as you may know by
raising<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.690> lowering<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:58.050> fingers<00:00:58.500> you

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
raising and lowering your fingers you

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.240 
raising and lowering your fingers you
will<00:00:59.570> change<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.840> pitch<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.770> pitch<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
will change the pitch and the pitch is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.370 
will change the pitch and the pitch is
determined<00:01:02.820> by<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:04.650> length<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:06.750> air

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
determined by the length of the air

determined by the length of the air
column<00:01:08.010> between<00:01:08.250> here's<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.119> open<00:01:09.450> hole

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659

here's<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.500> closed<00:01:10.770> hole<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.760> is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
here's the closed hole so this is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.149 
here's the closed hole so this is

actually the hole that is making the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.080 
actually the hole that is making the
sound<00:01:14.460> you'll<00:01:15.180> also<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.799> if<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.009> play<00:01:17.280> all<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
sound you'll also see if I play all the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.060 
sound you'll also see if I play all the
all<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.780> fingers<00:01:19.020> down<00:01:19.320> I'll<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> lowest

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
all my fingers down I'll get the lowest

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.679 
all my fingers down I'll get the lowest
note<00:01:22.100> if<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.250> play<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> different<00:01:23.729> flute<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
note if I play a different flute in a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.550 
note if I play a different flute in a
different<00:01:25.110> key<00:01:26.630> I'll<00:01:27.630> put<00:01:27.900> all<00:01:28.020> my<00:01:28.049> fingers

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560

different key I'll put all my fingers
down<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.040> get<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> different<00:01:30.210> note<00:01:33.320> now<00:01:34.759> I'll

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
down and get a different note now I'll

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.460 
down and get a different note now I'll
go<00:01:36.240> back<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.780> flute<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:39.720> way<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.020> raise

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
go back to this flute the way you raise

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.200 
go back to this flute the way you raise
and<00:01:40.740> lower<00:01:40.770> your<00:01:41.100> fingers<00:01:41.460> makes<00:01:41.729> quite<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> lot

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
and lower your fingers makes quite a lot

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.380 
and lower your fingers makes quite a lot
of<00:01:42.240> difference<00:01:42.740> I'll<00:01:43.740> show<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.670> simple

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
of difference I'll show you a simple

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.300 
of difference I'll show you a simple
tune<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.960> how<00:01:46.079> about<00:01:46.290> if<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.530> do<00:01:46.799> mary<00:01:47.070> had<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
tune and how about if we do mary had a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:59.330 
tune and how about if we do mary had a
little<00:01:47.520> lamb

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.599 

Oh

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.309 

when<00:02:06.609> there<00:02:06.789> are<00:02:06.880> repeated<00:02:07.329> notes<00:02:07.539> there's

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
when there are repeated notes there's

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.970 
when there are repeated notes there's
always<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.649> question<00:02:09.099> about<00:02:09.220> what<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.209> do

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
always a question about what to do

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.940 
always a question about what to do
traditional<00:02:12.030> classic<00:02:13.030> flute<00:02:13.750> playing<00:02:14.440> would

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
traditional classic flute playing would

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:23.339 
traditional classic flute playing would
require<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.670> go<00:02:15.819> tah<00:02:16.420> tah<00:02:16.900> tah<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.780> the

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
require that you go tah tah tah in the

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.309 
require that you go tah tah tah in the
irish<00:02:23.860> style<00:02:24.129> we<00:02:24.459> shy<00:02:25.060> away<00:02:25.090> from<00:02:25.420> using<00:02:25.870> our

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
irish style we shy away from using our

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.140 
irish style we shy away from using our
tongue<00:02:27.220> very<00:02:27.970> much<00:02:28.239> often<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.940> make<00:02:31.120> a

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
tongue very much often you to make a

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.479 
tongue very much often you to make a
division<00:02:31.720> between<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.200> notes<00:02:32.349> you<00:02:32.530> would<00:02:32.739> use

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
division between the notes you would use

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.339 
division between the notes you would use
a<00:02:33.519> car<00:02:34.000> sound<00:02:34.450> in<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:34.660> back<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:35.019> your<00:02:35.170> throat

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
a car sound in the back of your throat

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.640 
a car sound in the back of your throat
which<00:02:35.680> actually<00:02:36.459> makes<00:02:36.940> for<00:02:37.269> a<00:02:37.510> bigger<00:02:38.260> sound

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
which actually makes for a bigger sound

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:52.460 
which actually makes for a bigger sound
so<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:39.310> can<00:02:39.459> play<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:51.730> can<00:02:51.760> see<00:02:52.060> I'm<00:02:52.180> going

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
so we can play you can see I'm going

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.089 
so we can play you can see I'm going
Kaka<00:02:53.760> perhaps<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:54.910> can<00:02:55.060> see<00:02:55.269> that<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:56.379> that<00:02:56.799> is

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
Kaka perhaps you can see that so that is

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.970 
Kaka perhaps you can see that so that is
the<00:02:58.170> basics<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.349> playing<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.250> simple<00:03:00.760> tune
