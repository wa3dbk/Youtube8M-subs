my issue with this play when when

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.129 
my issue with this play when when
g---men<00:03:26.639> bets<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.209> river<00:03:27.389> after<00:03:27.660> betting<00:03:28.049> the

g---men bets the river after betting the
flop<00:03:28.349> inviting<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.829> turn<00:03:29.069> doesn't<00:03:29.790> he<00:03:29.940> almost

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
flop inviting the turn doesn't he almost

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.289 
flop inviting the turn doesn't he almost
always<00:03:30.660> have<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.319> two<00:03:31.530> pair<00:03:31.769> type<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.130> hand<00:03:32.310> he

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
always have a two pair type of hand he

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.030 
always have a two pair type of hand he
could<00:03:33.510> at<00:03:33.630> least<00:03:33.840> queen<00:03:34.139> or<00:03:34.290> ace<00:03:34.380> ten<00:03:34.620> I<00:03:34.650> think

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
could at least queen or ace ten I think

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.530 
could at least queen or ace ten I think
he<00:03:35.099> might<00:03:35.250> even<00:03:35.400> check<00:03:35.609> back<00:03:35.819> east<00:03:36.060> ten<00:03:36.269> at<00:03:36.419> the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
he might even check back east ten at the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.930 
he might even check back east ten at the
end<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:37.349> like<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:37.980> said<00:03:38.459> before<00:03:38.639> about

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
end so like you just said before about

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.940 
end so like you just said before about
two<00:03:39.450> minutes<00:03:39.569> ago<00:03:39.870> is<00:03:40.079> gman<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.590> type<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.859> guy

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
two minutes ago is gman the type of guy

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.610 
two minutes ago is gman the type of guy
that<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.190> want<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.430> Bluff<00:03:41.639> if<00:03:42.269> he<00:03:42.840> basically

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
that you want to Bluff if he basically

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.979 
that you want to Bluff if he basically
the<00:03:43.980> bottom<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.549> his<00:03:44.760> river<00:03:45.359> betting<00:03:45.630> Rangers

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
the bottom of his river betting Rangers

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.080 
the bottom of his river betting Rangers
ace<00:03:46.200> Queen<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:47.250> have<00:03:47.370> eight<00:03:47.489> Queens<00:03:47.819> so

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
ace Queen and you have eight Queens so

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.610 
ace Queen and you have eight Queens so
the<00:03:48.209> chances<00:03:48.599> that<00:03:48.630> he<00:03:48.780> has<00:03:48.900> ace<00:03:49.079> Queen<00:03:49.349> are

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
the chances that he has ace Queen are

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.610 
the chances that he has ace Queen are
less<00:03:50.130> likely<00:03:50.430> right<00:03:50.819> yeah<00:03:51.000> exactly

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
less likely right yeah exactly

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.650 
less likely right yeah exactly
no<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:52.650> don't<00:03:53.099> think<00:03:53.129> g-man's<00:03:53.910> really<00:03:54.329> Foley

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660

like is he folding ace king you know I

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.759 
like is he folding ace king you know I
mean<00:03:56.819> it's<00:03:56.940> kind<00:03:57.690> of<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.840> same<00:03:58.019> type<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.530> hand

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
mean it's kind of the same type of hand

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.300 
mean it's kind of the same type of hand
yeah<00:03:59.549> he's<00:03:59.819> not<00:03:59.940> fully<00:04:00.209> set

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.000 

he<00:04:04.310> doesn't<00:04:04.580> have<00:04:04.670> king-queen<00:04:05.180> ever<00:04:05.600> could<00:04:06.590> I

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
he doesn't have king-queen ever could I

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.370 
he doesn't have king-queen ever could I
think<00:04:07.610> he<00:04:07.730> was<00:04:07.820> checked<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.450> right<00:04:09.020> king

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
think he was checked the right king

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.410 
think he was checked the right king
queen<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:09.680> just<00:04:09.890> think<00:04:10.010> that<00:04:10.070> he's<00:04:10.700> very<00:04:10.790> strong

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
queen I just think that he's very strong

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.940 
queen I just think that he's very strong
when<00:04:11.600> he<00:04:11.660> bets<00:04:11.930> them<00:04:12.170> when<00:04:12.350> he<00:04:12.500> when<00:04:12.710> he<00:04:12.770> takes

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
when he bets them when he when he takes

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.860 
when he bets them when he when he takes
a<00:04:13.040> line<00:04:13.220> of<00:04:13.370> betting<00:04:13.670> flop<00:04:13.910> turn<00:04:14.240> and<00:04:14.420> River<00:04:14.570> I

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
a line of betting flop turn and River I

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.900 
a line of betting flop turn and River I
think<00:04:15.620> he's<00:04:15.740> very<00:04:15.830> strong<00:04:16.310> so<00:04:16.610> I<00:04:16.640> don't<00:04:16.820> know

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
think he's very strong so I don't know

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.070 
think he's very strong so I don't know
if<00:04:17.000> you're<00:04:17.090> trying<00:04:17.210> to<00:04:17.360> get<00:04:17.510> him<00:04:17.630> off<00:04:17.780> of<00:04:17.810> him

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
if you're trying to get him off of him

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.020 
if you're trying to get him off of him
very<00:04:18.260> strong<00:04:18.500> hands<00:04:18.770> this<00:04:18.920> is<00:04:18.980> I<00:04:19.280> probably<00:04:19.820> the

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
very strong hands this is I probably the

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.000 
very strong hands this is I probably the
bottom<00:04:20.570> of<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.840> valley<00:04:21.140> range<00:04:21.470> that<00:04:21.830> he's

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
bottom of the valley range that he's

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.290 
bottom of the valley range that he's
fooling<00:04:23.890> any<00:04:24.890> hand<00:04:25.250> that<00:04:25.310> he<00:04:25.550> has<00:04:25.730> that's<00:04:25.970> one

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
fooling any hand that he has that's one

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.790 
fooling any hand that he has that's one

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390

so it's 695 is that right so the pots
two<00:05:15.520> two<00:05:16.060> and<00:05:16.180> a<00:05:16.270> half<00:05:16.479> and<00:05:16.780> it's<00:05:16.870> I<00:05:18.240> mean<00:05:19.240> the

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
two two and a half and it's I mean the

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.429 
two two and a half and it's I mean the
only<00:05:19.449> thing<00:05:19.629> that<00:05:19.810> you<00:05:19.990> would<00:05:20.139> think<00:05:20.259> of

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:20.439 
only thing that you would think of

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.469 
only thing that you would think of
though<00:05:20.590> -<00:05:20.650> if<00:05:20.889> I'm<00:05:21.009> in<00:05:21.069> g-man<00:05:21.340> spot<00:05:21.610> is<00:05:21.729> like<00:05:21.879> if

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
though - if I'm in g-man spot is like if

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.809 
though - if I'm in g-man spot is like if
the<00:05:22.659> guy<00:05:22.750> actually<00:05:22.930> had<00:05:23.259> a<00:05:23.289> hand<00:05:23.620> it's<00:05:24.400> a<00:05:24.639> lot

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
the guy actually had a hand it's a lot

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:26.459 
the guy actually had a hand it's a lot
more<00:05:25.060> actually<00:05:25.210> that<00:05:25.659> looks<00:05:25.840> like<00:05:25.900> a<00:05:25.990> thousand

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:26.469 
more actually that looks like a thousand

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:28.409 
more actually that looks like a thousand
yeah<00:05:26.830> but<00:05:27.009> how<00:05:27.250> much<00:05:27.370> is<00:05:27.550> G<00:05:27.789> man<00:05:27.969> how<00:05:28.150> left

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
yeah but how much is G man how left

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:29.730 
yeah but how much is G man how left
though<00:05:28.599> I<00:05:28.659> think<00:05:28.870> is<00:05:28.960> what<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.199> issue<00:05:29.560> is

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
though I think is what the issue is

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.980 
though I think is what the issue is
right<00:05:30.129> keep<00:05:30.699> zoom<00:05:31.270> in<00:05:31.389> front<00:05:31.599> of<00:05:31.689> it

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
right keep zoom in front of it

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.369 
right keep zoom in front of it
no<00:05:32.439> jumper<00:05:33.069> always<00:05:33.370> more<00:05:33.669> yeah<00:05:34.110> yeah<00:05:35.110> so<00:05:35.289> it's

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:35.379 
no jumper always more yeah yeah so it's

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:37.920 
no jumper always more yeah yeah so it's
not<00:05:35.500> just<00:05:35.560> 695<00:05:36.460> is<00:05:37.150> it<00:05:37.330> it's<00:05:37.539> the<00:05:37.659> over<00:05:37.900> a

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
not just 695 is it it's the over a

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.830 
not just 695 is it it's the over a
thousand<00:05:38.379> to<00:05:38.469> call<00:05:42.150> the<00:05:43.150> issue<00:05:43.270> is<00:05:43.479> is<00:05:43.659> is<00:05:43.780> a

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
thousand to call the issue is is is a
