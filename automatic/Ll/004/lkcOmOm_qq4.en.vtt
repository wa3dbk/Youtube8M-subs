00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hi everyone welcome in my words 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.410
 this is my second video or note 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.950
 today i want to compare s4 mini white 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.639
 with the galaxy s2 black these two 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.620
 smartphone 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.929
 let's say no hardware features 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.830
 very similar however it has slightly to 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:24.330
 advantage of the galaxy s 4 mini we start 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.900
 from let's say from the features one 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:35.070
 qhd screen with a resolution of 256 pp 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:40.020
 to the super amoled both dual core 1.7 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.899
 cdti clock here 1.2 resolution approximately 216 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.610
 ppp ppi 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.610
 let's see the software version 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:01:06.320
 here 4.2.2 this focus and 4.1.1 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:20.300
 let's talk about the rom 1.5 gb gigabyte vs 4 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:26.020
 mini 1 on galaxy s2 from a very good 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.020
 view with them 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:53.939
 we take to delete all of kohat 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:55.959
 sorry 826 total other differences 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.729
 in the release 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:01.659
 this is the classic like borges unlocking 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:06.280
 let's say old samsung dragging e 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:15.280
 so while this is what is point 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:17.799
 in briar galaxy s 4 normal note 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.780
 like the ripple effect ie that 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.959
 which already derives from the eternal to the 3 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.060
 or is with the light effect we appeal 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:30.599
 point of view of cameras both from 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.599
 8 megapixels with videos shot at 1080p 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:40.359
 galaxy s 4 let's say drift takes note 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.120
 the functions of the galaxy s with a new one 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:49.540
 interface derived from the new one 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:52.870
 civic merci Uruguay 2 precisely this 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.299
 do with the flash fast enough 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.280
 instead here he knows how to self 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:03.639
 full two stephen s 3 ie though ie 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:08.950
 the one without flash but still a lot 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:11.849
 fast just with flash parity maybe 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.139
 its faster being web ok 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:19.889
 let's talk about known internal memory difference 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:22.690
 8 gigabytes of which about c5 available 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:28.799
 available here 16 gigs of which 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.799
 available are eleven and a half 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.980
 we also look at the screen in the 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.620
 much more we say more defined on 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.060
 on four-axles mini and let's try with 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:46.159
 just a game as far as I want 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.159
 we also think of my multimedia 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.440
 leave first 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.900
 much faster we are going to analyze 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.600
 one of the latest data the reader 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.330
 musical though I don't know if they are there 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:21.380
 songs because it's not mine 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:21.380
 sorry about the excellent, here they work 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:31.070
 we hear this samsung function 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.070
 s4 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:05:02.490
 let's see if certain here is the quality 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:04.850
 volume more or less identical to the last side 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.440
 the flash of the internet browser 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.440
 we load in both the verge 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.340
 my uncle 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:44.060
 this under the 3g network and it works 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.920
 so they didn't load me 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:05.360
 here he loaded me back but 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.360
 anyway ok work east load 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.840
 morning 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:24.230
 it's too high it doesn't deserve ok 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:39.599
 write a page and plan which o 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:43.050
 galaxy s 4g text adaptation 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.050
 let's get s2 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:57.000
 ourselves and the same programs also 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:00.390
 if the navigation clearly better ok 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 nice and good comparison I hope this 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:08.240
 video you liked if you put a 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.240
 like the crime channel a greeting from alex
