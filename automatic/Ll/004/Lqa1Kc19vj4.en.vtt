00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.509
 starting to mount horizontal 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.940
 us shelves were mounting only on 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.290
 produce right at the place 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.400
 many put it easier to be right 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.750
 mark and place guides 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.539
 when the vertical stand is not yet 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.960
 established but due to the fact that we 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.920
 set the closet and the moon 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.359
 a small difference is not very convenient 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.119
 postpone then install 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.859
 vertical racks which then can 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.570
 prove to be one slightly higher another lower 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.980
 total shelf 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.110
 horizontal will be i'm not 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.020
 strictly horizontally and at an angle therefore 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.489
 the markup was an action point right at the place 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.309
 that is, we have already installed vertical 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.840
 directing now we set our 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.570
 the laser is needed this way on us 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.719
 automated article to 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.530
 horizontal beam showed us the place 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.600
 future attachment guide as you can see 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.250
 everything is very clear 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.239
 horizontal line marked the place 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.460
 future mounts 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.170
 the only number is planning more accurately 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.409
 same vertical stand with the same 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.860
 shelves so I stuck on the end 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.110
 masking tape which will mark 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.689
 position to go from the next 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.620
 column 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.520
 vertical 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.500
 return the horizontal beam here personally 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.380
 shows the next step it needs 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.150
 install horizontal roller 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.000
 guides orient myself put the red 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:41.310
 we take the line manager for the boxes 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.070
 we apply it strictly on red with 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.060
 using ordinary sewed straight on red 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.440
 lines first with a pencil and then with an awl 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.910
 make two holes 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.690
 Now with the usual terms I 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.390
 fasten 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:02.570
 and so heading is established 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.150
 strictly gender changes into place and 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.410
 install the second 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.420
 if you when installing guides 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.310
 miss not only joyous mark 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.170
 portrait above or below do not worry 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.190
 the red line will always show the place where 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.190
 can make holes 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.780
 2 guides set also by 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:37.100
 laser beam 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:43.700
 as the first vodka umbrella flax pound 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:45.379
 becomes a place goes free on our 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.900
 Yes , the manager is correctly installed 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:54.489
 here 3 circles horizontally judging by 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:59.690
 the laser beam and so on to put in more 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:03.580
 you corner here is the result we 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.580
 get and here you are doing everything right 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:13.189
 not at all like vision and 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.189
 everyone walks easily 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:28.370
 so make using the device cube 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.370
 will mount the next columns
