00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
unacceptable but here's the thing Canada

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.839

00:05:58.059 --> 00:05:58.069 
but probably some of the best in the

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.469 
but probably some of the best in the
world<00:05:58.279> and<00:05:59.210> that's<00:05:59.300> actually<00:05:59.569> terrifying<00:06:01.479> you

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
world and that's actually terrifying you

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.709 
world and that's actually terrifying you
know<00:06:02.949> we<00:06:03.949> we<00:06:04.219> are<00:06:04.340> blessed<00:06:04.669> to<00:06:05.090> be<00:06:05.180> in<00:06:05.300> Ontario

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:05.719

and<00:06:05.990> in<00:06:06.080> Canada<00:06:08.050> not<00:06:09.050> everyone<00:06:10.569> has<00:06:11.569> the<00:06:11.949> lets

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:12.949 
and in Canada not everyone has the lets

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.219 
and in Canada not everyone has the lets
go<00:06:13.099> with<00:06:13.520> facilities<00:06:14.240> or<00:06:14.419> funding<00:06:14.750> available

go with facilities or funding available

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.040 
go with facilities or funding available
to<00:06:15.289> them<00:06:16.210> but<00:06:17.210> just<00:06:17.419> because<00:06:17.659> of<00:06:17.750> that<00:06:17.870> doesn't

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
to them but just because of that doesn't

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.619 
to them but just because of that doesn't
mean<00:06:18.259> we<00:06:18.409> shouldn't<00:06:18.620> strive<00:06:18.979> for<00:06:19.310> better<00:06:20.029> here

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:20.629 
mean we shouldn't strive for better here
