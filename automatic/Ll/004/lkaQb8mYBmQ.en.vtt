00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.640 

I<00:00:13.110> think<00:00:14.110> my<00:00:14.260> work<00:00:14.559> is<00:00:14.940> needed<00:00:15.940> with<00:00:16.650> how

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
I think my work is needed with how

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.609 
I think my work is needed with how
people<00:00:17.680> see<00:00:18.250> danger<00:00:18.640> how<00:00:19.300> people<00:00:19.720> see<00:00:19.960> at<00:00:20.260> risk

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
people see danger how people see at risk

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.780 
people see danger how people see at risk
oh<00:00:20.890> how<00:00:21.460> different<00:00:23.400> perspectives<00:00:24.400> we<00:00:24.550> have

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
oh how different perspectives we have

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.060 
oh how different perspectives we have
and<00:00:25.240> risk<00:00:26.110> and<00:00:26.439> danger<00:00:26.830> so<00:00:27.340> I<00:00:28.110> think<00:00:29.110> that's

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
and risk and danger so I think that's

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.130 
and risk and danger so I think that's
those<00:00:30.279> conversations<00:00:30.970> change<00:00:31.300> on<00:00:31.930> the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
those conversations change on the

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.889 
those conversations change on the
cultures<00:00:32.680> with<00:00:33.040> age<00:00:33.280> and<00:00:33.700> with<00:00:34.239> I<00:00:34.510> don't<00:00:34.809> know

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
cultures with age and with I don't know

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.350 
cultures with age and with I don't know
the<00:00:35.620> way<00:00:35.770> you<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:37.390> what<00:00:37.660> you<00:00:37.840> were<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.969> I<00:00:40.300> think

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
the way you do what you were so I think

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.410 
the way you do what you were so I think
my<00:00:40.600> work<00:00:40.780> started<00:00:41.320> in<00:00:41.469> a<00:00:41.730> border<00:00:42.730> between

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
my work started in a border between

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.549 
my work started in a border between
United<00:00:43.899> States<00:00:44.079> and<00:00:44.260> Mexico<00:00:44.469> and<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:47.140> every

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
United States and Mexico and so every

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:48.779 
United States and Mexico and so every

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
time I had to cross the border to go to

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.650 
time I had to cross the border to go to
school<00:00:49.120> so<00:00:50.429> when<00:00:51.429> I<00:00:51.460> was<00:00:51.670> in<00:00:51.820> Mexico<00:00:52.030> I<00:00:52.359> was

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
that I can see that sometimes it's just

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.530 
that I can see that sometimes it's just
like<00:01:34.900> a<00:01:34.930> game<00:01:35.560> but<00:01:35.950> it's<00:01:36.430> just<00:01:36.640> like<00:01:36.880> i'm<00:01:37.090> using

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
like a game but it's just like i'm using

you know heavy objects yes the Costas
connotations<00:01:42.760> and<00:01:43.320> used<00:01:44.320> them<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.560> call<00:01:44.890> each

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
connotations and used them to call each

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.520

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
other so I great these constructions

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.140 
other so I great these constructions
actually<00:01:48.010> theatre<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.670> I'm<00:01:48.880> totally<00:01:51.150> amazed

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
actually theatre and I'm totally amazed

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.100 
actually theatre and I'm totally amazed
and<00:01:52.830> influenced<00:01:53.830> by<00:01:54.010> construction<00:01:54.720> sites<00:01:55.720> and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
and influenced by construction sites and

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.950 
and influenced by construction sites and
construction<00:01:56.620> workers<00:01:57.690> Americans<00:01:58.690> and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
construction workers Americans and

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.110 
construction workers Americans and
Mexicans<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.710> have<00:01:59.920> different<00:02:00.460> ways<00:02:00.970> of

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
Mexicans I have different ways of

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.100 
Mexicans I have different ways of
working<00:02:01.420> but<00:02:02.410> I<00:02:03.220> think<00:02:03.880> both<00:02:04.720> of<00:02:04.750> them<00:02:04.930> are

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
working but I think both of them are

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.370 
working but I think both of them are
amazing<00:02:05.920> they<00:02:06.100> know<00:02:06.370> physics<00:02:07.270> they<00:02:07.660> know<00:02:07.870> how

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
amazing they know physics they know how

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.410 
amazing they know physics they know how
to<00:02:08.710> deal<00:02:09.280> with<00:02:09.310> materials<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.000> controversial

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
to deal with materials and controversial

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.260 
to deal with materials and controversial
problems<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:11.890> my<00:02:12.040> pieces<00:02:12.280> are<00:02:12.490> about<00:02:12.730> that<00:02:13.000> I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
problems so my pieces are about that I

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.480 
problems so my pieces are about that I
think<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.930> just<00:02:14.380> like<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:14.950> piece<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.280> didn't

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
think I just like this piece I didn't

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.830 
think I just like this piece I didn't
know<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.580> was<00:02:15.790> going<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.090> do<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.330> basement

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
know I was going to do this basement

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.420 
know I was going to do this basement
like<00:02:17.020> right<00:02:17.500> here<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.010> start<00:02:18.250> gathering

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
like right here and I start gathering

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.030 
like right here and I start gathering
gathering<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> materials<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.990> then<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.830> had

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
gathering the materials and then I had

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.910 
gathering the materials and then I had
when<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:21.880> face<00:02:22.240> I<00:02:22.570> face<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.900> problem<00:02:23.230> have<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.680> say

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
when I face I face a problem have to say

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.820 
when I face I face a problem have to say
the<00:02:24.160> solid<00:02:24.940> well<00:02:25.210> that's<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.750> tricky<00:02:26.320> part<00:02:26.620> I

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
the solid well that's the tricky part I

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.750 
the solid well that's the tricky part I
need<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.160> find<00:02:27.370> other<00:02:27.940> objects<00:02:28.720> like<00:02:28.990> an<00:02:29.200> work

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
need to find other objects like an work

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:45.750 
need to find other objects like an work
so<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.270> problem

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.600 

I<00:02:45.819> was<00:02:46.510> really<00:02:46.689> surprised<00:02:47.170> when<00:02:47.439> I<00:02:47.560> heard<00:02:47.890> that

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
I was really surprised when I heard that

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.160 
I was really surprised when I heard that
the<00:02:48.879> bridge<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.360> I'd<00:02:49.480> really<00:02:49.810> like<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:49.989> look

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
the bridge and I'd really like to look

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.440 
the bridge and I'd really like to look
at<00:02:50.349> the<00:02:50.500> pictures<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:51.129> worst<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:52.269> was

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
at the pictures of the worst and it was

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.360 
at the pictures of the worst and it was
terrible<00:02:52.930> but<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.620> was<00:02:53.739> pretty<00:02:53.950> interesting

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
terrible but it was pretty interesting

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.759 
terrible but it was pretty interesting
to<00:02:54.700> see<00:02:54.879> that<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.870> was<00:02:55.989> just<00:02:56.140> three<00:02:56.650> blocks

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
to see that it was just three blocks

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.789 
to see that it was just three blocks
away<00:02:57.040> from<00:02:57.549> me<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.329> I<00:02:58.450> started<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:58.840> general<00:02:59.140> at

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
away from me and I started in general at

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:48.950 
away from me and I started in general at
the<00:02:59.920> computers<00:03:00.459> i<00:03:00.640> got<00:03:00.819> my<00:03:00.939> god

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.660 

ettore<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.680> ultimate<00:03:50.300> emphasize<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.510> like<00:03:52.670> I

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
ettore I ultimate emphasize the like I

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.810 
ettore I ultimate emphasize the like I
don't<00:03:53.970> know<00:03:54.090> like<00:03:54.350> security<00:03:55.350> years<00:03:55.790> but<00:03:56.790> I

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
don't know like security years but I

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.110 
don't know like security years but I
come<00:03:57.090> here<00:03:57.300> I<00:03:57.360> criticize<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.350> other<00:03:59.120> security

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
come here I criticize the other security

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.330 
come here I criticize the other security
everywhere<00:04:00.390> now<00:04:00.690> how<00:04:01.320> you<00:04:01.380> can<00:04:01.620> do<00:04:01.800> anything<00:04:02.040> I

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
everywhere now how you can do anything I

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.730 
everywhere now how you can do anything I
see<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.850> construction<00:04:03.120> workers<00:04:03.540> for<00:04:03.840> states

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
see the construction workers for states

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.830 
see the construction workers for states
that<00:04:05.010> they<00:04:05.490> do<00:04:05.670> something<00:04:06.060> really<00:04:06.270> like<00:04:06.570> ass

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
that they do something really like ass

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.320 
that they do something really like ass
in<00:04:07.710> a<00:04:07.770> system<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.550> they<00:04:08.880> follow<00:04:09.090> this

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
in a system that they follow this

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.740 
in a system that they follow this
certain<00:04:09.690> rules<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.170> really<00:04:11.010> like<00:04:11.480> well<00:04:12.480> then

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
certain rules that really like well then

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.470 
certain rules that really like well then
it<00:04:12.930> works<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.740> system<00:04:14.070> works<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.580> in<00:04:15.030> Mexico

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
it works the system works and in Mexico

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.630 
it works the system works and in Mexico
is<00:04:15.600> just<00:04:15.840> is<00:04:16.350> their<00:04:16.620> kind<00:04:16.890> of<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.130> opposite<00:04:17.489> is

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
is just is their kind of the opposite is

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.320 
is just is their kind of the opposite is
like<00:04:17.880> quick<00:04:19.100> if<00:04:20.100> this<00:04:20.460> thing's<00:04:20.700> worked<00:04:21.030> right

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
like quick if this thing's worked right

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.080 
like quick if this thing's worked right
now<00:04:21.540> is<00:04:22.380> good<00:04:22.680> we<00:04:23.250> don't<00:04:23.370> care<00:04:23.580> about<00:04:23.610> tomorrow

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
now is good we don't care about tomorrow

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.410 
now is good we don't care about tomorrow
care<00:04:24.900> about<00:04:25.170> right<00:04:25.410> now<00:04:25.590> so<00:04:26.430> let's<00:04:26.790> do<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:27.030> so

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
care about right now so let's do it so

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.900 
care about right now so let's do it so
it's<00:04:27.660> just<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.200> can't<00:04:28.920> like<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.370> connected<00:04:29.790> to

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
it's just I can't like that connected to

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.730 
it's just I can't like that connected to
sometimes<00:04:30.420> that<00:04:30.780> kind<00:04:30.960> of<00:04:30.990> clash

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:05:09.250 

I<00:04:35.800> think

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.930 

then<00:05:09.620> we<00:05:09.890> lost<00:05:10.220> levels<00:05:10.640> with<00:05:10.850> achieve<00:05:11.210> mastery

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.180 

do<00:05:16.940> a<00:05:16.970> pretty<00:05:17.210> good<00:05:17.390> so<00:05:17.600> far<00:05:18.010> put<00:05:19.010> their

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
do a pretty good so far put their

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.450 
do a pretty good so far put their
bending<00:05:19.570> they<00:05:20.570> actually<00:05:20.990> are<00:05:21.080> packing<00:05:21.470> the

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
bending they actually are packing the

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.620 
bending they actually are packing the
thinking<00:05:22.790> was<00:05:22.880> they<00:05:23.180> were<00:05:23.240> straight<00:05:23.600> up

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
thinking was they were straight up

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:42.730 
thinking was they were straight up
another<00:05:24.080> against<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.800> cushion<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.310> couch

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.310 

should<00:05:43.740> we<00:05:43.860> try<00:05:44.070> and<00:05:44.130> leave<00:05:44.280> it<00:05:44.400> on<00:05:44.550> a<00:05:44.610> lot<00:05:44.880> more

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
should we try and leave it on a lot more

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.280 
should we try and leave it on a lot more
each<00:05:46.320> other<00:05:46.530> one<00:05:46.740> last<00:05:46.770> problem<00:05:47.580> no<00:05:48.210> no<00:05:49.169> is

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
each other one last problem no no is

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.719 
each other one last problem no no is
there<00:05:49.560> visiting<00:05:50.040> because<00:05:50.220> they're<00:05:50.580> not

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
there visiting because they're not

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:59.120 
there visiting because they're not
horizontal<00:05:51.690> I<00:05:53.180> will<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:57.229> yeah<00:05:58.229> that<00:05:58.860> used<00:05:59.010> to
