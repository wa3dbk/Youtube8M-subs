00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
really great by um but the best way I

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.490 
really great by um but the best way I
find<00:00:44.920> to<00:00:45.220> organize<00:00:46.000> something<00:00:46.570> when<00:00:47.140> you<00:00:47.260> get

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
find to organize something when you get

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.010 
find to organize something when you get
you<00:00:47.890> know<00:00:47.920> storage<00:00:48.730> containers<00:00:49.300> like<00:00:49.540> I<00:00:49.750> did

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
you know storage containers like I did

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.960 
you know storage containers like I did
because<00:00:50.590> right<00:00:50.830> now<00:00:50.980> this<00:00:51.160> is<00:00:51.430> a<00:00:51.460> mess

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
because right now this is a mess

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.200 
because right now this is a mess
um<00:00:52.090> I<00:00:52.870> find<00:00:53.440> that<00:00:53.680> taking<00:00:54.070> everything<00:00:54.400> out<00:00:54.760> you

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
um I find that taking everything out you

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.110 
um I find that taking everything out you
know<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.020> begin<00:00:56.290> is<00:00:56.740> a<00:00:56.800> lot<00:00:57.130> easier<00:00:57.550> I<00:00:57.880> go

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
know to begin is a lot easier I go

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.940 
know to begin is a lot easier I go
through<00:00:58.360> all<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.780> things<00:00:58.990> that<00:00:59.140> are<00:00:59.380> there<00:00:59.680> I

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
through all the things that are there I

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.380 
through all the things that are there I
see<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:01.420> I<00:01:01.570> use<00:01:01.810> it<00:01:02.020> I<00:01:02.260> check<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.490> expiration

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
see if I use it I check the expiration

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.660 
see if I use it I check the expiration
date<00:01:04.720> if<00:01:05.140> it's<00:01:05.320> good<00:01:05.560> or<00:01:05.590> not<00:01:05.770> and<00:01:06.189> I<00:01:06.520> usually

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
date if it's good or not and I usually

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.789 
date if it's good or not and I usually
try<00:01:07.150> to<00:01:07.180> keep<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.689> items<00:01:07.900> that<00:01:08.229> I<00:01:08.350> use<00:01:08.590> the

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
try to keep the items that I use the

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.190 
try to keep the items that I use the
most<00:01:08.979> towards<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.610> front<00:01:09.970> so<00:01:10.179> since<00:01:10.840> this<00:01:10.990> is

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
most towards the front so since this is

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.399 
most towards the front so since this is
not<00:01:11.319> my<00:01:11.560> bathroom<00:01:11.799> um<00:01:12.429> and<00:01:13.149> my<00:01:13.960> mother<00:01:14.229> and

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
not my bathroom um and my mother and

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.050 
not my bathroom um and my mother and
will<00:01:14.499> actually<00:01:14.799> use<00:01:14.979> faster<00:01:15.609> more<00:01:15.789> than<00:01:15.909> I<00:01:15.999> do

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
will actually use faster more than I do

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.580 
will actually use faster more than I do
so<00:01:16.210> this<00:01:16.479> is<00:01:16.539> most<00:01:16.749> of<00:01:16.869> her<00:01:16.990> stuff<00:01:17.200> under<00:01:17.439> there

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
so this is most of her stuff under there

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.929 
so this is most of her stuff under there
and<00:01:17.859> I<00:01:18.280> thought<00:01:18.399> this<00:01:18.520> would<00:01:18.609> be<00:01:18.670> a<00:01:18.759> really

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
and I thought this would be a really

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.959 
and I thought this would be a really
great<00:01:19.119> way<00:01:19.359> to<00:01:19.499> organize<00:01:20.499> them<00:01:21.069> so<00:01:21.490> I<00:01:21.729> can't

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
great way to organize them so I can't

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.129 
great way to organize them so I can't
throw<00:01:22.149> anything<00:01:22.359> away<00:01:22.600> because<00:01:22.960> it's<00:01:23.079> not

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:23.139 
throw anything away because it's not

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:27.749 
throw anything away because it's not
mine<00:01:23.380> so<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.939> we<00:01:25.090> go<00:01:25.210> from<00:01:26.009> Walmart<00:01:27.009> I<00:01:27.280> don't
