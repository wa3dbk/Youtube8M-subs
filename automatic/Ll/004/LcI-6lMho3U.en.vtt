 old man serious in my time of 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.180
 mano childhood I watched that much 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.270
 I do not know if you remember 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.700
 shit box that was those robozinhos the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.790

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.860
 Nike or in the cartoon and can not remember face in 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.079

 kurt is the molecada type transformers there 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.550
 who turns into a giant robot and now you see 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.580
 That's going to become a reality there. 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:15.910
 imagine what a most bizarre thing we 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.610
 in the here is now connected to people 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.820
 watch a live broadcast on 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.100
 youtube is tweets that is 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:29.560
 imagine you watch a broadcast to 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:32.830
 alive in a giant robot battle 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.500
 worry is a talking business goes to 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.510
 Japanese company rose download 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.240
 I do not know if this is how you pronounce it . 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.430
 low anyway low interest and heavy industry 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.730
 accepted the challenge of the American rival 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.740
 mary abbots net you see him with the 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.110
 incident right American rival mary 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.570
 abbots for a duel of giant robots 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.640
 the Americans had challenged the 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.130
 Japanese last week 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.150
 You have a giant robot and we have a 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.220
 giant robot 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.100
 You know what needs to happen. 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.730
 challenge you will duel warned the 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.950
 owners of the goal boats but it is not robozinho 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.550
 there is not ignorant of 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.040
 garden is a heavy old heavy business 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.519
 really heavy old for you guys to have 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.850
 human notion know how many tons have 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.970
 a robot of if you look at that robot of the 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:35.350
 Japanese company has something around there 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:37.840
 4.5 meters and 4 meters in height. 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.780
 that most worries only that it leaves the business 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.690
 more interesting is that the Japanese already 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.180
 have warned that this is a matter of 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.310
 honor for the country to lose to the states 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.519
 together it would be a business that they did not 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.310
 they would like it so much and they still spoke 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.200
 the robot right robots is now already in 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.019
 His story is linked to those robots. 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.450
 Japanese already giant that always appear 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.239
 in movies and such because it is already classic 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.510
 So, for them, it's going to be kind of 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.630
 compulsory to win and now the opponent 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.610
 United States that was the challenge 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.920
 What will the United States want? 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.799
 lose hands and he has more cars 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.799
 Japanese go there and provoke even more 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.050
 honest the fight like that should be 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.020
 made theoretically with 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.509
 paintball is on business more 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.280
 friendly but the Japanese guy wants to 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.139
 study and solve the problem 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.240
 same face it is that the little knock 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.780
 there face to face is on 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.180
 You talk, I just want to see how it goes. 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.120
 to be this goes so seriously me so well 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.270
 anxious year they released a video 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.819
 announcing in the duel, it's kind of 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.129
 accepting the challenge I will leave this 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.229
 video here in the description who wants to give 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.599
 a look at me a little while there that the 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.909
 video is very cool and I left it with a little 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.220
 more good mouth water let's see the 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:02.289
 galley let's see the two companies still 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.050
 they did not give many details about it 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.690
 of this battle over this duel and 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.909
 about the date that would happen 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.120
 the challenge made by my boot suggested 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:15.909
 in a year from today, then 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.240
 probably there is a year like the 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:22.180
 from a year is and we should already have 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.190
 this battle going on imagines exists 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.039
 hence being transmitted live 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.440
 Man is bizarre in a business of that né 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:32.500
 but good people, we have to take 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.310
 in consideration that if everything is taken 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.130
 that's it 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.550
 if they do not use all this 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.710
 technology to seal something old 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.469
 heavier it is switched on 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.380
 It's cool, I'm afraid because it's 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:49.990
 united states and japan yale already has 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.870
 corey haim already have Nania Germany have 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:56.169
 connected there goes but joining everything like this and 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.569
 if an injunction will be old and is 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.430
 Exit a business of this but at last it is 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:02.349
