00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
all I think it's a pretty terrible idea

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.760 
all I think it's a pretty terrible idea
when<00:00:55.880> you<00:00:56.300> make<00:00:56.480> a<00:00:56.510> game<00:00:56.750> like<00:00:56.810> captain<00:00:57.500> Noble

for the Nintendo 64 sir man's kind of a

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.450 
for the Nintendo 64 sir man's kind of a
difficult<00:01:45.179> character<00:01:45.539> to<00:01:45.840> adapt<00:01:46.740> he's<00:01:47.310> got

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
difficult character to adapt he's got

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.340 
difficult character to adapt he's got
just<00:01:47.819> an<00:01:47.969> infinite<00:01:48.240> amount<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.689> power<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.289> it

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
just an infinite amount of power so it

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.719 
just an infinite amount of power so it
makes<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.649> difficult<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.369> make<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.670> a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.640 
you couldn't really see that far in the
distance<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.209> developers<00:02:13.049> made<00:02:13.290> up<00:02:13.440> something

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
distance so developers made up something

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.170 
distance so developers made up something
really<00:02:13.920> bizarre<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.250> saying<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.819> know<00:02:14.940> oh

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
so you can't really see anything which

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.890 
so you can't really see anything which
was<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:19.319> like<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.530> nice<00:02:19.829> way<00:02:20.099> of<00:02:20.130> saying<00:02:20.900> we
