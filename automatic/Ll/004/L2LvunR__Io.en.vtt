00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.520 

so<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.969> it's<00:01:21.149> like<00:01:21.390> when<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> really<00:01:22.020> focus<00:01:22.409> on

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
so and it's like when I really focus on

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.789 
so and it's like when I really focus on
my<00:01:22.679> hamstrings<00:01:23.249> a<00:01:23.429> lot<00:01:23.840> that's<00:01:24.840> something<00:01:25.499> I

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
my hamstrings a lot that's something I

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.630

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
feel life kind of neglected over time

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.039 
feel life kind of neglected over time
and<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:29.969> is<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.119> last<00:01:30.420> set<00:01:30.750> where<00:01:30.960> I

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
frys reps so I did this instead of
