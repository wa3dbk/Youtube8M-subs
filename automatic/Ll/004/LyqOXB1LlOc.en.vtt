what passion was about and he kind of
gave<00:01:36.520> me<00:01:36.729> a<00:01:36.759> very<00:01:37.060> positive<00:01:37.330> rude<00:01:37.990> awakening

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
gave me a very positive rude awakening

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.160 
gave me a very positive rude awakening
and<00:01:38.950> it<00:01:39.429> has<00:01:39.580> only<00:01:39.850> fueled<00:01:40.270> my<00:01:40.390> desire<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:40.810> be<00:01:41.140> a

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.120 
and it has only fueled my desire to be a
fashion<00:01:41.560> designer<00:01:41.590> even<00:01:42.250> greater

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.039 

it's<00:01:45.880> not<00:01:46.090> just<00:01:46.360> telling<00:01:46.600> them<00:01:46.689> what<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:46.840> do

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049

that's<00:01:47.290> not<00:01:47.409> at<00:01:47.619> all<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.130> case<00:01:48.460> but<00:01:48.729> hearing

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
that's not at all the case but hearing

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.570

what<00:01:50.080> they<00:01:50.259> want<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.740> knowing<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.400> reality

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
what they want and knowing the reality

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
that amalgamation in between that gets

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.680 
that amalgamation in between that gets
their<00:01:56.409> vision<00:01:57.190> down<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.030> runway<00:01:58.360> in<00:01:58.570> the
