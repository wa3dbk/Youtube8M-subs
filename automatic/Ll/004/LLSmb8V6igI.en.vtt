I think he's eclipsing Nash at this
point<00:04:15.450> is<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.720> best<00:04:16.160> distributor<00:04:17.160> getting

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489

hands<00:05:06.419> and<00:05:06.539> if<00:05:06.900> Ray<00:05:07.110> didn't<00:05:07.409> like<00:05:07.560> it<00:05:07.710> I'm<00:05:07.800> just

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
hands and if Ray didn't like it I'm just

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.290 
hands and if Ray didn't like it I'm just
putting<00:05:08.190> words<00:05:08.340> in<00:05:08.550> Doc's<00:05:08.729> mouth<00:05:09.000> that's<00:05:09.150> how

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
putting words in Doc's mouth that's how

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.209 
putting words in Doc's mouth that's how
it's<00:05:09.419> coming<00:05:09.629> across<00:05:09.719> to<00:05:10.110> me<00:05:10.229> if<00:05:10.469> Ray<00:05:10.919> didn't

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219 
it's coming across to me if Ray didn't

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.300 
it's coming across to me if Ray didn't
like<00:05:11.370> it<00:05:11.610> then<00:05:12.090> fine<00:05:12.539> he<00:05:13.050> can<00:05:13.080> go<00:05:13.349> to<00:05:13.409> my<00:05:13.590> well<00:05:14.280> I

think what you saw was Doc Rivers

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.230 
think what you saw was Doc Rivers
because<00:05:16.979> a<00:05:17.009> lot<00:05:17.250> of<00:05:17.400> people<00:05:17.729> are<00:05:17.789> gonna<00:05:18.000> bring

because a lot of people are gonna bring
up<00:05:18.419> Rondo<00:05:18.840> because<00:05:19.110> we<00:05:19.259> all<00:05:19.500> know<00:05:19.740> that<00:05:19.949> his

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
up Rondo because we all know that his

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.920 
up Rondo because we all know that his
relationship<00:05:20.310> where<00:05:21.090> Ray<00:05:21.240> Allen<00:05:21.599> wasn't<00:05:21.750> the

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
relationship where Ray Allen wasn't the

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.110 
relationship where Ray Allen wasn't the
greatest<00:05:22.169> and<00:05:22.740> Doc<00:05:22.979> Rivers<00:05:23.190> was<00:05:23.550> elected<00:05:23.969> to

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
greatest and Doc Rivers was elected to

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.760 
greatest and Doc Rivers was elected to
address<00:05:24.419> it<00:05:24.569> from<00:05:24.659> that<00:05:24.870> perspective<00:05:25.050> but

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
address it from that perspective but

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.740 
address it from that perspective but
don't<00:05:26.009> think<00:05:26.250> for<00:05:26.430> one<00:05:26.460> second<00:05:27.150> that<00:05:27.270> Doc

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
don't think for one second that Doc

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.749 
don't think for one second that Doc
Rivers<00:05:29.599> decision<00:05:30.599> to<00:05:31.289> make<00:05:31.680> ray<00:05:31.979> come<00:05:32.310> off<00:05:32.550> the

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
Rivers decision to make ray come off the

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.670 
Rivers decision to make ray come off the
bench<00:05:32.940> once<00:05:33.330> he<00:05:33.509> came<00:05:33.719> back<00:05:33.990> from<00:05:34.139> injury<00:05:34.529> as

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
bench once he came back from injury as

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.200 
bench once he came back from injury as
opposed<00:05:35.039> to<00:05:35.159> putting<00:05:35.400> him<00:05:35.610> in<00:05:35.729> that<00:05:35.849> starting

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
opposed to putting him in that starting

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.740 
opposed to putting him in that starting
lineup

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
lineup

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.409 
lineup
didn't<00:05:37.229> resonate<00:05:37.469> profoundly<00:05:38.370> oh<00:05:38.520> I<00:05:38.580> get<00:05:39.210> that

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
didn't resonate profoundly oh I get that

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.930 
didn't resonate profoundly oh I get that
so<00:05:39.779> was<00:05:40.080> it<00:05:40.229> the<00:05:40.259> right<00:05:40.590> decision<00:05:40.650> to<00:05:41.580> make<00:05:41.610> it

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
so was it the right decision to make it

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.019 
so was it the right decision to make it
Rondo's<00:05:42.479> team<00:05:42.870> laugh<00:05:43.250> well<00:05:44.250> first<00:05:44.460> of<00:05:44.580> all<00:05:44.729> as

Rondo's team laugh well first of all as

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.760 
Rondo's team laugh well first of all as
far<00:05:45.060> as<00:05:45.270> I'm<00:05:45.449> concerned<00:05:45.839> it<00:05:46.110> should<00:05:46.139> always<00:05:46.469> be

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
far as I'm concerned it should always be

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.019 
far as I'm concerned it should always be
the<00:05:46.889> point<00:05:47.129> guards<00:05:47.430> team<00:05:47.669> that's<00:05:47.849> why<00:05:47.969> the

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
the point guards team that's why the

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:49.399 
the point guards team that's why the
point<00:05:48.360> guard<00:05:48.569> is<00:05:48.690> so<00:05:48.810> important<00:05:49.259> it<00:05:49.379> should

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
point guard is so important it should

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.290 
point guard is so important it should
always<00:05:49.680> be<00:05:49.919> the<00:05:50.009> point<00:05:50.250> guards<00:05:50.520> team<00:05:50.729> there's

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
always be the point guards team there's

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.059 
always be the point guards team there's
no<00:05:51.449> doubt<00:05:51.659> about<00:05:51.810> that<00:05:51.960> I<00:05:52.259> can't<00:05:52.680> believe<00:05:53.039> that

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:53.069 
no doubt about that I can't believe that

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:55.100 
no doubt about that I can't believe that
somebody<00:05:53.639> like<00:05:53.879> Ray<00:05:54.089> Allen<00:05:54.449> who<00:05:54.569> basically

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
somebody like Ray Allen who basically

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.990 
somebody like Ray Allen who basically
gets<00:05:55.319> open<00:05:55.710> and<00:05:55.919> shoots<00:05:56.250> would<00:05:56.729> have<00:05:56.969> a

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
gets open and shoots would have a

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.180 
gets open and shoots would have a
problem<00:05:57.449> with<00:05:58.050> it<00:05:58.199> being<00:05:58.440> a<00:05:58.650> point<00:05:58.889> guards

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
problem with it being a point guards

problem with it being a point guards
team<00:05:59.400> I<00:05:59.490> don't<00:05:59.669> believe<00:05:59.909> that<00:05:59.940> maybe<00:06:00.270> this

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
team I don't believe that maybe this

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.149 
team I don't believe that maybe this
particular<00:06:00.810> point<00:06:01.319> worked<00:06:01.560> this<00:06:01.770> particular

Garnett<00:06:13.979> so<00:06:14.279> I<00:06:14.310> can't<00:06:14.669> imagine<00:06:15.180> that<00:06:15.210> that<00:06:15.479> was

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
Garnett so I can't imagine that that was

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.300 
Garnett so I can't imagine that that was
that<00:06:15.960> big<00:06:16.199> of<00:06:16.379> a<00:06:16.440> problem<00:06:16.680> I<00:06:16.919> think<00:06:17.190> the

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
that big of a problem I think the

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.459 
that big of a problem I think the
biggest<00:06:17.550> problem<00:06:17.879> was<00:06:18.569> that<00:06:18.599> the<00:06:18.990> Celtics

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:19.469 
biggest problem was that the Celtics

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:21.110 
biggest problem was that the Celtics
were<00:06:19.589> making<00:06:19.979> it<00:06:20.159> clear<00:06:20.460> that<00:06:20.879> they<00:06:21.060> were

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
were making it clear that they were

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.670 
were making it clear that they were
moving<00:06:21.479> in<00:06:21.690> a<00:06:21.779> different<00:06:22.139> direction<00:06:22.229> with

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
moving in a different direction with

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.860 
moving in a different direction with
Avery<00:06:23.099> Bradley<00:06:23.339> yeah<00:06:23.789> and<00:06:23.940> that<00:06:24.089> resonated

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
Avery Bradley yeah and that resonated

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.779 
Avery Bradley yeah and that resonated
and<00:06:25.139> hold<00:06:25.319> on<00:06:25.469> and<00:06:25.680> all<00:06:25.919> I'm<00:06:26.129> saying<00:06:26.370> is<00:06:26.610> if
