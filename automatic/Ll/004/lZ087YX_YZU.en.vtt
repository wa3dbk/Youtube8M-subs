type<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.840> liquid<00:04:59.050> liner<00:04:59.440> I<00:04:59.740> find<00:04:59.979> it<00:05:00.099> to<00:05:00.190> be

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
type of liquid liner I find it to be

really<00:05:00.430> easy<00:05:00.550> to<00:05:00.940> apply<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.720> usually<00:05:02.620> it<00:05:02.740> will

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
really easy to apply and usually it will

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.529 
really easy to apply and usually it will
last<00:05:03.039> me<00:05:03.370> usually<00:05:03.909> one<00:05:04.060> of<00:05:04.090> these<00:05:04.210> containers

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539

will<00:05:04.720> last<00:05:04.900> me<00:05:05.080> quite<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.349> long<00:05:05.560> time<00:05:05.860> and<00:05:06.280> this

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
will last me quite a long time and this

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.820 
will last me quite a long time and this
last<00:05:07.120> product<00:05:07.449> isn't<00:05:07.720> a<00:05:07.900> cosmetics<00:05:08.440> product

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
last product isn't a cosmetics product

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.399 
last product isn't a cosmetics product
but<00:05:08.979> it<00:05:09.069> is<00:05:09.190> a<00:05:09.220> skincare<00:05:09.669> product<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.659> it's

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
but it is a skincare product and it's

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.980 
but it is a skincare product and it's
the<00:05:11.620> shea<00:05:11.949> butter<00:05:12.340> hand<00:05:12.759> cream<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.539> I<00:05:13.840> thought
