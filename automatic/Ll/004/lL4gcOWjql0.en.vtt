00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.310 

from<00:00:54.730> say

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.959

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.760 

then<00:01:04.239> you<00:01:04.360> plop<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.690> silat<00:01:04.930> ring<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.470> third

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.800 

it's<00:01:58.680> basically<00:01:59.840> all<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.990> same<00:02:01.170> again<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:02.810> just

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
it's basically all the same again I just

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:40.210 
it's basically all the same again I just
run<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.650> through<00:02:04.800> you

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.670 

first<00:02:41.220> prices<00:02:41.520> course<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:42.030> F<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:43.610> go<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.670> E<00:02:44.790> minor

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.539 

you<00:02:47.859> run<00:02:48.189> down<00:02:48.269> from<00:02:50.609> c2<00:02:51.609> I<00:02:51.640> think<00:02:51.969> that's<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.180> d9

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
you run down from c2 I think that's a d9

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.770 
you run down from c2 I think that's a d9
second<00:02:54.549> fret<00:02:54.790> 6<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:56.019> third<00:02:57.090> strings<00:02:58.090> first

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
second fret 6 and third strings first

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:11.300 
second fret 6 and third strings first
fret<00:02:59.219> second<00:03:00.219> string<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.709> you<00:03:02.859> get<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.280> F

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:24.150 

space<00:03:11.910> on<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.300> G<00:03:12.840> chord<00:03:13.640> 99

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.480 

so<00:03:24.550> that's<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.910> sixth<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:26.470> base<00:03:26.650> on<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:26.950> G

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
so that's a sixth the base on the G

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.950 
so that's a sixth the base on the G
chord<00:03:27.990> second<00:03:28.990> string<00:03:29.200> open

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
chord second string open

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.030 
chord second string open
then<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.560> go<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.710> fifth<00:03:32.100> string<00:03:32.310> open<00:03:32.490> first

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
then you go to fifth string open first

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.420 
then you go to fifth string open first
fret<00:03:35.040> on<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.220> second<00:03:35.640> string

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
fret on the second string

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.069 
fret on the second string
then<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:37.879> go<00:03:38.620> second<00:03:39.620> string<00:03:39.799> third<00:03:39.829> fret

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
then you go second string third fret

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.380 
then you go second string third fret
fifth<00:03:42.079> string<00:03:42.170> second

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.250 

and<00:03:45.630> then<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:45.900> have<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.670> open<00:03:47.670> six<00:03:48.270> to<00:03:48.990> first

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
and then you have the open six to first

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.510 
and then you have the open six to first
six

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.059 

so<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.150> get<00:03:54.270> there

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.309 

and<00:04:02.069> then<00:04:02.310> everything<00:04:02.700> else<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:03.170> that's<00:04:04.170> the

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
and then everything else is that's the

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:11.000 
and then everything else is that's the
same<00:04:04.349> again

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.700
