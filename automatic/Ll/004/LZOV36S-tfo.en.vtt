that thing out of there I've seen all
kinds<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.609> crazy<00:00:23.880> ways<00:00:24.150> usually<00:00:24.930> get<00:00:25.080> them<00:00:25.199> up

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
kinds of crazy ways usually get them up

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.230 
kinds of crazy ways usually get them up
and<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:26.039> worst<00:00:26.220> way<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:26.730> breaking<00:00:27.060> off

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and the worst way of just breaking off

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.150 
and the worst way of just breaking off
the<00:00:27.449> top<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> bottle<00:00:28.260> well<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:28.859> don't<00:00:28.980> want

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the top of the bottle well we don't want

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.620 
the top of the bottle well we don't want
to<00:00:29.220> do<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.730> bottle<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.090> wine<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.359> really

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
good so I went on the internet and found

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.500 
good so I went on the internet and found
a<00:00:32.880> solution

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
a solution

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.500 
a solution
take<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> look<00:00:34.910> this<00:00:35.910> video<00:00:36.270> was<00:00:36.390> originally

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
take a look this video was originally

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.330 
take a look this video was originally
put<00:00:37.020> together<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.440> French<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.040> I'm<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.309> to

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
put together in French so I'm going to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.819 
put together in French so I'm going to
ad-lib<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> little<00:00:40.739> bit

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
ad-lib it so that we have a little bit

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.950 
ad-lib it so that we have a little bit
of<00:00:40.920> English<00:00:41.070> coming<00:00:41.550> out<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.820> here<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.180> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
of English coming out of here and you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.209 
of English coming out of here and you
can<00:00:43.050> see<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.440> got<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.590> French<00:00:43.860> bottle<00:00:44.160> of

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.350 
wine and we have an issue we have no
corkscrew<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.700> we're<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> do<00:00:48.210> is

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
corkscrew so what we're going to do is

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.279 
corkscrew so what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:48.450> going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.600> create<00:00:48.809> some<00:00:49.020> pressure

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
we're going to create some pressure

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.740 
we're going to create some pressure
inside<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.160> bottle<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.670> slowly<00:00:51.149> force<00:00:51.539> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
inside the bottle and slowly force that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.680 
inside the bottle and slowly force that
corkscrew<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:53.329> one<00:00:54.329> thing<00:00:54.539> that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
corkscrew out and one thing that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.450 
corkscrew out and one thing that
everybody<00:00:54.870> has<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> shoe<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.190> we're<00:00:56.370> going

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
everybody has is a shoe so we're going

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.279 
everybody has is a shoe so we're going
to<00:00:56.520> utilize<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.000> shoe<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> Cushing<00:00:57.899> agent

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
to utilize the shoe as a Cushing agent

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.680 
to utilize the shoe as a Cushing agent
as<00:00:58.410> we<00:00:58.699> create<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> pressure<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> bottom

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
as we create the pressure on the bottom

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.729 
as we create the pressure on the bottom
of<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.899> bottle<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.559> course<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.980> corkscrew

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.380 
of that bottle of course that corkscrew
once<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.860> get<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.159> bottle<00:01:05.519> out<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.850> open<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
bottle in the bottom of the shoe and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.630 
bottle in the bottom of the shoe and
lightly<00:01:15.060> tap<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.720> against<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.110> wall

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
lightly tap it against the wall

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.660 
lightly tap it against the wall
so<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.700> see<00:01:18.150> here<00:01:19.100> positioning<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> bottle

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
so you see here positioning the bottle

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.540 
so you see here positioning the bottle
in<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.330> chute

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
in the chute

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.890 

we<00:01:24.550> create<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:24.880> pressure<00:01:25.120> I'm<00:01:25.330> going<00:01:25.540> to<00:01:25.600> push

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
we create the pressure I'm going to push

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.580 
we create the pressure I'm going to push
that<00:01:25.930> quartz<00:01:26.560> go<00:01:26.710> right<00:01:26.980> on<00:01:27.130> at<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.340> top

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.610 

that<00:01:32.429> my<00:01:33.060> slick<00:01:33.659> tack<00:01:33.929> on<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.200> wall

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.920 

as<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:40.280> can<00:01:40.400> see<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.700> corkscrew<00:01:41.480> is<00:01:41.570> starting

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
as you can see the corkscrew is starting

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.920 
as you can see the corkscrew is starting
to<00:01:41.990> release<00:01:42.230> itself<00:01:42.730> more<00:01:43.730> capsule<00:01:44.270> hammer

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:57.610 

maybe<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:49.950> more

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.890 

just<00:01:57.770> like<00:01:57.980> tap<00:01:58.280> in<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:58.850> can<00:01:59.000> see<00:01:59.180> now<00:01:59.360> get<00:01:59.870> a

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
just like tap in you can see now get a

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.380 
just like tap in you can see now get a
firm<00:02:00.200> grasp<00:02:00.440> on<00:02:00.620> that<00:02:00.800> question

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
firm grasp on that question

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.350 
firm grasp on that question
get<00:02:02.390> her<00:02:02.510> on<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:03.770> now<00:02:04.040> get<00:02:04.640> some<00:02:04.790> wine<00:02:05.000> for<00:02:05.240> our
