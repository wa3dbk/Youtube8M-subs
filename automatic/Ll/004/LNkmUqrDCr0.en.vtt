00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi of the world so today I 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.509
 presented an application that canon has 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.900
 go out, my name is my coach 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.960
 cannon es so this app allows 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.580
 to learn the picture very easily and 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.150
 it's an application for everyone 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.650
 especially for amateurs 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.750
 so the application is for those 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.010
 who have a reflex 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.279
 so as you can see here we have the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.099
 wheel with the different in the mode of 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.550
 style the manual had was vp 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.680
 automatic and already pre modes 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.620
 configured then the application is 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.899
 free available on the app store 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.920
 as you can see here you have the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.020
 little moor the button to access the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.940
 menu in the menu you have several 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.860
 things firstly the grip of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.250
 your camera 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.050
 so that's where I was sometimes 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.210
 have the presentation of the camera 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.309
 for example here it's a 1200 years old 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.940
 but you have another style model 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.970
 the house of this also corresponds so much 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.290
 that you have the same currency is here 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.090
 but usually if you have it reflex 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.360
 you have the same letter be it a 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.070
 sony a canyon or other brands 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.100
 you must normally have the same 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:22.170
 functions so there you have each time 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.850
 the explanations then what is good 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.530
 you have the tones these pictures so the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.530
 photo tips to start and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.479
 membership photo tips 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.189
 to start yes you need a 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.430
 wide internet connection the pines in this 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.960
 Good evening time it depends Categories 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.960
 what I find interesting me is 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.689
 exercises for example the implementation 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.680
 value of the subject have each time you 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.680
 can see some examples 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.090
 about enhancement and you 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.729
 can finally every time in every 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.320
 exercise had started here for example at 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.829
 about the focal length 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.310
 so you have here we know the example f 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.960
 the more you open it slower then my 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.099
 rim last night anne is to indicate 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.009
 if they put a distance of 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.160
 calabash you are the focus by 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.010
 example here on the cup 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.280
 so the task will be highlighted by 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.880
 relationship to funds that is behind you 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.880
 see it's interactive 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.870
 the fit he explains how he 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.000
 to make this picture so it makes the setting 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.500
 in place either you do it 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.320
 manually or so he advises you 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.170
 the av mode and where every time you have 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.650
 the steps to finally do 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.300
 your nbc photo to freeze the action 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.960
 every time I 've been told you have 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.640
 examples 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.330
 so you can get choices of 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.520
 results everything and tides we advise 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.490
 itv at least you'll learn better 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.850
 all the functions of your device 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.040
 Photo 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.120
 if in case you do not slip for manual 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.290
 and if you use it automatically 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.090
 frankly I do not recommend it is a 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.900
 little stupid to buy a reflex so 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.810
 try to get used rather small and 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.000
 take pictures especially for fun 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:15.550
 and so better see what's needed 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.860
 correct or not whose application as 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.030
 I tell my coach called cannon es 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.500
 it is free 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.230
 frankly I recommend it to you 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.060
 have some exercise tips and even 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.950
 how to avoid chili problems if 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.260
 for example the blur is empowered and the 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.680
 conclusions the composition is when 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.270
 even something important 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.740
 so there with respect to all 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.780
 information about this application I the 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.220
 would put in the description and if you 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.390
 have a reflex can frankly I you 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.390
 advise her and so here
