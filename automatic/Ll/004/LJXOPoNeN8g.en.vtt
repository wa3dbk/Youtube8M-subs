00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
around 65 notes as well so this is

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.020 
around 65 notes as well so this is
definitely<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:51.649> really<00:00:51.980> good<00:00:52.250> way<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:52.640> I

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
definitely a really good way and I

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.580 
definitely a really good way and I
personally<00:00:53.720> think<00:00:53.870> people<00:00:54.200> need<00:00:54.290> to<00:00:54.440> take

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
personally think people need to take

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.950 
personally think people need to take
advantage<00:00:54.829> of<00:00:55.070> this<00:00:55.220> before<00:00:55.670> nerves<00:00:56.120> come<00:00:56.810> in

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
advantage of this before nerves come in

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.590 
advantage of this before nerves come in

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
pretty much just stood still and I

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.760 
pretty much just stood still and I
pulled<00:01:04.129> everything<00:01:04.399> to<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.299> middle<00:01:05.569> you<00:01:06.499> keep

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770

him<00:01:06.920> one<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.399> NPC's<00:01:07.999> that<00:01:08.210> are<00:01:08.299> here<00:01:08.420> as

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539 
him one that the NPC's that are here as

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.149 
him one that the NPC's that are here as
well<00:01:08.659> if<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:08.960> just<00:01:09.139> tagged<00:01:09.319> something<00:01:09.740> the

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
well if you just tagged something the

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.559 
well if you just tagged something the
NPC's<00:01:10.579> are<00:01:10.700> going<00:01:10.819> to<00:01:10.909> finish<00:01:11.030> it<00:01:11.210> off<00:01:11.299> and

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:11.569 
NPC's are going to finish it off and

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:13.419 
NPC's are going to finish it off and
this<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.350> what<00:01:12.499> makes<00:01:12.679> this<00:01:12.859> absolutely

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
this is what makes this absolutely

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:15.340 
this is what makes this absolutely
ridiculous<00:01:14.060> you'll<00:01:14.869> see<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:15.170> there's

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
ridiculous you'll see that there's

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.020 
ridiculous you'll see that there's
catapults<00:01:15.979> or<00:01:16.069> something<00:01:16.459> that<00:01:16.609> land<00:01:16.789> on<00:01:16.969> the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
catapults or something that land on the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.029 
catapults or something that land on the
ground<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.450> blow<00:01:17.569> up<00:01:17.600> if<00:01:17.959> you<00:01:18.380> tag<00:01:18.649> that<00:01:18.829> more

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
ground and blow up if you tag that more

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.219 
ground and blow up if you tag that more
they<00:01:19.219> get<00:01:19.399> one<00:01:19.579> shotted<00:01:19.999> you<00:01:20.689> actually<00:01:20.990> get

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
they get one shotted you actually get

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.489 
they get one shotted you actually get
the<00:01:21.829> the<00:01:22.159> tag<00:01:22.369> for<00:01:22.609> that<00:01:22.729> as<00:01:22.880> well<00:01:23.049> so<00:01:24.049> as<00:01:24.350> you

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499 
the the tag for that as well so as you

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:25.870 
the the tag for that as well so as you
can<00:01:24.590> see<00:01:24.770> in<00:01:24.859> this<00:01:24.920> video<00:01:25.069> I'm<00:01:25.369> literally<00:01:25.639> just

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
can see in this video I'm literally just

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.940 
can see in this video I'm literally just
running<00:01:26.209> around<00:01:26.329> tagging<00:01:27.289> stuff<00:01:27.499> and<00:01:27.709> running

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
running around tagging stuff and running

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.699 
running around tagging stuff and running
back<00:01:28.069> to<00:01:28.249> the<00:01:28.340> middle<00:01:28.579> of<00:01:28.639> the<00:01:28.700> boomkin<00:01:28.969> is<00:01:29.240> I

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:29.709 
back to the middle of the boomkin is I

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:31.449 
back to the middle of the boomkin is I
personally<00:01:30.709> think<00:01:30.859> this<00:01:31.009> is<00:01:31.159> going<00:01:31.249> to<00:01:31.310> get

00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:31.459 
personally think this is going to get

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:33.399 
personally think this is going to get
nerfed<00:01:31.700> just<00:01:32.450> like<00:01:32.600> when<00:01:32.749> they<00:01:32.869> first<00:01:33.139> really

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
nerfed just like when they first really

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.769 
nerfed just like when they first really
smart<00:01:33.709> they<00:01:34.310> did<00:01:34.579> sort<00:01:35.179> of<00:01:35.240> nerf<00:01:35.420> that<00:01:35.659> the

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:35.779 
smart they did sort of nerf that the

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:38.379 
smart they did sort of nerf that the
spawn<00:01:36.049> time<00:01:36.259> is<00:01:36.469> fairly<00:01:36.920> quickly<00:01:37.219> with<00:01:38.149> dark

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:38.389 
spawn time is fairly quickly with dark

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:40.179 
spawn time is fairly quickly with dark
spear<00:01:38.600> we're<00:01:38.990> pretty<00:01:39.139> lucky<00:01:39.350> horde<00:01:39.740> isn't<00:01:40.039> too

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
spear we're pretty lucky horde isn't too

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.399 
spear we're pretty lucky horde isn't too
active<00:01:40.579> so<00:01:41.029> we<00:01:41.149> actually<00:01:41.359> control<00:01:41.899> a<00:01:41.929> lot<00:01:42.319> of

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
active so we actually control a lot of

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.550 
active so we actually control a lot of
the<00:01:42.469> map<00:01:42.679> if<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.789> are<00:01:44.060> horde<00:01:44.359> player<00:01:44.599> i<00:01:44.929> think

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
the map if you are horde player i think

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.109 
the map if you are horde player i think
this<00:01:45.649> works<00:01:45.859> exactly<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.310> same<00:01:46.369> way<00:01:46.549> except

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
this works exactly the same way except

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.109 
this works exactly the same way except
you'd<00:01:47.270> be<00:01:47.420> killing<00:01:47.599> the<00:01:47.869> Alliance<00:01:48.439> ones<00:01:49.119> this

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
you'd be killing the Alliance ones this

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.419 
you'd be killing the Alliance ones this

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
is an absolutely amazing weight as I

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.669 
is an absolutely amazing weight as I
said<00:01:52.759> took<00:01:52.969> me<00:01:53.090> about<00:01:53.240> 30<00:01:53.509> minutes<00:01:53.929> plenty

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
said took me about 30 minutes plenty

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.429
