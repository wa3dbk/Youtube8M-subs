00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.720
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.660
 home cinema deluxe today is about the 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.810
 film frozen ice cold abyss and first 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.820
 shot of the good adam green the hatchet 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.539
 has turned what is still there 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.900
 go wrong 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.670
 the team is from the year 2010 in the 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.910
 We already find main roles ashmore 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.920
 emma bell kevin zegers all year so semi 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.710
 I would say well known and the 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.920
 Action is as fast as it is ingenious 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.260
 three students namely lynch his friend 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.199
 ben and the girlfriend of dan namely 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.379
 Parker want a ski weekend 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.600
 spend 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.430
 as the day comes to an end 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.920
 The three of you want to go back to the hill 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.769
 drive down and so they persuade the 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.229
 overseer to look after the ski lift 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.690
 plus a single ride up 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.830
 to do and by a stupid 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.449
 By chance it comes to the chairlift 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.159
 is turned off while the three are up 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.920
 still in the chairlift 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.969
 high above the abyss and no chance 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.700
 on rescue 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:15.369
 So much for the basic concept of the 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.500
 You can already see certain parallel films 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.469
 to open water for example or too 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.210
 simply called or varied from it 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.649
 that people live in one 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.289
 situation 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.929
 which seems hopeless and that too 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.509
 mostly in one place only plays 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.490
 and that is also the case with frozen 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.990
 these films are characterized by communities 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.539
 because of that in the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.280
 purely displaced characters and wonders 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.329
 what would you do yourself in this situation 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.909
 do 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.579
 and you succeed in frozen because 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.539
 the film just not on any 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.210
 staged spectacularly 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.460
 persecution scenes or so sets but 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.950
 really focused on the matter 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.569
 And this desperation is here in 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.729
 this movie as well as the others 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.829
 I have learned to film well here 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.049
 one realizes that one feels 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.380
 already the throat is tied up because you look 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.329
 very well put into the characters purely 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.009
 can and that is just so exciting 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.840
 because you always want to know what 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.610
 next happens and also the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.560
 kyte education is here really 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.269
 plastic and tangible 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.760
 Of course we have the situation 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.370
 that there is a freezing cold 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.470
 and to top it off, it's still sunday 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.870
 that means the ski weekend is over 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.880
 and the runway will be on again 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.190
 be driven on next friday 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.910
 All in all, the film is relatively good 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.069
 written 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.000
 the actors make her one 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.519
 solid job 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.310
 nobody falls into a negative attitude here 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.380
 a green is a young director of 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.970
 something also dare and so on 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.549
 bit the complete opposite of 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.220
 hatchet here with this movie delivers 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.290
 so do not hedge about the film itself 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.750
 taken seriously and frozen loves itself 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.000
 seriously hatchet were film where many 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.970
 splatter effects were in it and at 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.980
 These are only very rudimentary frozen 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.690
 used and I found that very much 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.150
 pleasant because this is the tension yes 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.860
 does not give a break if extra sees 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.870
 you even have that of a leaves scene 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.970
 actually should be in there the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.970
 But then director has cut out 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.190
 and for good reason the film 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.410
 works very well and is also through 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.440
 the enormous tension that builds the film 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.000
 very entertaining that the film even 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.260
 did not go big and neither did 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.819
 so well known 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.459
 I think the miracle does not mean it yet 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.519
 This is really good 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.620
 representative of his genre and the 93rd 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.569
 minutes pass by like in flight 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.329
 All in all, that means for me 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.350
 a score of eight and a half out of 10 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.090
 possible points 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.859
 I would be interested in what you think of that 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.329
 film-think or what their general of 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.519
 I just think that movie 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.780
 and I would count myself 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.220
 Of course, if you are the next 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.510
 to be there again 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.510
 Until next time
