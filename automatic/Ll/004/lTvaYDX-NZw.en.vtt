00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.420
 there is work on the paris line 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.059
 orleans limoges toulouse 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.130
 we on our side and 5 cm we ourselves 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.540
 let's strengthen our battery of 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.210
 train to allow all 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.090
 travelers interested in traveling so the 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.210
 Friday or Monday is also our 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.640
 second duty to our customers 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.900
 it is to inform them the most upstream 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.369
 possible so that they can 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.269
 make arrangements for 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.269
 organize their trip 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.410
 under which we undertake a 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.080
 twenty or so shipyards lasting about 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.210
 a hundred workers who are going to 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.650
 relay day and night 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.610
 these works make it possible to maintain 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.610
 line performance 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.660
 the relaxation hall is relatively 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.730
 obsolete and asks for a realization 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.530
 overall for that we did not ask 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.240
 scaffolding on the entire 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.890
 under the front of the hall to be able to 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.930
 renovate the only way is to cut the 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.310
 all the votes that the work of the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.500
 hall tents in the past three 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.640
 phases first phase setting up 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.940
 scaffolding during the weekend of 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.250
 Easter 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.830
 the second phase the replacement of the 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.850
 roof the third phase the implementation 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.850
 painting of the carved 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.270
 then we proceed to the replacement of 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.400
 kilometers of rails between train stations 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.980
 nice jumps and toury because there 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.210
 had too many defects on the rail and 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.210
 causes too much maintenance 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.420
 this weekend we are replacing 4 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.220
 switches turnouts there are two 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.750
 constituents of a voice device that 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.280
 age inescapably 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.930
 it's the cross it has in 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.549
 the occurrence are wooden and the ballast 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.920
 and so big stones become 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.509
 pebbles smaller there have friable 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.090
 so that means that the holding of 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.590
 the voice apparatus in its place becomes 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.820
 more and more difficult we have 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.740
 interrupted all the circulations 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.570
 for operations it allows us to 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.039
 earn a lot of security and not 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.789
 disrupt only once 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.789
 the traveler 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.640
 the operation consists in affixing a 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.370
 gateway to delete so a 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.710
 pedestrian crossing that was 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.390
 become very dangerous so rail network 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.190
 de France and the SNCF wanted to delete 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.120
 for a nose more comfort of safety 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.010
 at the level of the people of local residents in 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.130
 48 hours we have to change several 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.710
 referrals renew several 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.810
 kilometers of track delete five 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.030
 level crossings made depends on August 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.650
 so to succeed this challenge the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.890
 teams will relay themselves day and night on 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.540
 the field here so we'll do on 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.520
 a small part of the big projects 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.560
 which are organized on the occasion of 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.260
 this 48 hour break there are three 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.970
 successive bridges that allow the 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.310
 railroad to span three arms of 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.830
 the indre and thus redesign 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.090
 it is the challenge that is given 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.410
 the company she has an imperative 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.580
 Monday 13 hours it is necessary that the through 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.580
 new ones are moving on this path 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.090
 today it is an operation of 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.120
 renewal of five crossings 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.530
 four branches schumann and a water tjs 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.480
 the difficulty is that we have a lapse of 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.890
 time that is pretty small for everything 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.050
 remove do the earthworks and 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.310
 bring the devices in and put them back in 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.060
 working condition for Monday 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.970
 it's zero there must be thirty 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.700
 of people from private enterprise and 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.170
 we the agents of the way the agents 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.970
 catenary the objects under the greenhouses on 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.390
 must be about twenty staff to 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.060
 a roll 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.100
 this operation will be renewed in 2013 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.959
 since in total five weekends 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.209
 particular said weekend punch 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.310
 are scheduled the following weekend and the 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.720
 weekend of ascension and the others 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.380
 weekends are rather positioned at 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.750
 the autumn the weekend of 13 14 15 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.739
 September weekend of November 23 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.739
 November and 30 November
