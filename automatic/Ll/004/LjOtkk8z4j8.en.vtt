00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
we're going to bake this in a preheated

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.309 
we're going to bake this in a preheated
350-degree<00:05:49.669> oven<00:05:49.939> for<00:05:50.270> 30<00:05:50.659> to<00:05:50.869> 35<00:05:51.259> minutes

cooling rack for at least an hour to let

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.230 
cooling rack for at least an hour to let
them<00:06:05.509> cool<00:06:05.689> before<00:06:05.749> we<00:06:06.110> slice<00:06:06.379> them<00:06:06.939> our<00:06:07.939> lemon

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
them cool before we slice them our lemon

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.059 
them cool before we slice them our lemon
bars<00:06:08.419> have<00:06:08.569> cooled<00:06:08.839> for<00:06:09.050> an<00:06:09.139> hour<00:06:09.349> and<00:06:09.800> I'm

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:10.069 
bars have cooled for an hour and I'm

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:12.040 
bars have cooled for an hour and I'm
going<00:06:10.399> to<00:06:10.460> slice<00:06:10.909> them<00:06:11.210> and<00:06:11.539> put<00:06:11.809> them<00:06:11.839> on<00:06:11.990> a

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:17.089 
them in 1-inch squares this is really

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:20.469 
them in 1-inch squares this is really
rich<00:06:17.449> so<00:06:17.899> you<00:06:18.800> don't<00:06:18.949> really<00:06:19.039> need<00:06:19.219> a<00:06:19.309> lot<00:06:19.520> so
