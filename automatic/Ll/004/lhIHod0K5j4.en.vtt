00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.210 
striker and Falcao I no can do it
definitely<00:05:09.140> but<00:05:10.140> I<00:05:10.170> think<00:05:10.470> with<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.770> factor

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
definitely but I think with the factor

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.820 
definitely but I think with the factor
that<00:05:11.610> if<00:05:11.760> we<00:05:11.880> get<00:05:12.060> our<00:05:12.240> girl<00:05:12.450> now<00:05:12.690> your<00:05:13.440> cock<00:05:13.650> we

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
that if we get our girl now your cock we

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.920 
that if we get our girl now your cock we
would<00:05:13.980> also<00:05:14.160> have<00:05:14.310> loads<00:05:14.640> of<00:05:14.730> time<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.210> to<00:05:15.660> grow

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
would also have loads of time to to grow

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.670 
would also have loads of time to to grow
