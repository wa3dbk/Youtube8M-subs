00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
growing a variety of baby lettuces they

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.059 
growing a variety of baby lettuces they
started<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.450> mix<00:02:15.629> in<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.900> European<00:02:16.470> salad<00:02:16.860> green

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
to adapt mosh to hydroponic growing and
