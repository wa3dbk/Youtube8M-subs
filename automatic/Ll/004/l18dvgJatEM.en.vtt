anywhere<00:02:37.870> near<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.140> bottom<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:38.530> mean<00:02:38.709> we<00:02:39.040> knew

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
anywhere near the bottom I mean we knew

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.820 
anywhere near the bottom I mean we knew
we<00:02:39.340> could<00:02:39.520> get<00:02:39.670> here<00:02:39.910> without<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.209> run<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.709> there

what<00:03:24.070> is<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.340> about<00:03:24.459> this<00:03:24.790> source<00:03:25.060> that's

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
what is it about this source that's

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.699 
what is it about this source that's
different<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:26.280> think<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.930> one<00:03:29.080> has<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.320> say

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
different I think that one has to say

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.280 
different I think that one has to say
he's<00:03:29.950> about<00:03:30.280> as<00:03:30.580> gorgeous<00:03:31.269> looking<00:03:31.900> horse<00:03:32.080> you

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
he's about as gorgeous looking horse you

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.900 
he's about as gorgeous looking horse you
never<00:03:32.590> see

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
never see

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.240 
never see
and<00:03:34.210> he<00:03:34.630> knows<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.140> so<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.680> old<00:03:35.860> principle

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
and he knows it so the old principle

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.710 
and he knows it so the old principle
that<00:03:36.340> if<00:03:36.460> they<00:03:36.580> look<00:03:36.760> good<00:03:36.970> they<00:03:37.030> probably<00:03:37.360> are

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
that if they look good they probably are

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.690 
that if they look good they probably are
