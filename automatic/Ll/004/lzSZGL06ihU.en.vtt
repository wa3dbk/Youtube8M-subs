you<00:00:22.350> Henrik<00:00:22.619> Zetterberg<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.100> see<00:00:23.250> here

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
you Henrik Zetterberg and see here

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.120 
you Henrik Zetterberg and see here
Skeeter<00:00:24.090> classified<00:00:24.510> defense<00:00:24.720> skater<00:00:25.289> plus

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
Skeeter classified defense skater plus

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.920 
Skeeter classified defense skater plus
for<00:00:26.369> shooting<00:00:26.699> both<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.449> these<00:00:27.510> cards<00:00:27.840> are

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
for shooting both of these cards are

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.380 
for shooting both of these cards are
bronze<00:00:28.140> actually<00:00:28.920> had<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> plus-7<00:00:29.880> goalie<00:00:30.090> or

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
bronze actually had a plus-7 goalie or

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.060 
bronze actually had a plus-7 goalie or
so<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> plus<00:00:30.900> seven<00:00:31.199> high<00:00:31.320> for<00:00:31.590> Jonathan<00:00:31.920> Quick

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
so I plus seven high for Jonathan Quick

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.010 
so I plus seven high for Jonathan Quick
and<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:32.850> also<00:00:33.059> bronze<00:00:33.480> cards<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:33.989> I

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
and that was also bronze cards so I

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.450 
and that was also bronze cards so I
would<00:00:34.440> assume<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.770> would've<00:00:35.010> been<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.130> silver

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
would assume that would've been a silver

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.340 
would assume that would've been a silver
card<00:00:35.700> something<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.329> range<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:36.870> that's

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
card something in that range but that's

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.319 
card something in that range but that's
also<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.739> bronze<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.520> guys<00:00:38.640> remember<00:00:38.760> NHL

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
also a bronze if you guys remember NHL

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.540 
also a bronze if you guys remember NHL
13<00:00:39.590> captain<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.710> assistant<00:00:40.770> captain<00:00:41.340> courage

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
13 captain and assistant captain courage

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.220 
13 captain and assistant captain courage
you<00:00:41.640> get<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.910> rookie<00:00:42.180> packs<00:00:42.420> which<00:00:42.809> makes<00:00:43.050> me

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
you get in rookie packs which makes me

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.720 
you get in rookie packs which makes me
believe<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.770> those<00:00:44.160> are<00:00:44.309> probably<00:00:44.489> any

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
believe that those are probably any

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.430 
believe that those are probably any
bronze<00:00:44.969> as<00:00:45.120> well<00:00:45.270> obviously<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.379> not

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
bronze as well obviously it's not

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.740 
bronze as well obviously it's not

confirmed just you know my guess we're

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.970 
confirmed just you know my guess we're
you<00:00:48.840> guys<00:00:48.960> gonna<00:00:49.140> show<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.350> Stephen<00:00:49.680> camps

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
you guys gonna show you Stephen camps

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.069 
you guys gonna show you Stephen camps
Steven<00:00:50.489> Stamkos<00:00:50.910> sorry<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.809> see

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
Steven Stamkos sorry as you can see

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.439 
Steven Stamkos sorry as you can see
three<00:00:52.710> sided<00:00:53.010> right<00:00:53.250> wing<00:00:53.399> cards<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:53.910> three

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
three sided right wing cards all three

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.340 
three sided right wing cards all three
of<00:00:54.480> these<00:00:54.570> are<00:00:54.719> bronze<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.289> actually

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
of these are bronze so this is actually

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.410 
of these are bronze so this is actually
really<00:00:55.590> big<00:00:55.860> deal<00:00:56.070> guys<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.059> remember

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
really big deal guys if you remember

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.090 
really big deal guys if you remember
position<00:00:57.960> cards<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> last<00:00:58.530> game<00:00:58.710> are<00:00:58.890> very

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
position cards in the last game are very

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.920 
position cards in the last game are very
expensive<00:00:59.430> that's<00:01:00.270> because<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:00.600> are<00:01:00.660> rare

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
expensive that's because they are rare

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.900 
expensive that's because they are rare
so<00:01:01.199> they're<00:01:01.469> harder<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:02.039> also<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.579> know<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
so they're harder to get also you know a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.310 
so they're harder to get also you know a
lot<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.239> people<00:01:03.329> wanted<00:01:03.899> them<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
lot of people wanted them for the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.020 
lot of people wanted them for the
chemistry<00:01:04.680> purposes<00:01:05.070> now<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:05.610> their<00:01:05.760> bronze

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
chemistry purposes now if their bronze

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.460 
chemistry purposes now if their bronze
cards<00:01:06.420> you're<00:01:06.510> gonna<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.720> getting<00:01:06.840> them<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> lot

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
cards you're gonna be getting them a lot

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.840 
cards you're gonna be getting them a lot
easier<00:01:07.650> because<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.490> able<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:08.760> them

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
easier because you be able to get them

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.830 
easier because you be able to get them
in<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> bronze<00:01:09.180> pack<00:01:09.450> which<00:01:09.600> will<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
in a bronze pack which will be the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.570 
in a bronze pack which will be the
cheapest<00:01:10.110> pack<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.740> i'll<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.010> big<00:01:11.310> toll<00:01:11.549> on

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
cheapest pack so i'll have a big toll on

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340 
cheapest pack so i'll have a big toll on
their<00:01:11.820> price<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> market<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.170> links

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
their price in the market the links

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.690 
their price in the market the links
actually<00:01:13.619> might<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> good<00:01:14.340> thing<00:01:14.400> because

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
actually might be a good thing because

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.670 
actually might be a good thing because
you<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> lot<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.270> people<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.750> actually<00:01:15.930> get

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
you know a lot of people to actually get

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.870 
you know a lot of people to actually get
better<00:01:16.860> chemistry<00:01:17.100> because<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:17.820> to

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
better chemistry because not going to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.850 
better chemistry because not going to
