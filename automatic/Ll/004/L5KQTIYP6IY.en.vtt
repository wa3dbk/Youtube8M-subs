00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
out horrible emissions so when you

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.070 
out horrible emissions so when you
replace<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.070> those<00:01:17.340> old<00:01:17.610> crown<00:01:18.030> vics<00:01:18.360> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
replace one of those old crown vics that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.890 
replace one of those old crown vics that
goes<00:01:19.560> through<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> full<00:01:20.580> tank<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.030> gas<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.630> one

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
goes through a full tank of gas in one

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.770 
goes through a full tank of gas in one
shift<00:01:22.610> you're<00:01:23.610> making<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> huge<00:01:24.180> difference<00:01:24.390> on

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
shift you're making a huge difference on
