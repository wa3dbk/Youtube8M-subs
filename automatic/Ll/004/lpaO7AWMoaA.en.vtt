00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:03.939
 I heard one more country 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.099
 Look for this strike 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.249
 Anyone who likes Omuta takes it 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:14.799
 Van Halen losing it 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.730
 Search of ev1 Kramer This is a carrying model 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.650
 Fake cousins 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.849
 This is a clip made of claymore made in Japan 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.460
 It runs out like old days 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.630
 Spo 93 people got around with his second hand guitar 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.450
 Did 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.800
 This strike is 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.420
 Own 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.820
 Or original 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.250
 Because it is not made in the game to the real thing 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.250
 Another withdrawal ship 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.300
 Well like this 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.640
 Already 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.460
 I've been doing it for a long time to Eastern Europe for Yacco 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.660
 Such as repainting 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.820
 Well, this is something about this guitar but it's like that impression 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.260
 Mon I look at this guitar 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.750
 I want to play a guitar 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.750
 I do not get nervous with the spray 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.970
 It has been realized for a long time 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.480
 Said that 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.030
 I want to do it 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.380
 Well this guitar is easy to pull anyway 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.110
 It really flies 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.350
 It is already considered that this is flexible and positive 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.070
 It is easy to come 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.070
 This sports Nitto Medic's first joint part of joining 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.370
 It's hot to get married and for the moment 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.790
 I'm cutting off a major advertiser company for doubt now 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.980
 I know something even though this part has not been shaved 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.560
 space 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 The true meaning of this method 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.570
 This scale 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.110
 in the meantime 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.400
 is increasing 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.900
 The age of thinking that you are leaving the port you are making 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.550
 Thoughts 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.520
 It is a comic of a needle 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.520
 This is the continent now 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.500
 It should be noted that this pickup 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.790
 It is 1pickup 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.030
 I don't know, but as a result of the Tankan 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.149
 Though 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.459
 This is a part of you guys, too 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:14.799
 Repeat for many years 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.799
 It is sluggish until this 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.329
 It feels like a real thing 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.859
 What 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.589
 This next 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:29.249
 Bento 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.319
 together 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.759
 To be 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.259
 Anyways 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:35.859
 If you already use a specialist 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.869
 Stop the plant and finish the state with Fujitsu's straight Koji 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:40.509
 The 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.509
 I was inside 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.619
 You did it 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:50.849
 Helping those who are in the country of Cuba who is in the process of remodeling 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.849
 I do not think 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:02.679
 The company 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.659
 Duncan's gdp to the bill of this plan 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.659
 I tend to use satellite airplanes, but I'm using this 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.439
 Probably an optical pickup 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.040
 I think some people will be dismantled but my grandson's Duncan 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.499
 It's been a while later, but the first one is definitely 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.779
 It is more than correct 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.499
 So much of this other world 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:28.069
 Even if you touch the paper cup, you can see the difference well 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.069
 Takeda This project is another Vickers 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.359
 Publish api 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.619
 I lost before entering 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.619
 The tree is here 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:45.239
 In this person
