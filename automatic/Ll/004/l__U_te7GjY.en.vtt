00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.159 
like you see on mouse's before when this
coin<00:05:36.260> this<00:05:36.830> gets<00:05:37.130> in<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.400> way<00:05:37.580> a<00:05:37.610> lot<00:05:37.910> and<00:05:38.180> this

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
coin this gets in the way a lot and this

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.560 
coin this gets in the way a lot and this
is<00:05:39.410> like<00:05:39.680> a<00:05:39.710> it's<00:05:40.160> like<00:05:40.370> a<00:05:40.490> cord<00:05:40.849> almost<00:05:41.330> this

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
is like a it's like a cord almost this

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.469 
is like a it's like a cord almost this
is<00:05:41.630> a<00:05:41.690> material<00:05:41.960> cord<00:05:42.500> so<00:05:43.400> obviously<00:05:43.849> it<00:05:44.030> is<00:05:44.240> a

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
is a material cord so obviously it is a

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.839 
is a material cord so obviously it is a
lot<00:05:44.990> more<00:05:45.020> flexible<00:05:45.320> and<00:05:45.919> you<00:05:46.010> like<00:05:46.520> even

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
lot more flexible and you like even

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:48.339 
lot more flexible and you like even
together<00:05:47.180> look<00:05:47.389> at<00:05:47.419> that<00:05:47.599> and<00:05:47.780> just<00:05:47.870> move<00:05:48.169> it

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
together look at that and just move it

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.010 
together look at that and just move it
around<00:05:48.410> there<00:05:48.800> and<00:05:49.789> it<00:05:49.940> just<00:05:50.150> moves<00:05:50.720> really

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
around there and it just moves really

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.320 
around there and it just moves really
freely<00:05:51.410> so<00:05:51.830> I'm<00:05:52.340> really<00:05:52.610> looking<00:05:52.820> there<00:05:53.210> look

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
freely so I'm really looking there look

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330 
freely so I'm really looking there look
at<00:05:53.419> this<00:05:53.570> mouse<00:05:53.780> so<00:05:54.050> far<00:05:54.289> to<00:05:54.470> be<00:05:54.560> honest<00:05:54.770> you've

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
at this mouse so far to be honest you've

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.909 
at this mouse so far to be honest you've
got<00:05:55.430> USB<00:05:55.880> input<00:05:56.419> to<00:05:56.539> plug<00:05:56.720> it<00:05:56.900> in<00:05:57.020> as<00:05:57.139> well

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
got USB input to plug it in as well

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.700 
got USB input to plug it in as well
I<00:05:57.949> think<00:05:58.460> the<00:05:58.550> cord<00:05:58.760> is<00:05:58.940> 2<00:05:59.120> meters<00:05:59.479> long<00:05:59.710> which

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
I think the cord is 2 meters long which

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.110 
I think the cord is 2 meters long which
is<00:06:00.740> quite<00:06:01.039> a<00:06:01.070> lot<00:06:01.280> really<00:06:01.580> because<00:06:01.880> a<00:06:01.910> lot<00:06:02.090> of

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
is quite a lot really because a lot of

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.930 
is quite a lot really because a lot of
