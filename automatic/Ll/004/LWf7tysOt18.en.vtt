00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
pull the grit and grime and dirt so you

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.970 
pull the grit and grime and dirt so you
can<00:02:45.460> come<00:02:45.580> over<00:02:45.610> here<00:02:45.910> from<00:02:46.150> look<00:02:47.110> here<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.860> as

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
of the Shane and not the in the links

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.160 
of the Shane and not the in the links
the<00:04:32.100> outer<00:04:32.280> links<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:33.390> it<00:04:33.690> but<00:04:33.900> what<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.110> might

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
the outer links of it but what you might

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.500 
the outer links of it but what you might
do<00:04:34.290> is<00:04:34.410> get<00:04:34.560> a<00:04:34.590> little<00:04:34.980> bit<00:04:35.130> in<00:04:35.340> each<00:04:35.610> one<00:04:36.390> of

do is get a little bit in each one of

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.930 
do is get a little bit in each one of

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
those pins so usually I do it's a pedal

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.470 
those pins so usually I do it's a pedal
round<00:04:39.270> two<00:04:40.260> or<00:04:40.290> three<00:04:40.590> times<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:42.180> what<00:04:42.360> this

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
round two or three times and what this

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.840 
round two or three times and what this
is<00:04:42.600> going<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.840> do<00:04:43.130> it's<00:04:44.130> going<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.460> pull<00:04:44.730> all

should<00:05:57.630> be<00:05:57.690> set<00:05:58.050> it's<00:05:58.290> great<00:05:58.560> so<00:05:58.710> like<00:05:58.800> I<00:05:58.860> said

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
should be set it's great so like I said

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.740 
should be set it's great so like I said
that<00:05:59.100> lubricates<00:05:59.670> it<00:05:59.850> also<00:06:00.030> cleans<00:06:00.450> it<00:06:00.660> with

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
that lubricates it also cleans it with

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.300 
that lubricates it also cleans it with
that<00:06:00.870> technique<00:06:01.260> where<00:06:01.680> you're<00:06:01.800> on<00:06:01.830> the<00:06:02.010> sides

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
that technique where you're on the sides

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.220 
that technique where you're on the sides
and<00:06:02.580> then<00:06:02.670> cleans<00:06:02.970> it<00:06:03.210> this<00:06:03.450> mixture<00:06:03.840> is<00:06:04.020> not

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
and then cleans it this mixture is not

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.320 
and then cleans it this mixture is not
any<00:06:04.470> excess<00:06:04.890> oil<00:06:05.100> in<00:06:05.370> there<00:06:05.550> to<00:06:05.670> pick<00:06:05.850> up<00:06:06.060> a<00:06:06.150> lot

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
any excess oil in there to pick up a lot

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.110 
any excess oil in there to pick up a lot
of<00:06:06.360> dirt<00:06:06.660> a<00:06:07.500> lot<00:06:07.950> of<00:06:08.100> static<00:06:08.400> electricity<00:06:08.730> will

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
of dirt a lot of static electricity will

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.540 
of dirt a lot of static electricity will
pick<00:06:09.330> up<00:06:09.510> a<00:06:09.630> ton<00:06:09.930> of<00:06:09.960> grit<00:06:10.320> and<00:06:10.470> grime<00:06:10.710> and<00:06:11.370> that

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
pick up a ton of grit and grime and that

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.310 
pick up a ton of grit and grime and that
correctly<00:06:11.880> rhyme<00:06:12.150> with<00:06:12.810> dig<00:06:12.990> deeper<00:06:13.290> and

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
correctly rhyme with dig deeper and

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.620 
correctly rhyme with dig deeper and

make a sense to wear out prematurely

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.720 
make a sense to wear out prematurely
have<00:06:18.540> to<00:06:18.690> replace<00:06:18.960> more<00:06:19.170> parts<00:06:19.530> again<00:06:20.220> it's

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
have to replace more parts again it's

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.300 
have to replace more parts again it's
more<00:06:20.850> expensive<00:06:21.440> yeah<00:06:22.500> proper<00:06:22.980> buy<00:06:23.100> beans

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
more expensive yeah proper buy beans

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.420 
more expensive yeah proper buy beans
like<00:06:23.580> that<00:06:24.770> it's<00:06:25.770> something<00:06:25.950> that<00:06:26.220> that

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
like that it's something that that

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.850 
like that it's something that that
everyone<00:06:26.790> should<00:06:27.030> know<00:06:27.410> regular<00:06:28.410> basis

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
everyone should know regular basis

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.670 
everyone should know regular basis
usually<00:06:29.760> every<00:06:30.150> couple<00:06:30.510> ride<00:06:30.690> you<00:06:31.410> want<00:06:31.560> to
