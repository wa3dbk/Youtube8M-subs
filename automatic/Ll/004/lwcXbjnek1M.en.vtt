we go me see if I can find any other
spots<00:04:14.010> up<00:04:14.250> here<00:04:15.799> because<00:04:16.799> there<00:04:16.950> actually

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
spots up here because there actually

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.620 
spots up here because there actually
should<00:04:17.310> be<00:04:17.519> some<00:04:17.760> other<00:04:17.880> spots<00:04:18.180> up<00:04:18.359> here<00:04:18.390> like

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
should be some other spots up here like

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.420 
should be some other spots up here like
some<00:04:18.810> jump<00:04:19.169> spots<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.650> stuff<00:04:19.769> if<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:19.979> remember

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
some jump spots and stuff if I remember

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.140 
some jump spots and stuff if I remember
correctly<00:04:20.989> yeah<00:04:21.989> like<00:04:22.229> for<00:04:22.500> example<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:24.060> can

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
correctly yeah like for example you can

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.760 
correctly yeah like for example you can
get<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.300> ton<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.630> speed<00:04:25.020> going<00:04:25.050> down<00:04:25.470> into<00:04:25.680> this

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
get a ton of speed going down into this

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.890 
get a ton of speed going down into this
area<00:04:26.099> and<00:04:26.280> then<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.030> can<00:04:27.150> shoot<00:04:27.510> out<00:04:27.660> on<00:04:27.810> the

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
area and then you can shoot out on the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.110 
area and then you can shoot out on the
other<00:04:28.020> side<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.740> actually<00:04:29.370> just<00:04:29.700> jump<00:04:30.060> over

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
other side and actually just jump over

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.020 
other side and actually just jump over
these<00:04:30.330> little<00:04:30.599> pits<00:04:30.840> almost<00:04:31.349> and<00:04:31.820> then<00:04:32.820> get<00:04:33.000> a

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
these little pits almost and then get a

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.089 
these little pits almost and then get a
bunch<00:04:33.300> of<00:04:33.390> speed<00:04:33.630> head<00:04:33.960> back<00:04:34.260> down<00:04:34.560> into<00:04:34.919> the

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
bunch of speed head back down into the

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:36.680 
bunch of speed head back down into the
muddy<00:04:35.340> area<00:04:35.700> it's<00:04:35.849> just<00:04:36.030> like<00:04:36.180> it's<00:04:36.419> just<00:04:36.479> a

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
muddy area it's just like it's just a

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.589 
muddy area it's just like it's just a
really<00:04:36.990> cool<00:04:37.140> area<00:04:37.320> um<00:04:37.820> for<00:04:38.820> not<00:04:39.270> only<00:04:39.390> for

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
really cool area um for not only for

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.029 
really cool area um for not only for

let me see if I can get up here one more

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.210 
let me see if I can get up here one more
time<00:05:10.940> OOP

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
time OOP

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
you can you've got a locking diffs and

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.670 
you can you've got a locking diffs and
you<00:05:22.110> got<00:05:22.289> all-wheel<00:05:22.650> drive<00:05:24.080> well<00:05:25.080> I<00:05:25.110> think<00:05:25.229> I

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
you got all-wheel drive well I think I

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
you got all-wheel drive well I think I
ain't<00:05:25.830> get<00:05:26.010> enough<00:05:26.220> speed<00:05:26.550> so<00:05:28.220> dang<00:05:29.220> I<00:05:29.370> wonder

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
ain't get enough speed so dang I wonder

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
ain't get enough speed so dang I wonder
if<00:05:29.789> I'll<00:05:29.849> be<00:05:29.970> able<00:05:30.060> to<00:05:30.150> get<00:05:30.270> through<00:05:30.479> the<00:05:30.539> water
