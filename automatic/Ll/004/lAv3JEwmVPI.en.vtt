letter if your paper size is not listed

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.500 
letter if your paper size is not listed
you<00:00:27.770> can<00:00:27.890> go<00:00:28.130> into<00:00:28.250> more<00:00:28.610> paper<00:00:28.850> sizes<00:00:29.360> and

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
you can go into more paper sizes and

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.870 
you can go into more paper sizes and
then<00:00:30.260> there<00:00:30.380> are<00:00:30.530> a<00:00:30.710> few<00:00:31.070> more<00:00:31.220> paper<00:00:31.610> sizes

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
then there are a few more paper sizes

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.990 
then there are a few more paper sizes
within<00:00:32.570> here<00:00:32.930> now<00:00:33.530> they<00:00:33.829> are<00:00:34.100> driven<00:00:34.489> by<00:00:34.789> your

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
within here now they are driven by your

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000 
within here now they are driven by your
printer<00:00:35.420> so<00:00:35.719> if<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:35.899> paper<00:00:36.140> size<00:00:36.440> is<00:00:36.739> not

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
printer so if the paper size is not

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.810 
printer so if the paper size is not
listed<00:00:37.280> there

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
listed there

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.610 
listed there
then<00:00:38.239> it's<00:00:38.450> the<00:00:38.600> printer<00:00:38.989> settings<00:00:39.170> that<00:00:39.500> you

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
then it's the printer settings that you

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.890 
then it's the printer settings that you
need<00:00:39.650> to<00:00:39.980> firstly<00:00:40.400> visit<00:00:40.700> to<00:00:41.000> add<00:00:41.180> that<00:00:41.480> in<00:00:41.690> as

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
need to firstly visit to add that in as

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.300 
need to firstly visit to add that in as
a<00:00:41.960> paper<00:00:42.350> size<00:00:42.680> that<00:00:42.950> the<00:00:43.010> printer

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
a paper size that the printer

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.190 
a paper size that the printer
effectively<00:00:43.820> can<00:00:43.970> handle<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:44.899> I'm<00:00:44.989> going<00:00:45.170> to

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
effectively can handle so I'm going to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.270 
effectively can handle so I'm going to
leave<00:00:45.440> minor<00:00:45.739> later<00:00:46.989> okay<00:00:47.989> now<00:00:48.890> as<00:00:48.980> well<00:00:49.160> as

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
leave minor later okay now as well as

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.130 
leave minor later okay now as well as
being<00:00:49.460> able<00:00:49.579> to<00:00:49.670> set<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.120> paper<00:00:50.329> size<00:00:50.660> to<00:00:50.930> fit

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
being able to set the paper size to fit

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.900 
being able to set the paper size to fit
the<00:00:51.170> printer<00:00:51.620> we<00:00:52.040> can<00:00:52.250> also<00:00:52.399> control

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
the printer we can also control

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.270 
the printer we can also control
orientation<00:00:53.840> now<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.350> orientation<00:00:54.559> options

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
orientation now the orientation options

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.610 
orientation now the orientation options
really<00:00:55.460> are<00:00:55.610> just<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.270> portrait<00:00:57.140> or<00:00:57.320> landscape

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620

the<00:01:00.200> other<00:01:00.320> is<00:01:00.620> really<00:01:01.040> determined<00:01:01.190> by<00:01:01.940> number

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
the other is really determined by number

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.600 
the other is really determined by number
of<00:01:02.450> columns<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.230> layout<00:01:03.440> so<00:01:04.189> I<00:01:04.460> would

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
of columns and the layout so I would

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.039 
of columns and the layout so I would
personally<00:01:05.000> always<00:01:05.509> go<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:05.689> Print<00:01:05.990> Preview

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
personally always go to Print Preview

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.469 
personally always go to Print Preview
just<00:01:06.920> have<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.159> look<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.850> think<00:01:08.180> well<00:01:08.360> that's

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
just have a look and think well that's

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.139 
just have a look and think well that's
currently<00:01:08.959> portrait<00:01:09.469> and<00:01:09.759> as<00:01:10.759> I<00:01:10.880> go<00:01:11.030> across

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
currently portrait and as I go across

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.660 
currently portrait and as I go across
there's<00:01:11.840> quite<00:01:12.139> a<00:01:12.170> few<00:01:12.259> columns<00:01:12.770> is<00:01:13.009> that

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
there's quite a few columns is that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.239 
there's quite a few columns is that
likely<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.240> fit<00:01:14.569> better<00:01:14.780> in<00:01:15.109> landscape<00:01:15.649> well

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:16.249 
likely to fit better in landscape well

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:18.770 
likely to fit better in landscape well
let's<00:01:16.399> try<00:01:16.579> out<00:01:16.789> we<00:01:17.179> go<00:01:17.270> back

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
let's try out we go back

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.260 
let's try out we go back
orientation<00:01:19.080> landscape<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.190> then<00:01:21.060> come<00:01:21.240> back

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
orientation landscape and then come back

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.840 
orientation landscape and then come back
into<00:01:21.810> print<00:01:22.110> preview<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.580> see<00:01:23.700> we

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
into print preview and you can see we

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.180 
into print preview and you can see we
get<00:01:24.000> more<00:01:24.270> columns<00:01:24.720> across<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.110> top<00:01:25.320> still

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
get more columns across the top still

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.280 
get more columns across the top still
doesn't<00:01:26.490> fit<00:01:26.640> everything<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.840> does<00:01:28.049> fit

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
doesn't fit everything but it does fit

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.780 
doesn't fit everything but it does fit
more<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.270> then<00:01:30.270> back

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
more and then back

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.280 
more and then back
as<00:01:31.940> well<00:01:32.090> as<00:01:32.210> been<00:01:32.360> able<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:32.720> control<00:01:33.140> the

it<00:02:32.360> will<00:02:32.480> quite<00:02:32.750> happily<00:02:32.810> fit<00:02:33.230> on<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.440> PDF<00:02:33.770> but

it will quite happily fit on the PDF but

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.070 
it will quite happily fit on the PDF but
then<00:02:34.489> thinking<00:02:34.880> longer<00:02:35.209> term<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.660> when

then thinking longer term and when

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.420 
then thinking longer term and when
printing<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.560> PDF<00:02:36.890> will<00:02:37.040> have<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.220> same

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
printing the PDF will have the same

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.920 
printing the PDF will have the same
issues<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.790> text<00:02:38.269> has<00:02:38.360> gone<00:02:38.510> right<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.900> the

issues the text has gone right to the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.930 
issues the text has gone right to the
edges<00:02:39.140> so<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.100> advisable<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.700> leave<00:02:40.790> a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
edges so it is advisable to leave a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.090 
edges so it is advisable to leave a
little<00:02:41.180> bit<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.510> margin<00:02:41.810> just<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:42.739> that<00:02:42.920> any

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
little bit of margin just so that any

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.800 
little bit of margin just so that any

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
printer could handle what you're sending

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.660 
printer could handle what you're sending
to<00:02:44.959> it<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.230> also<00:02:45.800> noticed<00:02:46.190> in<00:02:46.250> here<00:02:46.400> there's<00:02:46.610> an

to it I also noticed in here there's an

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.130 
to it I also noticed in here there's an

coming<00:02:50.030> up<00:02:50.209> short<00:02:50.510> links<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:50.840> we'll<00:02:50.959> leave

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
coming up short links so we'll leave

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.560 
coming up short links so we'll leave
those<00:02:51.350> by<00:02:51.560> use<00:02:51.769> as<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.160> default<00:02:52.580> but<00:02:53.299> we<00:02:53.330> can

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
those by use as the default but we can

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.400 
those by use as the default but we can
control<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.080> other<00:02:54.230> four

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
actually gone closer you can see the top

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.200 
actually gone closer you can see the top
is<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.710> lot<00:03:02.010> closer<00:03:02.280> at<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.580> bottom<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.060> lot

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
usually by shrinking your margins you

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.400 
usually by shrinking your margins you
can<00:03:07.590> get<00:03:07.770> more<00:03:07.980> columns<00:03:08.460> onto<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> page<00:03:09.410> but

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
can get more columns onto a page but

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.250 
can get more columns onto a page but
back<00:03:10.650> then<00:03:11.550> we<00:03:12.000> come<00:03:12.210> to<00:03:12.240> some<00:03:12.570> real<00:03:12.840> powerful

however<00:03:23.430> instead<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.090> doing<00:03:24.330> that<00:03:24.360> we<00:03:24.780> can

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
however instead of doing that we can

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.140 
however instead of doing that we can
actually<00:03:25.050> control<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.920> scale<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.880> print

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
actually control the scale of the print

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.420 
actually control the scale of the print
now<00:03:27.930> you'll<00:03:28.080> see<00:03:28.260> this<00:03:28.410> is<00:03:28.560> called<00:03:28.740> scale<00:03:29.220> to

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
now you'll see this is called scale to

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.160 
now you'll see this is called scale to
fit<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.970> it's<00:03:30.270> on<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.510> page<00:03:30.720> layout<00:03:31.140> ribbon

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
fit and it's on the page layout ribbon

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.920 
fit and it's on the page layout ribbon
now<00:03:32.040> we<00:03:32.160> can<00:03:32.310> adjust<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.790> scale<00:03:33.090> here<00:03:33.480> from

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
now we can adjust the scale here from

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.660 
now we can adjust the scale here from
100<00:03:34.230> percent<00:03:34.470> which<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.860> current<00:03:35.190> zoom

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
100 percent which is the current zoom

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.210 
100 percent which is the current zoom

you'll<00:03:38.550> notice<00:03:38.820> how<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:38.970> go<00:03:39.090> down<00:03:39.240> to<00:03:39.360> 95<00:03:39.780> and

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
you'll notice how I go down to 95 and

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.440 
you'll notice how I go down to 95 and
nothing<00:03:40.290> appears<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.650> happen<00:03:40.740> on<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.160> screen

preview<00:03:49.970> you'll<00:03:50.970> see<00:03:51.210> that<00:03:51.360> we're<00:03:51.510> printing

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
preview you'll see that we're printing

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.620

actually makes more fit on the page

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.250 
actually makes more fit on the page
obviously<00:03:57.240> you<00:03:57.540> have<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.690> be<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.840> little<00:03:58.020> bit

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
obviously you have to be a little bit

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.020 
obviously you have to be a little bit
careful<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.100> don't<00:03:59.310> drop<00:03:59.610> that<00:03:59.640> scale

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
careful that you don't drop that scale

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.690 
careful that you don't drop that scale
too<00:04:00.300> far<00:04:00.570> to<00:04:00.870> make<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.170> text<00:04:01.500> illegible<00:04:02.070> but

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
too far to make the text illegible but

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.280 
too far to make the text illegible but
it<00:04:02.760> will<00:04:02.910> go<00:04:03.090> down<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.570> down<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:03.750> down<00:04:03.959> and

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
it will go down and down and down and

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.680 
it will go down and down and down and
you<00:04:05.100> don't<00:04:05.280> need<00:04:05.520> to<00:04:05.670> go<00:04:05.790> down<00:04:06.000> in<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.240> 5<00:04:06.480> so

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
you don't need to go down in the 5 so

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.210 
you don't need to go down in the 5 so
it's<00:04:06.840> offering<00:04:07.200> here<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.560> could<00:04:07.740> click<00:04:07.950> in

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
it's offering here you could click in

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.180 
it's offering here you could click in
and<00:04:08.459> type<00:04:08.880> a<00:04:09.090> more<00:04:09.450> exact<00:04:09.840> amount<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.470> might

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
and type a more exact amount you might

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.640 
and type a more exact amount you might
think<00:04:11.430> 62<00:04:11.910> percent<00:04:12.240> is<00:04:12.360> good<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.780> type<00:04:13.020> 62

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
think 62 percent is good so you type 62

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.880 
think 62 percent is good so you type 62
in<00:04:13.800> and<00:04:13.980> return<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.940> accept<00:04:15.270> that<00:04:15.510> 62<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.260> then

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
in and return to accept that 62 and then

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.060 
in and return to accept that 62 and then
in<00:04:17.010> print<00:04:17.250> preview<00:04:17.280> you're<00:04:17.970> then<00:04:18.120> at<00:04:18.209> 62%

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
in print preview you're then at 62%

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.710 
in print preview you're then at 62%
notice<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.250> as<00:04:20.430> we<00:04:20.760> are<00:04:20.940> reducing<00:04:21.690> that

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
notice that as we are reducing that

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.200 
notice that as we are reducing that
scale<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.230> fit<00:04:22.620> we<00:04:23.070> are<00:04:23.130> reducing<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.940> number

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
scale to fit we are reducing the number

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.000 
scale to fit we are reducing the number
of<00:04:24.270> required<00:04:24.600> pages<00:04:24.990> we're<00:04:25.350> now<00:04:25.440> down<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.620> 4

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
of required pages we're now down to 4

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.670 
of required pages we're now down to 4
and<00:04:26.280> originally<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:26.760> was<00:04:26.880> 12<00:04:27.210> so<00:04:28.110> scale<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:28.560> fit

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
and originally it was 12 so scale to fit

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.810 
and originally it was 12 so scale to fit
is<00:04:28.860> our<00:04:29.010> option<00:04:29.490> here

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
is our option here

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.150 
is our option here
bear<00:04:30.090> in<00:04:30.240> mind<00:04:30.270> also<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:31.020> scale<00:04:31.470> to<00:04:31.680> fit<00:04:31.860> will

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
bear in mind also that scale to fit will

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.620 
bear in mind also that scale to fit will
actually<00:04:32.430> go<00:04:32.550> above<00:04:32.850> a<00:04:32.970> hundred<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.419> doesn't

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
actually go above a hundred it doesn't

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.330 
actually go above a hundred it doesn't
have<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.870> come<00:04:34.020> down<00:04:34.230> you<00:04:34.260> could<00:04:34.530> go<00:04:34.680> up<00:04:34.830> if

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
have to come down you could go up if

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.159 
have to come down you could go up if
you've<00:04:35.580> only<00:04:35.760> got<00:04:36.060> a<00:04:36.180> little<00:04:36.419> bit<00:04:36.540> of<00:04:36.720> text<00:04:37.050> on

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
you've only got a little bit of text on

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.900 
you've only got a little bit of text on
your<00:04:37.440> spreadsheet<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:38.010> may<00:04:38.280> want<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.640> zoom

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
your spreadsheet you may want to zoom

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.150 
your spreadsheet you may want to zoom
off<00:04:39.120> so<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:39.600> they<00:04:39.900> text<00:04:40.320> is<00:04:40.410> larger<00:04:40.919> when

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
off so that they text is larger when

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.250 
off so that they text is larger when
it's<00:04:41.310> printed<00:04:41.520> I<00:04:41.820> could<00:04:42.540> go<00:04:42.660> all<00:04:42.840> up<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.140> other

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
it's printed I could go all up the other

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.590 
it's printed I could go all up the other
way<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.470> can<00:04:43.650> go<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:43.830> 400%<00:04:44.520> actually<00:04:44.940> let's<00:04:45.480> look

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
way I can go to 400% actually let's look

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.730 
way I can go to 400% actually let's look
at<00:04:45.840> 140

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
at 140

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.560 
at 140
and<00:04:48.160> you'll<00:04:48.280> see<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.550> font<00:04:48.820> is<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.090> lot<00:04:49.420> bigger

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
and you'll see the font is a lot bigger

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.470 
and you'll see the font is a lot bigger
and<00:04:49.900> we're<00:04:50.380> using<00:04:50.530> 16<00:04:51.010> pages<00:04:51.400> so<00:04:51.970> in<00:04:52.060> our<00:04:52.210> case

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
and we're using 16 pages so in our case

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.300 
and we're using 16 pages so in our case
it's<00:04:52.750> not<00:04:52.930> ideal<00:04:53.140> to<00:04:53.500> go<00:04:53.590> over<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.070> hundred

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
it's not ideal to go over the hundred

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.340 
it's not ideal to go over the hundred
percent<00:04:54.610> but<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.000> is<00:04:55.090> an<00:04:55.300> option<00:04:55.630> if<00:04:55.780> you<00:04:56.110> want

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
percent but it is an option if you want

physically force the file here we have

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.180 
physically force the file here we have
forced<00:05:02.020> width<00:05:02.290> and<00:05:02.530> a<00:05:02.590> forced<00:05:02.980> height

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
forced width and a forced height

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.580 
forced width and a forced height
currently<00:05:04.060> they're<00:05:04.210> set<00:05:04.390> to<00:05:04.420> automatic<00:05:05.050> so

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
currently they're set to automatic so

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.760 
currently they're set to automatic so
Excel<00:05:05.950> does<00:05:06.250> its<00:05:06.370> own<00:05:06.520> calculations<00:05:07.210> or<00:05:07.770> we

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
Excel does its own calculations or we

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.350 
Excel does its own calculations or we

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
can force it we can see actually I want

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.630 
can force it we can see actually I want
the<00:05:10.450> width<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:10.990> be<00:05:11.020> forced<00:05:11.620> to<00:05:11.890> be<00:05:12.010> a<00:05:12.040> page<00:05:12.340> wide

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
the width to be forced to be a page wide

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.790 
the width to be forced to be a page wide
now<00:05:13.510> what<00:05:13.690> you'll<00:05:13.810> then<00:05:13.960> notice<00:05:14.140> the<00:05:14.440> scale

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
now what you'll then notice the scale

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.100 
now what you'll then notice the scale
gets<00:05:15.040> grayed<00:05:15.430> out<00:05:15.460> but<00:05:16.330> you<00:05:16.390> can't<00:05:16.600> just<00:05:16.900> it

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
gets grayed out but you can't just it

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.440 
gets grayed out but you can't just it
now<00:05:17.230> you've<00:05:17.410> been<00:05:17.530> forcing<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:18.400> width<00:05:18.610> in<00:05:18.910> but

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
now you've been forcing the width in but

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.540 
now you've been forcing the width in but
notice<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:19.900> scale<00:05:20.200> has<00:05:20.500> dropped<00:05:20.890> to<00:05:21.100> 48

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
notice the scale has dropped to 48

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.090 
notice the scale has dropped to 48
percent<00:05:21.610> so<00:05:22.540> by<00:05:22.690> me<00:05:22.900> forcing<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.590> width<00:05:23.830> of<00:05:24.010> my

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
percent so by me forcing the width of my

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.000 
percent so by me forcing the width of my
data<00:05:24.730> into<00:05:25.240> one<00:05:25.450> page<00:05:25.690> wide<00:05:25.990> it's<00:05:26.680> actually

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
data into one page wide it's actually

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.700 
data into one page wide it's actually
scaling<00:05:27.370> down<00:05:27.760> to<00:05:27.880> 48<00:05:28.330> percent<00:05:28.360> and<00:05:29.350> in<00:05:29.590> the

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
scaling down to 48 percent and in the

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.280 
scaling down to 48 percent and in the
print<00:05:29.950> preview<00:05:30.420> you'll<00:05:31.420> see<00:05:31.660> it<00:05:31.870> is<00:05:32.050> pretty

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
print preview you'll see it is pretty

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.730 
print preview you'll see it is pretty
