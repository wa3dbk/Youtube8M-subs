00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
but I do have some key differences which

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.420 
but I do have some key differences which
I'll<00:00:35.969> dissect<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.440> most<00:00:37.649> obvious<00:00:38.190> is

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
I'll dissect for you the most obvious is

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
but beyond that the difference in deco

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.049

them<00:02:43.420> having<00:02:43.629> different<00:02:44.079> heads<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.409> will

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
them having different heads I will

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.780 
them having different heads I will
quickly<00:02:44.799> take<00:02:45.129> a<00:02:45.159> look<00:02:45.280> at<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.609> neck

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
quickly take a look at the neck

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.759 
quickly take a look at the neck
articulation<00:02:46.629> to<00:02:46.780> see<00:02:46.959> if<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.200> heads<00:02:47.440> make<00:02:47.739> a

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769

so<00:02:48.700> both<00:02:48.879> rotate<00:02:49.359> side<00:02:49.659> to<00:02:49.690> side<00:02:50.109> them<00:02:50.409> both

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
so both rotate side to side them both

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.410 
so both rotate side to side them both
are<00:02:50.769> able<00:02:51.159> to<00:02:51.280> look<00:02:51.430> down<00:02:51.489> about<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.389> same

little bit further

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.059 
little bit further
I<00:02:58.420> think<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.900> volume<00:02:59.049> of<00:02:59.409> the<00:02:59.530> hair<00:02:59.739> on<00:02:59.950> the

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
I think the volume of the hair on the

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.710 
I think the volume of the hair on the
back<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.519> head<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:00.939> toys-r-us<00:03:01.450> one

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.479 
back of the head of the toys-r-us one
prevents<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.319> looking<00:03:02.620> up<00:03:02.769> as<00:03:02.950> far<00:03:03.189> as<00:03:03.340> the

prevents it looking up as far as the
puck<00:03:03.700> series<00:03:04.120> one<00:03:04.359> so<00:03:04.750> all<00:03:04.780> things<00:03:05.290> considered

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.809 
Wolverine figure than of the two it's
that<00:03:16.780> one<00:03:17.079> in<00:03:17.410> my<00:03:17.560> opinion<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:18.160> head<00:03:18.400> sculpt

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
that one in my opinion the head sculpt

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.970 
that one in my opinion the head sculpt
is<00:03:18.940> just<00:03:19.239> superior<00:03:19.720> I<00:03:20.079> mean<00:03:20.410> I<00:03:20.530> guess<00:03:20.769> the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
is just superior I mean I guess the

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.920 
is just superior I mean I guess the
toys-r-us<00:03:21.430> one<00:03:21.790> is<00:03:21.940> not<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.150> terrible<00:03:22.690> head

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
toys-r-us one is not a terrible head

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.619 
toys-r-us one is not a terrible head
sculpt<00:03:23.440> certainly<00:03:24.160> not<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.579> worst<00:03:24.849> unmasked

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
sculpt certainly not the worst unmasked

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.509 
sculpt certainly not the worst unmasked

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
Wolverine figure we've had I'd give that

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.699 
Wolverine figure we've had I'd give that

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
certainly serviceable it's just I can

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.240 
certainly serviceable it's just I can
think<00:03:34.239> of<00:03:34.449> so<00:03:34.690> many<00:03:34.750> better<00:03:35.169> ones<00:03:35.560> such<00:03:35.919> as<00:03:35.949> the

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
think of so many better ones such as the
