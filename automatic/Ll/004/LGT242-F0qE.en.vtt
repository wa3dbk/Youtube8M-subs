quadrant<00:03:10.859> score<00:03:11.069> I<00:03:11.099> just<00:03:11.459> ran<00:03:11.639> it<00:03:11.760> once<00:03:11.909> I

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
quadrant score I just ran it once I

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.869 
quadrant score I just ran it once I
installed<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:12.599> and<00:03:12.840> I'm<00:03:13.230> getting<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:15.500> 2418<00:03:16.500> is

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
installed this and I'm getting a 2418 is

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.920 
installed this and I'm getting a 2418 is
what<00:03:17.879> I'm<00:03:18.000> getting<00:03:18.299> right<00:03:18.389> now<00:03:18.569> on<00:03:18.720> this

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
what I'm getting right now on this

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.800 
what I'm getting right now on this
device<00:03:19.549> so<00:03:20.549> just<00:03:21.000> ran<00:03:21.239> that<00:03:21.419> after<00:03:21.780> I

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
device so just ran that after I

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.869 
device so just ran that after I
installed<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:22.620> that's<00:03:22.739> pretty<00:03:22.980> pretty<00:03:23.400> decent

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
installed so that's pretty pretty decent

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.159 
installed so that's pretty pretty decent
for<00:03:23.970> gingerbread<00:03:25.099> ROM<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:27.780> pretty<00:03:28.079> much

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
for gingerbread ROM so pretty much

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.449 
for gingerbread ROM so pretty much
standard<00:03:28.650> actually<00:03:28.829> it's<00:03:29.160> about<00:03:29.250> what

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
standard actually it's about what

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.129 
standard actually it's about what
they're<00:03:29.609> getting<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:30.599> those<00:03:30.930> are<00:03:31.049> your

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
they're getting so those are your

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.640 
they're getting so those are your
applications<00:03:33.049> overall<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:34.079> think<00:03:34.260> it's<00:03:34.500> nice

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
applications overall I think it's nice

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.550 
applications overall I think it's nice
really<00:03:35.010> nice<00:03:35.190> gingerbread<00:03:35.699> ROM<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.629> can

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
really nice gingerbread ROM you can

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.930 
really nice gingerbread ROM you can
obviously<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.040> think<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.280> would<00:03:38.459> change<00:03:38.669> the

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
obviously I think I would change the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.050 
obviously I think I would change the
launcher<00:03:39.840> myself<00:03:40.319> go<00:03:40.919> like<00:03:41.099> a<00:03:41.280> TW<00:03:41.849> or

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
launcher myself go like a TW or

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.009 
launcher myself go like a TW or
something<00:03:42.449> else<00:03:42.829> that<00:03:44.389> I<00:03:45.389> liked<00:03:45.629> as<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.870> can

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
something else that I liked as you can

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.449 
something else that I liked as you can
theme<00:03:46.319> it<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.530> little<00:03:46.739> better<00:03:46.889> and<00:03:47.129> things<00:03:47.310> like

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
theme it a little better and things like

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.610 
theme it a little better and things like
that<00:03:47.519> so<00:03:47.940> it's<00:03:48.090> kind<00:03:48.269> of<00:03:48.329> nice<00:03:48.480> but<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:48.989> do<00:03:49.379> like
