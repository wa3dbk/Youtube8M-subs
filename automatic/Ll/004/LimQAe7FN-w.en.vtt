 Liker little help the world novelty with digital much viewfinder and 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.700
 high-resolution color display for absolutely precise measurements 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.270
 the second time 4 inch color screen 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.800
 presents all measurement results and additional information clearly 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.820
 the robe with resolution ensures a razor sharp picture 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:33.280
 The digital goal viewfinder with 4x zoom makes it easy to put on at long 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.749
 Distances and allows measuring even in bright sunlight 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.579
 the manifold functions of the Reichard is only the 5 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.579
 can be called quickly via Carsten 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.430
 Danks appearance under ergonomic design is the head of the study 5 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.840
 always safe in the hand 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.070
 In addition, the robust housing protects against splash water and dust 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.780
 with its excellent optics of its incredible precision and its 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.020
 Rugged Housing Until The Head The Study 5 Her Strong Partner In The

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.010
 Euro 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.170
 with the digital target viewfinder and the high-resolution color display you can 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.650
 Attract distant objects easily and accurately 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.540
 There are three different zoom levels available 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.020
 simply fast and absolutely accurate, even such great distances can be achieved 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.020
 measure bright sunlight 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.310
 the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.920
 especially at distance measurements on construction sites 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.280
 is obscured to the Mest target by building materials or construction vehicles 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.010
 for the leader of study 5 this is not a problem 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.320
 in an instant, accurate distance measurements are even across obstacles 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.650
 possible thanks to the integrated tilt sensor Sam means with only 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.950
 a measurement the desired horizontal distance 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.190
 Free entry 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.420
 with the integrated tilt sensor 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.979
 can also faster and easier inclinations to plus minus 45 degrees 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.939
 determined 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.109
 rooms are not always rectangular and easy to let go 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:22.449
 The triangular formation also helps them to quickly surface many children's dreams 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.219
 capture 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.219
 they divide the space into imaginary three grandchildren 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:32.289
 dapd with three measurements they each determine the triangles areas which 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:35.029
 could add up at the same time 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.029
 Now you only need to read the result 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.059
 they must have the roof pitch of a house or the area a house facade 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:51.029
 ended o'neal was cool victories climbs are fast and easy 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:53.219
 safely with the head of the TuS II 5 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.569
 three measurements the result appears on the display 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:03.989
 another push of a button and you get additional information which for example 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.209
 Angles and surfaces 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.549
 Incidentally, these detail ads are available for many more functions of the Leica 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.079
 the study 5 percent 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.249
 they must determine the height or width of an object 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:19.199
 You can not do this directly to targets 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:24.339
 the leader of the study 5 also solves this situation thanks to his three days of shooting 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:27.749
 is working 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:31.799
 Using two measurements, the Howitzer Rheintaler or vertical 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.349
 Distance determined indirectly is important here that the second measurement in 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.939
 Right angle to the target object takes place with the minimal measurement a breeze 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:47.059
 Oct this is not possible there is another peter-horas features 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:51.609
 The head of the BMW 5 Series independently averaged the result from three measurements 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.930
 that can be determined on sub-routes when it comes to this, for example 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:59.419
 to measure the height or width of a window 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:03.449
 which works for all four days "is also available at the touch of a button 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.449
 Detailed results such as Winkelhorst 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.609
 With the head of the Study 5 they measurably increase their productivity
