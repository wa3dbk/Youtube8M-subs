00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
is in Swedish I believe I don't think

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.490 
is in Swedish I believe I don't think
that<00:00:38.489> was<00:00:38.730> German<00:00:39.270> pretty<00:00:39.840> sure<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.200> was<00:00:40.320> like

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that was German pretty sure it was like

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.250 
that was German pretty sure it was like
Swedish<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.370> some<00:00:41.910> other<00:00:42.090> language<00:00:42.600> it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
Swedish or some other language it

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.350 
Swedish or some other language it
definitely<00:00:43.649> wasn't<00:00:43.829> English<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:45.180> yeah

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360

things the main thing that I wanted to
discuss<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.640> discuss<00:01:21.119> was<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.659> dynamic

discuss to discuss was the dynamic

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.190 
discuss to discuss was the dynamic
factions<00:01:23.390> which<00:01:24.390> basically<00:01:25.110> means<00:01:25.530> that

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
factions which basically means that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.910 
factions which basically means that
every<00:01:28.200> faction<00:01:29.130> will<00:01:29.670> be<00:01:29.790> playable<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.920> every

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
map so for instance if you were playing

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.480

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
on a Chinese map you could actually play

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.270 
on a Chinese map you could actually play
the<00:01:41.490> US<00:01:42.150> faction<00:01:42.899> versus<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.680> Russian

the US faction versus the Russian

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.319 
the US faction versus the Russian
faction<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.990> Chinese<00:01:46.500> map<00:01:47.000> in<00:01:48.000> past

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
faction on a Chinese map in past

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.960 
faction on a Chinese map in past
Battlefield<00:01:49.049> games<00:01:49.610> basically<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.850> were

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
Battlefield games basically if you were

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.690 
Battlefield games basically if you were
playing<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.570> China<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.530> would<00:01:53.009> play<00:01:53.340> with<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
playing in China you would play with the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.080 
playing in China you would play with the
Chinese<00:01:54.119> faction<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.250> admin<00:01:56.880> will

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
Chinese faction but the admin will

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.880 
Chinese faction but the admin will
actually<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.930> ability<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:59.189> pit<00:01:59.969> either

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
actually have the ability to pit either

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.980 
actually have the ability to pit either
let's<00:02:01.890> say<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.219> u.s.<00:02:02.659> faction<00:02:03.659> with<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
let's say the u.s. faction with the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.649 
let's say the u.s. faction with the
Russian<00:02:04.469> against<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.579> Russian<00:02:06.030> faction<00:02:06.630> or

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
Russian against the Russian faction or

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.869 
Russian against the Russian faction or
the<00:02:07.200> u.s.<00:02:07.590> faction<00:02:08.220> against<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.670> Chinese

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
the u.s. faction against the Chinese

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.960 
the u.s. faction against the Chinese
faction<00:02:09.860> which<00:02:10.860> will<00:02:11.099> kind<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.459> make<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.790> game

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
faction which will kind of make the game

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.690 
faction which will kind of make the game
a<00:02:12.000> bit<00:02:12.330> more

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
a bit more

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.059 
a bit more
dynamic<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:13.480> keep<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.230> bit<00:02:14.410> more<00:02:14.620> fresh

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
dynamic and keep it a bit more fresh

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.880 
dynamic and keep it a bit more fresh
which<00:02:15.940> i<00:02:16.090> think<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.420> pretty<00:02:16.690> cool<00:02:16.890> giving

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
which i think is pretty cool giving

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.300 
which i think is pretty cool giving
those<00:02:18.300> admins<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.690> bad<00:02:19.989> men's<00:02:20.349> a<00:02:20.739> little<00:02:21.190> bit

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
those admins and bad men's a little bit

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.979 
those admins and bad men's a little bit
more<00:02:23.370> customization<00:02:24.370> as<00:02:24.489> far<00:02:24.790> as<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.840> way

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
more customization as far as the way

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.720 
more customization as far as the way
their<00:02:26.200> server<00:02:26.530> runs<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.310> think<00:02:27.580> that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
their server runs and I think that

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.940 
their server runs and I think that
they'll<00:02:27.879> be<00:02:28.030> able<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.300> set<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.709> that<00:02:29.739> it

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
they'll be able to set it so that it

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.610 
they'll be able to set it so that it
kind<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.340> rotates<00:02:31.330> through<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.810> factions<00:02:32.380> and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
kind of rotates through the factions and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.370 
kind of rotates through the factions and
different<00:02:32.950> stuff<00:02:33.250> like<00:02:33.489> that<00:02:33.519> to<00:02:33.760> make<00:02:34.120> it

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
different stuff like that to make it

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.280 
different stuff like that to make it
quite<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.410> bit<00:02:35.500> easier<00:02:35.650> on<00:02:36.010> them<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.370> assume<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.959> I

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
quite a bit easier on them I assume so I

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.920 
quite a bit easier on them I assume so I
think<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.890> that's<00:02:39.010> pretty<00:02:39.400> cool<00:02:39.690> I'd<00:02:40.690> love

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
think that that's pretty cool I'd love

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.780 
think that that's pretty cool I'd love
to<00:02:41.019> hear<00:02:41.170> what<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.349> guys<00:02:41.500> think<00:02:41.709> about<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.519> I

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
to hear what you guys think about that I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.460 
to hear what you guys think about that I
know<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.209> won't<00:02:43.330> make<00:02:43.569> too<00:02:43.959> big<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.290> a

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
know it won't make too big of a

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.680 
know it won't make too big of a
difference<00:02:44.650> but<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.760> think<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.120> will<00:02:46.299> kind<00:02:46.540> of

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
difference but I think it will kind of

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.860 
difference but I think it will kind of
keep<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.049> game<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.920> bit<00:02:48.280> fresher<00:02:48.700> which<00:02:49.690> is

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
keep the game a bit fresher which is

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.280 
keep the game a bit fresher which is
always<00:02:50.080> good<00:02:51.000> anything<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.180> extend<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.959> life

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
always good anything to extend the life

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.339 
always good anything to extend the life
of<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:54.040> game<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.610> always<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.599> good<00:02:55.840> thing<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.319> I

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
of the game is always a good thing so I

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.069 
of the game is always a good thing so I
think<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.980> will<00:02:57.040> be<00:02:57.099> pretty<00:02:57.430> cool<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.900> yeah

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
think that will be pretty cool so yeah

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.580 
think that will be pretty cool so yeah
dynamic<00:02:59.769> factions<00:03:00.400> will<00:03:00.700> be<00:03:00.910> in<00:03:01.590> battlefield

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
dynamic factions will be in battlefield

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.759 
dynamic factions will be in battlefield
4<00:03:02.730> now<00:03:03.730> buck<00:03:04.060> was<00:03:04.329> also<00:03:04.780> asked<00:03:05.260> about<00:03:05.319> some

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
4 now buck was also asked about some

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.199 
4 now buck was also asked about some
other<00:03:05.920> features<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:06.519> would<00:03:06.910> be<00:03:07.030> in

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
other features that would be in

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.160 
other features that would be in
battlefield<00:03:07.810> 4<00:03:08.370> he<00:03:09.370> went<00:03:09.610> on<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.819> talk<00:03:10.090> about

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
battlefield 4 he went on to talk about

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.620 
battlefield 4 he went on to talk about
soldier<00:03:11.250> customization<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.549> how<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.299> will<00:03:13.450> be

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
soldier customization and how it will be

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.660 
soldier customization and how it will be
much<00:03:13.930> greater<00:03:14.769> than<00:03:15.069> in<00:03:15.400> battlefield<00:03:16.030> 3<00:03:16.150> and

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
much greater than in battlefield 3 and

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.000 
much greater than in battlefield 3 and
yeah<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:19.000> game<00:03:19.269> will<00:03:19.510> actually<00:03:20.170> allow<00:03:20.410> for

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
yeah the game will actually allow for

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.620 
yeah the game will actually allow for
more<00:03:21.250> weapons<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.269> vehicles<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:24.069> game

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
more weapons and vehicles in the game

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.039 
more weapons and vehicles in the game
obviously<00:03:25.630> there<00:03:26.560> will<00:03:26.680> be<00:03:26.889> a<00:03:27.480> more<00:03:28.480> overall

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
obviously there will be a more overall

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.860 
obviously there will be a more overall
vehicles<00:03:29.920> with<00:03:30.310> each<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.329> the<00:03:31.480> three

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
vehicles with each of the three

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.390 
vehicles with each of the three
different<00:03:32.049> factions<00:03:32.829> having<00:03:33.220> their<00:03:33.370> own

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
different factions having their own

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.720 
different factions having their own
vehicles<00:03:34.319> but<00:03:35.319> I'm<00:03:35.560> assuming<00:03:35.709> that<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.549> know

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
vehicles but I'm assuming that you know

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.819 
vehicles but I'm assuming that you know
when<00:03:37.359> they<00:03:37.510> say<00:03:37.810> more<00:03:38.170> vehicles<00:03:38.200> in<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.040> game

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
when they say more vehicles in the game

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.580 
when they say more vehicles in the game
when<00:03:41.829> they<00:03:41.980> say<00:03:42.220> it's<00:03:42.400> up<00:03:42.609> there<00:03:43.060> they've

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
when they say it's up there they've

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.559 
when they say it's up there they've
optimized<00:03:44.590> their<00:03:45.040> streaming<00:03:45.579> system<00:03:46.120> I'm

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
optimized their streaming system I'm

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.740 
optimized their streaming system I'm
believing<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.650> that<00:03:47.709> means<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:49.510> there

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
believing that that means that there

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.440 
believing that that means that there
will<00:03:49.780> be<00:03:50.019> more<00:03:50.350> vehicles<00:03:51.160> on<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:52.060> actual

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
will be more vehicles on the actual

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.339 
will be more vehicles on the actual
battlefield<00:03:52.989> at<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.530> single<00:03:53.980> time<00:03:55.139> I'm<00:03:56.139> not

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
battlefield at a single time I'm not

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.940 
battlefield at a single time I'm not
positive<00:03:56.590> about<00:03:57.010> that<00:03:57.630> but<00:03:58.630> yeah<00:03:58.840> I'm<00:03:59.079> pretty

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
positive about that but yeah I'm pretty

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.879 
positive about that but yeah I'm pretty
sure<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.519> that<00:04:00.670> would<00:04:00.880> be<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:02.230> only<00:04:02.260> reason

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
sure that that would be the only reason

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.110 
sure that that would be the only reason
you<00:04:03.040> would<00:04:03.160> need<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.459> optimize<00:04:03.910> your

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
you would need to optimize your

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.949 
you would need to optimize your
streaming<00:04:04.900> system<00:04:05.670> would<00:04:06.670> be<00:04:06.819> able<00:04:06.970> would<00:04:07.750> be

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
streaming system would be able would be

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.699 
streaming system would be able would be
to<00:04:08.260> put<00:04:08.290> more<00:04:08.980> vehicles<00:04:09.459> on<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:10.000> battlefield

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
to put more vehicles on the battlefield

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.869 
to put more vehicles on the battlefield
at<00:04:11.709> one<00:04:12.130> time

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
at one time

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.689 
at one time
but<00:04:14.879> it<00:04:15.030> also<00:04:15.269> says<00:04:15.989> it<00:04:16.260> will<00:04:16.380> allow<00:04:16.739> for<00:04:17.190> even

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
but it also says it will allow for even

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.930 
but it also says it will allow for even
more<00:04:17.940> weapons<00:04:18.889> not<00:04:19.889> really<00:04:20.190> sure<00:04:20.489> what<00:04:20.910> that

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
more weapons not really sure what that

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.290 
more weapons not really sure what that
means<00:04:21.470> but<00:04:22.470> I'm<00:04:23.100> assuming<00:04:23.669> that<00:04:23.820> just<00:04:24.060> means

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
means but I'm assuming that just means

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.230 
means but I'm assuming that just means
more<00:04:24.479> weapons<00:04:25.110> in<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.350> game<00:04:25.380> because<00:04:26.240> I'm

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
more weapons in the game because I'm

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.610 
more weapons in the game because I'm
pretty<00:04:27.510> sure<00:04:27.780> you're<00:04:28.020> only<00:04:28.139> going<00:04:28.350> to<00:04:28.440> have

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
pretty sure you're only going to have

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.610 
pretty sure you're only going to have
your<00:04:28.889> primary<00:04:29.520> weapon<00:04:30.090> your<00:04:31.020> secondary

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
your primary weapon your secondary

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.300 
your primary weapon your secondary

pretty<00:04:46.229> sure<00:04:46.500> that<00:04:46.740> they're<00:04:46.889> going<00:04:47.010> to<00:04:47.100> be

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
pretty sure that they're going to be

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.390 
pretty sure that they're going to be
more<00:04:47.460> overall<00:04:47.970> weapons<00:04:48.690> that<00:04:49.680> you<00:04:49.889> can<00:04:50.100> choose

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
more overall weapons that you can choose

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.810 
more overall weapons that you can choose
from<00:04:51.080> because<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.770> know<00:04:52.889> they<00:04:53.070> are<00:04:53.310> trying<00:04:53.669> to

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
from because you know they are trying to

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.879 
from because you know they are trying to
create<00:04:55.280> more<00:04:56.280> customization<00:04:57.270> options<00:04:57.930> for

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
weapons will be a part of that now i'm

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.379 
weapons will be a part of that now i'm
not<00:05:04.800> sure<00:05:05.070> if<00:05:05.190> you'll<00:05:05.340> be<00:05:05.490> able<00:05:05.610> to<00:05:05.729> customize

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
not sure if you'll be able to customize

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.230 
not sure if you'll be able to customize
your<00:05:06.630> character<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.470> way<00:05:07.590> they<00:05:07.830> look<00:05:08.240> so

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
your character and the way they look so

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.360 
your character and the way they look so
that<00:05:09.389> maybe<00:05:09.570> you<00:05:09.780> could<00:05:10.070> possibly<00:05:11.070> make<00:05:11.310> a

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
that maybe you could possibly make a

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.520 
that maybe you could possibly make a
soldier<00:05:11.940> that<00:05:12.120> kind<00:05:12.360> of<00:05:12.479> resembled<00:05:13.020> you<00:05:13.110> or
