give it a password remember all that

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.039 
give it a password remember all that
information<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.729> identical<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.450> doing<00:01:54.930> a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
information it's identical to doing a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.709

but<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:58.710> you're<00:01:58.890> doing<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.280> distribution

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
but here you're doing for distribution

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.069 
but here you're doing for distribution
now<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:01.380> let<00:02:01.619> me<00:02:01.649> show<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.920> for<00:02:02.759> example<00:02:03.270> here

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
development one here's my ad hoc one

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.690 
development one here's my ad hoc one
goes<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.530> other<00:02:18.680> video<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.040> then<00:02:19.340> here<00:02:19.579> is

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
Arnold it's there ok first things first

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.619 
Arnold it's there ok first things first
we<00:02:59.480> need<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.750> make<00:03:00.019> sure<00:03:00.250> that<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.670> bundle<00:03:02.420> ID

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
we need to make sure that the bundle ID

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.190 
we need to make sure that the bundle ID
is<00:03:03.310> correct<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.489> so<00:03:04.670> it's<00:03:04.790> in<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.120> app<00:03:05.329> XML

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
is correct and so it's in the app XML

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.920 
is correct and so it's in the app XML
file<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:06.769> if<00:03:06.859> I<00:03:06.920> click<00:03:06.980> over<00:03:07.400> here<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.930> here

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
file so if I click over here and here

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.949 
file so if I click over here and here
it's<00:03:09.079> referred<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.530> as<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.920> ID<00:03:10.159> and<00:03:10.579> so<00:03:10.760> again

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
it's referred to as the ID and so again

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.830 
it's referred to as the ID and so again
this<00:03:11.959> must<00:03:12.680> match<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.840> distribution

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
this must match the distribution

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.210 
this must match the distribution
provisioning<00:03:15.319> profile<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:15.829> you<00:03:15.919> created

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
are ways to there's some stuff you can

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:07.050 
are ways to there's some stuff you can
do<00:07:00.650> with<00:07:00.680> it<00:07:01.210> Xcode<00:07:02.210> and<00:07:02.860> I<00:07:04.030> haven't<00:07:05.030> done<00:07:05.210> it

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
do with it Xcode and I haven't done it

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.300 
do with it Xcode and I haven't done it
typically<00:07:08.060> I<00:07:08.210> would<00:07:08.540> go<00:07:08.840> from<00:07:09.050> one<00:07:09.380> if<00:07:10.070> I<00:07:10.250> know

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
typically I would go from one if I know

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.600 
typically I would go from one if I know
that<00:07:10.640> that<00:07:11.420> a<00:07:11.620> like<00:07:12.620> you<00:07:12.860> could<00:07:13.010> test<00:07:13.340> it<00:07:13.460> with

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610 
that that a like you could test it with

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.980 
that that a like you could test it with
ad<00:07:13.760> hoc<00:07:13.970> bills<00:07:14.240> because<00:07:14.660> you<00:07:14.750> can<00:07:14.870> do<00:07:14.960> a

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:14.990 
ad hoc bills because you can do a

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.250 
ad hoc bills because you can do a
release<00:07:15.260> build<00:07:15.620> with<00:07:15.800> that<00:07:15.950> hawk<00:07:16.250> so<00:07:17.120> you<00:07:17.260> you

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.260 
release build with that hawk so you you

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.630 
release build with that hawk so you you
can<00:07:18.410> get<00:07:18.560> the<00:07:18.650> same<00:07:19.090> results<00:07:21.280> there<00:07:22.280> are<00:07:22.460> ways

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:22.640 
can get the same results there are ways

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.610 
can get the same results there are ways
to<00:07:22.670> check<00:07:23.180> it<00:07:23.330> I<00:07:23.510> again<00:07:24.050> I<00:07:24.080> haven't<00:07:24.320> done<00:07:24.470> it

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:24.620 
to check it I again I haven't done it

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.330 
to check it I again I haven't done it
but<00:07:24.970> maybe<00:07:25.970> I'll<00:07:26.210> do<00:07:26.510> it<00:07:26.600> some<00:07:26.810> other<00:07:26.900> time

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:27.340 
but maybe I'll do it some other time

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.370 
but maybe I'll do it some other time
okay<00:07:28.340> so<00:07:28.640> hopefully<00:07:29.000> that<00:07:29.210> makes<00:07:29.420> sense<00:07:29.570> how

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:30.380 
okay so hopefully that makes sense how

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.410 
okay so hopefully that makes sense how
to<00:07:30.440> do<00:07:30.680> a<00:07:30.710> release<00:07:31.130> build<00:07:31.400> using<00:07:31.580> Flash

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:32.420
