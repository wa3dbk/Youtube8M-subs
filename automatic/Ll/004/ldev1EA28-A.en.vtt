00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.449 
okay now you talk about hearing the
pitch<00:03:04.599> when<00:03:05.049> you<00:03:05.170> do<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.469> overtones<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:06.249> have

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
pitch when you do the overtones you have

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.910 
pitch when you do the overtones you have
to<00:03:06.639> hear<00:03:06.969> the<00:03:07.180> tone<00:03:07.420> can<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.139> talk<00:03:08.349> about<00:03:08.379> that

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
to hear the tone can you talk about that

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.739 
to hear the tone can you talk about that
a<00:03:08.950> little<00:03:09.189> bit<00:03:09.340> when<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:09.879> have<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.239> hear<00:03:10.569> the

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:10.749 
a little bit when you have to hear the

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:13.289 
a little bit when you have to hear the
pitch<00:03:11.019> yeah<00:03:11.560> if<00:03:11.769> you<00:03:11.950> don't<00:03:12.189> hear<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.790> pitch

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
pitch yeah if you don't hear the pitch

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.470 
pitch yeah if you don't hear the pitch
it's<00:03:13.629> just<00:03:14.879> just<00:03:15.879> like<00:03:16.000> turning<00:03:16.450> the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
it's just just like turning the

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.080 
it's just just like turning the
mouthpiece<00:03:16.930> on<00:03:17.109> the<00:03:17.290> side<00:03:17.500> right<00:03:17.980> right<00:03:18.549> so

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
mouthpiece on the side right right so

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.699 
mouthpiece on the side right right so
it's<00:03:19.239> important<00:03:19.719> to<00:03:19.810> hear<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.200> pitch<00:03:20.409> and<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
it's important to hear the pitch and the

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.640 
it's important to hear the pitch and the
overtone<00:03:21.340> exercise<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.930> overtone<00:03:23.290> exercise

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
overtone exercise the overtone exercise

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.300 
overtone exercise the overtone exercise
trains<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.579> hear<00:03:25.000> each<00:03:25.239> -<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:29.680> want<00:03:30.099> you<00:03:30.219> to

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
show us your your overtone series now

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:34.920 
show us your your overtone series now
what<00:03:33.909> are<00:03:33.969> you<00:03:34.030> thinking<00:03:34.450> which<00:03:34.599> no<00:03:34.750> you're

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
let's see what you do no sliding at all

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.589 
let's see what you do no sliding at all
okay<00:04:03.489> you<00:04:03.549> don't<00:04:03.699> need<00:04:03.909> to<00:04:04.000> so<00:04:04.150> when<00:04:04.419> do<00:04:04.540> you

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
okay you don't need to so when do you

okay you don't need to so when do you
need<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:04.989> slide<00:04:05.349> to<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:05.979> position<00:04:06.459> change

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
need to slide to the position change

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.149 
need to slide to the position change
position<00:04:07.299> the<00:04:07.389> reed<00:04:07.629> is<00:04:08.159> absolutely

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
position the reed is absolutely

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.240 
position the reed is absolutely
atrocious<00:04:09.519> so<00:04:10.479> hard<00:04:10.750> right<00:04:11.379> then<00:04:11.829> let's<00:04:12.069> do

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
atrocious so hard right then let's do

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.110 
atrocious so hard right then let's do

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
something but on volume control then you

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.580 
something but on volume control then you
move<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.329> mouthpiece<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.840> little<00:04:17.199> bit<00:04:17.320> sure

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.269 

so<00:04:39.009> the<00:04:39.460> ladder<00:04:39.699> that<00:04:40.089> you<00:04:40.120> get<00:04:40.800> do<00:04:41.800> do<00:04:42.099> it

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:42.279 
so the ladder that you get do do it

00:04:42.279 --> 00:05:04.209 
so the ladder that you get do do it
let's<00:04:42.490> say<00:04:42.639> you<00:04:42.699> do<00:04:42.969> that<00:04:43.150> again

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:04.219 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:06.469 

so<00:05:05.219> you're<00:05:05.339> saying<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:05.729> the<00:05:05.939> louder<00:05:06.300> that

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:08.429 
you get and the more volume that you

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:10.820 
you get and the more volume that you
need<00:05:08.610> you're<00:05:08.939> actually<00:05:09.389> sliding<00:05:09.899> in<00:05:10.229> yeah<00:05:10.679> a

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830

need you're actually sliding in yeah a
little<00:05:11.249> bit<00:05:11.490> Nakia<00:05:12.330> getting<00:05:12.689> away<00:05:12.959> from<00:05:13.020> here

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:13.379 
little bit Nakia getting away from here

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.769 
little bit Nakia getting away from here
okay<00:05:13.889> right<00:05:14.639> and<00:05:15.209> is<00:05:15.419> that<00:05:15.569> true<00:05:15.599> for

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:15.779 
okay right and is that true for

saxophone clarinet bass planet well
there<00:05:19.469> was<00:05:19.559> an<00:05:19.679> exercise<00:05:19.889> you<00:05:20.099> once<00:05:20.520> showed<00:05:20.759> me

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:21.029 
there was an exercise you once showed me

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.379 
there was an exercise you once showed me
you<00:05:21.749> started<00:05:22.169> on<00:05:22.289> the<00:05:22.559> G<00:05:22.919> in<00:05:23.759> fact<00:05:23.969> maybe<00:05:24.209> I'll

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
you started on the G in fact maybe I'll

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:32.689 
you started on the G in fact maybe I'll
even<00:05:24.509> try<00:05:24.839> it<00:05:24.899> it<00:05:25.409> was<00:05:25.559> like<00:05:25.740> this<00:05:31.249> the<00:05:32.249> normans

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
even try it it was like this the normans

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.239 
even try it it was like this the normans
you<00:05:32.789> get<00:05:33.059> higher<00:05:33.479> than<00:05:33.929> C<00:05:34.229> then<00:05:34.919> you're<00:05:35.099> going

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:35.249 
you get higher than C then you're going

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:37.369 
you get higher than C then you're going
into<00:05:35.580> okay<00:05:36.240> so<00:05:36.300> you're<00:05:36.509> playing<00:05:36.719> G<00:05:36.990> but<00:05:37.229> you're

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:37.379 
into okay so you're playing G but you're

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:54.820 
into okay so you're playing G but you're
getting<00:05:37.680> an<00:05:37.770> e<00:05:38.159> I<00:05:38.189> believe<00:05:38.669> I<00:05:50.449> can<00:05:51.449> do<00:05:52.490> all

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
getting an e I believe I can do all

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.109 
getting an e I believe I can do all
mm-hmm<00:05:55.919> and<00:05:56.189> you're<00:05:56.369> using<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.729> overtones

00:05:57.109 --> 00:05:57.119 
mm-hmm and you're using the overtones

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:00.019 
mm-hmm and you're using the overtones
here<00:05:57.300> sure<00:05:57.659> what<00:05:58.529> other<00:05:58.649> overtone<00:05:59.219> exercises
