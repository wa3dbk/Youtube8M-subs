00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:11.249
 short notes 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:14.649
 we still have seven like the short notes feature they are in 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:17.990
 broken more virtual post IT or so to the small Pieks block 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.029
 I have pa ways to open the showroom 3 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.630
 click here on instead of and Zach in the search bar 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.180
 and appetite short notes serve 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.580
 Directory programs 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.560
 or in the "Programs" tab 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.970
 Open Cannes 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.700
 is that painting 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.580
 around 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.580
 on the other hand, I have the opportunity to go through all the programs 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.210
 then about accessories 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.640
 to select the short texts 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.680
 the third possibility gives her again on Start and Rapid above short notes 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.260
 that opens the album 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.390
 and we see 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.460
 because first a short tips 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.690
 so post and Bahr cranes popped up to decide what I want Berlin 1 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
 been 18 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.020
 yes push the crane line where I want I can the integrated 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.020
 change variably 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
 There are quite a few programs open 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.969
 disappear in the background 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.539
 not to make STEICO profoundly back 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.040
 So the definition desktop 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.420
 yes, of course if I need more notes then I have here 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.010
 this plus sign alternatively I can also control and em-third 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.330
 finally on it 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
 and we see I can open her any number of Kiezen 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.430
 some can do 2 and 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.330
 tih 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.870
 is 1 and 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.750
 Note 2 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.160
 Amazon everything 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.430
 change in size 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.430
 push in and out 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.740
 Now I can say that I have Zier for myself two categories 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.180
 a matter min and once notes 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.529
 and to better sign it I have the following options 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:14.489
 I click on the appropriate note Bernhere anywhere in the note itself 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.239
 on the right mouse button to select different colors Kanye I say 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.039
 Now for my appointments I would like 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.039
 and for my notes I want 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.089
 as a color 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.089
 now you can distinguish that a bit 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.649
 now the following 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.319
 I have the option 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.709
 notes 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.680
 also to delete again 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.449
 For example, if I say appointment 2 has done 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.449
 then I click here on this sign or controls de 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.739
 Now that I'm still asking you to really delete this note I said 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.449
 Yes 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.669
 you could have had percentages 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.900
 at the next delete percent a note will no longer be asked if I am 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:58.899
 want to delete them is made in the country comparison 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:00.709
 but I leave Marceau 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.139
 and then this appointment is gone 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.979
 now the following 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.649
 So I want to protect the program so this short program may as well 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.959
 close again 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.959
 Do not confuse the following 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:20.089
 Leuschel close the notes when I say here 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:22.269
 if I mean mine now 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.970
 make program codes notes by deleting these notes here 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.769
 then I have quite a full program now disappeared though 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:33.509
 I also deleted the codes in Kitzen 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.789
 who in short wants to keep Tizen but closes the program 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:40.879
 then I have it on the lawn from Putin 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.259
 2 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:44.339
 and 2 once on 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.479
 Appointment 3 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:48.019
 then I go up here 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.020
 Kuczmann Kiezen 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.959
 in the system tray and says 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.389
 Close the window 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.109
 I can say then I would like to open the course rockets again 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.389
 90 I still have all appointments here bread at the Kiezen 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.389
 and Ronny, of course, bitter a thread 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.409
 Address Brussels 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.349
 that is a small but not consumed feature 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.879
 now inventory needs to be questions 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:23.209
 is all well and good I have him notes and percent if the program 

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:27.629
 Of course I also see it open but what happens if I mean mine 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:29.650
 Restart operating system and forget 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.090
 this costs now program to start 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.230
 I did not have the emergency seats and some may have needed them now 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:39.909
 in that case I have the opportunity to say that 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:44.080
 make a copy of the program code notes or I create 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.279
 a link 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:48.120
 and push them into the folder Autostadt 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.870
 in the folder Auto Stather are yes to get links or 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.780
 Documents and that will boot up at a windows startup 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.340
 means I sign up and without that I have to click something or without 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.340
 that manually do something to equip the programs 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.449
 I for you now before I go here to start 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:13.279
 for example, here are brief notes 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.279
 I have the program right mouse button 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.219
 Copy 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.540
 so now I've copied the cow to the neighborhood 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.550
 she has in the cache 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.349
 then I go to all programs Autostadt 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.629
 there on the right mouse button and Batman 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.709
 I open it to the autostart folder and CDs currently empty 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.539
 click here on the right mouse button and says insert 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.240
 that is a link now 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.969
 Hot is a bit different though 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:43.120
 This same program 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.949
 Now we can test it all 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.639
 by saying 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.800
 drive underneath and 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.800
 unsubscribe reached in the case 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.580
 reported 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.659
 and I will log in again 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.659
 with my users 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.270
 and we see the benefits are slightly open 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:17.069
 and we can still control that from Hagen all programs 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:20.719
 Autostadt and instructed him to give the link here 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.219
 the abyss 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.160
 it can be very relative 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.539
 effectively have edge by statements 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:30.740
 we do not forget anything 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.970
 we write everything down and we have the shortcut in the autostart 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.119
 reason 

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:40.189
 we organize so simply better we optimize and 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.059
 Roth Reason I hope this 

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:45.499
 has a small percentage of videos to delete 

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:47.789
 quietly fallen and until next time Sch√∂ls
