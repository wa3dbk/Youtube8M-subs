00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.480
 hello and welcome to part two of my 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.730
 third 17 specials and now I will 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.619
 Ask me a little about this 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.110
 notification center take care of you 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.420
 know and there 17 has the notification 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.039
 center yes a few extra 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.470
 functions we get from the 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.690
 suite scene was idiotic scene 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.550
 has known for a long time and has the whole thing 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.840
 Of course, a special look and 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.699
 I'll take the notification center 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.800
 down and there you can the whole 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.920
 I already see the and here 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.690
 installed settings that's a trick 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.290
 if you still do not know that 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.160
 here for example bluetooth wifi 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.480
 turn on can change the volume 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.370
 and much more 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.100
 and now there is a wonderful 7 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.440
 for what the whole 17 look 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.360
 gets through these rounds 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.640
 buttons you can see here 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.469
 these below double and now i show 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.180
 you guys like this team yet 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.250
 we can go to install 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.630
 Of course, once in the cee the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.880
 Astor briefly mentioned to install 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.770
 this team as for all the teams that do it 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.990
 in which the astor gives you need 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.670
 again winterboard you can 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.940
 you also free in cydia 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.950
 Download and the seven that you 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.240
 Now you have to look out for this 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.549
 To do that is 17 control toggle icons 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.010
 him a really small tongue twister 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.100
 but it's free too 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.340
 just look in cydia afterwards in the big one 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.600
 boss kripo and then after this 7 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.530
 downloaded 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.150
 let's go in here 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.689
 winterboard because there we have that 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.890
 see how all of course only once 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.119
 activate 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.770
 I'll show you that again 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.960
 how it all works and we go 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.590
 always on select teams and here altogether 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.710
 above you see that 17 control.de 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.570
 he just gets a tick 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.000
 Chairman Springboard once ries 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.019
 bring and then we go next 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.630
 in the settings 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.730
 there you have to and settings 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.170
 search out 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.610
 while ried does not know yet 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.109
 just in my old video is 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.780
 After that I already have the trick there 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.170
 presented so and we even go there 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.470
 Sir 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.190
 and then here you see below in the 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.000
 appearance 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.360
 the topic there is blue default and 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.819
 now our new theme we once 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.800
 and then the whole thing is already 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.690
 done and I think now really looks 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.870
 our notification center 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.370
 a little bit more like that of 17 die 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.069
 optics is really wonderful 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.530
 come across simple and elegant and the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.200
 functionality is just wonderful and 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.380
