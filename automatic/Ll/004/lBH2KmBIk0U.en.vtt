00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:08.140
 and thinking everything good, I'm going today 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.440
 doing my third video of the 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.839
 boy continued truck simulator 2 more 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.110
 today is not doing a gameplay and 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.820
 back in response to requests for 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.760
 solve the problem of my first 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.189
 video where I was reporting a 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.039
 gauge gol configuration program 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.500
 In the game I like showing that you 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.769
 now how I solved it is a good thing 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.769
 simple 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:40.180
 I broke my head to find out 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.360
 What was the problem? 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.710
 the problem is not that I was turning 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.629
 the steering wheel he was accompanying her 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.239
 I was in the middle of the course 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:57.670
 the steering wheel was already turning and I was 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:59.949
 this slack accompany him not 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.199
 I followed to the end 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.629
 I reported this in my first video 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.220
 if you take Venus in mine 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.410
 videos you'll see that I've already 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.010
 I made two videos of the new steering wheel in this 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.450
 new steering wheel was the trick and the staff 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.760
 I was asking how I had done 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.650
 to solve this problem is 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.770
 showing you mom there in setup 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:26.530
 of the game what was doing wrong 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.300
 I was setting the wheel in this 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.610
 page 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:38.910
 putting the steering wheel here is not direction and 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:44.410
 here and I was also setting it up 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.340
 mistakenly that turn me on 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.120
 right 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.160
 I was setting it up here myself 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.460
 was applying here and will come at the wheel 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.460
 to the left 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.270
 clicking here 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:04.150
 and turning the wheel to the right 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.700
 This is wrong with this setting. 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.580
 game was crying that way 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.160
 I showed he was not finishing the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.020
 course 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.350
 then on this page you can not 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.780
 to set up 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.200
 you can not click here and move on 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.720
 steering wheel you have to say associate the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.730
 format the steering wheel I say 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.700
 the axis your right you have to 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.000
 unlink it from this page 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.410
 so I went here I'm going to score 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 anything else striking the keyboard 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.580
 right 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.020
 Now come on back in the game to see 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.020
 how did it go 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.430
 now you can see that the steering wheel 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.430
 will follow to the end 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:00.140
 the steering wheel accompanies until the end is not 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.890
 Plus that problem with him coming here 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.680
 in the middle will come to the end 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.030
 follow to the end now 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.140
 well then that's what was problem I 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.190
 was having 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:16.090
 it 's not a big deal but it's a lot 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.090
 the head to discover 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:25.340
