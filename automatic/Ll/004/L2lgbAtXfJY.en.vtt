00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.480

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.989
 this is the folder to your complete 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.060
 mw2 is stored there you go in the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:12.090
 folder maine and into the folder iw 01 ewd 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.369
 in images the idea files you can 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.560
 By the way, with winrar open right-click 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.479
 open with winrar if not there 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.470
 open with is easy also open and 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.660
 then have winrar exe raussuchen so here 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.789
 now the idea 01 ewd opened and here 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.130
 the files from the pro rata must 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.959
 you all here over ten and then 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.160
 have you already installed the prora? 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:37.800
 also i-point xd but if that's you 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.690
 I've installed blue for what I have before 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.330
 a video made about a week ago 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.520
 you have to do it a little differently 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.789
 then you do not go in my and 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.670
 in the idea 01 ewd but you go the 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.399
 m 2 demo and underlined in the z 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.500
 website two points idea and there the 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.610
 images and copies the files from the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.280
 points 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.729
 in this folder so that with the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.140
 blue hat does not get in the way then 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.080
 you have everything installed 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.970
 So as I said if you have the blue 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.020
 do not just have the files from the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.270
 proa points also textfile in the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.820
 main and in vienna 01 ev.de copy 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.860
 just out of me with winrar and if you 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.660
 the blue one has 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.210
 well installed to me yes too 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.570
 video just in the m 2 demo 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.790
 folder in the z difference webs v2 gwd 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.250
 as well then open with winrar then easy 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.710
 here in the images folder and I hope 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.630
 you have a lot of fun with the koran 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.140
 nice round mw2 and until the next 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.750
 times 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.550
 but for now you have to pay attention to that 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.990
 the gate but not on all maps 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.820
 it only works when it works 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.230
 which you indicated so afghanen 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.350
 and so on it works everywhere 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.090
 and also on one of the dlc maps but on 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.040
 storm and so it works 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.990
 I do not believe and on the yukon too 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.459
 but not here you always see the map 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.770
 Names and then you can see if it 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.870
 on the map is or not but on the 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.870
 Most will be fine until then
