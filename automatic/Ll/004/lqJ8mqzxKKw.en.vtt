00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.480 

this<00:01:56.350> would<00:01:56.530> be<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.740> other<00:01:56.860> one<00:01:57.070> here<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.310> don't

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
this would be the other one here I don't

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.830 
this would be the other one here I don't
even<00:01:57.610> know<00:01:57.850> if<00:01:57.939> it<00:01:58.030> has<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.180> name<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.659> it<00:01:58.689> it's

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
even know if it has a name to it it's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.460 
even know if it has a name to it it's
it's<00:02:01.840> pretty<00:02:02.110> much<00:02:02.350> not<00:02:03.750> worth<00:02:04.750> anything<00:02:05.079> I

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
it's pretty much not worth anything I

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.590 
it's pretty much not worth anything I
mean<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:06.039> know<00:02:06.159> it's<00:02:06.729> great<00:02:07.030> for<00:02:07.329> you<00:02:07.539> know

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.789 

but<00:02:15.879> the<00:02:16.950> mbm<00:02:17.950> 88<00:02:18.459> on<00:02:18.640> directional<00:02:19.180> microphone

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
but the mbm 88 on directional microphone

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.020 
but the mbm 88 on directional microphone
is<00:02:20.799> definitely<00:02:21.900> definitely<00:02:22.900> 100%<00:02:23.230> worth<00:02:23.680> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
is definitely definitely 100% worth the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.030 
is definitely definitely 100% worth the
$30<00:02:25.030> or<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.450> 1699<00:02:26.230> which<00:02:26.440> i<00:02:26.590> paid<00:02:26.769> for<00:02:26.980> the
