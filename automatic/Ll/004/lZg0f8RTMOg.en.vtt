hey guys a samurai panda again with

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.700 
hey guys a samurai panda again with
another<00:00:02.939> discovery<00:00:03.659> that<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:03.929> made<00:00:04.170> last<00:00:04.500> night

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
another discovery that I made last night

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.540 
another discovery that I made last night
and<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.390> big<00:00:06.540> one<00:00:06.720> this<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.200> well<00:00:07.890> big

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
and this is the big one this is well big

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.740 
and this is the big one this is well big
is<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.730> relative<00:00:08.760> word<00:00:09.410> but<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.950> one<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:12.360> new

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
is a relative word but this one is a new

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.490 
is a relative word but this one is a new
advanced<00:00:13.740> technique<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.370> call<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.780> dash

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
advanced technique I call it the dash

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.310 
advanced technique I call it the dash
pivot<00:00:17.039> cancel<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.940> DPC<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.930> dash<00:00:19.109> whippet

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
pivot cancel the DPC the dash whippet

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.230 
pivot cancel the DPC the dash whippet
cancel<00:00:19.800> because<00:00:19.980> literally<00:00:20.910> what<00:00:21.119> you're

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
cancel because literally what you're

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.000 
cancel because literally what you're
doing<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.660> you're<00:00:21.869> dashing<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.800> you're

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
doing is you're dashing and you're

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.050 
doing is you're dashing and you're
pivoting<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.420> pivot<00:00:24.779> animation

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
pivoting and in that pivot animation

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.009 
pivoting and in that pivot animation
soon<00:00:27.060> after<00:00:27.300> your<00:00:27.359> pivot<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.750> start<00:00:27.930> moving

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
soon after your pivot you start moving

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.959 
soon after your pivot you start moving
forward<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:29.189> can<00:00:29.340> actually<00:00:29.609> cancel<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.630> into

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
forward you can actually cancel it into

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.299 
forward you can actually cancel it into
anything<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.090> really<00:00:33.360> want<00:00:33.570> well<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.500> take

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
anything you really want well I take

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.250 
anything you really want well I take
that<00:00:35.370> back<00:00:35.520> not<00:00:35.880> quite<00:00:36.090> sure<00:00:36.260> canceled

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
that back not quite sure canceled

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.900 
that back not quite sure canceled
everything<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:38.899> it's<00:00:40.010> you<00:00:41.010> know<00:00:41.070> useful

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
everything but it's you know useful

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.910 
everything but it's you know useful
because<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:44.070> back<00:00:44.340> your<00:00:44.760> character<00:00:45.270> will

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
because the back your character will

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.200 
because the back your character will
slide<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:48.289> like<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> way<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.559> looks<00:00:49.590> k<00:00:50.190> XE<00:00:50.489> has<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
slide I like the way it looks k XE has a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.119 
slide I like the way it looks k XE has a
nice<00:00:51.510> little<00:00:51.690> slide<00:00:51.960> sometimes<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.710> timing

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
nice little slide sometimes the timing

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.950 
nice little slide sometimes the timing
is<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:54.030> some<00:00:54.270> time<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.780> get<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
is that with some time you can get a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.709 
is that with some time you can get a
really<00:00:55.379> nice<00:00:55.500> slide<00:00:55.829> other<00:00:56.070> ppl<00:00:56.550> other<00:00:57.390> time

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
really nice slide other ppl other time

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.939 
really nice slide other ppl other time
and<00:00:57.930> you'll<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.170> kind<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.379> stand<00:00:58.590> there<00:00:58.770> dude

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and you'll just kind of stand there dude

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.640 
and you'll just kind of stand there dude
for<00:00:59.190> smack<00:01:03.199> see<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:05.040> you're<00:01:05.339> basically<00:01:05.489> just

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
for smack see so you're basically just

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.740 
for smack see so you're basically just
dashing<00:01:07.650> pivoting<00:01:08.430> holding<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> second

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
dashing pivoting holding it for a second

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.350 
dashing pivoting holding it for a second
of<00:01:09.869> all<00:01:10.020> ok<00:01:10.049> who<00:01:10.439> moves<00:01:10.619> forward<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.360> then

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
of all ok who moves forward and then

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.850 
of all ok who moves forward and then
with<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.540> right<00:01:12.689> timing<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.290> get<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.650> sit

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
with the right timing you get to see sit

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.630 
with the right timing you get to see sit
in<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.979> office<00:01:14.130> direction<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:16.100> it's<00:01:17.100> quite

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
in the office direction and it's quite

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.880 
in the office direction and it's quite
simple<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.970> do<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.270> timing<00:01:18.570> every<00:01:19.470> caper<00:01:19.680> has

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
simple to do with timing every caper has

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.039 
simple to do with timing every caper has
a<00:01:19.920> different<00:01:20.310> window<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.360> cancel<00:01:21.570> some

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
a different window you can cancel some

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.289 
a different window you can cancel some
characters<00:01:22.470> don't<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.580> useful<00:01:24.000> window

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
characters don't have a useful window

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.359 
characters don't have a useful window
like<00:01:24.570> Mario<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.110> example<00:01:25.530> he<00:01:25.860> can't<00:01:26.100> slide

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
like Mario for example he can't slide

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.870 
like Mario for example he can't slide
with<00:01:26.520> his<00:01:26.670> because<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> windows<00:01:27.360> very<00:01:27.840> task

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
with his because the windows very task

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.060 
with his because the windows very task
you<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.000> do<00:01:30.119> other<00:01:30.240> things<00:01:30.390> including<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
you can do other things including the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.420 
you can do other things including the
way<00:01:32.159> discover<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:32.850> actually

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
way discover this was actually

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.820 
way discover this was actually
with<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:34.880> down<00:01:35.060> smash<00:01:35.710> unfortunately<00:01:36.710> you

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
with the down smash unfortunately you

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.290 
with the down smash unfortunately you
can<00:01:36.950> only<00:01:37.010> do<00:01:37.280> down<00:01:37.430> smash<00:01:37.730> kind<00:01:38.000> of<00:01:38.060> going

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
can only do down smash kind of going

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.420 
can only do down smash kind of going
after<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.590> pivot<00:01:39.860> forwards<00:01:42.040> but<00:01:43.040> you<00:01:43.220> can<00:01:43.340> do

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
after the pivot forwards but you can do

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.920 
after the pivot forwards but you can do
a<00:01:43.460> sliding<00:01:43.880> down<00:01:44.030> smash<00:01:44.270> that's<00:01:44.420> quite<00:01:44.750> enough

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
a sliding down smash that's quite enough

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.570 
a sliding down smash that's quite enough
with<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:45.920> many<00:01:46.100> characters<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:49.310> are

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
with the many characters and you are

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.260 
with the many characters and you are
able<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.180> cut<00:01:50.360> go<00:01:50.870> and<00:01:51.140> do<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:52.270> sliding

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
able to cut go and do the sliding

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.530 
able to cut go and do the sliding
forward<00:01:53.750> smash<00:01:53.990> forwards<00:01:54.680> a<00:01:54.920> few<00:01:55.250> dash<00:01:55.540> but

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
forward smash forwards a few dash but

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.000 
forward smash forwards a few dash but
you'll<00:01:56.869> have<00:01:57.410> to<00:01:57.470> let<00:01:57.650> go<00:01:57.800> of<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:57.920> control

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
you'll have to let go of the control

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.800 
you'll have to let go of the control
stick<00:01:58.460> at<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.180> right<00:01:59.300> time<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:01.630> they<00:02:02.630> don't

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
stick at the right time and they don't

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.150 
stick at the right time and they don't
really<00:02:02.900> get<00:02:03.080> much<00:02:03.140> of<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.380> slider<00:02:03.590> also<00:02:04.070> it's

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
really get much of a slider also it's

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.100 
really get much of a slider also it's
kind<00:02:04.369> of<00:02:04.400> useless<00:02:04.520> as<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:05.660> see<00:02:05.810> right<00:02:05.840> there

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
kind of useless as you see right there

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.389 
kind of useless as you see right there
you<00:02:06.260> did<00:02:06.440> get<00:02:06.590> a<00:02:06.619> little<00:02:06.680> bit<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:06.950> slide<00:02:07.160> but

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
you did get a little bit of slide but

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.639 
you did get a little bit of slide but
still<00:02:08.179> I'm<00:02:08.330> not<00:02:08.479> quite<00:02:08.660> sure<00:02:08.690> when<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:09.380> use

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
still I'm not quite sure when you use

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.699 
still I'm not quite sure when you use
the<00:02:09.830> slider<00:02:10.100> down<00:02:10.340> smash<00:02:10.640> one<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.959> adaptive

just<00:02:15.470> don't<00:02:15.650> really<00:02:15.830> know<00:02:16.010> in<00:02:16.580> what

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
just don't really know in what

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.559 
just don't really know in what
situations<00:02:17.330> that's<00:02:18.110> useful

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.860

it<00:02:26.609> some<00:02:27.389> you<00:02:27.780> can<00:02:27.900> do<00:02:28.049> it<00:02:28.200> but<00:02:29.159> it's<00:02:29.310> not

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
it some you can do it but it's not

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.879 
it some you can do it but it's not

to do with Yoshi he has a really long
window<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:45.989> cancel<00:02:46.439> and<00:02:46.650> he<00:02:47.040> has<00:02:47.189> a<00:02:47.219> long<00:02:47.579> slide

two to the back door anywhere along that

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.140 
two to the back door anywhere along that
I<00:02:51.150> can<00:02:51.389> which<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.629> kind<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:52.849> do<00:02:53.849> a<00:02:53.879> forward

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
I can which is kind of do a forward

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.409 
I can which is kind of do a forward
smash<00:02:54.469> or<00:02:55.469> down<00:02:55.829> smash<00:02:56.069> be<00:02:56.310> like<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.879> was<00:02:57.299> like

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
smash or down smash be like I was like

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.500 
smash or down smash be like I was like
before<00:02:57.689> smash<00:02:58.079> was<00:02:58.290> fun<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:59.250> think<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.239> was<00:03:00.329> also

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
before smash was fun I think I was also

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.339 
before smash was fun I think I was also
able<00:03:00.719> to<00:03:00.870> get<00:03:01.079> this<00:03:01.319> all<00:03:01.650> labeled<00:03:02.189> down<00:03:02.340> tilts

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
able to get this all labeled down tilts

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.470 
able to get this all labeled down tilts
like<00:03:04.349> that<00:03:04.560> do<00:03:04.949> a<00:03:04.980> sliding<00:03:05.400> down<00:03:05.549> closer<00:03:06.709> I

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
like that do a sliding down closer I

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.360 
like that do a sliding down closer I
think<00:03:09.480> those<00:03:09.599> able<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.870> be<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.959> full<00:03:10.349> self<00:03:11.219> at

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
think those able to be a full self at

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.939 
think those able to be a full self at
one<00:03:11.549> point<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:14.540> bet<00:03:15.540> simply<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.230> stick<00:03:16.829> and

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
one point I bet simply a stick and

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:18.289 
one point I bet simply a stick and
you'll<00:03:17.069> be<00:03:17.189> able<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.400> get<00:03:17.489> forward<00:03:17.699> tilt<00:03:17.909> but<00:03:18.090> I

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
you'll be able to get forward tilt but I

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.209 
you'll be able to get forward tilt but I
guess<00:03:18.780> that's<00:03:19.230> only<00:03:19.349> really<00:03:19.590> affected<00:03:19.919> snake

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:20.219 
guess that's only really affected snake

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:24.439 
guess that's only really affected snake
or<00:03:20.370> something<00:03:21.319> um<00:03:22.730> really<00:03:23.730> long<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.389> really

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
or something um really long and really

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.080 
or something um really long and really
easy<00:03:25.139> to<00:03:25.290> do<00:03:25.349> yo<00:03:25.829> she's<00:03:26.069> got<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.489> trouble<00:03:26.639> or

for<00:04:11.920> smash<00:04:12.160> which<00:04:12.340> surprised<00:04:12.670> me<00:04:12.880> because<00:04:12.910> I

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
for smash which surprised me because I

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150 
for smash which surprised me because I
thought<00:04:13.330> I'd<00:04:13.480> cancel<00:04:13.930> momentum<00:04:14.500> but<00:04:14.680> it

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
thought I'd cancel momentum but it

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.300 
thought I'd cancel momentum but it

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
when we were dead and the reason why I

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
consider him the second best is because

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.530 
consider him the second best is because
he<00:04:23.260> can<00:04:23.380> do<00:04:23.440> things<00:04:23.680> like<00:04:23.770> oh<00:04:24.160> well<00:04:24.970> because

for smash is pretty nice new things like
that<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:31.050> backwards<00:04:32.050> morning<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:33.310> like<00:04:33.340> you're

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
that a backwards morning so like you're

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.610 
that a backwards morning so like you're
shielding<00:04:34.300> or<00:04:34.390> just<00:04:34.720> drop<00:04:34.870> a<00:04:34.900> shield<00:04:35.230> to<00:04:35.350> like

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620

timing the right sliding and everything

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.640 
timing the right sliding and everything
like<00:04:41.050> that<00:04:41.130> I<00:04:42.870> mean<00:04:43.870> it's<00:04:43.960> pretty<00:04:44.080> useful<00:04:44.290> also

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
like that I mean it's pretty useful also

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.110 
like that I mean it's pretty useful also
like<00:04:44.980> say<00:04:45.190> they're<00:04:45.340> recovering<00:04:45.669> from<00:04:45.970> the

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
like say they're recovering from the

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.200 
like say they're recovering from the
edge<00:04:46.270> or<00:04:46.510> something<00:04:47.040> and<00:04:48.040> they<00:04:48.160> grab<00:04:48.430> it<00:04:48.669> then

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
edge or something and they grab it then

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.690 
edge or something and they grab it then
you<00:04:49.780> can<00:04:49.930> kind<00:04:50.050> of<00:04:50.140> dash<00:04:50.350> forward<00:04:50.740> depending

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
you can kind of dash forward depending

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.540 
you can kind of dash forward depending
on what<00:04:51.850> they<00:04:51.970> did<00:04:52.120> we<00:04:52.180> can<00:04:52.330> lead<00:04:52.510> them<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:54.220> hit

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
on what they did we can lead them to hit

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.330 
on what they did we can lead them to hit
it<00:04:54.669> in<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.850> dance<00:04:55.150> match<00:04:55.419> and<00:04:56.260> slide<00:04:57.010> forward

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
it in the dance match and slide forward

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.980 
it in the dance match and slide forward
and<00:04:57.460> if<00:04:57.640> they<00:04:58.000> roll<00:04:58.240> up<00:04:58.270> like<00:05:00.690> even<00:05:01.690> like<00:05:01.750> that

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
and if they roll up like even like that

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.730 
and if they roll up like even like that
or<00:05:02.229> can<00:05:03.010> kind<00:05:03.220> of<00:05:03.250> do<00:05:03.370> it<00:05:03.490> and<00:05:04.350> if<00:05:05.350> you<00:05:05.500> look<00:05:05.620> at

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
or can kind of do it and if you look at

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.610 
or can kind of do it and if you look at
that<00:05:05.860> too<00:05:06.330> little<00:05:07.330> bit<00:05:07.419> a<00:05:07.450> little<00:05:07.510> bit<00:05:07.720> more<00:05:08.140> of

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
that too little bit a little bit more of

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.340 
that too little bit a little bit more of
a<00:05:08.740> slide<00:05:08.979> if<00:05:09.280> you<00:05:09.310> hold<00:05:09.790> it<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.630> way<00:05:11.020> you<00:05:11.080> do<00:05:11.320> it

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
a slide if you hold it the way you do it

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.140 
a slide if you hold it the way you do it
is<00:05:11.530> quite<00:05:11.890> simple<00:05:12.250> after<00:05:12.880> you<00:05:12.940> hit<00:05:13.000> the

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
is quite simple after you hit the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.100 
is quite simple after you hit the
c-stick<00:05:13.510> you<00:05:13.690> hold<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.530> Z<00:05:14.680> button<00:05:14.919> to<00:05:15.430> target

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
c-stick you hold the Z button to target

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.110 
c-stick you hold the Z button to target
similar<00:05:17.110> to<00:05:17.290> say<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.740> motor<00:05:17.950> slide<00:05:18.220> which

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
similar to say the motor slide which

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.090 
similar to say the motor slide which
brings<00:05:19.870> me<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.470> character<00:05:20.770> that<00:05:20.800> does

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
brings me to the character that does

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.580 
brings me to the character that does
