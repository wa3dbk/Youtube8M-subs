00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hi there, this is a review of the game metro last 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.569
 light last light is a direct sequel 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.309
 Metro 2033 which is not my time 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.900
 really enjoyed it yes it was good 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.849
 game but what it was made 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.849
 Ukrainian developers felt 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.250
 immediately the gameplay was crooked the plot strongly 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.690
 different and inferior books source 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.180
 schedule and left a good impression 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.279
 but optimization left much to be desired 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.470
 so I didn’t particularly expect continuation and 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.240
 turned out to be very pleasantly surprised metro 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.369
 last light is not inferior at all 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.660
 quality western product that in 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.000
 the process of passing completely 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.280
 you forget that we did it, I say 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.230
 ours because so in Russian attributed 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.030
 yourself to the success of the other side which 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.680
 no longer part of russia in turin as 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.050
 domestic game dev is on 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.719
 the very day in general the difference compared to 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.280
 Metro 2033 on face graphics leaves 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.750
 very pleasant impression 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.300
 if you are certainly not one of those who love 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.219
 engage in deep analytics work with 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.110
 the light is very cool all that is 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.940
 a few meters from the player looks like 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.829
 very smooth and nice plot pretty 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.750
 interesting firstly because it 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.640
 continuation of the artema story which 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.229
 The book is written in the second there were over 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.479
 The plot and dialogue worked himself Dmitri 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.860
 Glukhovsky author of books or it is noticeable in 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.869
 development process he was so carried away 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.659
 creating material that I decided to write 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.530
 new subway book 2035 storyline 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.930
 which will enter 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.850
 history of metro last light only more 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.830
 detail and expanded the game is very 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.420
 fascinating obviously done on the patterns 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.729
 half-life 2 that is, we periodically 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.590
 we visit peaceful locations in some 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.540
 The moment we are given transport and closer to 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.759
 the end of the chorus begins the episodes with monsters 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.170
 styles we don't go to ravenholm and even 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.070
 there is a boss resembling a queen 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.780
 antlions 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.729
 while each station in the game is very 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.290
 interesting and meter can not go no 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.509
 stumbled upon a long conversation and her 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.759
 dwellers wander elderly station dries 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.409
 conversation can be half an hour new episodes 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.899
 on the surface we fall into the most 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.000
 recognizable places this and vnh with his 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.399
 rockets of the Ostankino television tower and 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.590
 hotels space it and kremlin with red 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.149
 area if you are a resident of moscow then 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.219
 such moments the game will surely please you 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.350
 also pleased that the game has become more 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.450
 mystics than before because in the books was 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.610
 I really want to have it is not logical that 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.680
 touches the gameplay then shooting arrows 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.260
 become much better than before stealth me 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.300
 really liked 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.040
 can twist bulbs and throw knives 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.780
 and the murder near animated and 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.670
 differently depending on which 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.470
 hand you go to the enemy like everything 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.600
 equally pretty stupid about monsters i 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.640
 generally keep silence battle with them all the same 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.860
 curves as before they have torn 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.630
 animations they sometimes jump over walls and 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.460
 through the main character sometimes he doesn't 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.620
 defends their damage is hard to see 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.960
 on a gray background marsh monsters at all 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.210
 measure in asphalt they break off everything 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.400
 crooked as the subway 2033 is that a weapon 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.230
 Now it feels nicer in the game a lot 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.300
 their guns can be different from 10 a 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.100
 ammunition is almost always enough although 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.110
 episode in the catacombs I was left only 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.790
 only with ammo money 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.710
 use instead of usually but very 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.330
 sorry happiness did not have them on the boss 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.700
 me the episode still went not very 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.230
 fun i blame before this episode 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.300
 it was possible to buy well 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.430
 just started to talk about a spoonful of tar that 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.470
 noticed that at the end the game is losing ground 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.090
 compared to the cool start of the episode on 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.070
 surface in the rain with monsters 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.990
 Looks mildly dirty nauseous 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.120
 grafon on the surface leaves a very 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.130
 unpleasant impression all around sulfur 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.230
 texture resolution on buildings is so much 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.450
 low that even labor back texture 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.890
 around running monster with tattered animation 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.170
 the hero is in a gas mask on 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.239
 which drips rain and blood and 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.770
 be in such a situation at the end 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.600
 games have quite often what 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.700
 absolutely not happy and spoil the final 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.739
 gaming experience is something else you 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.720
 noticed that during flashbacks from 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.550
 childhood artem people on the street 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.769
 botanical garden all go in the same 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.310
 training loops as in the subway 20 years 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.530
 later 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.390
 I do not know how they have there in Ukraine but we 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.280
 in summer, people normally dress in 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.440
 vest with old dirty jackets 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.269
 I think about the second was stupidly lazy to do 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.160
 normal clothes for this scene hope 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.810
 what you will not notice in general on the basis of 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.720
 metro last light deserves me as a 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.200
 residents of Moscow, their 8 bedrooms and points of 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.390
 ten 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.730
 and if you metro its atmosphere do not touch 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.300
 then this is 8 and that 's all thanks to all 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.010
 Attention 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.340
 My name is Daniel yet 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.470
 I don’t even know how much 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.569
 now the rest of the artist produce 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.569
 impression to the public in
