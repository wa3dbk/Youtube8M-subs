00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
eventually got the first goal of the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.030 
eventually got the first goal of the
game<00:02:26.250> he<00:02:26.850> got<00:02:27.060> through<00:02:27.830> finding<00:02:28.830> very

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
game he got through finding very

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.460 
game he got through finding very
difficult<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.580> get<00:02:29.700> hold<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.030> ball<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.810> again

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
difficult to get hold the ball and again

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.070 
difficult to get hold the ball and again
he<00:02:31.560> played<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.800> ball<00:02:32.070> through<00:02:32.630> Ozil<00:02:33.630> with<00:02:33.840> on

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
he played the ball through Ozil with on

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.810 
he played the ball through Ozil with on
real<00:02:34.260> pace<00:02:34.530> but<00:02:35.220> actually<00:02:35.460> we<00:02:35.520> had<00:02:35.610> something

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
real pace but actually we had something

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.310 
real pace but actually we had something
kind<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.300> strange<00:02:36.390> happened<00:02:36.930> then<00:02:37.050> we<00:02:37.200> had<00:02:37.290> a

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
kind of strange happened then we had a

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.320 
kind of strange happened then we had a
lost<00:02:37.530> connection<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.070> match<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:39.000> we<00:02:39.210> had<00:02:39.300> a

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
lost connection to the match so we had a

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.720 
lost connection to the match so we had a
rematch<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.800> actually<00:02:40.980> got<00:02:41.250> through<00:02:41.280> and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
rematch and I actually got through and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.910 
rematch and I actually got through and
scored<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.420> first<00:02:42.600> goal<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.810> match<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.770> it's

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
scored the first goal a match so it's

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.170 
scored the first goal a match so it's
quite<00:02:44.010> funny<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.400> I'd<00:02:44.490> managed<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.940> get<00:02:45.120> a

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
quite funny that I'd managed to get a

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.260 
quite funny that I'd managed to get a
lead<00:02:45.690> from<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.290> other<00:02:46.680> game<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.220> kept<00:02:48.120> on

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
lead from the other game and kept on

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.900 
lead from the other game and kept on
playing<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.830> managed<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.890> get<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.370> second

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
playing and managed to get the second

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.910 
playing and managed to get the second
goal<00:02:50.940> again<00:02:51.300> we'd<00:02:51.450> Rob<00:02:51.630> with<00:02:51.780> some<00:02:51.930> nice<00:02:52.140> skill

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
goal again we'd Rob with some nice skill

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.280 
goal again we'd Rob with some nice skill
for<00:02:53.100> him<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.310> get<00:02:53.430> through<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:54.630> realized<00:02:55.080> I

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
for him to get through and I realized I

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.810 
for him to get through and I realized I
should<00:02:55.440> really<00:02:55.710> give<00:02:55.830> him<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.010> goal<00:02:56.220> back<00:02:56.460> so

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
should really give him the goal back so

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.360 
should really give him the goal back so
I<00:02:57.290> decided<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.500> shoot<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.860> my<00:02:59.100> own<00:02:59.160> they're

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
I decided to shoot a my own they're

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.430 
I decided to shoot a my own they're
given<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.000> ball<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.450> let<00:03:00.960> him<00:03:01.050> have<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.170> gold

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
given the ball I let him have that gold

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.690 
given the ball I let him have that gold
back<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.830> he<00:03:01.890> scored<00:03:02.070> earlier<00:03:02.460> because<00:03:02.580> I

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
back that he scored earlier because I

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.040 
back that he scored earlier because I
thought<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.000> wasn't<00:03:03.150> really<00:03:03.420> fair<00:03:03.630> kind<00:03:03.960> of

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
thought it wasn't really fair kind of

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.500 
thought it wasn't really fair kind of
forgot<00:03:04.260> about<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.470> goal<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:05.360> let<00:03:06.360> him<00:03:06.450> have

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
forgot about that goal and let him have

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.120 
forgot about that goal and let him have
the<00:03:06.630> gold<00:03:06.780> back<00:03:07.020> and<00:03:07.320> then<00:03:07.590> it's<00:03:07.740> what<00:03:07.920> we're

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
the gold back and then it's what we're

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.160

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
all square now basically because he's

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.260
