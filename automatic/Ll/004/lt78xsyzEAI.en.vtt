 Hello everyone, Barry here and welcome to My Virgin Kitchen. I'm with Stephan today 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.380
 from Berlin, Germany. Hi everyone. How are you doing? Good. Great, he is 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.540
 come all the way here to meet me and together we have this fantastic coconut chicken 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.509
 come all the way here to meet me and together we have this fantastic coconut chicken 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:23.169
 How would you describe the taste of this? Creamy and authentic Indian flavors and scents. 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.980
 And so it is, even with a nice spicy pepper and coriander that is also there. If 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.779
 if you want to make this also click on pause as soon as Stephan snaps his fingers. 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.260
 Okay, click on pause, note the ingredients. And see how we made it. 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.650
 First of all, grab a nice big pan with some oil in it and let it get well hot before 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.550
 you add the onion to it, a whole onion that you have chopped, 2 garlic cloves that you have also chopped, 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.230
 a piece of ginger of 2 centimeters, that gives such a nice sharp taste. 3 tablespoons curry powder 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.930
 and then the turmeric for that beautiful yellow-orange contrast, 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.210
 and some freshly sliced ​​red pepper. Experiment primarily with the quantities. It looks now 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.500
 good looking. You have to see those colors, delicious. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.620
 Now it was time for the main ingredient of this recipe, right, Stephan? Yes, we added 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.640
 the chicken pieces. They are a lot juicier than chicken fillets. Certainly, chicken pieces 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.550
 are very tasty in a curry. Led by Stephan 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.010
 we took brown rice. We cooked it according to the package, right? Not. We cooked 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.920
 the rice three minutes longer as indicated. It was not even pasta-al dente. 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.159
 It was indeed quite loud. But we have to do even more before the curry is ready. 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.659
 That is nice while the rice is cooking. Well, add the canned tomatoes, the coconut milk 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.890
 and the peanut butter. Also add the freshly sliced ​​coriander and let it bubble. 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.150
 You can let it bubble for twenty minutes, while the rice does the same. 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.530
 In this way the flavors are distributed throughout the dish and the room. 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.869
 Did you also smell it so good? Absolutely! Yes it certainly did. Feel free 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.119
 to play with the flavors by adding some chili flakes or 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.080
 salt, pepper, and maybe some curry powder. Adjust it to your taste. 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.370
 As soon as it is ready, you take rice, or not cooked according to the instructions 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.890
 or cooked a little longer than. Put the rice in a large, old bowl and spoon the chicken curry over it. 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.920
 Maybe with a little more sauce, if you want. Some fresh coriander and pepper to top it off. 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.170
 It tasted really great. So that was it then. Stephan, thank you so much for going 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.780
 come to my kitchen. Thank you for letting me come. Pretty silly to be here, sure? Sure. 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.900
 But this is a really good curry, we already ate it. Try it yourself 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.040

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.040
 Ha, that sounds like an app, smart, you know! That's it for now, until 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.430
 the next time!
