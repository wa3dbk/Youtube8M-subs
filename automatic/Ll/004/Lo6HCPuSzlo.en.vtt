the play yet ended here once the contact

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.710 
the play yet ended here once the contact
is<00:01:31.950> made<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.310> know<00:01:32.400> real<00:01:32.909> quick<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.479> show

is made you know real quick just to show
you<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.530> you've<00:01:34.799> got<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.340> defensive

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
you you know you've got a defensive

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.740 
you you know you've got a defensive
tackle<00:01:36.420> that's<00:01:36.600> 64<00:01:37.460> 303<00:01:38.460> pounds<00:01:38.850> you've<00:01:39.509> got<00:01:39.720> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
tackle that's 64 303 pounds you've got a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.100 
tackle that's 64 303 pounds you've got a
running<00:01:40.140> back<00:01:40.320> that's<00:01:40.619> 5<00:01:40.950> 11<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:42.090> 25<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.020> know

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
running back that's 5 11 to 25 you know

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.200 
running back that's 5 11 to 25 you know
I<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.649> fact<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.310> arm<00:01:44.520> does<00:01:44.909> come

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
I like the fact that the arm does come

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.289 
I like the fact that the arm does come
out<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:47.130> looks<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.579> if<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.090> going<00:01:48.210> to

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
out and it looks as if this is going to

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.139 
out and it looks as if this is going to
be<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> tackle<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.640> essentially<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:50.729> happens

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
be a tackle but essentially what happens

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.389 
be a tackle but essentially what happens
is<00:01:51.329> my<00:01:51.869> defensive<00:01:52.380> lineman<00:01:52.740> falls<00:01:52.979> down<00:01:53.220> on

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
is my defensive lineman falls down on

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.789 
is my defensive lineman falls down on
the<00:01:53.490> ground<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.090> shawn<00:01:54.840> green<00:01:55.140> extends<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the ground and shawn green extends to

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.850 
the ground and shawn green extends to
play<00:01:56.070> about<00:01:56.369> another<00:01:56.899> 23<00:01:57.899> yards<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.469> i<00:01:58.799> know

inches I mean it's I know that's cliche

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.359 
inches I mean it's I know that's cliche
but<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.270> very<00:02:06.570> much<00:02:06.869> true<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:08.190> a

gameplay sequences this play could have

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.670 
gameplay sequences this play could have
been<00:02:13.170> properly

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680

replicated<00:02:14.250> I'm<00:02:14.489> going<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.760> show<00:02:14.909> you<00:02:14.969> some

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
replicated I'm going to show you some

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.789 
replicated I'm going to show you some
examples<00:02:15.329> in<00:02:15.750> aa<00:02:15.810> pro<00:02:16.019> football<00:02:16.409> so<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.650> have

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
examples in aa pro football so you have

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.039 
examples in aa pro football so you have
a<00:02:16.829> better<00:02:17.069> idea<00:02:17.129> of<00:02:17.430> what<00:02:17.549> I'm<00:02:17.640> talking<00:02:17.969> about

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
a better idea of what I'm talking about

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.509 
a better idea of what I'm talking about
alright<00:02:19.049> so<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.319> last<00:02:19.620> example<00:02:19.829> just

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
alright so in this last example just

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.550 
alright so in this last example just
want<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.730> talk<00:02:20.909> about<00:02:21.090> some<00:02:21.959> dynamic

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
want to talk about some dynamic

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.259 
want to talk about some dynamic
interactions<00:02:23.189> that<00:02:23.310> occur<00:02:23.430> here<00:02:23.939> and<00:02:24.120> it's

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
interactions that occur here and it's

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.569 
interactions that occur here and it's
all<00:02:24.480> based<00:02:24.750> off<00:02:24.959> reaching<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.739> terms<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
all based off reaching in terms of the

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.420 
all based off reaching in terms of the
defensive<00:02:27.090> line<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.890> know<00:02:29.010> there's<00:02:29.280> some

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
defensive line and you know there's some

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.459 
defensive line and you know there's some
shifting<00:02:29.849> there's<00:02:30.329> some<00:02:30.510> warping<00:02:30.959> that

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469 
shifting there's some warping that

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:33.649 
shifting there's some warping that
happens<00:02:31.829> here<00:02:32.010> but<00:02:32.159> I<00:02:32.219> can<00:02:32.400> deal<00:02:32.579> with<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.849> as<00:02:33.030> I

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
happens here but I can deal with it as I

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.539 
happens here but I can deal with it as I
approach<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.230> line<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:34.590> can<00:02:34.739> see<00:02:35.010> this

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
approach the line you can see this

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.149 
approach the line you can see this
defensive<00:02:36.060> tackle<00:02:36.599> beats<00:02:37.230> his<00:02:37.439> man<00:02:37.620> he<00:02:37.859> comes

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
defensive tackle beats his man he comes

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.000 
defensive tackle beats his man he comes
over<00:02:38.480> reaches<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.689> and<00:02:39.930> like<00:02:40.469> we<00:02:40.680> maybe<00:02:40.889> should

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
over reaches in and like we maybe should

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.420 
over reaches in and like we maybe should
have<00:02:41.340> seen<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:42.170> Madden<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:44.010> see<00:02:44.189> that<00:02:44.340> my

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
have seen in Madden you see that my

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.460 
have seen in Madden you see that my
progress<00:02:44.730> gets<00:02:45.180> stopped<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.200> start

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
progress gets stopped and I start

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.610 
progress gets stopped and I start
yelling<00:02:46.769> backwards<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.489> sets<00:02:47.879> up<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.989> next

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
yelling backwards it sets up this next

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.369 
yelling backwards it sets up this next
safety<00:02:50.370> who<00:02:50.549> came<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.209> Blitz<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:52.230> get

safety who came in on the Blitz to get

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.649 
safety who came in on the Blitz to get
in<00:02:52.470> contact<00:02:52.739> with<00:02:53.310> me<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.700> then<00:02:54.269> here's<00:02:54.510> where

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
in contact with me and then here's where

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.119 
in contact with me and then here's where
we<00:02:54.750> talked<00:02:54.930> about<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> little<00:02:55.409> bit<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.709> shifting

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
we talked about a little bit of shifting

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.470 
we talked about a little bit of shifting
a<00:02:56.280> little<00:02:56.340> bit<00:02:56.669> of<00:02:56.760> morphing<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.209> see<00:02:57.359> number

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
a little bit of morphing you see number

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.420 
a little bit of morphing you see number
21<00:02:58.019> kind<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.319> gets<00:02:58.439> forced<00:02:58.739> out<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.129> play

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
21 kind of gets forced out of the play

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.520 
21 kind of gets forced out of the play
because<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:00.269> game<00:03:00.480> was<00:03:00.689> limited<00:03:01.139> to<00:03:01.169> three
