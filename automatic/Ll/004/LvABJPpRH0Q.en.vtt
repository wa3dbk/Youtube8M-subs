00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
mean a lot a lot of it has been one just

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.420 
mean a lot a lot of it has been one just
in<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.510> making<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> feel<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.800> since<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.219> was

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
in the making I I feel like since I was

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.630 
in the making I I feel like since I was
10<00:00:48.180> 11<00:00:48.210> years<00:00:48.510> old<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:49.079> wine<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.739> bring<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:50.070> future

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
10 11 years old a wine to bring a future

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.180 
10 11 years old a wine to bring a future
world<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.210> life<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.140> finally<00:00:52.469> given

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
world to life and so I was finally given

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.939 
world to life and so I was finally given
the<00:00:53.399> chance<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:54.000> able<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.949> and

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the chance to be able to do that and and

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.529 
the chance to be able to do that and and
so<00:00:56.160> there's<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.430> lot<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.670> ideas<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.210> there<00:00:57.360> that

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
so there's a lot of ideas in there that

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.160 
so there's a lot of ideas in there that
I've<00:00:58.050> been<00:00:58.730> really<00:00:59.730> thinking<00:00:59.850> about<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
I've been really thinking about and and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.020 
I've been really thinking about and and
you<00:01:02.070> know<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.219> terms<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.699> how<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.910> world

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
you know in terms of just how the world

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.000 
you know in terms of just how the world
built<00:01:03.629> I've<00:01:04.110> never<00:01:04.260> seen<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.530> world<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.949> is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
built I've never seen a world that is

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.980 
built I've never seen a world that is
actually<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.880> built<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.210> top<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.510> itself

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
actually it's built on top of itself

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.410 
actually it's built on top of itself
rather<00:01:07.710> than<00:01:07.799> expanding<00:01:08.189> out<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:09.090> i<00:01:09.270> just

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
rather than expanding out that i just

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.539 
rather than expanding out that i just
created<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:10.020> whole<00:01:10.439> different<00:01:10.799> type<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.189> world

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
created a whole different type of world

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.899 
created a whole different type of world
and<00:01:11.850> I've<00:01:12.150> seen<00:01:12.360> before<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.610> in<00:01:14.610> terms<00:01:14.790> of

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and I've seen before and in terms of

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.700 
and I've seen before and in terms of
inspiration<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.780> probably<00:01:16.080> too<00:01:16.290> many<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
inspiration it's probably too many to

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.160 
inspiration it's probably too many to
talk<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> us<00:01:17.040> over<00:01:17.430> over<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.090> many<00:01:18.180> years<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:19.110> a

have so I'm sure that works its way in
there<00:01:27.000> as<00:01:27.299> well<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.689> then<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.049> your<00:01:28.259> own

good<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.369> what<00:01:32.490> makes<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.729> feel<00:01:32.850> like

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
good I think what makes it feel like

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.310 
good I think what makes it feel like
this<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.210> believable<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.020> create<00:01:34.290> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
this is believable is that you create a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.800 
this is believable is that you create a

world so vibrant so so literal that you

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.330 
world so vibrant so so literal that you
can<00:01:36.930> easily<00:01:37.170> get<00:01:37.530> lost<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.159> looks

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
can easily get lost and it just looks

worried that would be kind of

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.469 
worried that would be kind of
tongue-in-cheek<00:01:54.619> humor<00:01:54.979> like<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.060> original

tongue-in-cheek humor like the original
it<00:01:57.439> looks<00:01:57.619> like<00:01:57.740> it's<00:01:57.920> going<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.100> be<00:01:58.189> a<00:01:58.250> lot<00:01:58.399> of

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
it looks like it's going to be a lot of

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.310 
it looks like it's going to be a lot of
action<00:01:58.970> I<00:01:59.210> guess<00:01:59.750> there's<00:01:59.960> three<00:02:00.200> different

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
action I guess there's three different

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.560 
action I guess there's three different
ways<00:02:00.619> you<00:02:00.649> can<00:02:01.009> go<00:02:01.159> you<00:02:01.970> can<00:02:02.000> look<00:02:02.270> at<00:02:02.390> as

ways you can go you can look at as

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.160 
ways you can go you can look at as
rebellion<00:02:03.560> against<00:02:04.430> people<00:02:04.670> pressing<00:02:05.390> in<00:02:05.539> you

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
can look at as pure action and the third

where we are in our lives he doesn't

where we are in our lives he doesn't
have<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:55.630> and<00:03:56.020> I<00:03:56.110> think<00:03:56.140> in<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:57.070> film

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
have that and I think in the film

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.770 
have that and I think in the film
there's<00:03:57.520> something<00:03:57.790> essentially<00:03:58.240> liberating

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
there's something essentially liberating

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.050 
there's something essentially liberating
not<00:03:59.530> at<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.740> start<00:03:59.980> not<00:04:00.190> only<00:04:00.370> finds<00:04:00.670> out<00:04:00.790> but

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
not at the start not only finds out but

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.460 
not at the start not only finds out but
essentially<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.570> becomes<00:04:01.660> a<00:04:02.080> kind<00:04:02.320> of<00:04:02.380> a

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
essentially it becomes a kind of a

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.080 
essentially it becomes a kind of a
source<00:04:02.890> of<00:04:03.010> liberation<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.760> future<00:04:04.060> is

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
source of liberation that the future is

right-hand man I think we used to to use
to<00:05:06.340> that<00:05:06.460> in<00:05:06.610> a<00:05:06.700> way<00:05:06.820> that<00:05:07.030> perhaps<00:05:07.720> audience

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
to that in a way that perhaps audience

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.760 
to that in a way that perhaps audience
is<00:05:08.380> a<00:05:08.410> from<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:08.950> original<00:05:09.190> maybe<00:05:09.340> weren't<00:05:10.770> but

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
is a from the original maybe weren't but

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.920 
is a from the original maybe weren't but
I<00:05:11.800> you<00:05:11.920> know<00:05:12.160> I<00:05:12.190> think<00:05:12.400> Sharon<00:05:13.270> sound<00:05:13.630> rocked

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
I you know I think Sharon sound rocked

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.870

it<00:05:14.080> our<00:05:14.650> town<00:05:14.890> is<00:05:14.950> very<00:05:15.310> different<00:05:15.520> so<00:05:15.790> it's

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
it our town is very different so it's

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.250 
it our town is very different so it's
actually<00:05:15.970> quite<00:05:16.210> hard<00:05:16.420> to<00:05:16.540> compare<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.080> two

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
actually quite hard to compare the two

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.050 
actually quite hard to compare the two
performances<00:05:17.950> really<00:05:18.250> at<00:05:18.340> it<00:05:18.520> doesn't<00:05:18.820> really

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
performances really at it doesn't really

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.520 
performances really at it doesn't really
seem<00:05:19.300> like<00:05:19.330> the<00:05:19.540> same<00:05:19.660> character<00:05:20.080> popper<00:05:20.380> we

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
seem like the same character popper we

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.460 
seem like the same character popper we
hit<00:05:20.710> certain<00:05:21.640> points<00:05:22.020> you<00:05:23.020> know<00:05:23.170> along<00:05:23.410> the

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
hit certain points you know along the

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.350 
hit certain points you know along the
way<00:05:23.620> in<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.800> story<00:05:24.100> but<00:05:24.460> it<00:05:24.940> was<00:05:25.060> a<00:05:25.090> while

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
way in the story but it was a while

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.870 
way in the story but it was a while
right<00:05:25.570> enjoyed<00:05:26.200> it<00:05:26.380> I<00:05:26.560> think<00:05:27.400> she<00:05:27.490> thought<00:05:27.640> Len

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
was going to be making basic instinct

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.920 
was going to be making basic instinct
