two guys that were pretty pretty

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.460 
two guys that were pretty pretty
dominant<00:02:08.090> going<00:02:08.360> up<00:02:08.509> so<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:08.869> broke<00:02:08.990> more<00:02:09.200> than

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
dominant going up so you broke more than

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.410 
dominant going up so you broke more than
most<00:02:09.979> inning<00:02:10.459> he<00:02:10.580> was<00:02:10.670> always<00:02:10.880> one<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.209> our

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
most inning he was always one of our

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.150 
most inning he was always one of our
best<00:02:11.690> players<00:02:11.870> there's<00:02:12.530> one<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.010> biggest

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
best players there's one of the biggest

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.860 
best players there's one of the biggest
kids<00:02:13.520> we'd<00:02:13.730> escaped<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.270> best<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.720> had<00:02:14.840> a

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
kids we'd escaped the best and had a

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.400 
kids we'd escaped the best and had a
great<00:02:15.080> shot<00:02:15.320> because<00:02:15.950> he<00:02:16.190> was<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:16.910> big<00:02:17.380> he's<00:02:18.380> a

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
great shot because he was so big he's a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.190 
great shot because he was so big he's a
little<00:02:18.800> top-heavy<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:20.300> fell<00:02:20.570> over<00:02:20.900> quite

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
little top-heavy and you fell over quite

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.229 
little top-heavy and you fell over quite
often<00:02:21.410> when<00:02:21.830> he<00:02:22.010> would<00:02:22.220> wind<00:02:22.459> up<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.850> take<00:02:23.030> one

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
often when he would wind up and take one

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.510 
often when he would wind up and take one
of<00:02:23.360> those<00:02:23.450> big<00:02:23.750> howitzers<00:02:24.320> maybe<00:02:25.160> not<00:02:25.340> the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
of those big howitzers maybe not the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.070 
of those big howitzers maybe not the
strongest<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:26.030> skater<00:02:26.330> maybe<00:02:26.630> just<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:26.959> little

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
strongest a skater maybe just a little

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.600 
strongest a skater maybe just a little
top-heavy<00:02:27.380> but<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:27.860> think<00:02:28.100> he<00:02:28.190> grew<00:02:28.400> into

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
top-heavy but I think he grew into

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.880 
top-heavy but I think he grew into
himself<00:02:28.730> okay<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.510> we<00:02:30.290> put<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.530> all<00:02:30.709> together

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
himself okay and we put it all together

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.370 
himself okay and we put it all together
