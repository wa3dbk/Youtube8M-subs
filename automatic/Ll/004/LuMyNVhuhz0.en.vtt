be kidding me

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.590 
be kidding me
because<00:00:42.739> when<00:00:42.890> you<00:00:42.980> look<00:00:43.129> at<00:00:43.220> it<00:00:43.309> this<00:00:43.430> way

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
because when you look at it this way

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.290 
because when you look at it this way
that<00:00:44.600> is<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.230> width<00:00:45.440> of<00:00:45.590> it<00:00:45.800> of<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.519> case<00:00:46.880> and

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
that is the width of it of the case and

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.990 
that is the width of it of the case and
then<00:00:48.079> when<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:48.440> turn<00:00:48.649> it<00:00:48.800> over<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:49.730> look

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
then when you turn it over and you look

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.819 
then when you turn it over and you look
at<00:00:50.239> it<00:00:50.510> this<00:00:51.079> way<00:00:51.140> that<00:00:52.840> is<00:00:53.840> how<00:00:54.020> tiny<00:00:54.320> it<00:00:54.710> is

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
at it this way that is how tiny it is

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.340 
at it this way that is how tiny it is
and<00:00:55.250> I'm<00:00:56.030> trying<00:00:56.329> to<00:00:56.360> see<00:00:56.570> if<00:00:56.690> I<00:00:56.750> can<00:00:56.960> get<00:00:57.140> in

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
beautiful coverage and I must say that

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.820 
beautiful coverage and I must say that
of<00:01:54.740> all<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.220> blushes<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:55.940> I<00:01:56.119> have<00:01:56.360> tried

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
of all the blushes that I have tried

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.160 
of all the blushes that I have tried
this<00:01:57.830> blush<00:01:58.459> to<00:01:59.090> me<00:01:59.330> is<00:01:59.630> one<00:01:59.869> of<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.020> most

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
this blush to me is one of the most

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.699 
this blush to me is one of the most
natural<00:02:00.920> looking<00:02:01.310> blushes<00:02:02.000> that<00:02:02.030> I<00:02:02.300> ever<00:02:03.050> used

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
natural looking blushes that I ever used

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.580 
natural looking blushes that I ever used
and<00:02:04.039> I've<00:02:04.130> used<00:02:04.310> log<00:02:04.489> washes<00:02:04.940> and<00:02:05.590> probably

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
and I've used log washes and probably

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.029 
and I've used log washes and probably
the<00:02:07.209> easiest<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.479> blend<00:02:08.869> it's<00:02:09.440> just<00:02:09.679> like<00:02:09.830> so

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
the easiest to blend it's just like so

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.020 
products that they ordered online and
really<00:05:54.530> weren't<00:05:54.800> there<00:05:54.950> to<00:05:55.070> kind<00:05:55.250> of<00:05:55.310> test<00:05:55.910> the

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
really weren't there to kind of test the

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.270 
really weren't there to kind of test the
color<00:05:56.270> out<00:05:56.540> on<00:05:56.720> their<00:05:56.870> own<00:05:56.990> skill<00:05:57.410> and<00:05:57.620> skin<00:05:57.980> so

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
color out on their own skill and skin so

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.410 
color out on their own skill and skin so
they<00:05:58.490> were<00:05:58.550> kind<00:05:58.850> of<00:05:58.910> looking<00:05:59.210> at<00:05:59.300> the

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420 
they were kind of looking at the

computer monitor

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.010 
computer monitor
guessing<00:06:01.160> what<00:06:01.460> color<00:06:01.730> that<00:06:02.510> would<00:06:02.630> go<00:06:02.750> good

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
guessing what color that would go good

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.210 
guessing what color that would go good
with<00:06:03.140> their<00:06:03.290> skin<00:06:03.530> color<00:06:03.770> and<00:06:03.920> then<00:06:04.010> when<00:06:04.130> they

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
with their skin color and then when they

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.920 
with their skin color and then when they
got<00:06:04.400> it<00:06:04.670> they<00:06:04.850> weren't<00:06:05.000> happy<00:06:05.300> with<00:06:05.570> the<00:06:05.690> color

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
got it they weren't happy with the color

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.090 
got it they weren't happy with the color
and<00:06:06.260> then<00:06:06.350> they<00:06:06.440> kind<00:06:06.680> of<00:06:06.710> put<00:06:06.890> a<00:06:06.920> negative

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
and then they kind of put a negative

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.690 
and then they kind of put a negative
review<00:06:07.430> on<00:06:07.850> the<00:06:08.890> makeup<00:06:09.890> as<00:06:10.040> a<00:06:10.070> result<00:06:10.430> of<00:06:10.550> that
