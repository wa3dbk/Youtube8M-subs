00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
a party so I don't know how much more of

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.600 
a party so I don't know how much more of
a<00:02:36.049> boxing<00:02:36.530> side<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.680> could<00:02:36.890> be<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.220> most<00:02:37.400> people

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610

a boxing side I could be and most people
don't<00:02:37.970> think<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.629> woman<00:02:38.720> would<00:02:39.019> be<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.799> big

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
don't think a woman would be that big

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.990 
don't think a woman would be that big
into<00:02:40.370> boxing<00:02:40.790> but<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.090> guess<00:02:41.360> it's<00:02:41.510> in<00:02:41.629> my<00:02:41.720> blood

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
into boxing but I guess it's in my blood

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.970
