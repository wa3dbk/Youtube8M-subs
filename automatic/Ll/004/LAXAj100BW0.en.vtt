the<00:01:41.970> secret<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.869> half<00:01:43.170> block<00:01:43.490> now<00:01:44.490> obviously

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the secret is a half block now obviously

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.969 
the secret is a half block now obviously
you<00:01:45.630> can't<00:01:45.869> walk<00:01:46.020> through<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.470> as<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.770> see

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
you can't walk through this as you see

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.620 
you can't walk through this as you see
here<00:01:47.450> neither<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.689> Bob's<00:01:49.280> now<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.630> skeletons

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
here neither can Bob's now I skeletons

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.569 
here neither can Bob's now I skeletons
can<00:01:51.869> obviously<00:01:52.110> fire<00:01:52.530> arrows<00:01:52.920> through<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.280> but

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
can obviously fire arrows through it but

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.289 
can obviously fire arrows through it but
and<00:01:54.380> say<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.409> had<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> full<00:01:56.159> block<00:01:56.369> there<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.820> would

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
and say I had a full block there I would

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.300 
and say I had a full block there I would
take<00:01:57.479> half<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.840> heart<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.110> damage<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.799> went

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
take half a heart of damage as I went

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.459 
take half a heart of damage as I went
through<00:01:59.430> with<00:01:59.490> my<00:01:59.610> mine<00:01:59.909> cart<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:01.049> you

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
through with my mine cart but if you

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.590 
through with my mine cart but if you
watch<00:02:01.740> with<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.430> half<00:02:02.880> block<00:02:03.530> nothing

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
watch with the half block nothing

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.499 
watch with the half block nothing
and<00:02:06.189> I<00:02:07.189> don't<00:02:07.460> know<00:02:07.549> you<00:02:08.030> may<00:02:08.149> be<00:02:08.209> thinking

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
and I don't know you may be thinking

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.710 
and I don't know you may be thinking
that<00:02:08.720> that's<00:02:08.959> just<00:02:09.200> because<00:02:09.410> I<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:11.300> cart<00:02:11.540> was

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
that that's just because I the cart was

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.420 
that that's just because I the cart was
through<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.230> half<00:02:12.410> block<00:02:12.740> when<00:02:13.010> i<00:02:13.040> clicked

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
through the half block when i clicked

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.490 
through the half block when i clicked
but<00:02:13.910> if<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:15.020> watch<00:02:15.230> again<00:02:15.590> i<00:02:16.510> will<00:02:17.510> get<00:02:18.380> in

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
but if you watch again i will get in

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.830 
but if you watch again i will get in
well<00:02:18.709> before<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.100> half<00:02:19.250> block<00:02:19.720> went<00:02:20.720> through

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
well before the half block went through

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.510 
well before the half block went through
it<00:02:20.930> really<00:02:21.140> slowly<00:02:21.500> didn't<00:02:21.920> take<00:02:22.040> any<00:02:22.280> damage

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
it really slowly didn't take any damage

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.050 
it really slowly didn't take any damage
and<00:02:22.940> i<00:02:23.920> was<00:02:24.920> getting<00:02:25.160> nervous<00:02:25.250> when<00:02:25.550> an<00:02:25.670> animal

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060
