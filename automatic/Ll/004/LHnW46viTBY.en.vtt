00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
they're monks and however they're really

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.759 
they're monks and however they're really
bad<00:00:45.410> at<00:00:45.679> self<00:00:46.070> healing<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:47.350> fairly<00:00:48.350> easy<00:00:48.649> to

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
bad at self healing so fairly easy to

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.259 
bad at self healing so fairly easy to
kill<00:00:48.980> them<00:00:49.249> but<00:00:49.489> if<00:00:49.609> you<00:00:49.730> leave<00:00:49.850> them<00:00:50.030> alive

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
all their heels will go into whatever

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.939 
all their heels will go into whatever
you're<00:00:52.760> attacking<00:00:53.269> and<00:00:53.539> make<00:00:54.140> it<00:00:54.350> pretty

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
you're attacking and make it pretty

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.020 
you're attacking and make it pretty
impossible<00:00:55.249> to<00:00:55.640> do<00:00:55.789> anything<00:00:56.769> besides<00:00:58.030> that

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
impossible to do anything besides that

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.709 
impossible to do anything besides that
you<00:00:59.420> gotta<00:00:59.719> watch<00:00:59.960> out<00:01:00.230> for<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.589> traps<00:01:00.890> and

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
you gotta watch out for the traps and

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.610 
you gotta watch out for the traps and
the<00:01:02.719> traps<00:01:02.989> are<00:01:03.199> probably<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.589> most

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
the traps are probably the most

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.000 
the traps are probably the most
dangerous<00:01:04.040> thing<00:01:04.580> on<00:01:04.879> this<00:01:05.030> farm<00:01:05.300> the<00:01:06.010> Macumba

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
dangerous thing on this farm the Macumba

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.590 
dangerous thing on this farm the Macumba
centaurs<00:01:07.460> don't<00:01:07.610> really<00:01:08.120> do<00:01:08.300> that<00:01:08.420> much

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
centaurs don't really do that much

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.990 
centaurs don't really do that much
damage<00:01:08.830> but<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:09.860> traps<00:01:10.250> will<00:01:10.550> get<00:01:10.730> you<00:01:10.910> if

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
damage but the traps will get you if

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.690 
damage but the traps will get you if
you're<00:01:11.120> not<00:01:11.210> paying<00:01:11.390> attention<00:01:11.600> which

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
you're not paying attention which

take a curve you may have seen that

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.940 
take a curve you may have seen that
there<00:02:23.300> were<00:02:23.480> quite<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.750> few<00:02:23.840> more<00:02:24.230> centaurs<00:02:24.740> off

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950

there were quite a few more centaurs off
to<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.220> side<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.330> really<00:02:26.630> big<00:02:26.930> group

to the side that is a really big group

of them that you can't really pull any
away<00:02:29.540> from<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.620> want<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.100> make<00:02:31.130> sure<00:02:31.250> you

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
away from so you want to make sure you

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.370 
away from so you want to make sure you
don't<00:02:34.130> go<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.430> way<00:02:34.490> unless<00:02:34.850> you

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
don't go that way unless you

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.600 
don't go that way unless you
specifically<00:02:36.380> design<00:02:36.710> a<00:02:36.740> specialized<00:02:37.340> build

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
specifically design a specialized build

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.240 
specifically design a specialized build
to<00:02:37.910> kill<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.120> whole<00:02:38.390> bunch<00:02:38.630> of<00:02:38.720> them<00:02:38.810> at<00:02:38.930> once

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
to kill a whole bunch of them at once

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.540 
to kill a whole bunch of them at once
because<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.990> can't<00:02:42.230> pull<00:02:42.590> very<00:02:43.100> well<00:02:43.310> in

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
because that you can't pull very well in

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.600 
because that you can't pull very well in
that<00:02:43.670> place<00:02:44.090> like<00:02:44.990> I've<00:02:45.230> done<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:45.920> few<00:02:46.010> runs<00:02:46.400> and

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
that place like I've done a few runs and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.210 
that place like I've done a few runs and
I<00:02:46.670> tried<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.900> pull<00:02:48.170> away<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:48.800> as<00:02:48.980> soon<00:02:49.130> as

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
I tried it you pull away and as soon as

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.470 
I tried it you pull away and as soon as
you<00:02:49.280> start<00:02:49.490> tagging<00:02:49.820> they'll<00:02:49.940> start<00:02:50.150> running

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
you start tagging they'll start running

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.210 
you start tagging they'll start running
back<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.930> other<00:02:51.080> group<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.590> everything

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
back to the other group and everything

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.250 
back to the other group and everything
will<00:02:52.340> just<00:02:52.400> run<00:02:52.640> out<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:52.970> kill<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.330> so<00:02:53.630> not

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
will just run out and kill you so not

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.940 
will just run out and kill you so not
really<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.650> best<00:02:54.800> idea<00:02:55.190> uh<00:02:56.050> there<00:02:57.050> is<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.230> monk

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
really the best idea uh there is a monk

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.210 
really the best idea uh there is a monk
boss<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.490> spawns<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.970> area<00:02:59.300> I<00:02:59.540> would<00:02:59.570> advise

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
boss that spawns the area I would advise

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.100 
boss that spawns the area I would advise
against<00:03:01.220> killing<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:02.180> group<00:03:02.330> of<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.570> monkey

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
against killing the group of the monkey

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.220 
against killing the group of the monkey
balls<00:03:03.320> cuz<00:03:03.850> that<00:03:04.850> one<00:03:05.030> can<00:03:05.300> heal<00:03:05.570> itself<00:03:05.660> and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
balls cuz that one can heal itself and

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.850 
balls cuz that one can heal itself and
it's<00:03:07.600> pretty<00:03:08.600> annoying<00:03:08.990> to<00:03:09.320> try<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.560> kill<00:03:09.830> it

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
it's pretty annoying to try to kill it

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.660 
it's pretty annoying to try to kill it
over<00:03:10.670> here<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:11.530> where<00:03:12.530> Nicholas<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.100> traveler

is after I kill this group i'll be going
over<00:03:16.220> towards<00:03:16.580> him<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:17.090> don't<00:03:18.050> understand<00:03:18.440> why

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
over towards him I don't understand why

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.650 
over towards him I don't understand why
Nick<00:03:18.800> can't<00:03:19.040> just<00:03:19.280> kill<00:03:19.489> his<00:03:19.670> own<00:03:19.760> centaurs<00:03:20.390> I

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
Nick can't just kill his own centaurs I

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.140 
Nick can't just kill his own centaurs I
mean<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.080> one<00:03:21.260> over<00:03:21.890> here<00:03:22.220> right<00:03:22.459> next<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.970> him

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
mean the one over here right next to him

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.570 
mean the one over here right next to him
drops<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:24.050> main<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.530> would've<00:03:24.769> helped<00:03:25.459> him

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
drops a main that would've helped him

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.280 
drops a main that would've helped him
out<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.970> lot<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:26.450> that<00:03:26.780> he<00:03:26.870> wouldn't<00:03:27.050> have<00:03:27.200> to

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
out a lot so that he wouldn't have to

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.870 
out a lot so that he wouldn't have to
ask<00:03:27.440> people<00:03:27.739> if<00:03:27.980> he<00:03:28.070> just<00:03:28.220> killed<00:03:28.489> him<00:03:28.640> every

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
ask people if he just killed him every

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.460 
ask people if he just killed him every
single<00:03:29.150> time<00:03:29.680> but<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.950> guess<00:03:31.370> not<00:03:31.900> so<00:03:32.900> this<00:03:33.350> is

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
single time but I guess not so this is

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.420 
single time but I guess not so this is
going<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.620> be<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:33.860> end<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.100> circle

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
going to be the end of the circle

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.970 
going to be the end of the circle
because<00:03:34.700> Nicholas<00:03:35.120> is<00:03:35.390> a<00:03:35.780> loser<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:36.680> lets<00:03:36.890> me

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
because Nicholas is a loser and lets me

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.590 
because Nicholas is a loser and lets me
die<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:38.209> have<00:03:38.690> fun<00:03:38.720> farm<00:03:39.140> in<00:03:39.290> this<00:03:39.380> week
