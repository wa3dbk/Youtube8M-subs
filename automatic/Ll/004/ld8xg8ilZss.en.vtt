hi i'm jay from real street performance
today<00:00:12.090> we're<00:00:12.240> going<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.420> talk<00:00:12.540> about

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
today we're going to talk about

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.959 
today we're going to talk about
correctly<00:00:13.290> diagnosing<00:00:13.799> your<00:00:14.070> smoking<00:00:14.580> turbo

correctly diagnosing your smoking turbo

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.240 
correctly diagnosing your smoking turbo
oh<00:00:15.859> look<00:00:16.859> at<00:00:16.949> that

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.590 

often<00:00:20.250> people<00:00:20.400> misdiagnosed<00:00:21.150> with<00:00:21.240> smoking

seal isn't a conventional seal like you

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.519 
seal isn't a conventional seal like you
would<00:00:26.430> think<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.330> small<00:00:27.660> ring<00:00:28.019> looks<00:00:28.410> a

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
would think it's a small ring looks a

assuming that you're oiling system of

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
your engine is working properly this

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.800 
your engine is working properly this
will<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.830> fine<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:09.150> oil<00:01:09.360> drain<00:01:09.689> is

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
will be just fine the oil drain is

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.240 
will be just fine the oil drain is
important<00:01:10.290> because<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.590> oil<00:01:10.860> cannot

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
important because if the oil cannot

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.700 
important because if the oil cannot
drain<00:01:11.670> out<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> turbo<00:01:12.390> fast<00:01:12.630> enough<00:01:12.990> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
drain out of the turbo fast enough it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.710 
drain out of the turbo fast enough it
will<00:01:13.860> fill<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.340> cartridge<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.090> then<00:01:15.420> start

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
will fill the cartridge and then start

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.410 
will fill the cartridge and then start
to<00:01:15.810> pressurize<00:01:16.200> past<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.770> seals<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.240> need

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to pressurize past the seals so you need

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.780 
to pressurize past the seals so you need
to<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.020> correct<00:01:19.470> sized<00:01:19.860> drain<00:01:20.310> we

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
to have the correct sized drain we

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.570 
to have the correct sized drain we
generally<00:01:21.210> use<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.390> -<00:01:21.720> 10<00:01:22.080> line<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.369> drain

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
generally use a - 10 line and the drain

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.399 
generally use a - 10 line and the drain
needs<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> clear<00:01:24.270> unrestricted<00:01:25.200> path

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the engine is correct is that the oil

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.960 
the engine is correct is that the oil
