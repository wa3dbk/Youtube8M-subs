think they she really should have built
her<00:01:38.280> up<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.750> a<00:01:39.750> underdog<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:41.040> thats<00:01:41.490> because

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
her up as a underdog is thats because

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.370 
her up as a underdog is thats because
that's<00:01:41.790> what<00:01:41.970> they're<00:01:42.119> trying<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.810> because

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
that's what they're trying to do because

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.039 
that's what they're trying to do because
Beth<00:01:43.740> Phoenix<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.220> Natalya<00:01:44.280> are<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.930> know

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
Beth Phoenix and Natalya are you know

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.960

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
better technical wrestlers and I think

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.490 
better technical wrestlers and I think
that's<00:01:48.180> how<00:01:48.299> they<00:01:48.420> should<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.689> done<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.990> by

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
that's how they should have done it by

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.410 
that's how they should have done it by
giving<00:01:49.710> Kelly<00:01:50.100> Kelly<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> win<00:01:50.670> last<00:01:50.850> week<00:01:51.210> it

giving Kelly Kelly the win last week it

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.060 
giving Kelly Kelly the win last week it
kind<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.720> makes<00:01:51.869> her<00:01:52.020> seem<00:01:52.200> too<00:01:52.409> powerful<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
kind of makes her seem too powerful and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.950
