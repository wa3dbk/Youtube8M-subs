00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.030

 need a little olive oil 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.710
 the beans I usually buy them from the pot 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.699
 that they already have cooked because they are made 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.179

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:45.810
 well let's start let's peel 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.870
 to wash and grate with the help of a 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.980
 grater the carrots the onion and the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.930

 now we will wash the pepper 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.579
 we will remove the nuggets from inside and go 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.980
 to cut it to our liking if you like 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.379
 the pepper will cut into pieces 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.510
 little ones and if you do not like it we can 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.850
 cut into large pieces or strips to 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.750
 Then I can push it away, I usually do 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.390
 half and half 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.030
 now we will take a frying pan and we will throw 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.790
 a good squirt of olive oil and what 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.490

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.150
 bay leaves 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.409
 while the vegetables are made we are going to 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.930
 wash our beans very well and let's 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.750
 to put them in a pot 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.240
 We are going to cover them very well with water and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.060
 we are going to put it to the maximum fire so that 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.490
 start cooking 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.610
 when we see that the vegetables are already 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.280
 well, teaspoons, we put out the fire and 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.149
 we will add the teaspoon of paprika 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.039
 Sweet careful not to burn and 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.220

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:59.090
 fried a few seconds we will add it to 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.090
 the pot of the beans 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.670
 we will also add the broth tablet 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.729
 that we have chosen and we will put to fire 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.979
 more than once it begins to boil 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.379
 we will put on medium low heat and we will leave 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.080
 until the beans have taken everything 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:20.200
 the flavor and they are very soft between 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.200
 half an hour and about 45 50 minutes 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.900

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.650
