00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
was on eight spring look it's look I had

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.150

pigmented you can see the shadows are a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.740 
pigmented you can see the shadows are a
little<00:02:41.190> bit<00:02:41.370> powdery<00:02:41.610> but<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.150> can<00:02:42.300> see<00:02:42.510> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
little bit powdery but you can see the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.630 
little bit powdery but you can see the
pigment<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.260> goes<00:02:43.530> on<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.220> tiniest

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
pigment that goes on so the tiniest

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.330 
pigment that goes on so the tiniest
amount<00:02:45.060> goes<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.870> wrong<00:02:46.020> this<00:02:46.170> way<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.830> then

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
amount goes the wrong this way and then

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.920 
amount goes the wrong this way and then
I'm<00:02:47.430> going<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.760> mixing<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.180> two<00:02:48.480> kind<00:02:48.810> of

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
I'm going to be mixing the two kind of

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.840 
I'm going to be mixing the two kind of
more<00:02:49.110> pinky<00:02:49.650> purple<00:02:50.040> they<00:02:50.280> didn't<00:02:50.460> get<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.580> shot

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
more pinky purple they didn't get a shot

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.060 
more pinky purple they didn't get a shot
of<00:02:50.880> them<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.420> then<00:02:51.930> just<00:02:52.110> add<00:02:52.290> matt<00:02:52.560> directly

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
of them and then just add matt directly

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.590 
of them and then just add matt directly
on<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.280> outer<00:02:53.460> corner<00:02:53.850> here<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.240> can<00:02:54.390> see<00:02:54.510> it

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
on the outer corner here you can see it

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.240 
on the outer corner here you can see it
adds<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.870> bit<00:02:54.990> more<00:02:55.020> of<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.290> pink<00:02:55.560> stone<00:02:55.830> because

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
adds a bit more of a pink stone because

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.980 
adds a bit more of a pink stone because
the<00:02:56.790> look<00:02:56.940> was<00:02:57.060> becoming<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.720> little<00:02:57.870> more

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
the look was becoming a little more

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.600 
the look was becoming a little more
neutral<00:02:58.230> than<00:02:58.440> i<00:02:58.590> wanted<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.130> this<00:02:59.250> morphe

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
neutral than i wanted and this morphe

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.760
