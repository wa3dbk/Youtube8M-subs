00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello people youtube line I am 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 adept rodrigues and today I'm going to teach 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.420
 how do you germinate the most 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.259
 fast 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.039
 so I do it like this in a pot you cover 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.230
 with cotton and put the seeds 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.420
 to put the seeds you do not 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:28.109
 sprayed on cotton not let soak 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.179
 a lot of touch leaves it wet you cover 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.410
 with the film role and leaves him 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.770
 Only a corner can not be that light. 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.040
 direct sun because it can happen 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.340
 burn and it does not work, so I 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.210
 I leave it in a corner where it has the light 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.980
 normal of the day and after a few days 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.739
 depending on the seed 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.699
 they begin to germinate this is a 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.460
 red pepper seed 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.719
 It has already begun after a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.840
 some four days have begun to germinate 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:11.610
 here is cherry tomatoes too 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.189
 also began to germinate and here it is 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.570
 500 that this one is taking a while 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:23.280
 more then once you have already 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.490
 germinating then you take one forceps 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.100
 not put directly by hand not 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:39.110
 take it with your hand because it 's not cool 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:45.540
 you take the tongs very slowly and 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.729
 places here on earth hole 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:54.390
 need not be a very deep hole're 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:57.180
 people you put him here always 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.079
 aa pontinha tac began to germinate to 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.670
 inside 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.670
 Okay, then you'll get the other one here. 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:23.530
 I'm going to pay fell here, there's good people there. 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.260
 doing this 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.940
 then if you want to or leave it like that 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.420
 You want and you can put some 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:35.530
 of very little earth even above and 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.940
 then water every day always leave the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.390
 moist earth 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.350
 I arrived yesterday to plant some here 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.920
 This one is from the cherry tomatoes. 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.440
 always good to exhaust all three in 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.160
 each pot because it always has one or 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.890
 another that is born very well in a 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.770
 then you take out those who do not 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.480
 have developed very well this one here 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.459
 You 're not very cool there. 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.040
 eliminates those and leaves only those who 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.500
 really finish the best 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.220
 reminding people that when I get this way 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.160
 germinating you do not leave good sun 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.510
 because he will surely die 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:26.019
 You always leave place with those of the day. 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:31.060
 but not directly in the sun and after 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:33.790
 One time you take care of the directive. 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.980
 like this one are the sausages that 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.150
 Protect has two months after you have 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.510
 this big 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:47.019
 you take from here in a vase of the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.380
 Ok, people are very easy. 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:54.610
 There is not much mystery, I think. 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.640
 way it germinates much faster than 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.290
 directly on land 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.930
 Okay, people, this is it, yes you 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.730
 like a like and sign up for my 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.730
 A canal, bye, bye, bye.
