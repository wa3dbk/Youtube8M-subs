00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.069 
no it's all right pretty good but
nowhere<00:02:42.670> near<00:02:42.879> as<00:02:42.909> cool<00:02:43.180> as<00:02:43.299> this<00:02:43.450> game<00:02:43.689> was<00:02:43.930> I

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
nowhere near as cool as this game was I

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.860 
nowhere near as cool as this game was I
guess<00:02:44.230> because<00:02:44.439> I<00:02:45.000> don't<00:02:46.000> know<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.269> didn't

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
guess because I don't know that didn't

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.449 
guess because I don't know that didn't
age<00:02:47.079> that<00:02:47.379> well<00:02:48.629> in<00:02:49.629> some<00:02:49.900> respects<00:02:50.319> like<00:02:50.590> or

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
age that well in some respects like or

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.369 
age that well in some respects like or
maybe<00:02:51.670> didn't<00:02:52.030> transfer<00:02:52.420> when<00:02:52.719> the<00:02:52.810> different

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
maybe didn't transfer when the different

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:59.600 
maybe didn't transfer when the different
people<00:02:53.650> made
