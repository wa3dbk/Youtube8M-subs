00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.550
 welcome to the next 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.740
 small talk on a beautiful 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.740
 autumn here in the middle of the forest 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.990
 I have a nice question again 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.460
 get that I received today times 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.189
 what does he want to be that yes 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.030
 several interested and indeed writes 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.460
 I love Thomas's question of a dummies 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.770
 daniela meanwhile I have you on 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.620
 the tour is experiencing an e-book and also the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.820
 bittersweet success read 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.670
 probably it's because I have one 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.729
 man or clog up to something 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.949
 understand that the success of me something 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:50.670
 Asking for our price has got that 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.010
 I understood 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.620
 only I am a little undecided what the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.110
 cost for that you have concerns of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.019
 more often mentioned that you are all friends 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.720
 family relationship etc pp the success 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.510
 it's really that subordinate 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.700
 what you want to tell us or is that 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.369
 to understand that I have to define 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.200
 how much I am elected to use and 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.990
 to pay to reach my goal 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.430
 and then to 100 percent and 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.620
 consistently implement 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.730
 I'll give you a short feedback 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.890
 very grateful 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:28.710
 dear greetings tom so for a dear 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.420
 Tom is not a stupid question at all 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.520
 I think that's a very smart one 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.980
 ask and that just shows me that you 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.160
 you really are concerned with the topic 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.750
 and you try to understand yes and 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.430
 also the background of it because she 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.700
 People often read white and we mean 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.720
 that we understood and but 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.230
 maybe we do not have it there 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.060
 understood so now in this case 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.940
 I good what you say because it shows that 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.530
 you really understand it you have 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.640
 it correctly recognized i actually have 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.630
 In my case, twice the success 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.590
 everything subordinate family relationship 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.629
 leisure vacation hobbies no matter what it was 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.979
 I really have mine for that 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.730
 business success everything 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.010
 subordinate 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.709
 so now it is natural for that 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.430
 not placeable if you are so nice 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.360
 on the network says that's not something 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.910
 In any 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.670
 people are equally environment 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.370
 can and where I am in any training 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.250
 I always say that in every seminar 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.930
 you have to think for yourself what you are 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.390
 you ready for your success 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.580
 It would be silly truth ' I must be moderate 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.530
 Of course, say what was my price for it 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.540
 or what I was ready for 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.490
 I can not wait or not 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.920
 assume that every human being that 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.590
 itself ready to use therefore becomes 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.410
 really nice phrase you doing 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.450
 your thoughts what are you ready 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.540
 to be used for your success 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.320
 For example, currently only one hour a day 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.510
 invested 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.580
 and there is still if it is then you have 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.920
 family then you have friends then you have 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.200
 you what is here all year then consider 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.120
 you just something from all these things 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.010
 you do and much of it will 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.230
 Needless to know what you are doing 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.700
 but do not bring anything and that you do that 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.220
 Just checked and see what 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.980
 of it you can delete that which is 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.410
 you ready to let a certain 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.209
 time span he should not be forever 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.130
 that irony sense of the thing one should also 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.080
 but maybe still living to say hey 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.510
 Do you know for one or two or three? 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.080
 years little willing on that and that and 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.180
 to do without my goals in the 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.549
 business area earlier and 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.690
 faster to reach then that's what 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.120
 you actually as far as right 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.000
 understood means and that's what it's about 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.299
 It is worthwhile to think because 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.250
 otherwise always somehow with it 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.959
 little time what's the hot try 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.730
 but to reach the maximum 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.250
 and there is a contradiction because it 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.130
 never will be possible and everyone 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.170
 the one who reaches the bigger and more 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.150
 maybe as the average has 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.730
 also used in other application 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.830
 and absolutely everyone and if someone has something 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.290
 Another tells you just put it and it 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.549
 just not so honest with you 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.169
 I hope that I give you that 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.970
 helped and thanks for 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.799
 Yours, by the way, very intelligent question 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.229
 and yes, see you next time 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.160
 smalltalk here was daniela sat I am pleased 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.160
 me for the next time
