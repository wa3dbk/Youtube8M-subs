 mod called not having time for us 3d hans 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.370
 and this mod adds 4 guns just 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.070
 4 weapons but they are super 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.410
 and now I will tell you about them with 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.350
 some mods were so you don't 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.480
 see hands but with this mod there is no such 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.120
 lack of a hand here is just the same 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.350
 traced here all in my 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.260
 thought out for the first time see this mod 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.120
 and honestly he was surprised here 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.180
 really already hands stick out that is 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.790
 you can see how he keeps his gun and so 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.350
 first weapon is p90 firing speed 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.450
 and so second up so the first weapon is 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.850
 p90 for it will need here such 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.049
 cartridges 5 3 7 tenths by 28 millimeters 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.369
 recharge sure we recharge 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.259
 click on the letter p 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.330
 without this, he will not shoot 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.070
 automatically it doesn't recharge too 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.619
 will be as it happens in some games 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.170
 here until you click on reload it 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.229
 will not shoot this clan let's 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.490
 take that lamb creeper too 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.060
 peaceful character they will not be sorry 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.090
 destroy her and so this weapon she has 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.770
 900 shooting speed as you can see here 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.350
 everything is written but i will translate for you 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.570
 ammunition capacity 50 is a weapon for 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.229
 defense let's see how it looks 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.439
 bang bang here everything is pretty big 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:03.860
 giving it to you is not a battlefield name 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.860
 counter-strike at least it would arrange 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.170
 in general this is a rouge for defense following 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.640
 weapons this ghali frankly at first 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.230
 because this is some kind of collage but on 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.910
 in fact it was ghali 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:24.489
 the rate of fire of 750 rounds capacity 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:31.239
 35 and this is an assault rifle 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.239
 i need ammo 7.62 for 39 millimeters 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:41.180
 bam-bam pretty powerful tick 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.580
 investigating weapons this is a sniper 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.709
 rifle does not enter 10 rounds back and 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.330
 sniper rifle and constantly what 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.489
 then you see a tank here I click on the right 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.000
 mouse button yes and I don't know what 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.850
 happens just can't see what's up there 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.100
 there is like this nonsense here if so 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.560
 walk some blocks are visible 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.030
 Well, nothing more but anyway if you are here 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.890
 so aim and you will know what 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.709
 you pro key you shoot you anyway 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.209
 it will get fucking and sniper 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.100
 rifle cartridges required 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:22.030
 polin already disappeared 7251 cartridges 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.410
 millimeters well, and then the store 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.859
 bang from one shot you just 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.079
 Embroider this creeper can just 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.690
 so aim and kill him too bad 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.450
 but this is a sniper rifle she just 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:41.739
 can you see how she is 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:46.190
 will destroy the iron golem you 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.920
 tenacious 34 damn yes he has a bulletproof vest himself 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.810
 want a bulletproof vest created by iron nolan 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.530
 move on to the next weapon next 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.359
 weapon is 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.970
 remington m47 shotgun yes it's a shotgun 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:01.850
 it requires such cartridges 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:05.560
 recharge create mobs and now you 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.709
 see how a shotgun behaves from 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.709
 scary yes 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.620
 but I think you know the shotgun should be 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.850
 much more powerful because if you 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.840
 shoot at close range you should just 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:24.650
 crush your enemy and he 's still 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:28.460
 lives still lives up to some kind of kripper 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.150
 It is the world well, big payoff 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.930
 Of course, I still need ammo 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.639
 recharge and and and and and but it waits well 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.370
 as long as possible to long recharge 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.130
 schools gymnastics such powerful returns here 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.000
 and now let me tell you about 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:50.270
 craft ah to create a p90 rifle you 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.270
 need iron ingots born 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.840
 this is a rice barrel and faith receiver 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.150
 and how much stock in my type something 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.789
 butt square butt of some kind and 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.250
 you also need metal flu 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.110
 This is a metal pen to craft 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.979
 but 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.710
 assault rifle to poured you 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.710
 need a tree block tree trunk 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.010
 metal handle 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.310
 also receiver box all the same and 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.610
 here you just need to put 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.240
 metal handle 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.220
 Previously, we put some 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.410
 square metal and so ok 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.099
 the next weapon is sniper 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.080
 rifle 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:33.139
 here everything is the same but here we are 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.330
 Substitute brackets brackets then I understand 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.419
 some 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.639
 Sight something but in general I'm not sure and 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:43.800
 the next last weapon is the shotgun 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:46.060
 but he is not crafting such things 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.159
