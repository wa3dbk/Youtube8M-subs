00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.590
 hello everyone in this video I'm going to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.150
 teach how to record the retina screen 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:12.900
 from your macbook pro to 2.880 by 1800 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.990
 with screen freak is a program that 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.490
 can capture all the pixels and make a 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.150
 video at 2,880 by 1800 thing that others 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.210
 capturers do in 1440 x 900 with a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.529
 quality pretty much worse so either 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.519
 let's go with the video let's see how 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.519
 this program works 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.930
 the program that we are going to use as 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.410
 I said before it's screen flick let's 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.329
 open it 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.750
 and let's see how we are presented 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.750
 Interface 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.640
 puts four tabs in recording what 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.530
 let's leave as is here we can 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.629
 to choose 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.460
 the king of frames per second that 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.610
 we want to give you better such better 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.110
 higher or lower quality to the video ie 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.110
 what we want to record audio 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.390
 the location 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.790
 on mobile phones we have the recordings of 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.950
 screen that we have already done with this 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.430
 program here we can export them 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.120
 directly if you save the format 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:32.110
 raw the raw format and we can 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.960
 export it to mov format mp4 I put you to 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.960
 enough formats we also have here 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.690
 the keyboard and mouse options 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.490
 and here in preferences that is what we 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.350
 interest we have in general the options 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.159
 I have left them by default 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:57.320
 in interface we have here what we want 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.850
 that shows when when we are 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.300
 recording the screen if we want it 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.100
 show the dow the menu bar 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.119
 etcetera we can hide it show and 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.649
 also if we want to be removed 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.560
 all these icons that I have here 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.300
 doing zero and it shows 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.880
 simply the desktop background 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.190
 and that's pretty good and what we 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.160
 Interested in advanced we can 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.820
 choose the quality of the record itself 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.610
 we can choose medium high and great and 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.190
 this check that by effect is removed 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.790
 we have to activate it so that we 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.670
 record all the possible resolution in the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.200
 retina displays of marc then yes 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.960
 we have a backup because with 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.930
 retina display we want to have a video to 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.840
 more of full hd because full hd 1920 x 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.380
 1080 we are going to have a video 29 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.130
 880 by 1800 it will look great in 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.050
 any screen then we 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.090
 we apply this option and when we record 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.550
 let's record a pretty video 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.470
 pretty good just now for 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.790
 record the screen between cording him 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.310
 we give star recording and here we choose 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.890
 the size that we want to record we give 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.370
 to the record 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.930
 and I have done so nothing else 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.850
 this is all the video that we are going to do 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.620
