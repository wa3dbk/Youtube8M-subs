so<00:00:49.200> 33<00:00:49.910> whenever<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.059> deal<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.360> master

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
so 33 whenever you deal with master

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.350 
so 33 whenever you deal with master
numbers<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.469> particular<00:00:53.070> or<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.610> double

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
numbers in particular or just double

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.869 
numbers in particular or just double
digits<00:00:54.899> numbers<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.440> general<00:00:55.649> any<00:00:56.070> series<00:00:56.730> of

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
digits numbers in general any series of

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.630 
digits numbers in general any series of
numbers<00:00:57.300> every<00:00:57.719> number<00:00:57.960> plays<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> part<00:00:58.920> but

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
numbers every number plays a part but

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580 
numbers every number plays a part but
when<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.030> comes<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> master<00:01:01.020> number<00:01:01.379> you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
when it comes with a master number you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.280 
when it comes with a master number you
have<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.039> take<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.489> single<00:01:02.940> digit<00:01:03.390> that

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
have to take the single digit that

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.560 
have to take the single digit that
includes<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.070> master<00:01:05.430> number<00:01:05.790> into<00:01:06.030> account

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
includes the master number into account

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.850 
includes the master number into account
so<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.380> 33<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.430> two<00:01:08.790> threes<00:01:09.500> three<00:01:10.500> three

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
so in 33 we have two threes three three

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.940 
so in 33 we have two threes three three
that<00:01:11.369> make<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.119> number<00:01:12.450> six<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.619> can

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
that make up the number six so you can

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.039 
that make up the number six so you can
check<00:01:14.159> out<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> videos<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.210> Life<00:01:15.720> Path<00:01:16.020> number

that's<00:01:40.020> what<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.380> three<00:01:40.680> energy<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:42.329> when

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
that's what that three energy is so when

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.569 
that's what that three energy is so when
you<00:01:42.600> put<00:01:42.930> two<00:01:43.200> threes<00:01:43.560> together<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.460> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
you put two threes together it's like a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.389 
you put two threes together it's like a
double<00:01:45.119> dose<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.590> these<00:01:46.770> people<00:01:47.040> can

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
double dose of that so these people can

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.929
