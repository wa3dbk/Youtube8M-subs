twelve hundred dollar system don't have
a<00:00:07.740> lot<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.160> differences<00:00:08.820> but<00:00:09.090> if<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.809> just

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.720 
whistles added i guess you know go for
this<00:00:14.880> build<00:00:15.210> um<00:00:15.830> gaming<00:00:16.830> performance<00:00:17.039> will<00:00:17.580> be

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
this build um gaming performance will be

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.939 
this build um gaming performance will be
roughly<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.510> same<00:00:18.750> just<00:00:19.109> slightly<00:00:19.590> better

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
roughly the same just slightly better

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.730 
roughly the same just slightly better
but<00:00:20.100> things<00:00:20.580> like<00:00:20.730> video<00:00:20.939> editing<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.810> you

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
but things like video editing and you

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.560 
but things like video editing and you
know<00:00:22.859> transcoding<00:00:23.730> video<00:00:24.000> stuff<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.539> that

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
know transcoding video stuff like that

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.450 
know transcoding video stuff like that
will<00:00:25.050> be<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.199> lot<00:00:25.410> better<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.189> build

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
will be a lot better on this build

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.890 
will be a lot better on this build
because<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.970> know<00:00:27.060> we<00:00:27.240> made<00:00:27.269> some<00:00:27.660> necessary

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
because you know we made some necessary

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.570 
because you know we made some necessary
upgrades<00:00:28.439> with<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.099> extra<00:00:29.429> two<00:00:29.550> hundred

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
upgrades with the extra two hundred

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.070 
upgrades with the extra two hundred
dollars<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.150> let's<00:00:30.330> get<00:00:30.449> straight<00:00:30.660> into<00:00:30.779> this

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
dollars so let's get straight into this

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.580 
dollars so let's get straight into this
for<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.800> cpu<00:00:32.189> i<00:00:32.250> got<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.610> intel<00:00:33.000> core<00:00:33.030> i7<00:00:33.590> 3770k

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
for the cpu i got it intel core i7 3770k

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.260 
for the cpu i got it intel core i7 3770k
I<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> three<00:00:35.579> point<00:00:35.790> five<00:00:35.910> gigahertz

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
I it's a three point five gigahertz

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.840 
I it's a three point five gigahertz
processor<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.620> has<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> 3.9<00:00:38.430> ignorance

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
processor and it has a 3.9 ignorance

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.600 
processor and it has a 3.9 ignorance
turbo<00:00:39.680> also<00:00:40.680> we're<00:00:40.860> gonna<00:00:40.920> pick<00:00:41.190> up<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.430> hyper

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
turbo also we're gonna pick up a hyper

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.940 
turbo also we're gonna pick up a hyper
212<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:42.870> can<00:00:42.899> overclock<00:00:43.469> this

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
212 with this so we can overclock this

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.209 
212 with this so we can overclock this
to<00:00:44.219> move<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.789> moon<00:00:45.260> we<00:00:46.260> could<00:00:46.469> probably<00:00:46.680> get

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
to move the moon we could probably get

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.790 
to move the moon we could probably get
this<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.730> 4.5<00:00:48.480> gigahertz<00:00:48.930> no<00:00:49.289> problem

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
this to like 4.5 gigahertz no problem

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.500 
this to like 4.5 gigahertz no problem
and<00:00:49.980> that's<00:00:50.520> gonna<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:50.850> great<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.270> video

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
and that's gonna be great for video

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.319 
and that's gonna be great for video
editing<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.110> especially<00:00:52.410> gaming<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.760> i5<00:00:54.180> in

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
editing and especially gaming the i5 in

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.000 
editing and especially gaming the i5 in
the<00:00:54.420> i7<00:00:54.870> gaming<00:00:55.230> lies<00:00:55.410> i've<00:00:55.649> said<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:55.890> many

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the i7 gaming lies i've said this many

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.010 
the i7 gaming lies i've said this many
times<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:56.640> don't<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.750> they

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
times they don't have you know they

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.229 
times they don't have you know they
don't<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> big<00:00:59.340> difference<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.000> for

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
don't have a big difference but for

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.139 
don't have a big difference but for
video<00:01:00.840> editing<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.469> know<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:02.129> eight<00:01:02.760> cores

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
video editing you know the eight cores

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.210 
video editing you know the eight cores
the<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:03.690> virtual<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.470> physical<00:01:04.920> really

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the for virtual and for physical really

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.420 
the for virtual and for physical really
help<00:01:06.119> with<00:01:06.689> render<00:01:07.229> time<00:01:07.439> stuff<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:07.950> so

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430

other things like photo editing video
editing<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.549> know<00:01:23.640> all<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.939> multitasking

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
editing you know all that multitasking

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.560 
editing you know all that multitasking
all<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.350> stuff<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:26.119> can<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> lot<00:01:27.390> better

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
all that stuff you can do a lot better

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.990 
all that stuff you can do a lot better
with<00:01:27.810> an<00:01:27.930> i7<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.740> ephod<00:01:29.040> will<00:01:29.250> get<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.820> job

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
with an i7 the ephod will get the job

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.999 
with an i7 the ephod will get the job
done<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> i7<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.259> know<00:01:31.380> speeds<00:01:31.829> up

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
done but the i7 just you know speeds up

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.330 
done but the i7 just you know speeds up
the<00:01:32.130> process<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:33.119> yeah<00:01:33.840> an<00:01:34.020> i7<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.890> will<00:01:35.100> run

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the process so yeah an i7 that will run

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.160 
the process so yeah an i7 that will run
you<00:01:35.729> about<00:01:35.759> three<00:01:36.329> hundred<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.750> ten<00:01:36.869> dollars

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
you about three hundred and ten dollars

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.990 
you about three hundred and ten dollars

enough<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.239> like<00:03:40.140> cooler<00:03:40.440> master's<00:03:40.830> cases<00:03:41.280> I

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
enough I like cooler master's cases I

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.100 
enough I like cooler master's cases I
would<00:03:41.459> have<00:03:41.670> gone<00:03:41.819> with<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.060> half<00:03:42.239> 932<00:03:42.930> but

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
would have gone with the half 932 but

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.289 
would have gone with the half 932 but
that's<00:03:43.260> almost<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.739> hundred<00:03:44.159> dollars<00:03:44.819> more<00:03:45.060> so

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.690 
that's almost a hundred dollars more so
it's<00:03:45.450> like<00:03:45.629> I<00:03:45.840> mean<00:03:46.560> if<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.799> want<00:03:47.040> those<00:03:47.250> extra

it's like I mean if you want those extra
things<00:03:47.730> go<00:03:48.299> ahead<00:03:48.659> but<00:03:48.989> I<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.530> don't<00:03:50.370> see<00:03:50.489> the

things go ahead but I I don't see the

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.630
