00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.770 

this<00:01:13.549> if<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.909> take<00:01:15.060> care<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.720> thing

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
like really well i guess it's worth the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.289 
like really well i guess it's worth the
like<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:20.280> or<00:01:20.430> two<00:01:20.460> dollars<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.210> spend<00:01:23.299> because

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
like one or two dollars to spend because

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.039 
like one or two dollars to spend because
it's<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:25.290> cheap<00:01:26.390> but<00:01:27.390> occasionally

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
it's like really cheap but occasionally

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.050 
it's like really cheap but occasionally
the<00:01:28.229> cards<00:01:28.619> will<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.579> box<00:01:29.850> will

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the cards will like like the box will

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.149 
the cards will like like the box will
open<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.079> because<00:01:31.890> it's

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
open like this and it's because it's

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.840
