 January 3, 2013 I lost my damsel today 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.420
 I do not have to laugh only to hide my 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.610
 pains between so much suffering breaking 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.710
 I'm sorry, waiting from heaven 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.480
 to hear again I love you is that they are 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.240
 so many things that make me remember 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.370
 and it hurts me today to know that I have to 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.350
 watch but I miss your kisses your 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.990
 cuddle your hugs when I listen 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.790
 I still agree, even though I love it, 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.580
 I blame myself for not having helped you 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.709
 the agony weighs me down and I do not have you 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.600
 my side my vision has your image 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.820
 appears anywhere and remembering 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.980
 as always the caresses of the past 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.230
 wrote a letter to heaven waiting for me 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.300

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.520

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.900
 please I did not think it was so hard the 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.690
 no matter what happens and the stars 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.150
 making a sign of it because I told you 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.670
 that you look like that but the most 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.160
 beautiful always tend to be fleeting when 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.870
 you left also took me from 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.360
 my smiles today only memories remain 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.150
 photos luck to the world to be able 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.670
 hold your hand but now this world 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.830
 It takes me away from you and I would really like it 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.720
 come to my voicemail the eavesdropping 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.060
 enough to tell me goodbye 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.760
 because rays had to stop their 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.950
 hearts and lack of love because it punishes 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.720
 with pain sir so much you say love me 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.330
 pick me up from life 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.970
 you are love because you can see me sad 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.280
 that you live in each one you killed yourself 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.420
 same and then I will think that you no longer 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.080
 exists 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.080
 I can 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.870
 and in these situations I always get lost 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.730
 just think that something happens 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.040
 things that I still have 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.140
 reinvent smile beautiful forgive me my 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.030
 love for not taking advantage of your luck this 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.340
 sound on my cheek waking up 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.620
 doing mine never allow that 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:28.400
 she sees me help from the place that you 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.400
 you gave and safe preferential place 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:38.630
 but it says decibels and do not take it off 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.249
 also rap and remember that there 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.709
 knows 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:44.709
 until he loses it record schumacher
