and then what they have to do is try and
get<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.479> ball<00:02:06.659> inside<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:08.009> one<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.280> these

get the ball inside of one of these

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.300 
get the ball inside of one of these
dispensers<00:02:09.060> put<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.289> score<00:02:10.679> has<00:02:11.160> to

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
dispensers put it in and to score has to

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.980 
dispensers put it in and to score has to
run<00:02:11.459> all<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.640> way<00:02:11.670> back<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.090> middle<00:02:12.360> here

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
run all the way back to the middle here

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.360 
run all the way back to the middle here
the<00:02:13.080> pressure<00:02:13.290> plate<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.740> then<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.220> light

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
the pressure plate and then the light

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.430 
the pressure plate and then the light
should<00:02:14.550> go<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:14.910> now<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.990> would<00:02:16.110> be<00:02:16.230> kind<00:02:16.410> of

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
should go on now it would be kind of

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.950 
should go on now it would be kind of
hard<00:02:16.620> cuz<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.890> could<00:02:17.040> steal<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.850> ball<00:02:18.660> out<00:02:18.900> of

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
hard cuz you could steal the ball out of

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.340 
hard cuz you could steal the ball out of
the<00:02:19.170> dispenser<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.150> only<00:02:21.270> thing<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.750> you

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
the dispenser but the only thing is you

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.140 
the dispenser but the only thing is you
have<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.680> hold<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.160> ball<00:02:23.370> when<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.700> carrying

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
have to hold the ball when you carrying

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.590 
have to hold the ball when you carrying
it<00:02:24.560> did<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.650> make<00:02:25.830> sense<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:27.000> guys<00:02:27.090> understand

you pick it up from a dispenser you have

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.500 
you pick it up from a dispenser you have
to<00:02:32.220> hold<00:02:32.460> it<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.670> can't<00:02:32.910> hold<00:02:33.060> your<00:02:33.210> stick<00:02:33.420> you

to hold it you can't hold your stick you

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.030 
to hold it you can't hold your stick you
can<00:02:33.540> load<00:02:33.870> your<00:02:33.900> hand<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.680> always<00:02:34.830> have<00:02:34.950> to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
can load your hand you always have to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.310 
can load your hand you always have to
hold<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.340> ball<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:36.420> he's<00:02:36.600> gotta<00:02:36.750> try<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.050> go

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
hold the ball and he's gotta try and go

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.740 
hold the ball and he's gotta try and go
place<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.310> didn't<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:39.240> have<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.420> place<00:02:39.600> the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
place you didn't you have to place the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.190 
place you didn't you have to place the
ball<00:02:39.960> in<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.380> then<00:02:41.570> hit<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.690> pressure<00:02:42.900> plate

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
you there's no way to like reset it

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.310 
you there's no way to like reset it
because<00:02:49.140> I'm<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:50.040> poop<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:50.550> but<00:02:51.210> anyway<00:02:51.570> yeah

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
because I'm a poop but but anyway yeah

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.170 
because I'm a poop but but anyway yeah
but<00:02:52.710> that's<00:02:52.920> just<00:02:53.040> an<00:02:53.220> idea<00:02:53.460> of<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.730> game<00:02:53.910> and

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
but that's just an idea of a game and

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.120 
but that's just an idea of a game and
what<00:02:54.540> we<00:02:54.660> can<00:02:54.900> do<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.200> we<00:02:55.320> can<00:02:55.440> probably<00:02:55.770> build

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
what we can do is we can probably build

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.540 
what we can do is we can probably build
another<00:02:57.110> goal<00:02:58.110> which<00:02:58.890> might<00:02:59.100> take<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.310> while

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
another goal which might take a while

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.840 
another goal which might take a while
but<00:03:00.510> we<00:03:00.660> want<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.020> set<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:01.650> up<00:03:01.710> right<00:03:04.850> yeah

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
but we want to set this up right yeah

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:06.950 
but we want to set this up right yeah
we're<00:03:05.970> just<00:03:06.120> have<00:03:06.270> to<00:03:06.360> knock<00:03:06.510> out<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.840> whole

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
we're just have to knock out the whole

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.400 
we're just have to knock out the whole
floor<00:03:07.520> but<00:03:08.520> it's<00:03:08.880> okay<00:03:09.090> don't<00:03:09.390> worry<00:03:09.660> guys<00:03:09.840> we

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
floor but it's okay don't worry guys we

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.380 
floor but it's okay don't worry guys we
got<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:11.010> then<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.910> would<00:03:12.000> go<00:03:12.120> up<00:03:12.240> to

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
got this and then it would go up to

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.020 
got this and then it would go up to
there<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.900> then<00:03:14.090> pressure<00:03:15.090> plate<00:03:15.680> would<00:03:16.680> be

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
there and then pressure plate would be

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.240 
there and then pressure plate would be
right<00:03:18.030> here<00:03:18.560> let's<00:03:19.560> get<00:03:19.710> a<00:03:19.740> pressure<00:03:20.010> plate

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
right here let's get a pressure plate

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.490 
right here let's get a pressure plate
okay<00:03:21.240> this<00:03:21.510> is<00:03:21.600> gonna<00:03:21.720> be<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.930> little<00:03:22.170> confusing

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
so that lines up to there something like

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.490 
so that lines up to there something like
this<00:03:27.870> alright<00:03:29.090> yeah<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.150> think<00:03:30.270> so<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:30.840> think<00:03:31.200> so

to lie on the redstone up and link it to
the<00:03:49.830> pressure<00:03:50.099> plate<00:03:50.610> right<00:03:50.790> now<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.090> have<00:03:51.209> to

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
the pressure plate right now you have to

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.990 
the pressure plate right now you have to
like<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.540> dispenser<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.040> dispenser<00:03:53.700> let's

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
like to dispenser to the dispenser let's

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.690 
like to dispenser to the dispenser let's
get<00:03:54.180> there<00:03:54.599> blocked<00:03:54.989> back<00:03:55.170> out<00:03:55.410> it<00:03:56.400> would<00:03:56.670> be

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
get there blocked back out it would be

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.680 
get there blocked back out it would be
over<00:03:57.330> here<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.489> what<00:03:59.489> I<00:03:59.519> did<00:03:59.879> was<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:00.569> got

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
over here and what I did was I got

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.000 
over here and what I did was I got
cobblestone<00:04:01.440> slabs<00:04:02.239> slap<00:04:03.239> me<00:04:03.540> or<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.799> slap

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
cobblestone slabs slap me or to slap

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.400 
cobblestone slabs slap me or to slap
slabs<00:04:05.340> right<00:04:05.580> there<00:04:05.879> you<00:04:06.390> put<00:04:06.569> it<00:04:06.660> on<00:04:06.840> those

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
slabs right there you put it on those

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.280 
slabs right there you put it on those
two<00:04:07.680> ends<00:04:08.099> just<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:08.910> redstone<00:04:09.330> is<00:04:09.629> able<00:04:10.200> to

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
two ends just so the redstone is able to

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.620 
two ends just so the redstone is able to
travel<00:04:10.910> just<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.120> redstone<00:04:12.660> is<00:04:12.930> able<00:04:13.739> to

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
travel just so the redstone is able to

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.719 
travel just so the redstone is able to
travel<00:04:15.630> up<00:04:16.590> see<00:04:17.010> how<00:04:17.100> we<00:04:17.160> can<00:04:17.340> go<00:04:17.430> through<00:04:17.639> the

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
travel up see how we can go through the

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.300 
travel up see how we can go through the
little<00:04:18.299> crack<00:04:18.870> between<00:04:19.109> if<00:04:19.769> I<00:04:19.829> have<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.040> block

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
little crack between if I have a block

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.280 
little crack between if I have a block
here<00:04:20.549> just<00:04:20.850> block<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.090> off<00:04:21.329> but<00:04:21.989> if<00:04:22.079> I<00:04:22.200> have

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
here just block it off but if I have

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.100 
here just block it off but if I have
that<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:23.220> can<00:04:23.669> go<00:04:23.790> through<00:04:24.030> now<00:04:24.660> what<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:24.870> mean

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
that it can go through now what I mean

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.200 
that it can go through now what I mean
and<00:04:25.710> I'm<00:04:25.950> ready<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.160> block<00:04:26.370> there<00:04:26.669> and<00:04:27.000> there

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
and I'm ready to block there and there

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.900 
and I'm ready to block there and there
I'm<00:04:27.870> gonna<00:04:28.110> get<00:04:28.260> some<00:04:28.410> repeaters<00:04:28.889> out<00:04:29.160> and

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
I'm gonna get some repeaters out and

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.120 
I'm gonna get some repeaters out and
we'll<00:04:30.180> put<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.360> repeater<00:04:30.600> right<00:04:30.870> there<00:04:31.169> just<00:04:32.040> so

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
we'll put a repeater right there just so

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.870 
we'll put a repeater right there just so
they<00:04:32.220> can<00:04:32.370> extend<00:04:32.700> all<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:32.910> way<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.450> then

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
they can extend all the way and then

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.820 
they can extend all the way and then
repeat<00:04:35.880> it<00:04:35.910> right<00:04:36.120> there<00:04:36.419> redstone<00:04:37.410> will<00:04:37.590> turn

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
repeat it right there redstone will turn

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.800 
repeat it right there redstone will turn
around<00:04:38.190> kind<00:04:39.090> of<00:04:39.150> like<00:04:39.210> that

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
around kind of like that

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.740 
around kind of like that
and<00:04:39.900> then<00:04:40.289> let's<00:04:40.530> get<00:04:40.650> our<00:04:40.970> stained<00:04:41.970> clay<00:04:42.389> back

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
and then let's get our stained clay back

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.279 
and then let's get our stained clay back
out<00:04:42.990> wherever<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:43.650> is<00:04:43.800> is<00:04:44.039> this<00:04:44.370> one<00:04:44.699> and
