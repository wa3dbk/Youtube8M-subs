00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
version right now because this is the

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.010 
version right now because this is the
first<00:01:49.069> time<00:01:49.279> I've<00:01:49.459> tried<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:49.999> and<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:52.810> do<00:01:53.810> not

00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599 
should be enough got pour in there

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.779 
should be enough got pour in there
person<00:02:00.590> thought<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.799> care<00:02:01.069> you<00:02:01.279> don't<00:02:01.520> want<00:02:01.669> to

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
melt it but uh straightening that with a

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.099 
melt it but uh straightening that with a
straightener<00:02:04.219> doesn't<00:02:04.849> really<00:02:04.999> work<00:02:05.270> it

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
straightener doesn't really work it

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.260 
straightener doesn't really work it
takes<00:02:06.349> a<00:02:06.469> lot<00:02:06.649> of<00:02:06.679> time<00:02:07.039> for<00:02:07.249> possibly<00:02:07.909> burning

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
takes a lot of time for possibly burning

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.880 
takes a lot of time for possibly burning
and<00:02:08.420> melting<00:02:08.539> it<00:02:09.039> which<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.429> same<00:02:10.700> could<00:02:11.090> be

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
and melting it which the same could be

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.190 
and melting it which the same could be
done<00:02:12.890> if<00:02:13.099> you<00:02:13.280> get<00:02:13.489> too<00:02:14.030> if<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.599> boil<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:14.989> too

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
done if you get too if you boil it too

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.840 
done if you get too if you boil it too
hot<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.530> water<00:02:15.770> so<00:02:16.160> say<00:02:16.430> between<00:02:16.700> 180
