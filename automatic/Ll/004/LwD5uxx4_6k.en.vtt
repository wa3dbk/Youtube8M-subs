pvp<00:01:02.850> spec<00:01:03.150> because<00:01:03.629> those<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.190> like

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
pvp spec because those you can have like

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.399 
pvp spec because those you can have like
two<00:01:05.640> instant<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:06.750> your<00:01:06.900> rotation

two instant that if you do your rotation
properly<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.700> useful<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.210> PvP

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
properly so it's really useful in PvP

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.569 
properly so it's really useful in PvP
whenever<00:01:09.869> you're<00:01:10.020> cutting<00:01:10.409> or<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:11.219> bugging

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
whenever you're cutting or just bugging

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.480 
whenever you're cutting or just bugging
people<00:01:11.609> and<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.829> pop<00:01:14.009> your<00:01:14.039> cooldown

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
people and you can pop your cooldown

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.099 
people and you can pop your cooldown
whether<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.850> need<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.270> bear<00:01:15.479> some<00:01:15.689> damage

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:16.109 
whether you need to to bear some damage

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.859 
whether you need to to bear some damage
and<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.299> actually<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.570> one

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
and then we have actually we have one

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.599 
and then we have actually we have one
healer<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.409> our<00:01:19.500> pyramid<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.250> east

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609 
healer in our pyramid and it's east

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.669 
healer in our pyramid and it's east
level<00:01:20.880> 11<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.689> don't<00:01:22.109> think<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.350> going<00:01:22.619> to

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
level 11 so I don't think it's going to

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.160 
level 11 so I don't think it's going to
be<00:01:22.770> much<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.219> factor<00:01:23.750> even<00:01:24.750> though<00:01:25.020> it's

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
be much of a factor even though it's

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.160 
be much of a factor even though it's
kind<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.469> scale<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.859> our<00:01:25.950> level<00:01:26.130> somewhere<00:01:27.170> so

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
kind of scale to our level somewhere so

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.190 
kind of scale to our level somewhere so
we<00:01:28.200> bombed<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.039> first<00:01:29.460> door<00:01:29.670> without

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
we bombed the first door without

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.980 
we bombed the first door without

18<00:01:50.280> he's<00:01:50.399> probably<00:01:50.579> need<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.149> game<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.539> he

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
18 he's probably need the game so he

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.809 
18 he's probably need the game so he
doesn't<00:01:51.780> grasp<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.259> concept<00:01:52.319> yet<00:01:52.890> so

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
doesn't grasp this concept yet so

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.760 
doesn't grasp this concept yet so
instead<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:55.549> coming<00:01:56.549> towards<00:01:56.969> me<00:01:57.030> he<00:01:57.960> simply

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
instead of coming towards me he simply

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010 
instead of coming towards me he simply
just<00:01:59.310> run<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.819> other<00:01:59.939> side<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.509> that

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
just run on the other side so that

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.379 
just run on the other side so that
leaves<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.499> door<00:02:01.649> open<00:02:01.859> for<00:02:02.069> me<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.880> plant<00:02:03.329> a

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:03.389 
leaves the door open for me we plant a

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:04.969 
leaves the door open for me we plant a
bomb<00:02:03.569> we're<00:02:03.990> going<00:02:04.109> to<00:02:04.170> defend<00:02:04.499> for<00:02:04.649> 20

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
bomb we're going to defend for 20

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.219 
bomb we're going to defend for 20
seconds<00:02:05.429> which<00:02:06.299> shouldn't<00:02:06.929> be<00:02:06.990> too<00:02:07.049> hard

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
seconds which shouldn't be too hard

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.529 
seconds which shouldn't be too hard
since<00:02:07.889> we're<00:02:08.160> pretty<00:02:08.340> much<00:02:08.520> stomping<00:02:09.420> these

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
since we're pretty much stomping these

dpsing but I still keep an eye on the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.130 
dpsing but I still keep an eye on the
door<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.239> case<00:02:15.269> that<00:02:15.599> would<00:02:15.659> be<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:15.959> some

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
door in case that would be like some

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.480 
door in case that would be like some
kind<00:02:16.319> of<00:02:16.379> ninja<00:02:16.530> that's<00:02:16.920> trying<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.360> design

bomb by only takes three seconds to
remove<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.750> so<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:24.490> second<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:24.940> door<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.210> open

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
remove it so the second the door is open

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.350 
remove it so the second the door is open
I<00:02:25.750> popped<00:02:26.500> my<00:02:26.590> sprint<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.670> like<00:02:27.970> knock<00:02:28.150> back

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
I popped my sprint and I like knock back

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.690 
I popped my sprint and I like knock back
people<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.110> put<00:02:29.290> my<00:02:29.410> bubble<00:02:29.770> up<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.190> if<00:02:30.490> i

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
people and I put my bubble up and if i

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.490 
people and I put my bubble up and if i
get<00:02:30.910> cc'd<00:02:31.300> i'll<00:02:31.420> try<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.810> break<00:02:31.990> them<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.260> CC

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
get cc'd i'll try and break them the CC

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.470 
get cc'd i'll try and break them the CC
with<00:02:32.710> my<00:02:32.860> unbreakable<00:02:33.160> will<00:02:33.640> then<00:02:34.240> basically

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
with my unbreakable will then basically

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.970 
with my unbreakable will then basically
what<00:02:34.900> i<00:02:34.930> do<00:02:35.020> is<00:02:35.260> i<00:02:35.290> always<00:02:35.680> go<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.100> furthest

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
what i do is i always go to the furthest

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.140 
what i do is i always go to the furthest
consulting<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.220> remove<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.640> force<00:02:39.880> field

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
consulting you to remove the force field

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.630 
consulting you to remove the force field
the<00:02:41.020> reason<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.380> do<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:41.740> swingley<00:02:42.340> because

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
the reason I do this is swingley because

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.400 
the reason I do this is swingley because
it<00:02:42.850> takes<00:02:43.060> more<00:02:43.360> time<00:02:43.570> like<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.050> gives<00:02:44.260> more

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
it takes more time like it gives more

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.740 
it takes more time like it gives more
time<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.770> my<00:02:44.860> teammates<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.520> stop<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.630> enemy

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
time to my teammates to stop the enemy

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.660 
time to my teammates to stop the enemy
and<00:02:47.080> also<00:02:47.350> it's<00:02:47.470> easier<00:02:47.800> for<00:02:47.830> me<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.190> have<00:02:48.520> to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
and also it's easier for me to have to

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.880 
and also it's easier for me to have to
this<00:02:48.850> ninja<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.450> door<00:02:49.900> without<00:02:50.530> them

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
this ninja in the door without them

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.510 
this ninja in the door without them
getting<00:02:51.130> too<00:02:51.820> much<00:02:51.940> attention<00:02:52.120> on<00:02:52.510> me<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:53.520> so

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
getting too much attention on me so so

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.980 
getting too much attention on me so so
I'm<00:02:54.610> going<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.790> try<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:54.970> plant<00:02:55.270> this<00:02:55.480> bomb<00:02:55.780> it

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
I'm going to try and plant this bomb it

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.890 
I'm going to try and plant this bomb it
again<00:02:56.520> hopefully<00:02:57.520> without<00:02:57.700> disruption<00:02:58.480> or<00:02:58.780> of

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.090 
program to communicate to make this
easier<00:03:07.480> which<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:08.080> could<00:03:08.260> recommend<00:03:08.650> strongly

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
easier which I could recommend strongly

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.190 
easier which I could recommend strongly
recommend<00:03:09.550> doing<00:03:09.720> but<00:03:10.720> most<00:03:10.960> of<00:03:11.020> you<00:03:11.140> guys

we<00:03:17.050> are<00:03:17.140> defending<00:03:17.440> front<00:03:17.770> of<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.980> 10<00:03:18.940> seconds

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
we are defending front of the 10 seconds

we are defending front of the 10 seconds
5<00:03:19.720> seconds<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.560> then<00:03:21.490> i'll<00:03:21.640> just<00:03:21.670> use<00:03:22.180> print

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
5 seconds and then i'll just use print

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.210 
5 seconds and then i'll just use print
in<00:03:22.900> there<00:03:23.110> and<00:03:23.320> try<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.620> get<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:24.010> reach<00:03:24.130> a

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
in there and try to get to reach a

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.600 
in there and try to get to reach a
console<00:03:24.610> as<00:03:24.700> soon<00:03:24.850> as<00:03:24.940> possible<00:03:26.580> obviously<00:03:27.580> i

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
console as soon as possible obviously i

console as soon as possible obviously i
mean<00:03:27.790> we<00:03:27.940> could<00:03:28.060> have<00:03:28.210> formed<00:03:28.540> them<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.810> bit

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
mean we could have formed them a bit

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.340 
mean we could have formed them a bit
more<00:03:29.080> like<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.070> longest<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:31.030> game<00:03:31.270> last<00:03:31.480> it

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
more like the longest the game last it

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.080 
more like the longest the game last it
also<00:03:32.620> mean<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:32.950> more<00:03:33.220> points<00:03:33.550> you<00:03:33.730> get<00:03:33.910> the

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
also mean the more points you get the

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.570

try to go on the side that there's the
least<00:04:29.710> players<00:04:30.090> because<00:04:31.090> I

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
least players because I

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.120 
least players because I
usually<00:04:32.020> stronger<00:04:32.290> than<00:04:32.530> other<00:04:32.740> since<00:04:33.040> I'm

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
usually stronger than other since I'm

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.240

level<00:04:33.370> 15<00:04:33.790> and<00:04:34.000> good<00:04:34.240> know<00:04:34.420> so<00:04:34.750> I<00:04:34.960> have<00:04:35.950> an<00:04:36.070> edge

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
level 15 and good know so I have an edge

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.580 
level 15 and good know so I have an edge
on<00:04:36.490> small<00:04:37.180> groups<00:04:37.450> of<00:04:37.570> players<00:04:37.780> when<00:04:38.350> like<00:04:38.560> I

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
on small groups of players when like I

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.940 
on small groups of players when like I
could<00:04:38.890> do<00:04:39.040> like<00:04:39.250> one<00:04:39.460> versus<00:04:39.760> two<00:04:39.790> for<00:04:40.120> example

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
could do like one versus two for example

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.370 
could do like one versus two for example
but<00:04:41.950> at<00:04:42.250> this<00:04:42.370> case<00:04:42.640> at<00:04:43.270> this<00:04:43.450> point<00:04:43.750> they're

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
but at this case at this point they're

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.260
