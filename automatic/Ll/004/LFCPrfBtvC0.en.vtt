00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.690
 and you guzzled youtube 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.170
 I was playing some matches there in 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.870
 open lobbies ranked and such and decided 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.830
 put on a test and move I hung up 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.380
 TV 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.769
 a few minutes later when I came back 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.720
 I came across this and spend the year 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.910
 doing this lately and this is a 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.199
 easy way to make a stir 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.970
 customized 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.859
 it's only to leave him in the Mexican test that 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.950
 begins to fill the room with people who 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.770
 They give a young man and I think it 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.910
 potosÃ­ staff at the fbc plant of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.309
 Funk do at 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.300
 some even tried to make my name 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.879
 funk 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.829
 hence the other fan in another qat I found 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.989
 very cool, and we already played one 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.980
 year and a half here now he's going to play 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.239
 other 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.280
 Only this one is going to be a little 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.010
 because it's going to be on this map that I 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.559
 I'm only going to be on this map because I 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.160
 I hate this map, and the weapon 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.989
 face 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.769
 this is going to be a great one with more 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:09.770
 suit and look at the time that is the worst 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.770
 at the time of g1 the gm does not gm name of the game 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.400
 show talked about the new game right on my 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.350
 disco is not dragon 10 it's not dude dude 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.470
 said I do not believe it 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.590
 beauty is this here is basically a 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.240
 where I say I miss the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.210
 first shot will have to go after him 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.650
 of the previous stab basically this 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.220
 Only what will happen if it is against 19 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.840
 and as you know I do not know cut copy 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.640
 I only know what the stage name is 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.530
 scam and my god 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:56.040
 our sequence that although this who 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:02:02.759
 I was ready to do it now. 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:05.040
 there knows that gun that despite being 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.290
 horrible she has a nice sound 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.290
 It may be strange, but I think 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:22.200
 I went there and I have a line there. 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:25.019
 line lined shot lined up and threw it 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.610
 I'm doing fine until I have one. 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.349
 affection reaching there already to that type 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.480
 of a face game that no one 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.370
 in this kind of a year of tinga business 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.019
 stand with your back to face walls 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.739
 otherwise he runs the risk of dying 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:50.220
 What I'm saying, what I 'm saying 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:59.340
 who comes to take a shot 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:03:02.340
 Behind my back I see that I got a 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.280
 table knife but could not 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:10.040
 Wow, I'm understanding this weapon now. 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:15.959
 She's good on Saturday she can shoot. 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:23.400
 with legal precision so far is only 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:37.019
 turning a little pistolinha practically and 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:40.950
 now you can see there is coming you can can 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:43.590
 I swear it is not operating worldwide 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:49.799
 Total live to the whole world against me and 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:55.440
 I had to stay there, he's the next one. 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:58.290
 victim comes in does not run away 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:05.579
 you can not escape your destiny your 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:08.489
 It 's our destination, I do not know how I 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:13.310
 I did not die this time and I think beauty 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:17.870
 Someone is coming here, how are you? 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.870
 eye command land command 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:25.910
 Look, I just used the atp's in the coop opa I 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.290
 I think there was a guy is not a 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:33.890
 chair 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:36.050
 Look at the scope, it comes loaded and I got it. 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:42.020
 the gun but did not catch ours with a 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:43.700
 huge advantage and that's what 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.330
 cool 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.550
 the map that I hate and the gun that I hate 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.530
 it's actually that gun I do not hate 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:57.790
 She's just too weak like I said to 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:05:01.490
 You guys have a nice ass sound. 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:09.560
 comes someone behind that phrase got 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:11.690
 It's strange, but it's okay, and now it 's just 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.580
 one more minute in the previous match I 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.590
 I did it in ten minutes only this one that I 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.430
 I put it on 5 because ten minutes is too long. 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.880
 long 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.880
 I caught Jose Luis 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.250
 now it's the last match I 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.820

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.820
 I'm going better 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.460
 Look, look, I had to do it. 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:47.660
 accessibility is very low is in the 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:49.990
 3 It took me a while to get there. 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.990

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:22.429
