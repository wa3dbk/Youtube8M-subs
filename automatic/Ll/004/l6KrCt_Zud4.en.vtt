00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
smartphones coming out these days we do

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.709 
smartphones coming out these days we do
have<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.489> 4.3<00:00:56.489> inch<00:00:56.730> super<00:00:57.239> amoled<00:00:57.270> plus

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
port and unfortunately this device did

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.580 
port and unfortunately this device did
not<00:01:46.350> come<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.100> micro<00:01:47.640> hdmi<00:01:48.329> cable<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.560> i

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
not come with the micro hdmi cable so i

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.139 
not come with the micro hdmi cable so i
have<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.979> get<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.310> those<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.670> test<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.030> out

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
have to get one of those and test it out

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.450 
have to get one of those and test it out
someday<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.409> bottom<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:53.130> our

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.399 
one thing to know is that the device is
really<00:01:59.850> sharp<00:02:00.240> down<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:00.990> i<00:02:01.020> don't<00:02:01.110> know<00:02:01.320> if

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
really sharp down here i don't know if

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.139 
really sharp down here i don't know if
that<00:02:01.439> will<00:02:01.710> appeal<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.159> many<00:02:02.310> people<00:02:02.610> but

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
that will appeal to many people but

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.300 
that will appeal to many people but
having<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.659> at<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> point<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.530> also<00:02:05.040> feeling

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
having it at a point and also feeling

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.359 
having it at a point and also feeling
rather<00:02:05.670> sharp<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:07.020> not<00:02:07.320> too<00:02:07.619> attractive<00:02:07.770> so

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
rather sharp it's not too attractive so

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.140 
rather sharp it's not too attractive so
