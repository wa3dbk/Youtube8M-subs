00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.210
 You can organize a website translation under 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.980
 running Joomla into different languages 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.960
 and I want to show the easiest 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.740
 the way and the translation will not be exactly 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.869
 quality as we would like sometimes 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.970
 so here I have a website to such 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.460
 training consisting of only one 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.170
 the only page you see here 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.910

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.980

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.200
 different languages means the easiest way 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.530
 how to organize it 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.059

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.380
 translation in order to paw him 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.900
 help is generally recommended in 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.880
 module settings 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.960
 set this parameter necessarily 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.310
 website language language site that is from the site 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.560
 I have in Russian therefore 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.750
 I exhibit Russian when more or less 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.960
 his translation is ok 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.419
 besides this there are settings that 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.169
 Well, for example what way to produce 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:23.320
 translation now we have 33 direct means 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.660
 how to show the translation in the form of flags 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.970
 either a drop down list or both flags and 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.560
 drop-down lists 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.110
 that is, they are like showing a translation and how 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.640
 choose translation language flag size 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.680
 can change here also starting from 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:42.130
 after selecting the site language you can 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:45.669
 exclude or include languages ​​that you 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:50.220
 want to translate well, for example Albanian 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:53.729
 I will put there is no Russian language site 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.729
 saving module 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.350
 now I update the site page 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.840
 look, I have Albanian here 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.070
 you see the letter and the Albanian is not then 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.229
 have we can exclude from this 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.570
 a long list of languages ​​we don’t 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:13.060
 need translation can be done 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.160
 click on the flash drive and the first is 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.500
 Russian flag because we indicated that 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.610
 Russian language site click for example 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:26.710
 English is done by google 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:29.310
 English translation see article 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:35.040
 transferred squeeze for example on 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:37.750
 french again google 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.000
 French translation in progress 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.010
 but in this way the quality of translation 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.160
 of course leaves much to be desired 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:47.080
 if you need to organize 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.000
 multilingual site in which the translation 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.150
 it will be better of course then 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.120
 machine translation cannot be trusted a 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.750
 it is necessary to do manual and in this case for 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.860
 Joomla 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.930
 You can install an extension that 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:04.510
 allows you to do manual translation of all 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.940
 site elements about what extension 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.889
 How to install it I use 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.979
 I'll tell you in the next video tutorials before 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:10.979
