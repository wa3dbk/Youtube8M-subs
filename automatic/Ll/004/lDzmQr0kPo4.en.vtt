00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
last one it's not quite a V at the very

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.899 
last one it's not quite a V at the very
last<00:01:26.560> one<00:01:26.830> because<00:01:27.159> we<00:01:27.280> have<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.490> icord

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
last one because we have the icord

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.460 
last one because we have the icord
edging<00:01:28.120> but<00:01:28.450> I<00:01:28.480> just<00:01:28.690> stab<00:01:28.960> my<00:01:29.140> needle<00:01:29.409> in

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
edging but I just stab my needle in

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.500 
edging but I just stab my needle in
there<00:01:29.650> and<00:01:29.800> did<00:01:29.920> it<00:01:29.950> now<00:01:30.760> this<00:01:31.030> is<00:01:31.270> tricky

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
there and did it now this is tricky

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.410 
there and did it now this is tricky
trust<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.530> pattern<00:01:32.890> here<00:01:33.190> because<00:01:33.610> if<00:01:34.270> you

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
trust the pattern here because if you

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.730 
trust the pattern here because if you
start<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.810> overthink<00:01:35.320> it<00:01:35.470> you're<00:01:35.590> going<00:01:35.680> to

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
start to overthink it you're going to

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.940 
start to overthink it you're going to
think<00:01:35.980> you're<00:01:36.100> doing<00:01:36.340> something<00:01:36.370> wrong<00:01:36.940> I

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
think you're doing something wrong I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.680 
think you're doing something wrong I
have<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.280> right<00:01:39.520> side<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.420> sweater

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
have the right side of the sweater

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.690 
have the right side of the sweater
showing<00:01:41.140> here<00:01:41.409> but<00:01:41.830> this<00:01:41.920> is<00:01:42.100> actually<00:01:42.550> the

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
showing here but this is actually the

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.090 
showing here but this is actually the
wrong<00:01:42.880> side<00:01:43.300> of<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.600> collar<00:01:43.870> so<00:01:44.800> you're<00:01:44.979> going

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
wrong side of the collar so you're going

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.940 
wrong side of the collar so you're going
to<00:01:45.159> turn<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.640> work<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:46.170> work<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.350> wrong<00:01:47.680> side

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
to turn the work and work a wrong side

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.620 
to turn the work and work a wrong side
collar<00:01:48.340> with<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.760> right<00:01:49.060> side<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.510> the

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
collar with the right side of the

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.930 
collar with the right side of the
sweater<00:01:50.229> showing<00:01:50.710> let<00:01:51.159> me<00:01:51.340> show<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.580> why<00:01:51.909> that

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
sweater showing let me show you why that

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.640 
sweater showing let me show you why that
is<00:01:53.310> because<00:01:54.310> if<00:01:54.820> we<00:01:55.060> unfold<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:56.049> collar<00:01:56.290> here

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
is because if we unfold the collar here

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.520 
is because if we unfold the collar here
like<00:01:56.830> this<00:01:57.100> right<00:01:57.850> side<00:01:58.150> wrong<00:01:58.630> side<00:01:58.659> it's<00:01:59.260> so

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
like this right side wrong side it's so

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.190 
like this right side wrong side it's so
when<00:02:00.070> it<00:02:00.159> folds<00:02:00.370> over<00:02:00.640> we<00:02:01.540> have<00:02:01.690> right<00:02:01.930> side

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
when it folds over we have right side

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.200 
when it folds over we have right side
showing<00:02:02.680> on<00:02:02.830> both<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.580> collar<00:02:03.790> and<00:02:04.060> the

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.090 
two different sweaters and I've found
that<00:04:01.989> when<00:04:02.230> you're<00:04:02.380> working<00:04:02.590> with<00:04:02.829> those

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
that when you're working with those

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.190 
that when you're working with those
fibers<00:04:03.519> that<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:04.000> really<00:04:04.299> if<00:04:04.600> you<00:04:04.720> really<00:04:05.049> want

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
fibers that it really if you really want

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.259 
fibers that it really if you really want
to<00:04:05.290> give<00:04:05.410> something<00:04:05.680> shape<00:04:06.100> and<00:04:06.430> have<00:04:06.880> it<00:04:06.970> hold

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
to give something shape and have it hold

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.720 
to give something shape and have it hold
the<00:04:07.959> best<00:04:08.170> thing<00:04:08.380> to<00:04:08.410> do<00:04:08.650> is<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:09.070> use<00:04:09.250> an<00:04:09.430> iron

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
the best thing to do is to use an iron

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.330 
the best thing to do is to use an iron
and<00:04:10.209> that's<00:04:10.870> what<00:04:11.049> I've<00:04:11.170> done<00:04:11.200> with<00:04:12.070> both<00:04:12.280> of

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
and that's what I've done with both of

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.009 
and that's what I've done with both of
these<00:04:12.549> little<00:04:12.790> sweaters<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.299> get<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.630> collars

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
these little sweaters to get the collars

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.590 
these little sweaters to get the collars
to<00:04:14.230> really<00:04:14.620> be<00:04:14.980> flat<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.700> perfect<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:16.570> that

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
to really be flat and perfect and that

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.900 
to really be flat and perfect and that
that<00:04:17.229> pretty<00:04:17.500> much<00:04:17.650> sets<00:04:18.010> it<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.489> you

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
that pretty much sets it and to you

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.539 
that pretty much sets it and to you
can't<00:04:19.209> use<00:04:19.510> an<00:04:19.720> iron<00:04:19.989> directly<00:04:20.530> on<00:04:21.010> a

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
can't use an iron directly on a

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.820 
can't use an iron directly on a
synthetic<00:04:22.450> fiber<00:04:22.630> so<00:04:23.080> what<00:04:23.260> I<00:04:23.289> did<00:04:23.560> was<00:04:23.710> I

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
synthetic fiber so what I did was I

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.520 
synthetic fiber so what I did was I
turned<00:04:23.890> it<00:04:24.250> on<00:04:24.310> full<00:04:24.850> steam<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.539> I<00:04:25.990> used<00:04:26.289> a

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
turned it on full steam and I used a

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.840 
turned it on full steam and I used a
linen<00:04:26.950> dish<00:04:27.220> towel<00:04:27.820> between<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:30.340> sleep

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
linen dish towel between the the sleep

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.240 
linen dish towel between the the sleep
sack<00:04:31.120> and<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.660> iron<00:04:31.870> and<00:04:32.320> then<00:04:32.800> pressed<00:04:33.070> it

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
sack and the iron and then pressed it

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.300 
sack and the iron and then pressed it
down<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:34.419> was<00:04:34.599> all<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:34.810> took

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
down and that was all it took

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.679 
down and that was all it took
synthetic<00:04:36.310> fiber<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.729> will<00:04:36.880> really

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:37.689 
synthetic fiber and will really

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.359 
synthetic fiber and will really
very<00:04:37.839> different<00:04:38.259> in<00:04:38.349> that<00:04:38.469> way<00:04:38.619> will<00:04:38.979> you<00:04:39.189> just
