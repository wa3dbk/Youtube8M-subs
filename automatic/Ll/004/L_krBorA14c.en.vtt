00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
little bit but I would say he was out of

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.420 
little bit but I would say he was out of
control<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.600> was<00:02:15.630> not<00:02:16.230> perfect<00:02:16.980> but<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.310> was

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
control it was not perfect but it was

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.640 
control it was not perfect but it was
not<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.850> perspective<00:02:18.600> especially<00:02:19.230> after

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
not this perspective especially after

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.700 
not this perspective especially after
long<00:02:20.010> layover<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:21.000> got<00:02:21.360> for<00:02:21.720> considering<00:02:22.500> those

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
long layover I got for considering those

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.560 
long layover I got for considering those
two<00:02:22.920> twelve<00:02:23.220> days<00:02:23.460> without<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.940> game<00:02:24.240> and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
two twelve days without the game and

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.230 
two twelve days without the game and
also<00:02:24.720> skipping<00:02:25.470> some<00:02:25.710> some<00:02:26.370> days<00:02:27.800> I<00:02:29.240> thought

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
also skipping some some days I thought

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.080 
also skipping some some days I thought
he<00:02:30.630> did<00:02:31.230> tremendously<00:02:32.070> well<00:02:32.370> even<00:02:32.880> better

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
he did tremendously well even better

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.660 
he did tremendously well even better
than<00:02:33.390> now<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.810> doubt<00:02:34.080> because<00:02:34.590> because<00:02:35.340> he's

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
than now I doubt because because he's

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.460 
than now I doubt because because he's
come<00:02:35.880> better<00:02:36.120> when<00:02:36.390> we<00:02:36.510> knew<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.840> he's<00:02:37.230> going

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
come better when we knew that he's going

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.710 
come better when we knew that he's going
to<00:02:37.560> make<00:02:38.070> those<00:02:38.280> first<00:02:38.580> days<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.090> control<00:02:39.510> was

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
to make those first days but control was

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.430 
to make those first days but control was
actually<00:02:40.140> a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
actually a

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.150 
actually a
very<00:02:41.950> good<00:02:42.210> pass<00:02:43.210> game<00:02:43.390> went<00:02:44.050> on<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.470> he<00:02:45.010> got

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
very good pass game went on and he got

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.880 
very good pass game went on and he got
more<00:02:45.490> into<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:45.880> he<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:46.600> got<00:02:46.990> better<00:02:47.230> there

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
more into it he just got better there

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.280 
more into it he just got better there
and<00:02:48.310> finally<00:02:48.730> um<00:02:49.000> he<00:02:49.540> was<00:02:49.660> talking<00:02:49.960> about<00:02:49.990> how
