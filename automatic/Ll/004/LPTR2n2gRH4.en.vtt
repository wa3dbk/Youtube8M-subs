00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.830 
leave it hold generally I with the
spinach<00:04:13.770> though<00:04:14.160> it's<00:04:14.640> more<00:04:14.849> than<00:04:14.940> aesthetic

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
spinach though it's more than aesthetic

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.710 
spinach though it's more than aesthetic
than<00:04:16.019> this<00:04:16.500> that<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:17.459> mean<00:04:17.669> it'll<00:04:18.359> taste<00:04:18.600> a

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
than this that I mean it'll taste a

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.289 
than this that I mean it'll taste a
little<00:04:18.870> bit<00:04:19.049> differently<00:04:19.410> because<00:04:20.250> it's<00:04:20.579> a

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
little bit differently because it's a

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.890 
little bit differently because it's a
strip<00:04:21.840> instead<00:04:22.680> of<00:04:22.800> like<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:22.980> leaf<00:04:23.270> but<00:04:24.270> it's

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
strip instead of like a leaf but it's

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.379 
strip instead of like a leaf but it's
more<00:04:25.110> aesthetic<00:04:25.740> than<00:04:25.919> anything<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.580> just<00:04:27.120> like

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389
