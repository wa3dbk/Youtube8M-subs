a little bit of SAP green and yellow
curry<00:01:32.580> just<00:01:32.970> plotting<00:01:33.690> in<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> main<00:01:34.050> tree

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
curry just plotting in the main tree

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.810 
curry just plotting in the main tree
where<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.590> want<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.800> to<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:35.039> justice<00:01:35.700> of

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
where I want it to be justice of

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.969 
where I want it to be justice of
composition<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:37.080> then<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.380> start<00:01:37.710> sort<00:01:37.950> of

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
composition and then I start sort of

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.249 
composition and then I start sort of
putting<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.369> some<00:01:38.640> more<00:01:38.990> branches<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
putting in some more branches and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.230 
putting in some more branches and
putting<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.130> detail<00:01:41.550> some<00:01:41.759> shadows<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
putting a bit more detail some shadows a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.540 
putting a bit more detail some shadows a
bit<00:01:42.479> cobalt<00:01:43.080> blue<00:01:43.289> there<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:44.220> top<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
bit cobalt blue there on top of the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.040 
bit cobalt blue there on top of the
burnt<00:01:44.759> umber<00:01:44.910> to<00:01:45.149> give<00:01:45.479> us<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> shadow

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
burnt umber to give us in the shadow

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.190 
burnt umber to give us in the shadow
because<00:01:47.450> I'm<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.600> sort<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.840> trying<00:01:49.110> to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
because I'm just sort of trying to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.170 
because I'm just sort of trying to
capture<00:01:49.740> all<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> bits<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.610> see<00:01:50.850> while<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
capture all the bits I see while the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.460 
capture all the bits I see while the
lights<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.660> because<00:01:51.869> sometimes<00:01:52.050> a<00:01:52.320> light

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
lights out because sometimes a light

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.810 
lights out because sometimes a light
will<00:01:52.649> fade<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.250> won't<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.670> these

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
will fade and you won't have these

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.370 
will fade and you won't have these
shadows<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.510> it's<00:01:54.630> important<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.229> capture

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
shadows so it's important to capture

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.410 
shadows so it's important to capture
them<00:01:55.680> while<00:01:55.830> they're<00:01:55.979> there<00:01:56.010> you<00:01:56.400> never<00:01:57.299> know

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
them while they're there you never know

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.149 
them while they're there you never know
when<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> sun's<00:01:58.020> gonna<00:01:58.229> go<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.860> here<00:01:59.070> I'm

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
when the sun's gonna go in so here I'm

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.070 
when the sun's gonna go in so here I'm
just<00:01:59.189> put<00:01:59.850> those<00:01:59.970> in<00:02:00.119> there<00:02:00.479> myself<00:02:00.570> blocking

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
just put those in there myself blocking

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.550 
just put those in there myself blocking

just<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:28.019> hint<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.260> crimson<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:28.769> haven't<00:02:28.980> put

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
just a hint of crimson I haven't put

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.229 
just a hint of crimson I haven't put
crimson<00:02:29.400> all<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.579> list<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.820> colors<00:02:30.060> because<00:02:30.209> I

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
crimson all the list of colors because I

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.390 
crimson all the list of colors because I
used<00:02:30.420> hardly<00:02:30.780> any<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.079> it<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:32.130> added<00:02:32.280> a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
used hardly any of it but I just added a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.560 
used hardly any of it but I just added a
little<00:02:32.459> bit<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.730> purple<00:02:32.910> there<00:02:33.209> where<00:02:33.360> some<00:02:33.390> of

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
little bit of purple there where some of

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.690 
little bit of purple there where some of
the<00:02:33.660> branches<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.950> background<00:02:35.370> sort<00:02:35.640> of

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
the branches in the background sort of

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.930 
the branches in the background sort of
turned<00:02:35.910> purpley<00:02:36.390> with<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.660> haze<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:37.110> the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
turned purpley with the haze of the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.039 
turned purpley with the haze of the
atmosphere<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.090> stuff<00:02:39.329> so<00:02:39.570> sometimes<00:02:39.930> it

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
atmosphere and stuff so sometimes it

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.030 
atmosphere and stuff so sometimes it
sounds<00:02:40.290> quite<00:02:40.500> purply

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
sounds quite purply

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.470 
sounds quite purply
so<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.340> sort<00:02:41.519> reside<00:02:41.850> rating<00:02:42.090> those<00:02:42.180> colors

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
so you sort reside rating those colors

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.759 
so you sort reside rating those colors
as<00:02:42.600> bit<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.810> burnt<00:02:43.170> umber<00:02:43.320> there<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.709> the

as bit of burnt umber there in the
background<00:02:44.160> just<00:02:45.620> looking<00:02:46.620> at<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.769> tree

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
background just looking at the tree

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.259 
background just looking at the tree
where<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.280> light<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.700> tree<00:02:47.850> want<00:02:48.060> dark

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
where the light is on the tree want dark

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.550 
where the light is on the tree want dark

dark so you can see the tree in the

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.449 
dark so you can see the tree in the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
want to see I use a lot of paint

want to see I use a lot of paint
thinners<00:03:01.530> here<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.830> start<00:03:02.069> taking<00:03:02.430> off<00:03:02.550> the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
thinners here and start taking off the

thinners here and start taking off the
background<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.330> sort<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.540> gripped<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.050> on<00:03:04.200> and

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
background I sort of gripped it on and

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.559 
background I sort of gripped it on and
started<00:03:04.830> using<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.580> cloth<00:03:05.849> to<00:03:06.090> give<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.390> some

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
started using a cloth to give it some

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.180 
started using a cloth to give it some
some<00:03:06.750> texture<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.440> like<00:03:07.590> having<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.040> lot<00:03:08.130> of

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
some texture I like having a lot of

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.880 
some texture I like having a lot of
texture<00:03:08.580> in<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.700> background<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:10.170> then<00:03:10.860> I

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
texture in the background and then I

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.610 
texture in the background and then I
used<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.489> bit<00:03:11.640> cobalt<00:03:12.030> blue<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.630> white<00:03:12.989> for<00:03:13.560> a

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
used a bit cobalt blue and white for a

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.850 
used a bit cobalt blue and white for a
bit<00:03:13.739> of<00:03:13.800> sky<00:03:14.069> here<00:03:14.340> putting<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.730> bit<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.090> sky

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
bit of sky here putting a bit of the sky

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.110 
bit of sky here putting a bit of the sky
again<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.220> clouds<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.670> are<00:03:17.730> moving

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
again you have clouds that are moving

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.190 
again you have clouds that are moving
you<00:03:18.209> might<00:03:18.239> want<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.599> capture<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:19.020> certain

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
you might want to capture a certain

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.380 
you might want to capture a certain
clouds<00:03:19.650> are<00:03:20.010> there<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.550> they<00:03:20.940> might<00:03:21.120> not<00:03:21.239> be

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
clouds are there and they might not be

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.370 
clouds are there and they might not be
there<00:03:21.569> by<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.750> time<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:22.019> finished<00:03:22.290> the

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
there by the time you finished the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.830 
there by the time you finished the
painting<00:03:22.560> but<00:03:22.920> that's<00:03:23.069> fine<00:03:23.390> so<00:03:24.390> there<00:03:24.599> and

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
painting but that's fine so there and

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.350 
painting but that's fine so there and
the<00:03:24.930> background<00:03:25.290> is<00:03:25.349> now<00:03:25.500> covered<00:03:26.040> with

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
the background is now covered with

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.460 
the background is now covered with
yellow<00:03:27.360> ochre<00:03:27.780> burnt<00:03:27.810> sienna<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.380> burnt

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
yellow ochre burnt sienna and burnt

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.670 
yellow ochre burnt sienna and burnt
umber<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.790> sky<00:03:30.060> which<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.170> cobalt<00:03:31.410> blue

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
umber and the sky which is a cobalt blue

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.020 
umber and the sky which is a cobalt blue
and<00:03:31.980> then<00:03:32.069> I'm<00:03:32.190> putting<00:03:32.459> in<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.640> branches

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
and then I'm putting in the branches

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.390 
and then I'm putting in the branches
again<00:03:33.300> back<00:03:33.510> over<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.810> top<00:03:34.019> of<00:03:34.050> that<00:03:34.280> I've<00:03:35.280> got

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
again back over the top of that I've got

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.190 
again back over the top of that I've got
an<00:03:35.489> indication<00:03:35.819> of<00:03:36.030> where<00:03:36.209> they<00:03:36.330> were<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.900> I

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
an indication of where they were so I

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.289 
an indication of where they were so I
know<00:03:37.440> where<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.860> branches<00:03:38.220> were<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:39.180> I'll

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
know where the branches were and I'll

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.820 
know where the branches were and I'll
just<00:03:39.420> go<00:03:39.600> over<00:03:39.810> with<00:03:39.930> this<00:03:40.110> brush<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:40.650> used

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
just go over with this brush I used

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.289 
just go over with this brush I used
quite<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.069> lot<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.250> paintings<00:03:41.640> in<00:03:41.850> there<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.180> get

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
quite a lot of paintings in there to get

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.840 
quite a lot of paintings in there to get
the<00:03:42.510> paint<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.620> flow<00:03:43.890> quite<00:03:44.220> nicely<00:03:44.459> with<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
the paint to flow quite nicely with the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.880 
the paint to flow quite nicely with the
brush<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.840> then<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.230> had<00:03:46.350> on<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.680> white

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
brush and then I had on the white

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.650 
brush and then I had on the white
branches<00:03:47.340> with<00:03:47.519> white<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.060> yellow<00:03:48.150> ochre

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
branches with white and yellow ochre

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.080 
branches with white and yellow ochre
cost<00:03:49.470> me<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.650> little<00:03:49.860> bit<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.130> both<00:03:50.640> serum<00:03:51.030> as

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
cost me a little bit of both serum as

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.110 
cost me a little bit of both serum as
well<00:03:51.120> just<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.510> tiny<00:03:51.840> bit<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.470> there

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120

the<00:03:54.120> tree<00:03:54.360> was<00:03:54.540> actually<00:03:54.870> quite<00:03:55.049> green<00:03:55.319> in<00:03:55.410> the

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
the tree was actually quite green in the

the tree was actually quite green in the
background<00:03:55.650> was<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.010> point<00:03:56.569> almost<00:03:57.569> the<00:03:57.720> same

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
background was a point almost the same

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.630 
background was a point almost the same
color<00:03:58.200> so<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.470> sort<00:03:58.739> of<00:03:58.830> have<00:03:58.950> changed<00:03:59.459> that

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640

out there's two things that interest me
the<00:05:14.740> first<00:05:15.039> is<00:05:15.849> the<00:05:16.269> inclusion<00:05:16.809> of<00:05:16.869> a<00:05:16.990> spider

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349

quite<00:05:20.649> sure<00:05:20.679> what<00:05:21.009> the<00:05:21.129> significance<00:05:21.339> is<00:05:22.029> but

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419
