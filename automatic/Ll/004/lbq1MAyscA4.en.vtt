00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:45.190
 surf with current 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:49.449
 publix says fai break the atrium of 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.489
 everyone can play and well what 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.280
 we started is go to the page that 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.120
 download in the video description 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.579
 we would have on the internet 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.230
 zermeÃ±o this 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.230
 it's an olive tree I counted that 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.590
 the most 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.850
 let's read down there none the only 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.869
 first that this is the new page 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.490
 not from a place that has not gone well to 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.149
 save 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.149
 here is flying 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:34.390
 and good the video that comes 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.920
 and we are coming young I encourage 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.920
 here is the friends we come 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.330
 some may show you this because it is 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:55.000
 very simple to fix it they just have 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:57.270
 that make an appointment can save and 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.270
 we have 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:11.780
 for this to download and run in the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.780
 language they want to select 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.310
 the following according to the terms 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.930
 and conditions before the next 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:28.540
 the next next and for the sack 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.400
 because I do not lie to you 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.400
 and why 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.900
 and some that the new version because yes 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.290
 is a 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.299
 before you will not be served by some 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.129
 tickets will take you out because you're going to 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.110
 say you have to use the new 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.480
 version of the new yorker 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.950
 some sites to say I prefer that 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.230
 update it when it appears yes 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.230
 because if they do not pay attention to it, it sounds 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.109
 because if you can not play the 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.829
 minimize and open the counter to see 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.829
 a play 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.050
 yes 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.370
 now 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.420
 people 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.380
 I will know what to say that is the photo that 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.380
 I have here 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:54.890
 remembering that I work with 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:54.890
 the miranda count 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.440
 Hail 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.840
 to see if it does not work 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.080
 dale dale dale dale 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:33.410
 and they see it if it does not work 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.410
 sometimes we can get the good guys 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.850
 good guys but you liked it 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.540

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:55.660
 7
