this<00:00:30.660> guitar<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.260> were<00:00:31.380> working<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
this guitar we were working with a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.410 
this guitar we were working with a
camera<00:00:32.279> with<00:00:32.480> AGC<00:00:33.620> ACG<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.250> whole<00:00:35.430> if<00:00:36.270> you

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
camera with AGC ACG the whole if you

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.520 
camera with AGC ACG the whole if you
don't<00:00:36.540> know<00:00:36.600> what<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.750> means<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
don't know what that means it's a the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.250 
don't know what that means it's a the
automatic<00:00:38.100> oh<00:00:38.340> no<00:00:38.879> way<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.270> AGC<00:00:39.840> sorry

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
automatic oh no way it is AGC sorry

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.049 
automatic oh no way it is AGC sorry
about<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:41.399> automatic<00:00:41.820> gain<00:00:42.000> control

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
about that the automatic gain control

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.740 
about that the automatic gain control
and<00:00:43.160> basically<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.280> kind<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.760> fluctuates

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
and basically that kind of fluctuates

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.600 
and basically that kind of fluctuates
and<00:00:46.020> screws<00:00:46.379> with<00:00:46.620> your<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:47.129> your<00:00:47.160> volume

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
and screws with your with your volume

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.410 
and screws with your with your volume
and<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.350> this<00:00:49.350> would<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.910> much<00:00:50.910> better<00:00:50.940> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and so this would be much better it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.110 
and so this would be much better it
should<00:00:51.590> it<00:00:52.590> should<00:00:52.649> give<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.640> way<00:00:53.879> better

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
should it should give you a way better

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.810 
should it should give you a way better
idea<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.809> what<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> guitar<00:00:55.980> sounds<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.309> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
idea of what the guitar sounds like and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.090

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:58.859 

cool

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.260 

a<00:02:01.229> McDonald's<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.310> true<00:02:03.490> story<00:02:03.670> and

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
a McDonald's that's a true story and

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.230 
a McDonald's that's a true story and
that's<00:02:04.359> a<00:02:04.509> horrible<00:02:04.750> sign<00:02:04.990> um<00:02:05.320> yeah<00:02:06.250> okay<00:02:06.700> so

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
that's a horrible sign um yeah okay so

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.029 
that's a horrible sign um yeah okay so
basically<00:02:07.869> that's<00:02:08.229> what<00:02:08.379> the<00:02:08.500> guitar<00:02:08.739> sounds

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
basically that's what the guitar sounds

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.380 
basically that's what the guitar sounds
like<00:02:09.099> I<00:02:09.369> guess<00:02:09.550> it<00:02:09.700> could<00:02:09.819> play<00:02:09.940> some<00:02:10.179> power

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
like I guess it could play some power

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:31.780 
like I guess it could play some power
chords<00:02:10.750> something<00:02:11.080> like<00:02:11.170> this

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:43.010 

actually<00:02:32.790> that's<00:02:32.849> kind<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.090> cool<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:33.330> right

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.190 

yeah

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
yeah

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.380 
yeah
so<00:02:44.550> hopefully<00:02:45.550> that<00:02:45.670> gives<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:45.970> kind<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:46.240> an

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
so hopefully that gives you kind of an

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.690 
so hopefully that gives you kind of an
idea<00:02:46.480> of<00:02:46.900> what<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.140> guitar<00:02:47.380> sounds<00:02:47.650> like<00:02:47.800> like

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
idea of what the guitar sounds like like

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.860 
idea of what the guitar sounds like like
I<00:02:48.790> said<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.000> my<00:02:49.060> last<00:02:49.210> video<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.540> was<00:02:49.570> trying<00:02:49.840> to
