00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
know that I think about but it's kind of

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.500 
know that I think about but it's kind of
tough<00:02:36.010> but<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.250> know<00:02:36.400> that's<00:02:37.000> not<00:02:37.180> my<00:02:37.300> father

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
tough but you know that's not my father

tough but you know that's not my father
my<00:02:37.720> dad<00:02:37.900> before<00:02:38.050> he<00:02:38.200> died<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.410> was<00:02:38.620> gonna<00:02:38.710> go<00:02:38.800> to

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
my dad before he died I was gonna go to

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.110 
my dad before he died I was gonna go to
college<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.340> won't<00:02:39.550> want<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.760> break<00:02:39.970> that

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
promised him dead so I think it'd be

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.460
