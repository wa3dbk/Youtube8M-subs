00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.130 
theoretically could kill a boss but
since<00:04:00.879> bosses<00:04:01.420> don't<00:04:01.540> really<00:04:01.750> get<00:04:01.840> stunned

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
since bosses don't really get stunned

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.309 
since bosses don't really get stunned
whatever<00:04:03.840> but<00:04:04.840> it's<00:04:04.930> like<00:04:05.019> the<00:04:05.110> ultimate

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
whatever but it's like the ultimate

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.599 
whatever but it's like the ultimate
technique<00:04:05.920> order<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:08.650> know<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.220> then<00:04:09.489> it's

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
technique order you know and then it's

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.660 
technique order you know and then it's
like<00:04:09.700> some<00:04:10.420> little<00:04:10.680> loser<00:04:11.680> guy<00:04:11.920> as<00:04:12.160> like<00:04:12.310> half
