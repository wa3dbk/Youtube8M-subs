I've<00:03:50.790> got<00:03:50.940> about<00:03:51.349> 6500<00:03:52.349> pounds<00:03:52.500> hooked<00:03:52.859> up<00:03:52.980> to

I've got about 6500 pounds hooked up to

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.759 
I've got about 6500 pounds hooked up to
the<00:03:53.190> back<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.489> this<00:03:53.549> truck<00:03:53.609> and<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.989> feels<00:03:55.290> okay

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
the back of this truck and it feels okay

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.259 
the back of this truck and it feels okay
but<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.069> got<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.430> tell<00:03:56.609> you<00:03:56.699> that<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:56.970> torque

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
but I got to tell you that the torque

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.420 
but I got to tell you that the torque
just<00:03:57.540> isn't<00:03:57.780> really<00:03:57.989> there<00:03:58.230> but<00:03:58.919> of<00:03:59.010> course

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
just isn't really there but of course

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.470 
just isn't really there but of course
the<00:03:59.669> 3.08

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
the 3.08

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.809 
the 3.08
is<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.840> smallest<00:04:01.169> ratio<00:04:01.769> that's<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.699> one

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
is the smallest ratio that's the one

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:03.979 
is the smallest ratio that's the one
that's<00:04:02.970> going<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.150> give<00:04:03.299> you<00:04:03.389> the<00:04:03.480> best<00:04:03.660> fuel

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
that's going to give you the best fuel

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.640 
that's going to give you the best fuel
economy<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.739> worst<00:04:04.949> torque<00:04:05.750> with<00:04:06.750> 3.08

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
economy and the worst torque with 3.08

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.409 
economy and the worst torque with 3.08
I'd<00:04:08.040> say<00:04:08.310> it's<00:04:08.459> pretty<00:04:08.699> much<00:04:08.849> a<00:04:08.910> weekend

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
I'd say it's pretty much a weekend
