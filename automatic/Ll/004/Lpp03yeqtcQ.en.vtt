was<00:04:07.470> gold<00:04:07.920> but<00:04:08.459> I<00:04:08.489> don't<00:04:08.940> know<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:10.260> what<00:04:10.730> what

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
was gold but I don't know to what what

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.190 
was gold but I don't know to what what
to<00:04:12.030> assume<00:04:12.810> from<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.680> new<00:04:14.100> game<00:04:14.580> and

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
to assume from the new game and

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.979 
to assume from the new game and
characters<00:04:16.200> would<00:04:16.440> be<00:04:17.010> all<00:04:17.250> gold<00:04:17.940> would<00:04:18.930> be

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
characters would be all gold would be

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.090 
characters would be all gold would be
all<00:04:19.380> gold<00:04:19.859> but<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.430> guess<00:04:20.760> it's<00:04:21.090> possible<00:04:22.100> many

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
all gold but I guess it's possible many

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.520 
all gold but I guess it's possible many
of<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.490> sets<00:04:23.729> will<00:04:24.060> Castle<00:04:24.630> related<00:04:25.289> but

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
of the sets will Castle related but

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.180 
of the sets will Castle related but
