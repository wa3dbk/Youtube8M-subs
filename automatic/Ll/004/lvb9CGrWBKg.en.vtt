see<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.780> tight<00:00:04.259> game<00:00:04.440> I<00:00:04.650> thought<00:00:04.859> we<00:00:05.819> weren't

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
see a tight game I thought we weren't

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.849 
see a tight game I thought we weren't
our<00:00:06.150> best<00:00:06.420> for<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.049> first<00:00:07.290> hour<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.710> game

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
our best for the first hour of the game

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.259 
our best for the first hour of the game
I<00:00:08.010> thought<00:00:08.160> we<00:00:08.220> grew<00:00:08.429> into<00:00:08.639> it<00:00:08.760> as<00:00:08.849> it<00:00:08.940> went<00:00:09.120> on

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
I thought we grew into it as it went on

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.600 
I thought we grew into it as it went on
and<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.660> got<00:00:10.260> better<00:00:10.440> finish<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.490> game

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
and and got better finish the game

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.690 
and and got better finish the game
probably<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.000> stronger<00:00:12.570> team<00:00:12.599> but

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
probably the stronger team but

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.650 
probably the stronger team but
unfortunately<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.299> wrong<00:00:15.450> end<00:00:15.599> of

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
unfortunately on the the wrong end of

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.760 
unfortunately on the the wrong end of
the<00:00:15.719> school<00:00:15.900> own<00:00:16.109> but<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.350> think<00:00:16.470> there's<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.650> lot

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
the school own but I think there's a lot

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.070 
the school own but I think there's a lot
of<00:00:16.800> positives<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.279> take<00:00:17.840> certainly<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.900> game

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
of positives to take certainly the game

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.779 
of positives to take certainly the game
asks<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.500> lot<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.650> questions<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.430> our<00:00:20.550> players

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
asks a lot of questions of our players

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.670 
asks a lot of questions of our players
and<00:00:21.119> was<00:00:21.510> interested<00:00:21.750> at<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.109> stage<00:00:22.439> how<00:00:22.619> we

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
and was interested at this stage how we

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.740 
and was interested at this stage how we
how<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.039> stack<00:00:23.340> up<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.330> shame<00:00:24.480> for<00:00:24.630> that

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
how we stack up it's a shame for that

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.880 
how we stack up it's a shame for that
guy<00:00:24.869> on<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> end<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.260> be<00:00:25.350> scratched<00:00:25.590> up<00:00:25.740> it

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
guy on the end to be scratched up it

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.990 
guy on the end to be scratched up it
would've<00:00:26.039> been<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.160> nice<00:00:26.279> round<00:00:26.640> off<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:26.910> you

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
would've been a nice round off for you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.519 
would've been a nice round off for you
he<00:00:27.330> had<00:00:27.480> been<00:00:27.599> good<00:00:27.750> obviously<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.199> score<00:00:28.500> I

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
he had been good obviously to score I

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.230 
he had been good obviously to score I
thought<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.160> need<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.550> see<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.760> again<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.090> see

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
thought I need to see it again to see

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.209 
thought I need to see it again to see
what<00:00:30.449> whether<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.320> wasn't<00:00:31.470> was<00:00:31.740> offside<00:00:32.070> or

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
what whether it wasn't was offside or

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.370 
what whether it wasn't was offside or
not<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.579> i<00:00:32.610> think<00:00:33.000> was<00:00:33.120> keenly<00:00:33.930> fought<00:00:34.230> by

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
not but i think was keenly fought by

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.420 
not but i think was keenly fought by
both<00:00:34.530> teams<00:00:34.559> i<00:00:34.980> think<00:00:35.130> there's<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> good

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
both teams i think there's a good

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.010 
both teams i think there's a good
quality<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.000> there's<00:00:36.510> obviously<00:00:36.780> stuff

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
quality in it there's obviously stuff

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.209 
quality in it there's obviously stuff

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
for us to work on at this stage of the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.200 
for us to work on at this stage of the
season<00:00:38.690> what<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> lads<00:00:39.960> very<00:00:40.200> hard<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.590> week

laughs what we looked a little bit leggy

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.840 
laughs what we looked a little bit leggy
but<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.890> wouldn't<00:00:44.070> be<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> surprise<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.760> him

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
but that wouldn't be a surprise with him

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.790

at<00:00:44.940> work<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.270> we've<00:00:45.360> done<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:46.320> considering

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
at work that we've done and considering

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.080 
at work that we've done and considering
it's<00:00:46.950> still<00:00:47.070> quite<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> long<00:00:47.460> way<00:00:47.579> from<00:00:47.640> start

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
it's still quite a long way from start

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.869 
it's still quite a long way from start
the<00:00:48.180> season<00:00:48.360> yeah<00:00:48.660> team<00:00:49.320> fairly<00:00:49.829> sharp<00:00:49.980> fairly

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the season yeah team fairly sharp fairly

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.160

sharp there's the room for improvement

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.930 
sharp there's the room for improvement
