average<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.119> 70<00:01:48.570> years<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.200> should

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
average like 70 years so we should

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.810 
average like 70 years so we should

the entire function of an adult mayfly

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.310 
the entire function of an adult mayfly
is<00:01:59.909> reproduction<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:02.750> their<00:02:03.750> whole<00:02:03.899> life<00:02:04.079> the

life no matter how nasty

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.820 
life no matter how nasty
that<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.270> nasty<00:02:10.690> we<00:02:11.050> humans<00:02:11.350> have<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.530> harder

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
that is nasty we humans have a harder

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.560 
that is nasty we humans have a harder
time<00:02:11.860> figuring<00:02:12.310> out<00:02:12.490> that<00:02:12.700> answer<00:02:12.910> I<00:02:13.240> mean<00:02:13.540> a

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
time figuring out that answer I mean a

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.240 
time figuring out that answer I mean a
lot<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.810> people's<00:02:14.080> answer<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.920> same<00:02:15.100> as

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
lot of people's answer is the same as

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.020 
lot of people's answer is the same as
the<00:02:15.400> mayflies<00:02:15.730> answer<00:02:16.120> but<00:02:16.270> those<00:02:16.420> people<00:02:16.690> are

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
the mayflies answer but those people are

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.580 
the mayflies answer but those people are
there<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.180> no<00:02:19.240> one<00:02:19.420> perfect<00:02:19.900> answer<00:02:20.320> but<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.500> do

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
there is no one perfect answer but I do

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.560 
there is no one perfect answer but I do
know<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:20.890> there's<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.280> time<00:02:21.550> limit<00:02:21.730> life<00:02:22.330> will

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
know that there's a time limit life will

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.540 
know that there's a time limit life will
end<00:02:22.750> so<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.110> can<00:02:23.230> answer<00:02:23.710> questions<00:02:24.250> like<00:02:24.340> this

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
end so I can answer questions like this

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.830 
end so I can answer questions like this

and fun hang on I'm figuring something
out<00:03:31.510> all<00:03:31.600> right<00:03:31.660> so<00:03:31.840> there<00:03:31.989> are<00:03:32.050> four

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
out all right so there are four

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.440 
out all right so there are four

categories knowledge health fun and work

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.940 
categories knowledge health fun and work
and<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.720> think<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:34.989> overall<00:03:35.260> goal<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:35.650> to

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
and I think the overall goal is to

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.370 
and I think the overall goal is to
maximize<00:03:36.160> fun<00:03:36.880> without<00:03:37.360> compromising<00:03:38.170> health
