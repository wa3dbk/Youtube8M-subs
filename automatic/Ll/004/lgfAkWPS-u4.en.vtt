00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
which i reviewed earlier so the big

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.150 
which i reviewed earlier so the big
selling<00:00:15.750> point<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.619> difference<00:00:16.920> between

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
selling point in the difference between

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.670 
selling point in the difference between
the<00:00:17.220> two<00:00:17.340> cases<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.300> one<00:00:18.680> can

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the two cases is that this one can

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.029 
the two cases is that this one can
rotate<00:00:20.039> 360<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.330> will<00:00:21.930> allow<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.439> view

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
rotate 360 and will allow you to view

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.240 
rotate 360 and will allow you to view
your<00:00:23.220> iPad<00:00:23.699> within<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> stand<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.710> vertical

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
your iPad within the stand in a vertical

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.910 
your iPad within the stand in a vertical
stance<00:00:27.180> which<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.689> handy<00:00:28.050> for<00:00:28.080> viewing

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
stance which can be handy for viewing

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.450 
stance which can be handy for viewing
you<00:00:29.609> know<00:00:29.730> newspapers<00:00:30.269> magazines<00:00:30.420> alike<00:00:31.460> as

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
you know newspapers magazines alike as

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.030 
you know newspapers magazines alike as
you<00:00:32.790> calculate<00:00:33.750> case<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.170> very<00:00:34.380> similar<00:00:34.710> to

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
you calculate case is very similar to

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.160 
you calculate case is very similar to
the<00:00:35.190> protective<00:00:35.610> cover<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.969> staying<00:00:36.239> single

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the protective cover and staying single

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.500 
the protective cover and staying single
stitching<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.950> think<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.790> front<00:00:39.030> cover<00:00:39.210> just

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
stitching I think the front cover just

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.810 
stitching I think the front cover just
slightly<00:00:39.870> thicker<00:00:40.230> or<00:00:40.410> not<00:00:40.649> much<00:00:41.010> thicker

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
slightly thicker or not much thicker

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.260 
slightly thicker or not much thicker
than<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.120> other<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:43.710> other<00:00:43.890> case<00:00:44.100> prior<00:00:44.460> but

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
than the other the other case prior but

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.569 
than the other the other case prior but
there<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.510> plastic<00:00:46.320> tray<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.399> you

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
there is a plastic tray that you

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.310 
there is a plastic tray that you
actually<00:00:47.789> slipped<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> iPad<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.079> course

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
actually slipped the iPad and of course

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.069 
actually slipped the iPad and of course
the<00:00:50.010> spot<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> apple<00:00:51.300> logo<00:00:51.329> hollowed<00:00:51.989> out

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the spot for the apple logo hollowed out

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.010 
the spot for the apple logo hollowed out
so<00:00:52.140> there<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.649> no<00:00:52.860> protection<00:00:53.550> there<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.930> you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
so there is no protection there so you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.799 
so there is no protection there so you
have<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.230> keep<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.649> mind<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:57.000> with<00:00:57.629> that

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
have to keep that in mind so with that

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.709 
have to keep that in mind so with that
you<00:00:58.590> simply<00:00:58.949> ipad<00:00:59.579> ian<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.000> i<00:01:00.059> found<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.420> much

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
you simply ipad ian and i found it much

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.959 
you simply ipad ian and i found it much
easier<00:01:00.989> than<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.829> other<00:01:02.100> targets<00:01:02.550> protective

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
easier than the other targets protective

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.189 
easier than the other targets protective
cover<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.300> stand<00:01:03.510> case<00:01:03.750> which<00:01:03.930> i<00:01:04.019> reviewed

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
cover and stand case which i reviewed

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.130 
cover and stand case which i reviewed
you<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.100> snap<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.280> into<00:01:05.519> place<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.960> goes

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
you just snap it into place so it goes

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.440 
you just snap it into place so it goes
in<00:01:07.290> much<00:01:07.500> quicker<00:01:07.740> much<00:01:08.640> easier<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.150> i<00:01:09.210> think

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
in much quicker much easier and i think

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.440 
in much quicker much easier and i think
the<00:01:09.659> channel<00:01:10.650> grooves<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.250> grooves<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.270> you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the channel grooves the grooves that you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.649 
the channel grooves the grooves that you
use<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.630> hold<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> ipad<00:01:13.590> up<00:01:14.060> work<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.330> are

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
use to hold the ipad up work and are

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.719 
use to hold the ipad up work and are
much<00:01:15.840> deeper<00:01:16.110> or<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.100> least<00:01:17.220> slightly<00:01:17.460> deeper

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
much deeper or at least slightly deeper

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.460 
much deeper or at least slightly deeper
deeper<00:01:18.030> enough<00:01:18.420> where<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.900> feels<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.170> bit<00:01:19.200> more

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
deeper enough where it feels a bit more

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.890 
deeper enough where it feels a bit more
secure<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.950> me<00:01:20.070> yeah<00:01:21.060> attached<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> side

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
secure to me yeah attached on the side

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.330 
secure to me yeah attached on the side
and<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.229> tell<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:22.950> moving<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and you tell that it's not moving a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.999 
and you tell that it's not moving a
whole<00:01:23.369> lot<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.909> says<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.380> position<00:01:25.770> closes

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
whole lot that says the position closes

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.819 
whole lot that says the position closes
to<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.780> next<00:01:27.930> position<00:01:28.259> back<00:01:28.619> is

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
to to you and the next position back is

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.240 
to to you and the next position back is
a<00:01:28.860> little<00:01:28.979> less<00:01:29.880> dirty<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.079> don't<00:01:31.590> risk<00:01:31.979> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
a little less dirty but I don't risk and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.219 
a little less dirty but I don't risk and
I<00:01:32.280> don't<00:01:32.460> think<00:01:32.520> you'd<00:01:32.670> risk<00:01:32.909> tipping<00:01:33.689> over<00:01:33.960> or

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
I don't think you'd risk tipping over or

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.350 
I don't think you'd risk tipping over or
anything<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.790> of<00:01:35.790> course<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.210> big

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
anything like that of course the big

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.249 
anything like that of course the big
selling<00:01:36.659> point<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.159> will<00:01:38.400> rotate

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
selling point is that this will rotate

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.499 
selling point is that this will rotate
360<00:01:40.259> degrees<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.700> particular<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.329> will

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
360 degrees and in particular it will

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.929 
360 degrees and in particular it will
allow<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.960> move<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.500> into<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.939> vertical

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
allow you to move it into a vertical

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.749 
allow you to move it into a vertical

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.969 
a cool feature to have but here's the
problem<00:01:53.360> as<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.630> see<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.439> think<00:01:55.890> this

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
problem as you can see and I think this

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.270 
problem as you can see and I think this
depends<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.610> your<00:01:56.729> taste<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:58.020> move<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.860> it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
depends on your taste but to move it it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.530 
depends on your taste but to move it it
is<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> bit<00:01:59.820> clunky<00:02:00.030> and

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
is a bit clunky and

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.930 
is a bit clunky and
man<00:02:01.660> it<00:02:02.100> realistically<00:02:03.100> for<00:02:03.370> me<00:02:03.460> I'm<00:02:03.610> not<00:02:03.790> sure

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
man it realistically for me I'm not sure

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.240 
man it realistically for me I'm not sure
it's<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.120> great<00:02:04.390> idea<00:02:04.420> if<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.650> need<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.920> case

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
it's a great idea if you need a case

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.660 
it's a great idea if you need a case
like<00:02:06.460> this<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:07.750> rotate<00:02:08.200> around<00:02:08.460> then<00:02:09.460> it's

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
like this to rotate around then it's

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.700 
like this to rotate around then it's
probably<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.030> only<00:02:10.149> option<00:02:10.570> currently<00:02:10.990> but

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
probably the only option currently but

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.760 
probably the only option currently but
for<00:02:12.220> me<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.730> is<00:02:13.090> kind<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.540> hassle<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.500> way<00:02:14.650> in

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
for me it is kind of a hassle the way in

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.200 
for me it is kind of a hassle the way in
which<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.040> have<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.340> kind<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.610> rotate<00:02:15.970> on<00:02:16.180> its

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
which you have to kind of rotate on its

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.630 
which you have to kind of rotate on its
axis<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.870> do<00:02:16.990> it<00:02:17.140> but<00:02:17.770> again<00:02:17.980> kind<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.430> nifty

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
axis to do it but again kind of a nifty

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.610 
axis to do it but again kind of a nifty
feature<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:19.660> but<00:02:19.990> you<00:02:20.110> do<00:02:20.200> trade<00:02:20.470> off<00:02:20.590> for

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
feature to have but you do trade off for

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.170 
feature to have but you do trade off for
bit<00:02:21.100> more<00:02:21.340> thickness<00:02:21.520> in<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:21.880> previous

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
bit more thickness in the previous

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.740 
bit more thickness in the previous
targets<00:02:22.600> case<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:23.530> are<00:02:23.650> reviewed<00:02:24.090> now<00:02:25.090> again

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
targets case that are reviewed now again

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.990 
targets case that are reviewed now again
sterling<00:02:26.620> starting<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.190> didn't<00:02:27.610> feel<00:02:27.790> at<00:02:27.940> any

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
sterling starting I didn't feel at any

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.180 
sterling starting I didn't feel at any
point<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.630> would<00:02:28.750> fall<00:02:28.960> over<00:02:28.990> it<00:02:29.980> was

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
point that it would fall over it was

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.920 
point that it would fall over it was
just<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.430> little<00:02:30.700> awkward<00:02:30.970> twisting<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.840> around

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
just a little awkward twisting it around

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.290 
just a little awkward twisting it around
and<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.380> don't<00:02:32.560> know<00:02:32.740> that<00:02:33.340> over<00:02:33.520> time<00:02:33.730> if<00:02:34.120> this

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
and I don't know that over time if this

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.449 
and I don't know that over time if this
twisting<00:02:34.780> makes<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.260> bit<00:02:35.440> more<00:02:35.620> loose<00:02:35.830> that

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
twisting makes it a bit more loose that

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.460 
twisting makes it a bit more loose that
be<00:02:36.580> something<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:36.970> have<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.120> watch<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:38.230> see

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
be something you have to watch to see

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.850 
be something you have to watch to see
you<00:02:39.190> can<00:02:39.340> use<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.850> band<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:41.050> secure<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.650> Kings

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
you can use the band to secure the Kings

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.070 
you can use the band to secure the Kings
but<00:02:42.130> here's<00:02:42.580> an<00:02:42.700> interesting<00:02:42.820> catch<00:02:43.270> there's

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
but here's an interesting catch there's

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.010 
but here's an interesting catch there's
a<00:02:44.290> gap<00:02:45.070> when<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.090> close<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.720> don't<00:02:46.900> if<00:02:46.959> you

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
a gap when you close it I don't if you

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.170 
a gap when you close it I don't if you
can<00:02:47.140> tell<00:02:47.320> but<00:02:47.350> it's<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.680> little<00:02:48.070> bit<00:02:48.370> in<00:02:48.850> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
can tell but it's a little bit in the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.910 
can tell but it's a little bit in the
center<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:49.959> now<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:50.170> kind<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.440> push<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.740> back

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
center so now I kind of push it back

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.220 
center so now I kind of push it back
trying<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.310> close<00:02:51.520> it<00:02:51.700> it's<00:02:52.270> not<00:02:52.450> as<00:02:52.660> tight<00:02:52.959> and

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
trying to close it it's not as tight and

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.260 
trying to close it it's not as tight and
I'm<00:02:53.709> not<00:02:53.860> sure<00:02:53.890> if<00:02:54.160> this<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.310> just<00:02:54.459> a<00:02:54.730> defect<00:02:55.150> in

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
I'm not sure if this is just a defect in

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.750 
I'm not sure if this is just a defect in
the<00:02:55.330> case<00:02:55.600> that<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.870> had<00:02:56.110> or<00:02:56.680> if<00:02:57.100> it's<00:02:57.340> just<00:02:57.550> the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
the case that I had or if it's just the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.820 
the case that I had or if it's just the
way<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.000> case<00:02:58.180> is<00:02:58.390> made<00:02:58.540> but<00:02:58.750> certainly<00:02:59.230> be

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
way the case is made but certainly be

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.880 
way the case is made but certainly be
mindful<00:03:00.160> this<00:03:00.340> when<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.520> purchase
