 extraordinary interfacing to 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.240
 held on June 8 this year 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.010
 on the esplanade of the former unit of 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.470
 humanities in which the 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.480
 students we present the following 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.779
 employee request with character 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.669
 urgent response with 1 we consider that 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.009
 the position issued by the rector of 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.920
 our house of studies is a total 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.020
 lack of respect when minimizing and overlapping 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.900
 the facts we demand a 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.329
 clear pronouncement blunt and without 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.399
 ambiguous ambiguities that reflects your 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.410
 obligation to defend and ensure the 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.590
 physical and psychological security of their 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.870
 students 2 we demand from the university 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.000
 Veracruz to be responsible for the 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.129
 medical expenses resulting from 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.980
 multiple injuries suffered by our 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.600
 companions not only the three that 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.559
 require the prisoners victims of 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.360
 hospitalization but the eight attacked 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.580
 action for which we demand a deadline 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.730
 maximum of until Wednesday 10 of 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.430
 June 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.080
 we demand the rectory and defend 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.240
 the relevant dependencies a 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.120
 protocol of action in situations that 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.720
 violate the integrity and freedom of 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.720
 his students 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.020
 or not 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.070
 by the machine 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.070
 to study subjects 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.040
 but not 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.960
 I do not care 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.960
 this year 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.910
 it kills me 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.290
 or not 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.670
 the truth 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.670
 at this time
