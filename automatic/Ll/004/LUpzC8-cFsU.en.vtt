I've used a number of different ones but
at<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.600> moment<00:02:00.720> i<00:02:00.990> use<00:02:01.200> directions<00:02:02.540> which

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
at the moment i use directions which

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.779 
at the moment i use directions which
looks<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.159> this<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.220> actually<00:02:05.759> a

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
looks like this this is actually a

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.960 
looks like this this is actually a
violet<00:02:06.270> color<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:07.320> they<00:02:08.100> are<00:02:08.310> conditioner

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
violet color and they are conditioner

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.260 
violet color and they are conditioner
based<00:02:10.550> semi-permanent<00:02:11.550> conditioner<00:02:12.090> hair

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
based semi-permanent conditioner hair

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.309 
based semi-permanent conditioner hair
color<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.350> it's<00:02:14.220> not<00:02:14.489> like<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.540> packets<00:02:16.019> you<00:02:16.140> I

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
color so it's not like the packets you I

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.550 
color so it's not like the packets you I
from<00:02:16.709> like<00:02:16.890> boots<00:02:17.850> or<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:19.170> they<00:02:19.380> have

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
from like boots or and they have

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.080 
from like boots or and they have
chemicals<00:02:20.069> in<00:02:20.250> them<00:02:20.400> there<00:02:20.640> are<00:02:20.730> no<00:02:20.880> chemicals

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
chemicals in them there are no chemicals

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.020 
chemicals in them there are no chemicals
in<00:02:21.630> these<00:02:21.810> it's<00:02:22.200> just<00:02:24.110> vegetable<00:02:25.640> matter<00:02:26.640> I

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
in these it's just vegetable matter I

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.460 
in these it's just vegetable matter I
think<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:28.670> it's<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> conditioner<00:02:30.180> based<00:02:30.470> so

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
think and it's a conditioner based so

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.860 
think and it's a conditioner based so
it's<00:02:32.190> not<00:02:32.459> doing<00:02:32.730> any<00:02:32.940> damage<00:02:33.209> whatsoever<00:02:33.360> to

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
it's not doing any damage whatsoever to

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.380 
it's not doing any damage whatsoever to

it locks the color in and it'll lock a

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.180 
it locks the color in and it'll lock a
lot<00:04:40.210> of<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.600> moisture<00:04:40.810> in<00:04:41.100> from<00:04:42.100> the
