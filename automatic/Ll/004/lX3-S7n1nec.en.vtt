00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
basically free just had to have

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.870 
basically free just had to have
neighbors<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.350> have<00:01:53.920> three<00:01:54.220> neighbors<00:01:54.580> so<00:01:54.729> the

neighbors I have three neighbors so the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.550 
neighbors I have three neighbors so the
highest<00:01:55.150> thing<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:55.330> can<00:01:55.510> get<00:01:55.660> is<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:55.870> swing<00:01:56.290> set

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
highest thing I can get is a swing set

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.060 
highest thing I can get is a swing set
but<00:01:57.400> before<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:57.880> do<00:01:57.940> this<00:01:58.270> I<00:01:58.540> see<00:01:59.350> my<00:01:59.560> talent

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070

idea<00:02:00.310> is<00:02:00.369> nine<00:02:00.610> thousand<00:02:01.150> nine<00:02:01.500> hundred<00:02:02.500> ten

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
idea is nine thousand nine hundred ten

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.900 
idea is nine thousand nine hundred ten
thousand<00:02:03.640> five<00:02:03.940> hundred<00:02:03.970> ninety-one<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.520> if

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
thousand five hundred ninety-one and if

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.770 
thousand five hundred ninety-one and if
you<00:02:07.150> go<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:08.340> used<00:02:09.340> most<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.820> my<00:02:09.970> life<00:02:10.179> points<00:02:10.450> but

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
putting into your inventory so when I

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.920 
putting into your inventory so when I
clear<00:05:49.279> up<00:05:49.310> all<00:05:49.580> of<00:05:49.789> this<00:05:49.940> as<00:05:50.210> you<00:05:50.270> can<00:05:50.629> see<00:05:50.779> I've

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
clear up all of this as you can see I've

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.140 
clear up all of this as you can see I've
done<00:05:51.199> this<00:05:51.379> multiple<00:05:52.039> times<00:05:52.340> so<00:05:52.819> it's

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
done this multiple times so it's

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.409 
done this multiple times so it's
probably<00:05:53.650> hundreds<00:05:54.650> of<00:05:54.800> these<00:05:55.310> should<00:05:55.639> be<00:05:55.669> you

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
probably hundreds of these should be you

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.689 
probably hundreds of these should be you
probably<00:05:56.690> think<00:05:57.080> hundreds<00:05:57.500> of<00:05:57.589> swing<00:05:58.370> sets

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
probably think hundreds of swing sets

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:04.240 
probably think hundreds of swing sets
are<00:05:58.879> in<00:05:59.060> there<00:05:59.300> I<00:06:02.349> just<00:06:03.349> might<00:06:03.740> think<00:06:04.009> that<00:06:04.069> but

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
are in there I just might think that but

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.399 
are in there I just might think that but
once<00:06:04.699> you<00:06:04.819> click<00:06:05.029> inventory<00:06:07.990> I've<00:06:08.990> done<00:06:09.229> this
