00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.320
 once again 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.109
 for the existing insecurity 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.459
 in the construction industry 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.699
 there are two other workers 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.019
 who have been victims 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.419
 finished work accident 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.689
 and I say incident in a social plane of work because 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.449
 it was about foreseeable issues 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.640
 as long as the companies 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.329
 comply with the norm 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.119
 the incense 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.200
 at work 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.510
 always when the company invests 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.990
 but obviously to the clothing companies 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.000
 and talking about companies like architects and engineers 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.800
 escrow 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.590
 they only care 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.170
 investments 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.730
 i will take out 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.810
 the biggest 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.340
 possible gain said path 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.990
 and for that it seems that human life is a bit 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.540
 despite the fact that security is an expense 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.070
 when reality 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.220
 Who 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.750
 are struggling to make a living they end up losing the 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.460
 we enter as a result of insecurity 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.460
 facing this situation I think we have worked for that general 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.650
 the human rights objectives 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.780
 the labor lawyers 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.850
 the technical engineers in hygiene and safety at work 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.990
 take a clear common position 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.020
 defense of safety 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.020
 of defense of normal working conditions 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.930
 that this is also associated 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.210
 the need to end up with job insecurity because the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.360
 job insecurity 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.710
 the job 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.840
 in exhausting days extreme amount of 10 pesos 12 hours are the cause 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.930
 Main 2 accident 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.420
 besides the insecurity and in addition to the lack of compliance 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.420
 of the rules 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.360
 vueling will continue to increase considerably and rosary in sum of 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.579
 the city where it is most seriously observed 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.679
 just in the insistence of this one although the whole in laos 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:16.829
 accidents have occurred all the producer in the country in what 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.999
 goes from the year of 65 deaths 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.539
 65 fatal accidents 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:26.840
 we have between this privilege in rosario where to have five 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.050
 five dead are rosario province 8 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.129
 but there are other tic accidents that happens no one Aryan 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.689
 piqué incapacitate the worker and haiti we also speak not only two 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.879
 Chinese accidents also of those diseases 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.620
 of those of work work sickness that many times pearls 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.620
 insurer watered work they refuse to recognize 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:52.449
 and what are diseases caused 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.449
 as a result of replacement by worker 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.779
 factors antier goal comic factors 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.549
 what are potentially disabling 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.379
 percent the case of intoxication for example of workers 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.129
 of villa constitution 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.739
 who is not a subject that in the press is trying a lot at this time 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.840
 I think it has caused death 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.809
 of one of those workers 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:21.229
 mocorito comunas investment is eta 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.519
 and it has been given this year arrives in a very short time 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.239
 by a hundred a huge amount of victims 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.209
 it's two workers burned in an oven 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.559
 by the way in prison i 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:36.470
 I live in a dead worker as a consequence 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.409
 of this poisoning 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.870
 therefore I believe that in that salary that workers take in their 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.989
 own image 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.389
 the problem 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.429
 that the workers themselves 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:50.699
 adopt the necessary measures 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.899
 to be able to preserve 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.099
 is your physical integrity 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.909
 i 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.839
 for the exhibition area of ​​paralyzing the production is necessary 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:03.119
 when the minimum conditions are not met 

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:04.769
 this work 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.949
 the minimum security conditions 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:10.109
 and this has to do with the independent organization of 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.949
 workers the employer 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.349
 the union and state protest 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.959
 to carry out a plan 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.029
 the leader 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.920
 to 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.890
 finish with the history at work lic get better conditions 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.090
 with one out 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.279
 Cuernavaca 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:41.499
 for now 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:45.449
 the numbers achieved a new goal 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:48.369
 they succeeded
