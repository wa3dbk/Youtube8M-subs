this is the second time I'm having to
report<00:01:17.190> this<00:01:17.930> because<00:01:18.930> my<00:01:19.110> computer<00:01:19.290> randomly

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
report this because my computer randomly

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.570 
report this because my computer randomly
decided<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.180> shut<00:01:21.540> down<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.229> me<00:01:22.260> while<00:01:23.190> I<00:01:23.220> was

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
decided to shut down on me while I was

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.410 
decided to shut down on me while I was
recording<00:01:24.830> anyway<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> died<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.550> first<00:01:26.970> time<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
recording anyway I died the first time I

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
recording anyway I died the first time I
thought<00:01:27.660> through<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.890> cut

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.899 

okay<00:02:20.469> what's<00:02:20.739> in<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.189> that<00:02:21.609> no<00:02:22.450> but<00:02:23.140> anyway

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
okay what's in it is that no but anyway

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.330 
okay what's in it is that no but anyway
it<00:02:24.909> was<00:02:24.939> like<00:02:25.780> outside<00:02:26.019> of<00:02:26.499> the<00:02:26.739> spot<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:27.219> can

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
it was like outside of the spot you can

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.369 
it was like outside of the spot you can
actually<00:02:27.549> go<00:02:27.939> it's<00:02:28.180> too<00:02:28.450> far<00:02:28.780> away<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.139> I

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
actually go it's too far away and I

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.520 
actually go it's too far away and I
can't<00:02:29.409> get<00:02:30.159> to<00:02:30.459> it

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
can't get to it

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.750 
can't get to it
seriously<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.709> far<00:02:32.980> away<00:02:33.219> it's<00:02:33.400> all<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.639> way

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
seriously that far away it's all the way

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.559 
seriously that far away it's all the way
outside<00:02:34.599> of<00:02:34.659> the<00:02:34.930> playing<00:02:35.349> area<00:02:36.209> if<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:37.389> go

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
outside of the playing area if you go

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.390 
outside of the playing area if you go
too<00:02:37.989> far<00:02:38.230> out<00:02:38.290> there<00:02:38.709> there's<00:02:39.010> gonna<00:02:39.129> be<00:02:39.250> like

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
too far out there there's gonna be like

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.550 
too far out there there's gonna be like
no<00:02:39.579> we<00:02:39.939> can't<00:02:40.239> go<00:02:40.389> here<00:02:40.629> we<00:02:40.810> gotta<00:02:40.959> turn<00:02:41.200> around

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
no we can't go here we gotta turn around

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.300 
no we can't go here we gotta turn around
and<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:43.569> other<00:02:43.780> glitch<00:02:44.260> that's<00:02:44.680> Bernie<00:02:45.129> to

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
and the other glitch that's Bernie to

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.629 
and the other glitch that's Bernie to
see<00:02:45.639> how<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.629> boxes<00:02:46.870> are<00:02:47.409> health<00:02:48.159> leaders<00:02:48.519> are

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
see how the boxes are health leaders are

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:54.059 
see how the boxes are health leaders are
empty<00:02:49.769> yeah<00:02:50.769> usually<00:02:51.400> when<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:53.049> box<00:02:53.530> runs<00:02:53.919> out

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
empty yeah usually when a box runs out

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.220 
empty yeah usually when a box runs out
of<00:02:54.099> health<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.760> only<00:02:55.540> have<00:02:55.719> to<00:02:55.810> stake<00:02:56.049> the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
of health you only have to stake the

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.140 
of health you only have to stake the
ones<00:02:56.409> that<00:02:56.680> remaining<00:02:57.069> and<00:02:57.370> then<00:02:57.489> you<00:02:57.609> win<00:02:57.849> at

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
ones that remaining and then you win at

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.129 
ones that remaining and then you win at
least<00:02:58.329> I<00:02:58.510> think<00:02:58.780> that's<00:02:59.109> how<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.349> goes<00:03:00.299> but<00:03:01.299> for

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
least I think that's how it goes but for

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.819 
least I think that's how it goes but for
some<00:03:02.500> reason<00:03:03.219> even<00:03:03.639> though<00:03:04.000> two<00:03:04.629> of<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.650> boxes

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
some reason even though two of the boxes

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.420 
some reason even though two of the boxes
lost<00:03:06.370> their<00:03:06.699> house<00:03:07.620> they're<00:03:08.620> still<00:03:08.980> make<00:03:09.189> you

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
lost their house they're still make you

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.039 
lost their house they're still make you
kill<00:03:10.060> all<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.329> enemies<00:03:11.609> even<00:03:12.609> though<00:03:13.049> clearly

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
kill all the enemies even though clearly

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.280 
kill all the enemies even though clearly
it<00:03:14.739> looks<00:03:15.010> like<00:03:15.159> you're<00:03:15.340> asleep<00:03:15.459> one<00:03:16.060> yes<00:03:17.049> it

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
it looks like you're asleep one yes it

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.990 
it looks like you're asleep one yes it
looks<00:03:17.469> like<00:03:17.530> this<00:03:17.799> loved<00:03:18.040> us<00:03:18.159> must<00:03:18.370> be<00:03:18.519> over

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
looks like this loved us must be over

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.849 
looks like this loved us must be over
because<00:03:19.329> work<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.780> timer's<00:03:20.169> not<00:03:20.199> even<00:03:20.590> there

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
because work the timer's not even there

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:21.330 
because work the timer's not even there
anymore

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
anymore

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.089 
anymore
that<00:03:22.150> shows<00:03:22.419> you<00:03:22.930> know<00:03:23.049> how<00:03:23.319> many<00:03:23.620> enemies<00:03:24.069> are

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
that shows you know how many enemies are

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:32.490 
that shows you know how many enemies are
left<00:03:25.079> so<00:03:26.079> that's<00:03:26.290> very<00:03:27.180> odd<00:03:30.569> yeah<00:03:31.569> it's<00:03:32.109> very

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
left so that's very odd yeah it's very

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.030 
left so that's very odd yeah it's very
strange<00:03:33.189> glitch<00:03:34.290> just<00:03:35.290> kill<00:03:35.590> all<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:36.009> enemies

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
strange glitch just kill all the enemies

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.249 
strange glitch just kill all the enemies
would<00:03:36.699> say<00:03:36.909> all<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.239> boxes<00:03:37.359> whether<00:03:37.959> they're

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:38.259 
would say all the boxes whether they're

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.379 
would say all the boxes whether they're
dead<00:03:38.650> or<00:03:38.829> not<00:03:39.009> I'm<00:03:39.280> not<00:03:39.459> sure<00:03:39.639> if<00:03:39.699> it's<00:03:39.819> just<00:03:40.030> my

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
dead or not I'm not sure if it's just my
