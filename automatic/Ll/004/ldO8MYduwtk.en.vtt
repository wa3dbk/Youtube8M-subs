over and over again and it gets

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.080 
over and over again and it gets
repetitive<00:02:30.900> also<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.769> soundtrack<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.489> basic

great<00:03:18.450> or<00:03:18.630> appealing<00:03:19.049> or<00:03:19.290> even<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.709> pretty

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
great or appealing or even that pretty

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.610 
great or appealing or even that pretty
but<00:03:21.030> when<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.299> are<00:03:21.329> like<00:03:21.660> whooping<00:03:22.139> around<00:03:22.260> in

fighting off big creatures and stuff

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.150 
fighting off big creatures and stuff
it's<00:03:26.910> really<00:03:27.180> damn<00:03:27.600> good<00:03:27.630> looking<00:03:27.989> so<00:03:28.380> overall

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
it's really damn good looking so overall

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.400 
it's really damn good looking so overall
graphically<00:03:29.910> it's<00:03:30.180> hit<00:03:30.420> or<00:03:30.450> miss<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:30.989> would<00:03:31.290> say

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
graphically it's hit or miss I would say

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.080 
graphically it's hit or miss I would say
it's<00:03:31.530> more<00:03:31.590> hit<00:03:31.980> though<00:03:32.190> because<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.760> city<00:03:32.970> is

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
it's more hit though because the city is

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.420 
it's more hit though because the city is

what<00:04:27.240> be<00:04:27.390> Knox<00:04:27.630> introduces<00:04:28.350> into<00:04:28.530> this<00:04:28.770> game

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
what be Knox introduces into this game

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.980 
what be Knox introduces into this game
is<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.310> new<00:04:29.580> way<00:04:29.850> to<00:04:29.880> swing<00:04:30.360> around<00:04:30.480> the<00:04:30.720> city

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
is a new way to swing around the city

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.260 
is a new way to swing around the city
and<00:04:31.170> it's<00:04:31.590> called<00:04:31.890> the<00:04:32.160> web<00:04:32.400> rush<00:04:32.760> ability

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
and it's called the web rush ability

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.510 
and it's called the web rush ability
which<00:04:33.450> actually<00:04:33.630> slows<00:04:34.140> down<00:04:34.320> time<00:04:34.680> makes<00:04:35.310> you

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
which actually slows down time makes you

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.160 
which actually slows down time makes you
see<00:04:35.760> through<00:04:36.090> spider-man's<00:04:36.660> eyes<00:04:36.870> and

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
see through spider-man's eyes and

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.170 
see through spider-man's eyes and
whatever<00:04:37.680> point<00:04:38.010> you<00:04:38.220> pick<00:04:38.490> on<00:04:38.670> the<00:04:38.790> map<00:04:38.970> you

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
whatever point you pick on the map you

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.910 
whatever point you pick on the map you
will<00:04:39.390> automatically<00:04:40.170> swing<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.800> that

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
will automatically swing to that

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.950 
will automatically swing to that
location<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:41.610> if<00:04:41.700> you<00:04:41.790> pick<00:04:41.970> like<00:04:42.150> a<00:04:42.330> part<00:04:42.750> of<00:04:42.840> a

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
location so if you pick like a part of a

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.110 
location so if you pick like a part of a
