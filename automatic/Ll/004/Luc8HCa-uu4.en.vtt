sort<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.560> looks<00:01:49.770> design<00:01:50.369> wise<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.600> fact

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
sort of looks design wise is the fact

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.569 
sort of looks design wise is the fact
that<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.110> krk<00:01:52.560> logo<00:01:52.920> lights<00:01:53.159> up<00:01:53.399> when<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
that the krk logo lights up when the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.639 
that the krk logo lights up when the
speakers<00:01:53.939> are<00:01:54.060> powered<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.509> think<00:01:55.320> this

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
speakers are powered I think this

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.289 
speakers are powered I think this
happened<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.430> other<00:01:56.549> speakers<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.210> stuff

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
happened on the other speakers and stuff

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.790 
happened on the other speakers and stuff
but<00:01:57.780> yeah<00:01:57.930> looks<00:01:58.259> pretty<00:01:58.500> cool

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.320 

ok<00:02:02.800> so<00:02:02.860> these<00:02:03.160> are<00:02:03.220> fairly<00:02:03.580> standard<00:02:03.910> you've

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
ok so these are fairly standard you've

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
listening the the clarity between the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.840 
listening the the clarity between the
stereo<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.050> mono<00:03:08.080> sounds<00:03:08.770> was<00:03:08.920> massive<00:03:09.459> like

stereo and mono sounds was massive like

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.850 
stereo and mono sounds was massive like
that<00:03:10.120> was<00:03:10.239> noticeable<00:03:10.840> on<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.080> first<00:03:11.290> track<00:03:11.650> I

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
that was noticeable on the first track I

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.490 
that was noticeable on the first track I
played<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.940> know<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.060> could<00:03:13.330> hear<00:03:13.630> where<00:03:14.290> each

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
played you know I could hear where each

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.040 
played you know I could hear where each
different<00:03:14.950> sound<00:03:15.250> was<00:03:15.459> coming<00:03:15.640> from<00:03:16.050> which

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
different sound was coming from which

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.750 
different sound was coming from which
for<00:03:17.260> me<00:03:17.410> was<00:03:17.440> at<00:03:17.739> first<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.280> know<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.580> the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
for me was at first you know that the

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.449 
for me was at first you know that the
samson's<00:03:19.330> were<00:03:19.630> way<00:03:20.620> more<00:03:20.650> muddy<00:03:21.130> in<00:03:21.340> the

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
samson's were way more muddy in the

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.140 
samson's were way more muddy in the
stereo<00:03:21.820> field<00:03:21.880> was<00:03:22.330> nowhere<00:03:22.540> near<00:03:22.690> as<00:03:22.959> good

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
stereo field was nowhere near as good

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.390 
stereo field was nowhere near as good
so<00:03:25.510> yeah<00:03:25.689> these<00:03:25.870> are<00:03:26.019> pretty<00:03:26.200> cool<00:03:26.349> and<00:03:26.590> the

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
so yeah these are pretty cool and the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.160 
so yeah these are pretty cool and the
other<00:03:27.549> thing<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:27.849> noticed<00:03:27.909> was<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.390> bass<00:03:28.689> at

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
other thing I noticed was the bass at

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.170 
other thing I noticed was the bass at
long<00:03:29.439> last<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:30.069> actually<00:03:30.340> have<00:03:30.760> something<00:03:31.030> to

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
long last I actually have something to

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.300 
long last I actually have something to
play<00:03:31.360> around<00:03:31.629> with<00:03:31.900> I<00:03:32.170> listened<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.069> few

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
play around with I listened to a few

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.890 
play around with I listened to a few
tracks<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:33.760> notice<00:03:34.030> how<00:03:34.150> punchy<00:03:34.569> and<00:03:34.629> smooth

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
tracks and notice how punchy and smooth

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.800 
tracks and notice how punchy and smooth
the<00:03:35.049> bottom<00:03:35.349> end<00:03:35.530> sounded<00:03:36.269> that's<00:03:37.269> not<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.629> say

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
the bottom end sounded that's not to say

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.259 
the bottom end sounded that's not to say
that<00:03:37.840> it's<00:03:38.379> exaggerated<00:03:39.120> because<00:03:40.120> obviously

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
that it's exaggerated because obviously

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.449 
that it's exaggerated because obviously
some<00:03:40.629> people<00:03:40.930> complain<00:03:41.680> that<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.950> Kerr<00:03:42.159> caves

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
some people complain that the Kerr caves

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.229 
some people complain that the Kerr caves
can<00:03:42.760> be<00:03:43.019> way<00:03:44.019> too<00:03:44.079> bassy<00:03:44.440> or<00:03:45.129> whatever<00:03:45.459> but<00:03:46.120> now

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
can be way too bassy or whatever but now

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.309 
can be way too bassy or whatever but now
I<00:03:46.269> didn't<00:03:46.540> think<00:03:46.629> they<00:03:46.780> were<00:03:46.840> thought<00:03:47.200> they

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
I didn't think they were thought they

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.039 
I didn't think they were thought they
were<00:03:47.379> pretty<00:03:47.500> spot-on<00:03:48.390> for<00:03:49.390> me<00:03:49.569> they're

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
were pretty spot-on for me they're

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.809 
were pretty spot-on for me they're
exactly<00:03:50.409> what<00:03:50.560> I'm<00:03:50.709> after<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.459> other<00:03:51.609> thing

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
exactly what I'm after the other thing

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.330 
exactly what I'm after the other thing
is<00:03:51.970> if<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.390> bass<00:03:52.569> is<00:03:52.900> too<00:03:53.140> much<00:03:53.349> if<00:03:54.159> you're

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
is if the bass is too much if you're

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.770 
is if the bass is too much if you're
getting<00:03:54.549> way<00:03:54.700> too<00:03:54.760> much<00:03:55.120> bass<00:03:55.390> from<00:03:55.599> these

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
getting way too much bass from these

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.270 
getting way too much bass from these
things<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:57.430> can<00:03:57.640> turn<00:03:57.849> it<00:03:58.000> down<00:03:59.099> or<00:04:00.099> you<00:04:00.220> can

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
things you can turn it down or you can

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.770 
things you can turn it down or you can
adjust<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.849> on<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.030> back<00:04:01.299> of<00:04:01.329> the<00:04:01.540> speaker

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
adjust it on the back of the speaker

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.660

the<00:04:13.299> sound<00:04:13.569> like<00:04:13.930> people<00:04:14.470> say<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:14.920> you<00:04:15.069> know

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
the sound like people say that you know

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.759 
the sound like people say that you know
cheap<00:04:16.239> speakers<00:04:16.750> can<00:04:16.930> be<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:17.049> bit<00:04:17.229> too<00:04:17.380> colored

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
cheap speakers can be a bit too colored

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.370 
cheap speakers can be a bit too colored
and<00:04:17.979> you<00:04:18.250> know<00:04:18.549> you're<00:04:18.729> not<00:04:18.850> getting<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.510> clean

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
and you know you're not getting a clean

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.420 
and you know you're not getting a clean
sort<00:04:20.889> of<00:04:20.979> natural<00:04:21.990> neutral<00:04:22.990> sound<00:04:23.289> I<00:04:23.620> actually

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
sort of natural neutral sound I actually

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.080 
sort of natural neutral sound I actually
thought<00:04:24.940> that<00:04:25.300> these<00:04:25.720> were<00:04:25.780> fairly<00:04:26.500> clean

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
thought that these were fairly clean

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.760 
thought that these were fairly clean
there<00:04:28.090> doesn't<00:04:28.330> seem<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.539> be<00:04:28.780> too<00:04:29.020> much<00:04:29.289> going

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
there doesn't seem to be too much going

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.180 
there doesn't seem to be too much going
on<00:04:29.889> it's<00:04:30.160> being<00:04:30.370> boosted<00:04:30.780> unnecessarily<00:04:32.190> yeah

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
on it's being boosted unnecessarily yeah

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.890 
on it's being boosted unnecessarily yeah
I<00:04:33.220> thought<00:04:33.820> they<00:04:33.940> were<00:04:34.030> actually<00:04:34.360> okay<00:04:34.479> and

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
I thought they were actually okay and

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.020 
I thought they were actually okay and
