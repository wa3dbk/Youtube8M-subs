sort<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.489> this<00:02:28.700> kind<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.840> similar<00:02:30.290> piece<00:02:30.620> but

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
sort of this kind of similar piece but

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.850 
sort of this kind of similar piece but
with<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:32.000> set<00:02:32.239> we<00:02:32.390> have<00:02:32.660> this<00:02:33.379> little<00:02:33.590> piece

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
with this set we have this little piece

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.610 
with this set we have this little piece
that<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.370> can<00:02:34.580> only<00:02:34.700> assume<00:02:34.879> is<00:02:35.390> meant<00:02:35.810> to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
that I can only assume is meant to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.910 
that I can only assume is meant to
attach<00:02:37.160> this<00:02:37.640> sword<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.780> back<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.590> some<00:02:39.799> of

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
attach this sword to the back of some of

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.880 
attach this sword to the back of some of
your<00:02:40.040> figures<00:02:40.750> however<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:41.930> can't<00:02:42.470> really

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
your figures however I can't really

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.949 
your figures however I can't really
figure<00:02:43.400> out<00:02:43.640> how<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.239> do<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:46.569> maybe<00:02:47.569> it's<00:02:47.810> just

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
figure out how to do it maybe it's just

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.970 
figure out how to do it maybe it's just
supposed<00:02:48.110> to<00:02:48.319> rest<00:02:48.980> between<00:02:49.819> these<00:02:50.299> sections

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
supposed to rest between these sections

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.180 
supposed to rest between these sections
like<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.540> but<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:54.200> doesn't<00:02:54.410> really<00:02:54.709> attach

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
like this but it doesn't really attach

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.369 
like this but it doesn't really attach
anywhere<00:02:56.920> which<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:57.950> kind<00:02:58.340> of<00:02:58.459> strange<00:02:59.379> and

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
anywhere which is kind of strange and

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.979 
anywhere which is kind of strange and
it's<00:03:01.370> just<00:03:01.549> supposed<00:03:01.879> to<00:03:02.120> balance<00:03:02.420> on<00:03:02.870> the

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
it's just supposed to balance on the

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.699 
it's just supposed to balance on the
back<00:03:03.170> but<00:03:04.299> for<00:03:05.299> whatever<00:03:05.629> reason<00:03:06.140> this<00:03:06.379> piece

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
back but for whatever reason this piece

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.229 
back but for whatever reason this piece
seems<00:03:07.629> useless<00:03:08.860> but<00:03:09.860> regardless<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:10.849> the

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
seems useless but regardless the the

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.600 
seems useless but regardless the the
sword<00:03:11.599> itself<00:03:11.989> is<00:03:12.319> what<00:03:12.829> you<00:03:12.980> get<00:03:13.099> it<00:03:13.220> for<00:03:13.400> so

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
sword itself is what you get it for so

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.400 
sword itself is what you get it for so
it's<00:03:13.760> not<00:03:13.819> too<00:03:14.150> big<00:03:14.360> of<00:03:14.390> a<00:03:14.540> problem<00:03:14.750> now<00:03:15.110> I

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
it's not too big of a problem now I

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.900 
it's not too big of a problem now I
display<00:03:15.860> this<00:03:16.010> with<00:03:16.220> my<00:03:16.660> deluxe<00:03:17.660> class

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
display this with my deluxe class

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.099 
display this with my deluxe class
Megatron<00:03:19.910> from<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.209> 2pac<00:03:20.569> just<00:03:20.780> because<00:03:20.989> I

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
Megatron from the 2pac just because I

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.870 
Megatron from the 2pac just because I
think<00:03:21.590> this<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:21.859> a<00:03:21.889> better<00:03:22.130> figure<00:03:22.400> than<00:03:22.579> the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
think this is a better figure than the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.660 
think this is a better figure than the
Voyager<00:03:23.359> I<00:03:24.109> think<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:24.560> looks<00:03:24.769> better<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.310> don't

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
Voyager I think it looks better I don't

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.059 
Voyager I think it looks better I don't
have<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.239> Voyager<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:27.200> think<00:03:27.560> that<00:03:27.799> this

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
have the Voyager and I think that this

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.069 
have the Voyager and I think that this
sword<00:03:28.519> would<00:03:28.880> scale<00:03:29.420> better<00:03:29.780> with<00:03:29.989> the

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
sword would scale better with the

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.729 
sword would scale better with the
Voyager<00:03:30.310> I<00:03:31.310> just<00:03:32.239> like<00:03:32.359> this<00:03:32.510> toy<00:03:32.720> better<00:03:32.989> so

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
Voyager I just like this toy better so

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.599 
Voyager I just like this toy better so
and<00:03:34.010> it's<00:03:34.910> what<00:03:35.120> I<00:03:35.150> have<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:36.099> but<00:03:37.099> either<00:03:37.280> way

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
and it's what I have to but either way

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.449 
and it's what I have to but either way
just<00:03:38.599> like<00:03:38.900> on<00:03:39.139> the<00:03:39.200> star<00:03:39.560> saber<00:03:39.799> this<00:03:40.160> piece

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
just like on the star saber this piece

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.589 
just like on the star saber this piece
on<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.760> bottom<00:03:40.940> can<00:03:41.389> twist<00:03:41.930> off<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:43.450> then<00:03:44.450> you

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
on the bottom can twist off and then you

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.750 
on the bottom can twist off and then you
can<00:03:44.780> slide<00:03:45.079> it<00:03:45.260> through<00:03:45.290> Megatron's<00:03:45.950> hand

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.089 

again<00:03:49.760> be<00:03:50.269> very<00:03:50.349> careful<00:03:51.349> with<00:03:51.500> these<00:03:51.680> thin

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
again be very careful with these thin

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.620 
again be very careful with these thin
little<00:03:52.340> parts<00:03:52.730> here<00:03:52.910> you<00:03:53.060> don't<00:03:53.239> want<00:03:53.419> to<00:03:53.480> put

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
little parts here you don't want to put

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.500 
little parts here you don't want to put
it<00:03:53.750> too<00:03:54.230> far<00:03:54.260> into<00:03:55.040> his<00:03:55.310> hand<00:03:55.579> you<00:03:56.060> could<00:03:56.269> risk

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
it too far into his hand you could risk

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.050 
it too far into his hand you could risk
breaking<00:03:56.900> those<00:03:57.260> again<00:03:58.099> this<00:03:58.250> seems<00:03:58.730> like<00:03:59.030> a

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
breaking those again this seems like a

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.479 
breaking those again this seems like a
pretty<00:03:59.569> sturdy<00:03:59.900> plastic<00:04:00.260> but<00:04:00.739> I<00:04:00.889> would<00:04:01.280> not

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
pretty sturdy plastic but I would not

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.059 
pretty sturdy plastic but I would not
risk<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:02.060> in<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.510> slightest<00:04:02.989> just<00:04:03.680> because<00:04:03.950> of

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
risk it in the slightest just because of

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.979 
risk it in the slightest just because of
the<00:04:04.130> design<00:04:04.549> of<00:04:04.579> the<00:04:05.030> sword<00:04:05.329> there's<00:04:05.630> a<00:04:05.690> lot<00:04:05.870> of

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
the design of the sword there's a lot of

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.720 
the design of the sword there's a lot of
very<00:04:06.230> thin<00:04:07.069> parts<00:04:08.349> anyway<00:04:09.349> here<00:04:09.739> is<00:04:09.919> the<00:04:10.280> sword

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
very thin parts anyway here is the sword

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.909 
very thin parts anyway here is the sword
and<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.690> looks<00:04:11.870> fantastic

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
and it looks fantastic

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.940 
and it looks fantastic
the<00:04:13.250> purple<00:04:13.639> matches<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:15.079> purple<00:04:15.500> on<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.799> toy

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
the purple matches the purple on the toy

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.360 
the purple matches the purple on the toy
itself<00:04:16.459> pretty<00:04:16.880> well<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:17.359> just<00:04:18.200> looks<00:04:18.919> great

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
itself pretty well and just looks great

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.990 
itself pretty well and just looks great
now<00:04:20.030> unfortunately<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:22.280> one<00:04:22.490> Megatron<00:04:22.969> I

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
now unfortunately the one Megatron I

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.110 
now unfortunately the one Megatron I
have<00:04:23.390> is<00:04:23.750> a<00:04:23.810> bit<00:04:24.349> shorter

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
have is a bit shorter

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.070 
have is a bit shorter
then<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:27.460> Optimus<00:04:27.850> Prime<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.150> like<00:04:28.510> displaying

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.240 
then the Optimus Prime I like displaying
my<00:04:29.350> sky<00:04:29.680> breaker<00:04:30.010> sword<00:04:30.460> with<00:04:30.729> so<00:04:32.010> it's<00:04:33.010> a

my sky breaker sword with so it's a
little<00:04:34.470> size<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.830> accurate<00:04:36.280> but<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.729> swords

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
little size and accurate but the swords

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.270 
little size and accurate but the swords
do<00:04:37.630> just<00:04:37.960> look<00:04:38.080> great<00:04:38.320> on<00:04:38.680> these<00:04:38.919> two<00:04:39.070> guys
