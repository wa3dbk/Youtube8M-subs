stuff like that so and I will be doing

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.130 
stuff like that so and I will be doing
this<00:00:21.840> for<00:00:22.529> more<00:00:22.740> heroic<00:00:23.070> weapons<00:00:23.490> maybe<00:00:24.140> even

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
this for more heroic weapons maybe even

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.620 
this for more heroic weapons maybe even
rigor<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.800> stuff<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.490> but<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.269> first

any other ways to get the engineering
tokens<00:01:07.530> later<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:09.710> jagex<00:01:10.710> have<00:01:11.189> put<00:01:11.549> a

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
tokens later on so jagex have put a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.000 
tokens later on so jagex have put a
limit<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.479> engineering<00:01:13.229> level<00:01:13.500> to

limit to the engineering level to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.770 
limit to the engineering level to
actually<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> item<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.090> don't<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.540> yet

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
actually get the item I don't know yet

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.660 
actually get the item I don't know yet
but<00:01:16.049> anyway<00:01:16.439> these<00:01:16.590> are<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.860> requirements<00:01:17.159> to

but anyway these are the requirements to
actually<00:01:18.600> buy<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.890> now<00:01:19.890> if<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.460> item<00:01:20.820> is

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
actually buy it now if your item is

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.080 
actually buy it now if your item is
fully<00:01:21.570> degraded<00:01:22.110> you'll<00:01:22.590> need<00:01:22.860> 200<00:01:23.850> k

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
fully degraded you'll need 200 k

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.539 
fully degraded you'll need 200 k

dungeoneering total two tokens to
recharge<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> or<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.530> use<00:01:28.560> 20k

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
recharge it or you can use 20k

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.120 
recharge it or you can use 20k
dungeoneering<00:01:30.360> tote<00:01:30.979> tokens<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:33.950> 200<00:01:34.950> k

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130

dungeoneering tote tokens and 200 k
normal<00:01:36.030> cash<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:37.860> use<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.549> mill<00:01:38.820> cash

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
normal cash or you can use to mill cash

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.260 
normal cash or you can use to mill cash
but<00:01:40.950> i<00:01:40.979> do<00:01:41.100> recommend<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.700> second<00:01:42.090> option

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
but i do recommend the second option

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.600 
but i do recommend the second option
because<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.049> won't<00:01:43.229> use<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:43.829> much<00:01:44.009> cash<00:01:44.310> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
because you won't use as much cash and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.359 
because you won't use as much cash and
you<00:01:44.850> won't<00:01:45.060> use<00:01:45.329> as<00:01:45.540> much<00:01:45.720> as<00:01:46.229> many<00:01:46.619> tokens<00:01:47.040> so

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
you won't use as much as many tokens so

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.249 
you won't use as much as many tokens so
that's<00:01:48.060> what<00:01:48.240> i<00:01:48.270> recommend

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.389 

as<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.409> can<00:01:52.500> probably<00:01:52.680> tell<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.189> Kelly

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
as you can probably tell the Kelly

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.399 
as you can probably tell the Kelly
crossbow<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.360> ranged<00:01:54.780> weapon<00:01:55.140> now<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
crossbow is a ranged weapon now the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.590 
crossbow is a ranged weapon now the
closest<00:01:55.979> comparison<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.970> ranged<00:01:57.270> weapon

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
closest comparison do that ranged weapon

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.349 
overload rigger it is amazing but if you
don't<00:03:45.900> have<00:03:46.019> rigor<00:03:46.410> yes<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.220> can<00:03:47.310> also<00:03:47.519> just

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
don't have rigor yes you can also just

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.660 
don't have rigor yes you can also just
use<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:49.079> train<00:03:49.769> your<00:03:49.920> range<00:03:50.190> me<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.549> have

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
use it to train your range me you have

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.190 
use it to train your range me you have
10<00:03:50.880> hours

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
10 hours

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.869 
10 hours
you<00:03:52.680> can<00:03:52.830> just<00:03:52.980> spray<00:03:53.220> your<00:03:53.370> range<00:03:53.550> you'll<00:03:53.730> hit

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
you can just spray your range you'll hit

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.550 
you can just spray your range you'll hit
more<00:03:54.090> often<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:54.599> your<00:03:54.780> experience<00:03:55.170> rate<00:03:55.379> for

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
more often so your experience rate for

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.670 
more often so your experience rate for
our<00:03:55.709> Lashley<00:03:56.370> increase<00:03:56.849> so<00:03:57.690> you<00:03:58.410> don't<00:03:58.590> have

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
our Lashley increase so you don't have

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.710 
our Lashley increase so you don't have
to<00:03:58.830> worry<00:03:59.069> about<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.489> money<00:03:59.640> I<00:04:00.120> mean<00:04:00.510> two

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
to worry about the money I mean two

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.540 
to worry about the money I mean two
million<00:04:01.140> yeah<00:04:01.319> I<00:04:01.349> mean<00:04:01.739> it's<00:04:01.800> a<00:04:02.010> law<00:04:02.190> but<00:04:02.459> you

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
million yeah I mean it's a law but you

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.970 
million yeah I mean it's a law but you
can<00:04:02.700> also<00:04:02.819> do<00:04:03.060> like<00:04:03.300> 200<00:04:03.660> k<00:04:03.810> +<00:04:04.050> 20<00:04:04.379> Kate's<00:04:04.560> opens

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
can also do like 200 k + 20 Kate's opens

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.150 
can also do like 200 k + 20 Kate's opens
to<00:04:05.250> recharge<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:07.680> money<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:08.010> don't

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
to recharge it so the money you don't

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.920 
to recharge it so the money you don't
really<00:04:08.400> have<00:04:08.550> to<00:04:08.640> worry<00:04:08.730> about<00:04:09.060> i<00:04:09.420> think<00:04:09.450> it's

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
really have to worry about i think it's

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.220 
really have to worry about i think it's
a<00:04:10.140> it's<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.650> nice<00:04:10.860> price<00:04:11.250> if<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:11.700> think<00:04:11.970> the

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
a it's a nice price if you think the

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.110 
a it's a nice price if you think the
weapons<00:04:13.230> strength<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:13.830> know<00:04:13.980> if<00:04:14.519> it<00:04:14.670> was<00:04:14.849> just

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
weapons strength you know if it was just

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.670 
weapons strength you know if it was just
a<00:04:15.209> room<00:04:15.420> like<00:04:15.630> a<00:04:15.780> room<00:04:15.959> class<00:04:16.229> where<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.560> can

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
a room like a room class where you can

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.229 
a room like a room class where you can
just<00:04:16.709> use<00:04:17.040> it<00:04:17.190> forever<00:04:17.459> i<00:04:17.609> think<00:04:17.850> one<00:04:18.030> little

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
just use it forever i think one little

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.940 
just use it forever i think one little
bit<00:04:18.329> overpowered<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.139> now<00:04:19.229> i<00:04:19.260> think<00:04:19.350> it's<00:04:19.680> so

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
bit overpowered and now i think it's so

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.030 
bit overpowered and now i think it's so
nice<00:04:20.190> variance<00:04:20.700> between<00:04:20.850> those<00:04:21.540> two<00:04:21.889> now<00:04:22.889> if

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
nice variance between those two now if

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.590 
nice variance between those two now if
you're<00:04:23.160> thinking<00:04:23.280> about<00:04:23.430> dragon<00:04:24.210> crosman

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
you're thinking about dragon crosman

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.330 
you're thinking about dragon crosman
