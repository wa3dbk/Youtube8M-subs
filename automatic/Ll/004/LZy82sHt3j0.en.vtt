 j 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.160
 Hi everyone, then I finally manage to 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.930
 shoot this tutorial finally because 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.059
 let's say it was also a little bit one 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.750
 coincidence in the sense that a short time ago 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.400
 I received an auxiliary request from me 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.290
 I greet and send a great kiss 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.140
 because it always follows me and it really is 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.570
 cute especially on facebook is 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.310
 practically asked me for a trick 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.250
 not very heavy on the tones of the pan 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.970
 brown and a little bit just a little bit 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.560
 of black and totally crazy on the occasion 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.119
 a wedding for the evening was indeed 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.130
 it was the same colors I had 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.810
 used for a trick I did 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.149
 on the mimic Mary of which vi 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.490
 I leave the picture here that many of you me 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.160
 you requested that he put the photo I 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.170
 I had posted on facebook it was me 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.110
 for her I had done it on the occasion of a 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.180
 evening wedding with the same colors 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.580
 so I showed him help 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.860
 that both she and that was fine 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.479
 they managed to do two things in one is 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.700
 I finally managed to do that 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.890
 trick because it was so much anyway 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.100
 lost ahead was really so long 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.720
 you have requested and then nothing I 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.099
 I apologize if during the video 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.709
 continues to change the light but 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.270
 punctually arrived a 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.229
 certain times here it continues to rain 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.810
 it's starting to rain 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.080
 the light changes that is the sun a 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.769
 that becomes July and yet they are only the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.239
 four in the afternoon I did everything 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.989
 to do it because it is a while 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.640
 plan between exams and various so do me 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.629
 know what you think and let me know 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.540
 if you would have done something different 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.910
 me even if it's not really make up 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.930
 heavier than I did I decided to 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:43.489
 use a nude lipstick by the way 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.440
 is of the new line of the kate rim 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.829
 moss of which he made a review 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.000
 on my blog I leave the link 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:53.629
 in the info box then if you are interested 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.349
 go and read it and I'm saying 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:03:02.450
 lost the thread and but obviously if you want 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.750
 you can use a lipstick on maybe 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.319
 pink or even red for whom 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.910
 prefers to do a little more is another 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.910
 what for those with small eyes 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.560
 I repeat maybe avoid the black line 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.139
 in the inner rim of the eye is 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.000
 use a white pencil or a pencil 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.260
 flesh-colored pencil I leave you at 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.099

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:29.000
 let's see what I did now 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.069
 always start by applying my primer 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.959
 on the eyelid also under use 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.620

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.720
 this pole knot of the landslide in 38 and 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.060
 use the second eye shadow of the 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.130
 second row 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.720
 above the fold of the mobile eyelid for 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.610

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.040

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.959
 above 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.330

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.519
 beat 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:20.139
 here is the same shade of pencil I go 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:21.850
 to blend it towards the inside of the 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.270
 third last eyeshadow of the last daughter 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.919
 this brownish is going to go over again 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.100
 above the pencil just placed 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.130
 I'm going to fade it and after that I'll take a 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.919
 light brown and with the number 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.320

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.320
 amount of naro watts and spread it 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.570
 in the outer corner of the eye his 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.770
 further not take a brown 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.770
 even more so 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.449
 resume admits the same pencil me 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.370
 I apply it to the game 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.949
 the hours below murder and I go 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.529
 to fade that same smudge I take 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.659
 a light brown again and I go 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:09.029
 blend the pencil allowed to the 18th 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:11.669
 of the eye that goes from city to teeth 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:15.270
 instead then with a black eye shadow towards the 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:18.449
 end now takes this pink color 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.330
 meat I am going to apply to the of 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.009
 above the pencil and after that opening 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.289

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.569
 white cream that I apply below 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.589
 of the state can be reconciled with mine 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:33.180
 usually exex immersion eyeliner gel 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:34.680
 think I draw my eyeliner line 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.400
 that is going to end 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.740
 slightly larger person fine la 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.319
 portofino to the lacrimal duct both 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.879
 survived is also applied in the 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.229
 internal rhyme of the eye since it is all 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:50.270
 a muzzle plus marriage 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.270
 the trick should hold up as much as possible 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:59.490
 using over tech kiko curve like 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:01.380
 n mascara acquires in abundance and after 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.170
 of which I am going to lengthen further 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:09.230
 the deadly zandel top coat that one 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.230
 green the false concentrated lash of fig 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.900
 with this tender huge fake e 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.060
 I take my beloved land is almost 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.460
 to finish and I beg you to do mine 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.710
 kulturi and then with another brush 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.930
 of France 38 goes well for the 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.920
 palette of the mass from that of blush 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:34.080
 I use a dark brick pink and it 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:37.620
 I apply on the brigade on the other lips 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.480
 those of the constipated primer is not 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.490
 I apply very little and I pat him and 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:45.550
 later they make you face lilies at 35 minutes 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.979
 in such a way as to drag once 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.919
 dried I apply the number 600 million 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:55.440
 the clips of the apocalypse line of the 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:55.440
 liberia on my lips 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.680
 and this is the final result 

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:08.889
