could get get it on without any dust
specks<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:48.460> it<00:01:48.579> because<00:01:49.030> any<00:01:49.270> little<00:01:49.630> dust

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
specks in it because any little dust

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.660 
specks in it because any little dust
speck<00:01:50.079> will<00:01:50.289> show<00:01:50.500> up<00:01:50.740> under<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.189> screen<00:01:51.429> as

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
speck will show up under the screen as

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.350 
speck will show up under the screen as
like<00:01:51.850> little<00:01:52.149> air<00:01:52.329> bubbles<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:53.109> which<00:01:53.920> is

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
like little air bubbles and which is

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.539 
like little air bubbles and which is
kind<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.539> not<00:01:55.840> really<00:01:55.899> ideal<00:01:56.590> but<00:01:57.280> yeah<00:01:57.429> that's

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
kind of not really ideal but yeah that's

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.190 
kind of not really ideal but yeah that's
the<00:01:57.729> way<00:01:57.880> I<00:01:57.909> recommend<00:01:58.600> doing<00:01:58.719> that's<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.079> way

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
the way I recommend doing that's the way

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.080 
the way I recommend doing that's the way
I<00:01:59.229> did<00:01:59.380> it<00:01:59.649> I<00:01:59.829> just<00:02:00.340> rinsed<00:02:00.610> it<00:02:00.700> off<00:02:00.759> in<00:02:00.939> some

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
I did it I just rinsed it off in some

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.529 
I did it I just rinsed it off in some
water<00:02:01.329> nature<00:02:02.259> is<00:02:02.289> really<00:02:02.709> clean<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.189> then<00:02:03.969> I

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
water nature is really clean and then I
