00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
seen though all it does is it will

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.460 
seen though all it does is it will
install<00:01:19.560> an<00:01:19.950> application<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:23.960> will<00:01:24.960> allow

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
install an application that will allow

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.080 
install an application that will allow
you<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.680> install<00:01:25.890> third-party<00:01:26.250> applications

you to install third-party applications

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.910 
you to install third-party applications
and<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.480> not<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:28.050> App<00:01:28.320> Store<00:01:28.350> this

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
and this is not just the App Store this

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.610 
and this is not just the App Store this
is<00:01:29.040> not<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.370> App<00:01:29.490> Store<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:31.080> fair<00:01:31.320> this

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
is not the App Store to be fair this

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.830 
is not the App Store to be fair this
feels<00:01:32.010> I've<00:01:32.370> seen<00:01:32.940> this<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.270> action<00:01:33.420> as<00:01:33.690> well

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
feels I've seen this in action as well

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.120 
feels I've seen this in action as well
and<00:01:34.050> it<00:01:34.110> feels<00:01:34.290> more<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.770> Linux

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
and it feels more like a Linux

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.680 
and it feels more like a Linux
repository<00:01:37.370> which<00:01:38.370> brings<00:01:39.000> me<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.180> my<00:01:39.630> next

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
repository which brings me to my next

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.170 
repository which brings me to my next
question<00:01:40.490> what<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.760> difference<00:01:42.030> between

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
question what is the difference between

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.170 
question what is the difference between
this<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.870> the<00:01:43.770> ipod<00:01:44.159> Linux<00:01:44.520> project<00:01:45.030> that's

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
name and I'm trying to call it by you

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.559 
name and I'm trying to call it by you
know<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.129> name<00:02:14.909> i'm<00:02:15.090> trying<00:02:15.299> to<00:02:15.360> call<00:02:15.480> it

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
know that name i'm trying to call it

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.539 
know that name i'm trying to call it
gnu/linux<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.349> is<00:02:16.530> hard<00:02:16.769> because<00:02:17.010> most<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.430> the

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
gnu/linux it is hard because most of the

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.240 
gnu/linux it is hard because most of the
people<00:02:17.580> refer<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.360> simply<00:02:18.690> as<00:02:18.810> linux<00:02:19.290> so

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
people refer to it simply as linux so

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.369 
people refer to it simply as linux so
calling<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.700> gnu/linux<00:02:21.150> they<00:02:21.599> may<00:02:21.750> think<00:02:21.780> gnu

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
calling it gnu/linux they may think gnu

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.590 
calling it gnu/linux they may think gnu
is<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.500> distribution<00:02:23.220> so

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
is a distribution so

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.620 
is a distribution so

is<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.840> little<00:02:42.050> bit<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.350> contrast<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.520> the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
is a little bit of a contrast to the

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.360 
is a little bit of a contrast to the
iphones<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.770> ipods<00:02:45.770> that<00:02:46.010> are<00:02:46.130> jailbroken

iphones and ipods that are jailbroken

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.150 
iphones and ipods that are jailbroken
and<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.390> reason<00:02:47.660> i<00:02:47.750> say<00:02:47.960> that<00:02:47.990> is<00:02:48.230> because<00:02:48.470> um

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
and the reason i say that is because um

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.180 
and the reason i say that is because um
people<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.420> I<00:02:50.480> saw<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.110> few<00:02:51.320> videos<00:02:51.530> one<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.130> the

I saw to jailbreaking though speaking of

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.930 
I saw to jailbreaking though speaking of
Linux<00:03:32.420> is<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.920> possibility<00:03:34.460> of<00:03:34.670> having

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
Linux is the possibility of having

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.720 
Linux is the possibility of having
drivers<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:35.990> software<00:03:36.370> that<00:03:37.370> would<00:03:37.490> make

drivers and software that would make

box<00:03:42.010> now<00:03:43.420> again<00:03:44.420> this<00:03:44.840> is<00:03:45.020> just<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.320> thought<00:03:45.620> but

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
box now again this is just a thought but

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.860 
box now again this is just a thought but
back<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.450> subject<00:03:47.630> of<00:03:47.900> hand<00:03:49.720> from<00:03:50.720> what<00:03:50.840> I

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
back to the subject of hand from what I

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.430 
back to the subject of hand from what I
could<00:03:50.990> see<00:03:52.090> jailbreaking<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.240> ipod<00:03:53.780> touch<00:03:53.810> is

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
could see jailbreaking the ipod touch is

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.040 
could see jailbreaking the ipod touch is
it<00:03:55.010> sounds<00:03:55.580> very<00:03:55.910> similar<00:03:56.330> to<00:03:56.510> putting<00:03:56.810> linux

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
it sounds very similar to putting linux

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.750 
it sounds very similar to putting linux
on<00:03:57.350> it<00:03:57.380> because<00:03:57.740> it<00:03:57.890> opens<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.280> up<00:03:58.340> for<00:03:58.580> pool

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
on it because it opens it up for pool

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.000 
on it because it opens it up for pool
full<00:03:59.120> customizability<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.140> again<00:04:00.380> it<00:04:00.800> even

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
full customizability and again it even

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.190 
full customizability and again it even
gives<00:04:01.130> you<00:04:01.310> terminal<00:04:01.910> access<00:04:02.030> or<00:04:02.660> excuse<00:04:03.170> me

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
gives you terminal access or excuse me

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.130 
gives you terminal access or excuse me
command<00:04:03.680> line<00:04:03.890> access<00:04:04.390> just<00:04:05.390> like<00:04:05.600> linux<00:04:05.960> does

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
command line access just like linux does

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.570 
command line access just like linux does
you<00:04:06.260> can<00:04:06.380> go<00:04:06.470> down<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.860> core<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:07.130> change

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
you can go down to the core and change

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.520 
you can go down to the core and change
it<00:04:07.820> now<00:04:08.000> i'm<00:04:08.510> not<00:04:08.720> sure<00:04:08.870> if<00:04:08.990> you<00:04:09.050> can<00:04:09.080> get<00:04:09.320> that

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
it now i'm not sure if you can get that

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.620 
it now i'm not sure if you can get that
low<00:04:09.770> with<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.070> ipod<00:04:10.490> but<00:04:12.700> but<00:04:13.700> again<00:04:13.970> my<00:04:14.210> ipod
