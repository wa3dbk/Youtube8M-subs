method one to get started and what you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.319 
method one to get started and what you
do<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.770> always<00:00:53.070> start<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:53.550> oversized

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
do is you always start with oversized

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.049 
do is you always start with oversized
squares<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.170> rectangles<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.610> after<00:00:57.030> you

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
squares and rectangles so that after you

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.700 
squares and rectangles so that after you
have<00:00:57.210> sewn<00:00:57.480> your<00:00:57.660> curve<00:00:58.079> which<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.410> don't

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
have sewn your curve which you don't

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.950 
have sewn your curve which you don't
have<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.160> perfect<00:00:59.579> at<00:00:59.760> then<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.719> trim

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
have to be perfect at then you can trim

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.470 
have to be perfect at then you can trim
it<00:01:00.989> down<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.710> will<00:01:01.859> end<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.250> perfect<00:01:02.699> so

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
it down and it will end up perfect so

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.359 
it down and it will end up perfect so
here's<00:01:03.809> our<00:01:03.960> five<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.500> half<00:01:04.530> inch<00:01:04.890> squares

here's our five and a half inch squares
and<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.479> do<00:01:06.600> these<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.930> stacks<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
and you can do these in stacks and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.490 
and you can do these in stacks and
you'll<00:01:08.040> place<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.369> ruler<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
you'll place the ruler with the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.020 
you'll place the ruler with the
appropriate<00:01:10.979> line<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.460> case<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
appropriate line in this case it's the a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.420 
appropriate line in this case it's the a
line<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.840> edge<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.080> your<00:01:13.140> stack<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.979> then

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
line on the edge of your stack and then

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.179 
line on the edge of your stack and then
you<00:01:14.549> can<00:01:14.729> cut<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:15.030> curve<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:16.259> what<00:01:17.009> that

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
you can cut your curve and what that

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.840 
you can cut your curve and what that
gives<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.640> over<00:01:17.909> here<00:01:18.470> it<00:01:19.470> shows<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.580> if<00:01:20.700> I

gives you over here it shows you so if I

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.440 
gives you over here it shows you so if I
do<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.060> stack<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.600> two<00:01:21.900> pieces<00:01:22.759> then<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.090> am<00:01:24.210> going

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
do a stack of two pieces then I am going

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.620 
do a stack of two pieces then I am going
to<00:01:24.570> get<00:01:24.930> enough<00:01:25.680> pieces<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.369> make<00:01:26.580> two<00:01:27.090> units

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
to get enough pieces to make two units

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that are in opposite colorways then what

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.399 
that are in opposite colorways then what
you<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.040> use<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.479> best<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.110> can

will look like after it's sewn it's not

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.580 
will look like after it's sewn it's not
perfect<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.939> little<00:01:54.180> wonky<00:01:54.409> but<00:01:55.409> what

lie<00:02:00.990> nice<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.469> flat<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.670> will<00:02:02.790> look

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
lie nice and flat and it will look

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.670 
lie nice and flat and it will look
something<00:02:03.210> like<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:04.229> still<00:02:04.890> wonky<00:02:05.840> but<00:02:06.840> good

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
something like this still wonky but good

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.249 
something like this still wonky but good
enough<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.819> will<00:02:08.970> take<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.539> ruler<00:02:09.929> again

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
enough and you will take the ruler again

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.260 
enough and you will take the ruler again
and<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.950> time<00:02:11.220> you'll<00:02:11.400> position<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.970> ruler

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
and this time you'll position the ruler

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.980 
and this time you'll position the ruler
with<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
with the

next to your body and the instruction

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.390 
next to your body and the instruction
sheet<00:02:15.300> will<00:02:15.780> show<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.080> which<00:02:16.410> two<00:02:16.800> dots<00:02:17.100> on

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
sheet will show you which two dots on

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.400 
sheet will show you which two dots on
the<00:02:17.520> ruler<00:02:17.850> you'll<00:02:18.090> use<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.990> square<00:02:19.260> up<00:02:19.380> your

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
the ruler you'll use to square up your

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.040 
the ruler you'll use to square up your
block<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.490> case<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.120> dot<00:02:21.480> one<00:02:21.750> and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
block so in this case it's dot one and

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.860 
block so in this case it's dot one and
dot<00:02:22.320> two<00:02:22.700> they<00:02:23.700> all<00:02:23.970> have<00:02:24.180> light<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.810> dark

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
dot two they all have light and dark

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.750 
dot two they all have light and dark
markings<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:25.770> here<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.220> can<00:02:26.340> see<00:02:26.550> them<00:02:26.700> on

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
markings on here so you can see them on

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.310 
markings on here so you can see them on
all<00:02:26.970> your<00:02:27.210> fabrics<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.930> you're<00:02:28.080> just<00:02:28.230> gonna

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
all your fabrics and you're just gonna

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
all your fabrics and you're just gonna
move<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.370> ruler<00:02:30.060> around<00:02:30.530> until<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:32.100> dots

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
move that ruler around until the dots

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.780 
move that ruler around until the dots
are<00:02:32.640> both<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:34.230> curve<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.400> gives<00:02:35.640> you

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
are both on the curve and that gives you

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.170 
are both on the curve and that gives you
your<00:02:35.940> positioning<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.990> trim<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.380> block<00:02:38.180> so

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
your positioning to trim the block so

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.660 
your positioning to trim the block so
we're<00:02:39.390> just<00:02:39.420> going<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.780> trim<00:02:40.140> two<00:02:40.350> sides<00:02:43.670> you

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
we're just going to trim two sides you

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.440 
we're just going to trim two sides you
turn<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.860> unit<00:02:46.860> around<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.700> ruler<00:02:48.030> stays<00:02:48.270> the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
turn the unit around the ruler stays the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.860 
turn the unit around the ruler stays the
same<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.930> now<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.650> can<00:02:49.950> use<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.310> C<00:02:50.580> lines<00:02:50.880> to

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
same and now you can use the C lines to

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.780 
same and now you can use the C lines to
square<00:02:52.230> up<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.380> block<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.490> get<00:02:53.640> that

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
square up the block and you get that

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.510 
square up the block and you get that
into<00:02:53.970> position<00:02:54.600> if<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.470> look<00:02:55.830> up<00:02:55.980> at<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.160> dots

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
into position if you look up at the dots

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.610 
into position if you look up at the dots
again<00:02:56.700> you'll<00:02:57.150> notice<00:02:57.480> they<00:02:57.720> are<00:02:57.840> back<00:02:58.110> on<00:02:58.380> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
again you'll notice they are back on the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.090 
again you'll notice they are back on the
curve<00:02:59.060> because<00:03:00.060> those<00:03:00.300> dots<00:03:00.630> represent<00:03:01.380> where

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
curve because those dots represent where

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.770 
curve because those dots represent where
the<00:03:02.370> curved<00:03:02.610> seam<00:03:02.910> crosses<00:03:03.570> your

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
the curved seam crosses your

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.440 
the curved seam crosses your
quarter-inch<00:03:04.440> seam<00:03:05.400> line<00:03:05.670> at<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.120> edge<00:03:06.240> of

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
quarter-inch seam line at the edge of

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.560 
quarter-inch seam line at the edge of
your<00:03:06.510> unit<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:07.680> now<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:08.130> have<00:03:08.460> a<00:03:08.490> perfect<00:03:09.120> unit

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
your unit so now you have a perfect unit

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.170 
your unit so now you have a perfect unit
and<00:03:10.080> when<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.590> put<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:10.950> with<00:03:10.980> other<00:03:11.460> units

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
and when you put it with other units

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.970 
and when you put it with other units
you're<00:03:12.420> going<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.870> get<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.020> perfect<00:03:13.440> circle<00:03:13.710> so

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
you're going to get a perfect circle so

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.560 
you're going to get a perfect circle so
I'm<00:03:14.280> going<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.430> switch<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.850> different<00:03:15.000> fabrics

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
I'm going to switch to different fabrics

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.390 
I'm going to switch to different fabrics
now<00:03:15.870> cuz<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.350> don't<00:03:16.410> have<00:03:16.620> enough<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:16.890> those<00:03:19.400> but

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
now cuz I don't have enough of those but

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.460 
now cuz I don't have enough of those but
for<00:03:20.580> instance<00:03:20.700> here's<00:03:21.180> some<00:03:21.390> pretty<00:03:21.720> striped

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
for instance here's some pretty striped

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.460 
for instance here's some pretty striped
fabrics

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.440 

and<00:03:26.980> you<00:03:27.160> can<00:03:27.310> see<00:03:27.550> they<00:03:27.760> are<00:03:27.940> starting<00:03:28.150> to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
and you can see they are starting to

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.560 
and you can see they are starting to
create<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:29.020> perfect<00:03:29.560> circle<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:31.420> nice

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
create a perfect circle and the nice

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.090 
create a perfect circle and the nice
thing<00:03:31.750> about<00:03:31.810> this<00:03:32.080> is<00:03:32.260> you<00:03:32.350> can<00:03:32.500> take<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:32.920> to

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
thing about this is you can take this to

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.340 
thing about this is you can take this to
your<00:03:33.130> design<00:03:33.610> wall<00:03:33.850> and<00:03:34.270> just<00:03:34.660> play<00:03:35.080> with

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
your design wall and just play with

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.710 
your design wall and just play with
different<00:03:35.530> design<00:03:36.040> ideas<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:37.000> just<00:03:37.330> create

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
different design ideas and just create

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.360 
different design ideas and just create
your<00:03:37.750> own<00:03:37.960> blocks<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:44.380> there's<00:03:44.950> a<00:03:45.010> sample

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
your own blocks and there's a sample

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.760 
your own blocks and there's a sample
