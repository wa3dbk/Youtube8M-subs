which is much different than the garage
in<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:55.870> first<00:04:56.139> time<00:04:56.410> that's<00:04:56.949> luck<00:05:05.430> yes<00:05:07.680> don't

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
in the first time that's luck yes don't

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.710 

and<00:05:23.190> be<00:05:23.340> careful<00:05:23.759> here<00:05:23.940> it's<00:05:24.240> cramped<00:05:24.629> when

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
and be careful here it's cramped when

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:32.830 
and be careful here it's cramped when
you<00:05:24.840> actually<00:05:25.139> go<00:05:25.289> into<00:05:25.319> it<00:05:25.740> yeah<00:05:29.539> whoa<00:05:31.789> okay
