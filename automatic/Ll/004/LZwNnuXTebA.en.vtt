00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Well, before him was the question of how her 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.640
 wash the need to wash clothes 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.060
 existed of all nations and in all 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.830
 time 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.290
 but still hundreds of years washing mostly 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.179
 produced in the hands but here is the 18th century 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.559
 issues of creating a device capable 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.619
 facilitate and speed up this process 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.279
 engaged closely and in 1797 was 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.050
 created one of these devices on March 28 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.699
 1979 in the US Nataniel prix 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.439
 Avoid soon patented the first 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.480
 washing machine representing 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.099
 wooden box with a movable frame 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.869
 Today in our market is represented 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.420
 a huge variety of washing machines 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.309
 differing in price and functionality 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.090
 let's understand together how to choose 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.350
 washing machine for home 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.210
 washing machines are divided into 2 types 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.399
 front loading and with vertical 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.809
 weâ€™ll start by downloading from the machines 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.879
 which loading of linen takes place in 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.829
 vertical position that is above and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.390
 the main advantage of such machines is 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.329
 in their size mixer on such a machine 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.829
 is 40 45 centimeters and and very 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.989
 convenient to put in a small apartment and 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.160
 it will save you a place well 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.809
 here use this washing 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.340
 typewriter as an extra shelf 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.799
 it is unlikely to succeed at every wash 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.540
 will have to remove all the jars of the vial with 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.159
 top cover to the same such 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.640
 washing machine is not very convenient 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.640
 embed 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.229
 advantages of washing machines from the front 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.189
 loading is also obvious in the first place their 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.780
 can be embedded 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.399
 and it is very important agree 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.740
 capacity for one cycle such a machine 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.970
 can handle up to 10 kilos ilya 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.979
 maximum for car with vertical 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.899
 loading is 7 kilograms of linen 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.670
 Well, basically, they all 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.710
 calculated at five and a half 6. 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.509
 frontalka wherever she stood 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.310
 can serve as an extra shelf 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.350
 especially in small bathrooms 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.330
 After all, forever these all jars and bubbles 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.100
 there is no place to put them here so neatly 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.630
 make up the top washing machine 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.789
 for example, here is a candy machine 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.860
 aquamatic can be easily built in two 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.750
 such machines are usually rare in stores 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.369
 electronics special difference between 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.769
 frontal washing machines and 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.200
 vertically loaded machines 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.700
 simply there is no break and so on 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.290
 that the question of choosing each is oriented 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.290
 to your own tastes and preferences 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.860
 capacity is another factor to which 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.970
 worth paying attention to the family of two 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.680
 man or bachelor 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.269
 usually washing machine with maximum 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.130
 loading three and a half four 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.690
 kilogram 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.609
 if the cell of society is more crowded 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.019
 3-4 people will suit washing 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:36.019
 machines with maximum load 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.820
 56 kilograms large families fit 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.220
 units with a load from 7 to 10 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.660
 kilogram remember however what speaking of 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.570
 maximum load manufacturer 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.870
 Means machine load 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.549
 cotton products when choosing 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.620
 washing machine note on 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.840
 kinsky arrow and letters that indicate 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.180
 on the quality of washing the spin level and on 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.859
 energy efficiency of your class model 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.870

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.250
 standard test laboratories for 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.470
 all washing machines and methodologies 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.299
 assigned models provided 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.390
 the most efficient and gentle wash 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.310
 class models cd and e erase slightly worse 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.269
 and the letters f and g talk about low 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.190
 washing efficiency 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.769
 however a washing machine with a class 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.720
 washing below the prices you now if you find in 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.370
 the store who with great difficulty to 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.010
 from the wash class b have to look 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.690
 spin class from a to g 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.950
 he indicates residual moisture 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.140
 linen after spinning 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.900
 in cars a class this indicator is equal 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.360
 40 45 percent a in c-class cars 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.580
 about 60 percent of course a little 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.450
 extends drying time but does not affect 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.670
 on the frequency of linen 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.830
 energy efficiency class from a to g 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.330
 talks about the economy of the car than he 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.519
 higher the less typewriter you need 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.220
 electricity to wash clothes 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.170
 which means it will save you the most money 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.480
 economical of course cars a class 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.280
 washing at a water temperature of 60 degrees 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.500
 they consume electricity about 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.879
 one kilowatt per hour is now in 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.580
 sale and washing machine with energy 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:01.269
 class and plus they spend on washing more 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.110
 less electricity 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.290
 modern washing machine like 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.269
 rule 10 20 different wash programs 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.069
 basic parameters for all strange machines 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:14.260
 almost the same they can only 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.260
 differ in algorithms and names 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.479
 leakage protection is complete and 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.639
 partial in low-cost models 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.680
 partial protection is used so 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.080
 called hoses protection in expensive 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.029
 models used in full protection that 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.830
 provides protection not only themselves 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:40.370
 hoses but also the device body 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.389
 for example, here it is equipped with a hose 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.949
 servo which in case 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.740
 automatic leakage 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.449
 block access to the water system tanks 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.099
 modern washing machines makes of 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.349
 resistant to high temperatures 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.330
 composite materials polymers 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.460
 high quality plastic or from 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.629
 stainless steel each washing 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.460
 the machine has its own functional 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.500
 features for example here's a washing 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.120
 samsung machine with function and to babla has 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.770
 completely dissolve the powder to 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.810
 make your laundry as clean as possible and 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.020
 no stains from undissolved powders 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.370
 because she has a foam generator built in 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.259
 same used here 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.509
 ceramic heating elements 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.509
 which prevent the formation of scale 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.800
 year after year washing machine 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.930
 became all committing they learned 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.370
 themselves rinse squeeze possess 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.800
 a huge variety of 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.600
 functions have decreased in size and even 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.370
 themselves turn off in general steel 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.470
 an essential attribute in life 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.419
 modern man besides over 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.430
 engineers work not only engineers 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.130
 but also designers that turns every 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.870
 model in the elements of art for today
