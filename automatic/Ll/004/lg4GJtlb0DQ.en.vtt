00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.580
 for that reason 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.100
 welcome to india 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.100
 welcome to Facebook 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.790
 travel through India without a singer and the second will know that the poisonous 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:25.689
 cobra 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.689
 she does not always love being charmed 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.340
 the imposing virla temple is totally finished with a very fine 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.650
 White marble 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.650
 and raised in honor of virgin 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.830
 passed by hand some symbols may surprise us and it is no coincidence 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.500
 a good example 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.950
 is the symbol of peace undoubtedly stolen by the Nazis who turned the 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.950
 wolf and of course the meaning 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.730
 we are very close to the desert and the camel because of its great qualities is 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.730
 one of the best means of locomotion 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.540
 Leave us for free but go out with a limit weight of alabama mÃ³naco 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.090
 for a few rupees and a lot of patience can be mobilized by the cure in a 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.550
 chariot pulled by a sacred and legendary human work 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.680
 but undoubtedly the best is the classic and therefore welcome 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.730
 in the same house she 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.730
 despite this it entails 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.940
 we are going to cross one of the seven gates of the city wall 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.800
 old and I leave you with the original sound so you understand a little more this 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 place 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.099
 the traffic is chaotic and a good investment is to buy plugs for 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.099
 ears 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:25.769
 the leader of cc oo 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.769
 vacation 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:33.739
 much more nervous than it was coming 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.680
 look at aa 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.680
 so let's continue for a while more 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:41.610
 we take out the stress 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.610
 with a colorful snack 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.569
 mohamad cent 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:02.409
 do not be fooled because here is nothing that seems not peanuts or 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.829
 they are sticks and for the face of mustafa 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.829
 this is a man thing 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:17.409
 some locals peek out because they know that this is worse than the fut 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.599
 born 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.599
 if they limit the fire 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.479
 and hairdressers or street barber shops are everywhere 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.389
 a mirror a scissors and a comb 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.349
 everything you need so you can do a good yordano competition 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.099
 some phases of the recording are by the interference of harmful 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.549
 transformers but absolutely nothing is going to interfere so that this young don 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.599
 Diego de la Vega Hindu finishes fixing his mustache 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.699
 life is very difficult here 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:12.159
 medicine is only for the rich and india is one of the few countries in the world 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.349
 world that has not yet established polio although the vaccine was invented more 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:21.439
 50 years old this is a topic that we are going to meet at another time because now 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:24.439
 we will enter 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.930
 we are in a real palace the central museum is the meeting point for 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.930
 women 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.029
 this version the little camera catches their attention 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.699
 and I was delighted 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.639
 the Asian cobra is sacred but very poisonous, that is why the enchanting 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.639
 they always make you very clear signs so you do not come near 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:22.439
 little by little I approach the cobra and wait 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:24.550
 I hope you do not have benetton 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.810
 Obama said they are so fast that you can not blink 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.289
 now the little college 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.979
 sources of the entity 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:45.300
 I do not know if because of tiredness or because they wanted me to bite the cobra but I 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.370
 they said try luckily cobras are deaf but unfortunately people 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.370
 no and they started bothering with my concert 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.560
 when you blow your head is because you are irritated and about to attack 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.830
 With the desire to get a good shot many times we make mistakes and not 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.779
 we listen to the warnings 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.150
 better get away because the cobra 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.150
 It is very poisonous 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.210
