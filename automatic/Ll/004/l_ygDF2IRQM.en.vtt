00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.139
 for vigo 20 Aug in this video we do not want 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.500
 this luck redivivo to what is the subject expressed facto 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.909
 good the beginning so your sleeve 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:29.929
 This case includes the ones that seven protest 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.499
 it's a kind of musala island quite pretty soft enough comfortable 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.530
 which basically serves to transport an act of faith that he does not 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.820
 this keyboard 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.920
 Well yes we want is that it will not change position change the axis 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.270
 of team dengue because if we have a team 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.380
 in my case I tell them that I have first compared it to the child under 17 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.240
 inches 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.089
 I want I have on the second floor 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.170
 and now lately worrying about him 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.270
 also allows inches that can appreciate her 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.070
 percent 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.780
 I do not 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.909
 eye sometimes 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.730
 you saved it in this case 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.030
 so that the means of transport is the most appropriate and I do not have any 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.740
 problem 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.750
 and also obviously not good for saving it 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.730
 so that it protects us from what that dust 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.200
 videla be scratched was that I may have in a case 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.260
 well let's leave it background talk to continue focusing on it keyboard that 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.090
 yes 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.100
 good alan a bit of what is your last experience of use in my case 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.420
 I find that it's a pretty good keyboard 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.600
 I quite like what it is and in the way of its keys 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.840
 it's quite comfortable when it comes to typing 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.409
 per cent what their separation do the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.180
 it becomes very optimal 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.040
 I like in that same car pretty 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.690
 what I do not like a thousand pesetas declared 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.970
 that basically is the key to go down to go up left to right what is that 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.280
 the arrow 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.580
 the one that is immersed in a single breeding which 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.600
 it makes it be removed it does not make it quite i 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.869
 I do not say it quite uncomfortable 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.990
 poetry and we wanted to be going down we just ran some cinemas 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.279
 millimeters for shelter 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:19.159
 either for left to right 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.650
 and we are going to automatically change the direction of kenneth d ela 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.399
 of the exciting nba in which we are moving 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:30.919
 which makes it a point against to score percent 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.719
 quite and go to take it into account 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.819
 obviously here in our newsletter he does it according to 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.009
 in mini Emmaus sorry a sin 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:42.959
 well or to the act for games 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.320
 If you want to have 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.529
 and they have had the possibility to acquire that is clear to you 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:51.529
 I do not recommend it at all for just tactics 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.229
 annual percent 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:57.360
 as to what your design is a pretty special design 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.569
 as you can see 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.329
 this curve they bring 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.030
 it's going to be quite elegant national sutel are pretty good 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.369
 They are excellent and I did not believe in themselves 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:12.299
 I have agreed to the udyco wanted him or what he wanted to be more prisoners 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.059
 esquivel at the time of obtaining a better one have a better percent 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:21.669
 comfort when deciding if we do not want it to have a basis 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.489
 and for example we want to have it in another legs 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.689
 is to see what they bring that kind of circle triangle en you 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:29.489
 understands 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.879
 is suitable so much what denotes leg just makes it quite comfortable to 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.000
 the time to write 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.090
 on an absorbent 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.090
 on the one on the surface the plan v 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.639
 now a little bit of your 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:43.529
 jadué 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:47.259
 do we can appreciate for a hundred what are the different keys 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.259
 this keyboard works to unite without more 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:55.469
 I had the opportunity to prove it with him whoever has the last gesture 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.829
 gubernativo released by paper 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.939
 and I must say that it runs without any problems 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.680
 I've also tried it that you have boyfriend party points the 8th point 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.360
 that is the axis in the case of the 20-inch aimar 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.349
 also runs without any problem 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.250
 percent also works with windows obviously 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.500
 whether they are equipped by tobacco a 2 7 works without any problem so I had the 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.479
 opportunity to 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.319
 prove it nesat 3 percent 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:26.929
 civil operating system as I said without any functional problem 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:29.870
 what yes and that if we want 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.039
 Diego then occupies with a mac 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.470
 per cent I do not recommend it 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.640
 or that I recommend it peron you have that there are doors that both use it 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.370
 that the command key 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.400
 good on paper today more use pretty late entity 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.900
 and well do a little what windows feel on the art key 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.090
 commands basically serves us for example if we want we are on safari 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.300
 we want to open 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.330
 another tab petraeus commander and it opens immediately 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.480
 Petete claims the project the Black Command which is a point to consider 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.479
 if you want to occupy it with the mac 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.570
 this keyboard works with a cd 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.440
 a cedé but it is a wireless keyboard this judge is imputed by what is 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:19.419
 is the receiver 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.639
 of signal which is connected to the computer 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.080
 by obviously the ubu s 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.819
 and there just process what is the gross towards ours 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.759
 percent and clear 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.970
 this government position is 23% a magnet 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.969
 which adheres to this this part because it agrees I do not go to the strip 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:45.860
 and I hope that it applies to us in the mortal fishing field 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.139
 maybe I will say without any problem 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.059
 it's how you can appreciate it did not fall well 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.479
 but you find percent 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.479
 with the Germans together percent on the keyboard with the weser 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.089
 we found what your compartment to lecture gravestones 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:08.330
 this activity is the corts without alves who included me before 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.410
 in this degree I have not changed them and this numeric keypad will soon 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:14.430
 Moscow two months can not be 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.250
 and I have not had the opportunity or the need to change strategy 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.400
 expert stack 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.330
 let's finish four rubber tubes which basically does not work 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.290
 farah 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.949
 If the keyboard has a vision 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:33.910
 shocking is strong to the surface where we control it a good appreciates already 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:35.619
 1 4 active 

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:40.180
 pushing him to you does not move almost anything thanks to Alberto tomes 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.650
 first of all it is a day mentioned before 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.580
 by last 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.080
 this race 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.330
 just above the uncover key we will appreciate a kind of 

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:54.559
 d min as seen in vigo an image yes 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:58.139
 - printing what is the on / off button 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.210
 we see one 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.800
 small light 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.499
 which at the time of 

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:07.180
 press what is the key 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.089
 with the key it's fine 

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:14.099
 we press it for about 5 seconds and that is that this key at the moment 

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:17.740
 to turn totally green to say that it is clear slope 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.309
 and do the same but keep it at bay for about six seconds to seven seconds 

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:25.020
 every year they cited regret to blink 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.020
 that you want yes that keyboard wobble 

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:34.449
 percent a bit of it my experience of using me some stick pretty much I do not have 

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:35.889
 no good 

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:38.480
 no maybe section of this vote 

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.909
 keevill the only control that has a poquillo the found 

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:47.639
 and if I recommend it, it is an excellent slalom and serra is appreciated 

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:49.539
 quite that they have the option of 

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:51.979
 be used with very few lime 

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:56.770
