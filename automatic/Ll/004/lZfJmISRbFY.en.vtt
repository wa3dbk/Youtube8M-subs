00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.950
 watteau everyone is Christ and 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.470
 today we meet for the woods 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.490
 guilloul thanks to those people in my 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.169
 previous video that shows everything 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.400
 simply said when what he wanted that 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.720
 I change the cup so I tried on 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.259
 said even fed up with comments this 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.240
 what do you think 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.770
 otherwise I will cut them nothing to see I 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.449
 know but here I wanted to have fun 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.340
 a little bit and then be interacting with 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.339
 you so I 'm doing this all this 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.510
 way they were the haircut 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.150
 and today so we talked about 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.250
 of the xbox one and the pch 24 with a 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.900
 first information that is official and 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.040
 a second piece of information so a lot 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.000
 people are talking about it and I think 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.769
 the second information is a lot 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.379
 more interesting so stay well 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.519
 until the end of the story video bah 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.089
 here you save a little 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.040
 money and short not really not those 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.650
 of the first information that is to 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.570
 the mother's April sales 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.920
 either last month of course this 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.739
 there we can not really say lease 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.229
 who sold the most consoles on the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.220
 ps4 the exodus sound because inevitably 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:10.680
 finally sounded that in the middle of May 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.790
 so obviously we can not really 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.990
 say who for the moment has sold the most 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.720
 end who made the most sales in 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.760
 trapeze 4 or the xbox one then for the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.030
 April on the month before eh well 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.600
 it's the xbox one that did the most 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.400
 of sales 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.070
 a gift that, by the way, was thanked 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.770
 also by greenberg who thanks on his 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.860
 twitter saying an admission big fun to a 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.780
 friend for making us wants face sellings 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.800
 console and nightfall at kolding all npd 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.080
 so this is the first small 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.840
 information so basically he thanks 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.560
 just that this is the xbox wen has 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.850
 makes the most sales that that the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.220
 playstation 4 last month 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.799
 that's ok, it's super important because 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.299
 that normally one does more than one's calculations 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.740
 the end when we are going to say that the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.810
 calculations are a very very interesting 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.100
 it's on a year not really on a 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.630
 month past a month because it can 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.400
 to be the xbox one after that fart the ps4 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.659
 for two months or three months and after 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.810
 it can be xbox on for four 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.940
 five months so good voice after that is a 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.920
 little thing to know but would that 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.500
 a lot of good people got started 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.730
 attack sony underneath rouaix the xbox 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.360
 live is better and any fund crap my 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.400
 number of sales 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.310
 good it's a little disappointing to see the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.590
 things like that but you have to know 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.779
 also for example bomba that already the xbox 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.999
 one compare in 2014 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:32.249
 that is to say that the month of April 2014 the 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:34.739
 April 2015 then xbox one has 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:37.829
 really increased their selling rate of 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.739
 65% end of 63 that's exactly% to say 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.510
 65 which is a pretty big numbers 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.980
 still in a year they really 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.430
 tipped their sales 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.280
 they have multiply well 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.739
 so 2 63% so that comes it comes 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.980
 increase in terms of sales good this is 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.239
 not something incredible is also 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.069
 the last little thing it's careful 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.120
 is that in April in terms of 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.540
 hardware 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.680
 if you want xbox finally the xbox one has 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.480
 been much more sold than the 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.430
 playstation 4 mhz in terms of software 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.590
 the opposite is sony that keeps 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.540
 well, that's big software sales 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.469
 hello that does not really happen to 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.639
 to distinguish what is good 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.560
 hardware is simply the 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:19.019
 console is all that will be 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.250
 hardware and software it's going to be everything 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.169
 which is going to be the software so here is 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.549
 forget about it last month it was sony 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.319
 who is at or above 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.239
 software at the level of rescuers but 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.470
 in terms of hardware so in terms of 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.780
 consoles as I wanted to say so to 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.340
 the moment and well it's microsoft who 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.919
 have the top of last month 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.849
 I told myself and that's why 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.469
 I could see a lot of information 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.609
 selanne is time for you from that and 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.049
 that's why I do not have any 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.010
 new generation of consoles this is 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.930
 why then I wanted to speak 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.609
 video to tell you this is take your 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.590
 time for people who are not 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.780
 procured yet a new generation 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.109
 console either the xbox live or the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.269
 playstation 4 2 take your time 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.510
 since without much talk maybe of 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.540
 lower him praying to bring him back to 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.650
 come back to make it come to 311 euros 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.329
 there is nothing confirmed on the 3rd of 2015 that 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.189
 will appear the big games room 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.030
 video and everything that will appear in no 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.250
 so long as that 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.900
 and maybe we can get to 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.359
 maybe a new version of 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.970
 consoles or a new version finally 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.259
 there even the same faith on the ground but a lot 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.570
 cheaper at 300 euros 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.889
 maybe with no toy all but that 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.330
 can be a good deal it's for 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.590
 that I 'm really telling you to be that for this 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.460
 Christmas has it for people 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.780
 maybe I do not know it's their 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.169
 birthday is where she bought herself the 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.930
 console 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.780
 I can understand 2 2 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.070
 to get it right now but 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.370
 why not take a little more 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.289
 time and save 100 euros 100 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.400
 euros we can say the equivalent 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:45.199
 a game and a gamepad almost 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.960
 see it so it can be a good 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.509
 small business that can be done 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.910
 thanks for that after that depends on what 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.259
 you want to do too, but damn it 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.320
 has talked a lot in France is not 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.820
 really a ch'ti it'll be done or not 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.490
 but here after me too 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.050
 I am really waiting for a new piece 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.669
 platform end not a new platform 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.949
 form and a new edition of 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.740
 consoles present an ultra slim or a 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.900
 stuff like that because when these 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.639
 big brands of style consoles 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.099
 sony microsoft will release their console 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.720
 ps4 xbox one they really tend to 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.419
 take them out as quickly as possible 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.490
 to make a maximum of sales and the 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.830
 problem is that often they do not have 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.280
 really time to develop from 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:33.080
 build to produce the console in 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.370
 a state in the merits possible often 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.380
 they will do it the fastest 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.699
 possible what will bring the console 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:43.400
 to have a lot and well we'll say he 'll 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.810
 to be very very unstable and that creates 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.909
 many negative points like 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.590
 overheating problems or other 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:51.409
 any problems as we have seen 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:55.340
 previously with the xbox one or on the 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:57.889
 ps4 from cd player etc etc we think about 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.570
 I tell myself he'll wait a little for 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.280
 maybe see maybe a 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.190
 new edition finally a new 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.800
 option ie a new console 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.509
 a kind of ultra slim slim that 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.520
 might be cheaper than 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:13.759
 so much better 300 euros or so of 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.949
 find the console even if it has 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.840
 maybe problems but to move on to 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:19.490
 400 to 300 euros 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.990
 certainly my opinion with packs of 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.820
 games that will entice even more people 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.930
 to buy a new I finally they 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.400
 make a beautiful generation of 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.280
 consoles here it was just a little 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.320
 video with this little information to 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.940

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.490
 April and also to tell you 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.250
 be careful people ben this is not 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.570
 do not buy the console like that 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.580
 wait a bit anyway 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.229
 after do as you want you see 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.190

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:44.780

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.430
