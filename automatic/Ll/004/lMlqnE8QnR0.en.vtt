what<00:00:05.279> we've<00:00:05.460> been<00:00:05.700> working<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:06.899> here<00:00:07.170> as<00:00:07.319> far

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
what we've been working on here as far

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.220 
what we've been working on here as far
as<00:00:07.830> replacing<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.580> wax<00:00:08.790> for<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.690> track<00:00:09.960> and

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
as replacing the wax for the track and

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.370 
as replacing the wax for the track and
the<00:00:10.290> track<00:00:10.500> inserts<00:00:11.030> I<00:00:12.030> sent<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.660> spec<00:00:12.929> for

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
the track inserts I sent you to spec for

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.180 
the track inserts I sent you to spec for
the<00:00:14.269> RTV<00:00:15.269> silicone<00:00:15.630> gasket<00:00:16.230> maker<00:00:16.619> here<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
the RTV silicone gasket maker here the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.060 
the RTV silicone gasket maker here the
ultra<00:00:17.550> black<00:00:17.760> made<00:00:18.150> by<00:00:18.300> permatex<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.199> that

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
ultra black made by permatex and that

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.710 
ultra black made by permatex and that
sounds<00:00:20.460> like<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.699> guys<00:00:20.820> found<00:00:21.119> some<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:21.660> I

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
sounds like you guys found some so I

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.210 
sounds like you guys found some so I
just<00:00:21.869> kind<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.109> wanted<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.410> show<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.650> what<00:00:23.070> we

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
just kind of wanted to show you what we

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.120 
just kind of wanted to show you what we
found<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.449> easiest<00:00:24.750> way<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> apply<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.380> we

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
found is the easiest way to apply it we

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.890 
found is the easiest way to apply it we
have<00:00:26.250> actually<00:00:26.640> tried<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.180> use<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> paint<00:00:27.810> brush

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
have actually tried to use a paint brush

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.390 
have actually tried to use a paint brush
and<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.320> paint<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.680> right<00:00:28.859> on<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> back<00:00:29.220> of

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
and just paint it right on the back of

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.700 
and just paint it right on the back of
the<00:00:29.460> insert<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.000> also<00:00:30.990> paint<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.410> right<00:00:31.590> on

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the insert and also paint it right on

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.160 
the insert and also paint it right on
the<00:00:31.890> track<00:00:32.340> surface<00:00:33.059> down<00:00:33.450> here<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> frame

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
the track surface down here on the frame

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.020 
the track surface down here on the frame
and<00:00:34.410> either<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> those<00:00:35.370> methods<00:00:35.640> were

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
and either one of those methods were

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.090 
and either one of those methods were
very<00:00:36.809> clean<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.410> ended<00:00:37.590> up<00:00:37.680> with<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> lot<00:00:38.070> of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
very clean and we ended up with a lot of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100 
very clean and we ended up with a lot of
excess<00:00:38.579> material<00:00:39.059> kind<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.750> squirting<00:00:39.989> out

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
excess material kind of squirting out

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.250 
excess material kind of squirting out
all<00:00:40.260> over<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.469> place<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.670> found<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.260> this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
all over the place so we found this this

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.020 
all over the place so we found this this
power<00:00:43.559> bead<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:44.190> which<00:00:44.489> hopefully<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.940> can

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
power bead can which hopefully you can

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.110 
power bead can which hopefully you can
get<00:00:45.180> your<00:00:45.329> hands<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.719> some<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.700> makes<00:00:47.940> it

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
get your hands on some and it makes it

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.860 
get your hands on some and it makes it
really<00:00:48.420> easy<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:49.489> apply<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.550> nice<00:00:50.850> bead<00:00:51.149> down<00:00:51.719> in

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
really easy to apply a nice bead down in

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.869 
really easy to apply a nice bead down in
the<00:00:51.930> track<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.469> basically<00:00:53.039> what<00:00:53.699> we've<00:00:53.850> found

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the track so basically what we've found

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.000 
the track so basically what we've found
so<00:00:54.360> far<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.780> work<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> best<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.590> apply<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
so far to work the best is to apply a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.310 
so far to work the best is to apply a
continuous<00:00:56.850> bead<00:00:57.149> along<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.870> length<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
continuous bead along the length of the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.549 
continuous bead along the length of the
track<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.629> extreme<00:01:00.629> inner<00:01:00.809> portion<00:01:01.260> here

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
track on the extreme inner portion here

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.110 
track on the extreme inner portion here
and<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:01.829> also<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.309> extreme<00:01:02.579> outer<00:01:02.760> edge

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and then also on the extreme outer edge

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.359 
and then also on the extreme outer edge
down<00:01:03.570> there<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:04.049> little<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.530> don't<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:04.979> call<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.309> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
down there a little I don't I call it a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.340 
down there a little I don't I call it a
corner<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.510> know<00:01:06.630> down<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:07.020> where<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
corner but you know down there where the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.600 
corner but you know down there where the
track<00:01:07.920> inserts<00:01:08.369> its<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.939> then<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.869> apply

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
track inserts its and then to apply

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.250 
track inserts its and then to apply
beads<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:12.150> single<00:01:12.510> beads<00:01:12.659> all<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> way<00:01:13.080> down

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
beads just single beads all the way down

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.929 
beads just single beads all the way down
the<00:01:13.439> center<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.430> I'll<00:01:14.520> go<00:01:14.610> ahead<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.909> that

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
the center so I'll go ahead and do that

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.030 
the center so I'll go ahead and do that
so<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.360> guys<00:01:15.509> can<00:01:15.780> give<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.080> guys<00:01:16.619> an<00:01:16.770> idea<00:01:16.860> of

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
so you guys can give you guys an idea of

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:28.520 
so you guys can give you guys an idea of
what<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.310> looks<00:01:17.490> like

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.370 

so<00:01:29.530> I'm<00:01:29.620> just<00:01:29.800> putting<00:01:29.980> this<00:01:30.130> continuous<00:01:30.700> bead

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
so I'm just putting this continuous bead

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.990 
so I'm just putting this continuous bead
on<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.620> whole<00:01:32.740> length<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.250> was<00:01:33.430> actually<00:01:33.610> a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
on the whole length that was actually a

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.480 
on the whole length that was actually a
little<00:01:34.210> bit<00:01:34.540> too<00:01:34.690> big<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.050> bead<00:01:35.370> and<00:01:36.370> we'll

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
little bit too big of a bead and we'll

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.680 
little bit too big of a bead and we'll
see<00:01:36.670> that<00:01:36.790> in<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.970> minute<00:01:37.090> because<00:01:37.270> it's<00:01:37.510> going

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
see that in a minute because it's going

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.220 
see that in a minute because it's going
to<00:01:37.770> probably<00:01:38.770> score<00:01:39.190> it<00:01:39.250> out<00:01:39.370> but<00:01:39.990> that's<00:01:40.990> part

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
to probably score it out but that's part

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.750 
to probably score it out but that's part
of<00:01:41.290> the<00:01:41.380> part<00:01:41.680> of<00:01:41.770> refining<00:01:42.100> this<00:01:42.280> process

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
of the part of refining this process

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
of the part of refining this process
will<00:01:42.910> be<00:01:43.000> figuring<00:01:43.300> out<00:01:43.360> how<00:01:43.450> much<00:01:43.570> material

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
will be figuring out how much material

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.950 
will be figuring out how much material
to<00:01:44.140> use<00:01:44.730> and<00:01:45.730> then<00:01:45.850> I<00:01:46.000> go<00:01:46.150> back<00:01:46.180> here<00:01:46.690> and<00:01:46.780> just

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
to use and then I go back here and just

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.620 
to use and then I go back here and just
put<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.230> little<00:01:47.380> beads<00:01:47.590> down<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.100> center<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
put the little beads down the center and

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
put the little beads down the center and
the<00:01:49.720> reason<00:01:49.960> I'm<00:01:50.050> doing<00:01:50.080> this<00:01:50.290> is<00:01:50.410> because

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.100 
the reason I'm doing this is because
like<00:01:50.890> I<00:01:51.010> mentioned<00:01:51.190> earlier<00:01:51.510> when<00:01:52.510> we<00:01:52.630> pick<00:01:52.930> we

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
like I mentioned earlier when we pick we

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
like I mentioned earlier when we pick we
found<00:01:53.290> that<00:01:53.440> when<00:01:53.530> we<00:01:53.620> painted<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:53.950> whole

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
found that when we painted the whole

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.620 
found that when we painted the whole
surface<00:01:54.369> there<00:01:54.760> was<00:01:54.850> just<00:01:55.030> way<00:01:55.240> too<00:01:55.300> much

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
surface there was just way too much

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.390 
surface there was just way too much
extra<00:01:56.050> material<00:01:56.760> so<00:01:57.760> this<00:01:57.940> this<00:01:58.630> way<00:01:59.369> we<00:02:00.369> don't

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
extra material so this this way we don't

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.260 
extra material so this this way we don't
don't<00:02:01.119> have<00:02:01.270> as<00:02:01.510> much<00:02:01.780> wasted<00:02:02.320> material<00:02:03.270> so

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
don't have as much wasted material so

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.460 
don't have as much wasted material so
now<00:02:04.930> we'll<00:02:05.170> just<00:02:05.200> now<00:02:05.800> that<00:02:05.860> we've<00:02:06.040> done<00:02:06.220> that

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
now we'll just now that we've done that

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.410 
now we'll just now that we've done that
you'll<00:02:08.470> just<00:02:08.649> slide<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.790> track<00:02:10.060> insert

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
you'll just slide the the track insert

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.160 
you'll just slide the the track insert
over<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.020> then<00:02:11.560> wipe<00:02:11.740> off<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.130> excess
