00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
actually pretty pretty intense the first

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.380 
actually pretty pretty intense the first
time<00:03:15.320> you<00:03:15.440> do<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.850> walk<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.120> right<00:03:17.240> between

time you do it walk and right between
those<00:03:17.690> two<00:03:17.930> but<00:03:18.670> they<00:03:19.670> don't<00:03:19.820> seem<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.150> care
