00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.160 
twelve years old so you got to think
that<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.940> know<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.270> ten<00:01:39.720> years<00:01:39.750> in

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
that you know if you ten years in

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.380 
that you know if you ten years in
something<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.620> that<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.940> know<00:01:42.060> you're

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
something like that that you know you're

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.850 
something like that that you know you're
gonna<00:01:42.480> get<00:01:42.660> a<00:01:42.720> better<00:01:42.870> player<00:01:43.200> at<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> end<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
gonna get a better player at the end and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.410 
gonna get a better player at the end and
I<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:43.920> that's<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.730> idea<00:01:45.030> behind<00:01:45.180> what

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
I think that's the idea behind what

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.280 
I think that's the idea behind what
we're<00:01:45.660> all<00:01:45.750> trying<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:46.050> do

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
we're all trying to do

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.960 
we're all trying to do
I<00:01:46.320> think<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.740> like<00:01:47.190> since<00:01:47.460> last<00:01:47.670> year<00:01:47.880> it's

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
I think the like since last year it's

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.400 
I think the like since last year it's
receiving<00:01:48.450> value<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.840> bigger<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.230> there's

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
receiving value in bigger like there's

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.810 
receiving value in bigger like there's
lots<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.650> people<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:50.070> here<00:01:50.220> lots<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.520> games
