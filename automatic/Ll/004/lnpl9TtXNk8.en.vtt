00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.199
 all right 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.010
 It is undeniable that we separate ourselves from what 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.110
 we love it can be very painful but more 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.520
 painful can be resist us 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.430
 to let go when the time comes 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.529
 inevitable to do it today in conversing 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.529
 with greater war the art of letting go 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.900
 and 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.339
 how are you welcome to chatting with 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.190
 mario war today we are going to 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.350
 talk about the art of letting go this 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.269
 know how to release in time to let go 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.280
 when it is inevitable and enter 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.989
 resist what is anyway 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.089
 will present our lives that is the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.299
 change that is the separation that 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.710
 finally it is the transition of a state 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.659
 present where someone or something has been 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.670
 in our lives to a future state 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.710
 where that will no longer be where a 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.200
 situation has changed the letting go no 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.160
 only implies as we know the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.530
 loss a loved one 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.050
 by death but also the separation of 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.179
 a relationship leaving a job being 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.759
 fired from work the change of a 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.460
 maybe single status to a state 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.729
 of married or maybe a change of house of 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.229
 city ​​residence sometimes because the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.630
 separation from the family when we left 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.640
 from the parental house and we're going to live 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.560
 our own life then with us 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.539
 themselves or with a couple suddenly 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.610
 also be able to face these 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.700
 changes that are inevitable with step 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.070
 of time 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.100
 we are crossing the great decades the 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.289
 30 at 40 to 50 and we have to leave 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.909
 go certain expectations that there are dreams 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.189
 that were not fulfilled and also 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.049
 learn to let go of those times that 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.030
 Well, they will not come back and as we say 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.860
 that all past time was better because no 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.840
 it is necessarily so we can 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.579
 build future times with 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.229
 our actions we can build the 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.060
 future times with decisions that 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.290
 we are taking but let's see what we 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.640
 has to say the people out there in 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.500
 the poll let's listen to these 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.860
 questions and answers and we return the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.860
 moment 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:26.379
 is when you live depending on a 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:31.209
 person of a thing there is a need 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:34.750
 of having a person close you're a lot 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.670
 time about something when you depend on 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.670
 something or someone 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.460
 and I think with support from some 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.890
 therapist or quiet with wisdom 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.500
 It is very hard but very bravely with 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.950
 very good attitude and positive because no 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.950
 has a remedy 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.159
 because they become dependent on 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.260
 them out of fear fear of change by 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:06.099
 fear it's hard for you to see your life without 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.099
 that other person 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.540
 and for you that is the attachment as you face 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.420
 when the inevitable appear 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.120
 separations in life you resist you 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.650
 you resist for a time 3 totally or 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.150
 from the beginning begins to cooperate 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.430
 with life for this to progress 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.500
 and go flowing is not always easy 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.629
 It is always easy to assume this 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.389
 let go of this let go so we talk about 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.340
 an art of letting go art means doing 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:38.159
 but do with creativity do 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.389
 consciously do with a purpose and 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.919
 we would have to learn to 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.989
 letting go learn to let go with a 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.389
 purpose the purpose of being better 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.680
 because resisting the change resisting 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.449
 drop what is no longer in 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.189
 our lives although it is inevitable the 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.780
 separation simply will not cause 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.870
 pain will cause us anguish 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.549
 uncertainty in this in this being in 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.739
 this anxiety in this anguish for not 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.599
 lose what maybe is already lost 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.609
 Speaking of this should be given by 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.629
 lost what was lost sometimes you would have to 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.699
 understand that human beings 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.519
 We work between two forces of 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:10.560
 opposition one which is the strength of the attachment 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.180
 the force that makes us that of being 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.159
 close and united that which we love 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.950
 what we value what 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.200
 we have great appreciation and on the other side 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.820
 strength of the fear of separation 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.130
 fear the anguish that causes us 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.690
 get away from those objects of attachment these 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.880
 beloved objects that we believe give us 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.080
 security 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.940
 inevitably unmistakably 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.160
 they give pleasure but that can also be 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.140
 we should know that they are passengers that 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.420
 are therefore simply transient in 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.920
 our life in one way or another there is 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.660
 things that remain long in 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.970
 our life there are things that remain 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.130
 only for a short time relationships 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.870
 people situations and we have to 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.820
 understand that in the end at the end we will have 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.040
 to separate ourselves from them and this fight 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.050
 between those two forces the attachment and the 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.670
 fear and separation anxiety that 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.830
 we are moving in a state of tension 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.930
 continuous between what to do to be able to 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.360
 keep the things we love close 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.490
 of us and what may be so that 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.320
 inevitably, the 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.390
 loss what will happen in a moment or 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.240
 in another it will be necessary to define the 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.680
 attachment in this art of letting go then not 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.020
 necessarily as love we 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.000
 we think sometimes that we love a lot when 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.860
 we want something or someone to be close 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.810
 of us but talk about what to think 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.120
 it will really be love that we are 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.920
 feeling or it will be a great fear or a 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.260
 great need to be 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.450
 of being loved by someone a need 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.310
 to be recognized or maybe it's the fear of 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.930
 remain alone in life to no longer 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.940
 be with that person that we love so much 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.000
 and how much we care and care 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.860
 of course he can not go on 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.690
 that the one that really moves us 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.030
 to keep us linked as I said 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.460
 it's not always love because love 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.470
 I could say at a certain moment if 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.110
 you have to go and that is inevitable or 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.420
 that you have already left because I do not like that 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.670
 you go, it hurts a lot, you share but 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.860
 I also grant you by some form 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.960
 say so my permission to leave to go to 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.940
 what follows and I also want for me 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.430
 this release of being able to continue with 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.080
 my way without saying without wanting to say that 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.120
 we will not miss of course 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.760
 we're going to miss but can drop 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.220
 being able to release to open the hands of that 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.230
 grip of that exasperating force 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.630
 that hurts us from trying to 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.490
 grab what is simply gone 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.230
 from our hands what is no longer 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.330
 because it can be a relationship one 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.190
 separating a situation that is no longer 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.110
 present and that we are resisting 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.990
 letting go of that is what sometimes causes 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.430
 much more pain then assume what is 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.870
 our level of fear 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.060
 assume what our level of 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.520
 need can reveal something to us that 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.560
 maybe we did not want to see how 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.330
 Once we have not loved as much as we believe 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.670
 and what we had in great fear of 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.620
 separate because maybe maybe in the 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.300
 passed since childhood we were not taught to 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.970
 handle the separations we could not 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.620
 learn efficiently to detach 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.450
 of what I inevitably put 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.790
 had to happen then let's take in 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.560
 count this to that question I love 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.060
 too much or really I have a big 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.460
 compulsive attachment and a great fear of 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.200
 separate well let's go to a cut in a 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.550
 more time we come back here talking 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.620
 with mario war remember that we are 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.620
 talking about the art of letting go we go back
