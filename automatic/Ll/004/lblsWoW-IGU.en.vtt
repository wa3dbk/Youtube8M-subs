 eat a hornazo I do not know if whole but 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.499
 whole but we have to 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.690
 discover how the true one is made 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:48.030
 hornazo de salamanca there are two sites here 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.710
 covered by the guarantee or trademark of 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.019
 hornazo guarantee of salamanca and 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.389
 we are going to bet move to 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.829
 this mecca to this divine plan for 

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:57.510
 that víctor as always tell us how 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.749
 the real hornazo of 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.749
 salamanca 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.830
 and what better place to tell us 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.350
 how it is done and where a good 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.990
 oven to come to the bakery 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.310
 delicatessen in this case on the street 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.260
 azafranal because here they have the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.290
 workmen here ride this hornazo that 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.640
 It has its peculiarities and has its 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.500
 differences because it is covered in a 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.150
 guarantee mark that is not being 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.500
 offering that guarantee mark 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.780
 us as any brand of 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.800
 guarantee because we follow the controls 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.770
 year 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.869
 and we perfectly the weight of the loin that 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.610
 wear loin tape 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.600
 emphasize that is loin belt is 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.310
 important the quality of 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.259
 ingredients we are pulling quality 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.700
 the amounts are controlled but 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.350
 that when we start with a good quality 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.700
 so no one will tell you so I'll take 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.800
 in a kilo arm are always going to have 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.869
 the same loin the same chorizo the same 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.280
 proportion of ham the same amount of 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.930
 bone mass none will have more mass 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.460
 newton less so no one will fight 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.899
 then it usually happens a lot not capita 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.430
 play the chorizo ​​no no here is everything 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.110
 prepared and is calculated so that 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.660
 all the way to the corner are these 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.000
 corners also like every oven with with 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.770
 its quality ingredients and for 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.810
 course with an effect a date of 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.340
 consumption a preferred consumption 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.330
 the trellis is also important that 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.220
 We are talking about the quality of 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.540
 ingredients but not all in Salamanca 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.310
 we found the trellis also not 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.170
 it is another one of the particularities is 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.760
 a particularity of brand graphics 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.340
 of clear guarantee the hornazo so that it 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.780
 can call hornazo de salamanca 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.330
 denomination the note of salamanca has 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.280
 that having the we are going to fulfill these 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.840
 characteristics and we always notice that 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.819
 do not put the goal on the label we put it 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.040
 once the hornazo comes out of the oven 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.840
 as he just came out we put him the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.730
 label in the corner that you see 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.459
 clearly preferential and ornate consumption 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.420
 identified 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.040
 evidently that each one has each 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.780
 one has his shtick and there is no way 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.220
 this is a this is a follow-up that if 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.510
 we throw from here is now we know that that 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.220
 arm the session or this is 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.989
 practically as in the signature of the 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.110
 artist's signature loin ribbon 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.840
 then it comes with a lot everything is used 3 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.120
 some ties with guarantee mark that you 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.220
 I clearly assure what you are going 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.650
 to eat a kilo of hornazo how much he said 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.239
 common and evidently that is also is 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.440
 very important regularity in a 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.660
 product or because we can 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.920
 go to the art to the artisan who is 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.299
 will call weighing around the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.319
 corner and one day will touch us in a 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.760
 automatic way 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.170
 but I first saw the 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.629
 get here to the tahona delicatessen 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.010
 while I was riding, that was 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.480
 that you were thinking the ingredients 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.879
 so he had that caravaca 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.260
 important part and also good 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.389
 distributed and it is also to this aspect 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.950
 well this this tap this leads to 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.409
 bring a little egg over 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.900
 also and before putting in the oven 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.879
 has a little bit of yeast in the dough 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.430
 we let him have 20 minutes and we give him 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.650
 two egg baths at the beginning we leave 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.389
 another 20 minutes and we give it a second 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.400
 egg bath when there are 8 for more 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.590
 so then it also gives you enough 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.419
 shine the dough takes a lot of butter 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.489
 also on Sunday you open also we are going to 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.959
 morning open we open to elaborate 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.780
 hornazo everything as it is a fresh product 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.219
 neither can we not generate what 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.560
 We were updating the fornazos 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:09.469
 that what is that is that is difficult 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.159
 today that's because tomorrow has passed 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:14.540
 On Monday I work 24 hours a day plus 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.980
 we have spent the holy week this 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.139
 this tires that you end up doing 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.729
 torrijas pestiños a lot of things not 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.859
 rest and we started a season 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.389
 from the furnace of the reasons of always I 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.940
 I like it all year long I have to control a 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.230
 a little bit of arm is that my medium 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.420
 kilo of this medium 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.130
 you're going to eat two people well and 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.570
 that anyway we're going to 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.670
 clarify what healthy you have because to take you 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.960
 the typical one like me who lives who lives alone 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.340
 anguish or there has no reason 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.230
 take that I'm going to take it too 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.640
 well because it's all this hold me 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.500
 I'm going to put my hand but you have several 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.840

 perfectly without problems we can 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.660
 send all hornazos to Spain 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.700
 where they ask us to be in a problem or 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:04.590
 be those who emigrated here from Salamanca 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:06.300

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.490
 and what all those immigrants said and 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.530
 I know many people who were here 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.120
 studying with me and then they leave 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.620

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.360
 the hornazo miss the ornate 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.860
 guarantee mark and now as what 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.810
 I got a lot just said the bear 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.370
 I quietly have four colleagues to 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.370
 that comes to an ornament with the use of 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.570
 andrey water and raw material 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.249
 that he carries and everything is worth it 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.109
 packaging this the truth 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:33.299
 the development and work of all 

00:05:31.109 --> 00:05:34.709
 that we are here doing what 

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:37.559
 possible that the decoration can be done

00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:45.509
 or with guarantee mark so eye 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:47.279
 also with what we find ourselves 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.139
 there in the shop windows because they appear 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.039
 many brands that I do not know in the 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.599
 last moment 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.749
 they have climbed on the car not at once and 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:56.279
 bang and look at the label that is 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:58.259
