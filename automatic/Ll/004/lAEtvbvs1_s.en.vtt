combo damn ripped our whims I got the
win<00:02:38.250> i<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:38.760> better<00:02:39.060> than<00:02:39.390> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
win i think this is better than the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.289 
win i think this is better than the
invisibility<00:02:40.379> mode<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:41.040> do<00:02:41.099> I<00:02:41.549> think<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.209> the

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
invisibility mode I do I think of the

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.610 
invisibility mode I do I think of the
nimble<00:02:42.629> at<00:02:42.780> least<00:02:42.930> fucks<00:02:43.200> them<00:02:43.379> up<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.590> little

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
nimble at least fucks them up a little

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.229 
nimble at least fucks them up a little
bit<00:02:43.920> temporarily<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.700> they<00:02:44.790> really<00:02:45.030> can't

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
bit temporarily and they really can't

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.630 
bit temporarily and they really can't
play<00:02:45.510> normally<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:46.799> think<00:02:46.890> nimble<00:02:47.310> mode<00:02:47.489> is

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
play normally so I think nimble mode is

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.979 
play normally so I think nimble mode is
better<00:02:47.819> than<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.030> visibility<00:02:48.360> mode<00:02:48.660> I'm<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.840> try

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
better than a visibility mode I'm I try

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.849 
better than a visibility mode I'm I try
to<00:02:49.019> use<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.349> one<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.709> future<00:02:49.849> okay
