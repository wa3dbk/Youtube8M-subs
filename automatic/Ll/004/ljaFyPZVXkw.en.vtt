00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.969
 so hello here is dr so i wanted you 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.160
 today my new daytime running lights 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.740
 I show for my mini cooper 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.369
 I bought that and I have that 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.480
 problem of an old love spotlight 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.580
 lamps are under water there 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.920
 bleeding no longer works 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.590
 and since I have to tÃ¼v I need anyway 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.660
 new lamps and then I have to stop 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.290
 the chic design has bought that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.780
 let's see what it looks like that is 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.300
 then to see all that is for 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.510
 daytime running lights we have such a led circle 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.800
 then if the lamps are on so so 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.530
 Headlight upper semicircle 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.360
 and fog is just that the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.610
 entire lamp then still lights up with the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.940
 Semicircle because the fog lights 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.090
 only go if the main driving light 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.830
 is on so now we pack the whole time 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.830
 so that there is always something in it 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:18.590
 that means the individual lamps 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.030
 nicely packed you can the 121 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:35.260
 exchange against the existing ones 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:38.410
 fog lights, we have a 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:44.560
 Fixing set with big cable ties 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:52.420
 etc so and here and the whole we have 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:54.310
 here is this controller as well 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.979
 we use this controller with the engine room 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.360
 Cable ties fixed for whole cable 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.160
 rat tail to it and you see that is 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.570
 Everything compatible that means coming here 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.920
 the two old plugs of the 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.729
 fog lamp lamp ran 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.280
 that goes to the led headlight at the 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.510
 one page as well and then we 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.330
 today still two mass cables and a plus 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.300
 cable for the duration plus of the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:28.390
 daytime running light so a complete 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:30.340
 Set here to install the rather install 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.170
 leave because the front apron 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.060
 actually has to give up the lamps 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.810
 install and then I show you 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.810
 how the whole thing looks like 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.560
 so here is the controller that is 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:50.740
 grown here and the corresponding 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:53.580
 cable run here to the left to 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.580
 right fog lamp down here 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.850
 and the others are here 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.630
 down accordingly 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.300
 and here there is a plus cable in 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.540
 and here then further in the 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.540
 inner space
