00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
may want to ahead grain is because you

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.630 
may want to ahead grain is because you
may<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.780> some<00:00:48.960> pre-existing<00:00:49.230> images<00:00:50.070> that

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
developing panel in lightroom three and

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.149 
developing panel in lightroom three and
to<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.229> I'm<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.710> ahead<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
to do this I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.539 
to do this I'm going to go ahead and
really<00:01:20.790> crank<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.780> little<00:01:21.990> bit<00:01:22.549> so

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
really crank this up a little bit so

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.390 
really crank this up a little bit so
that<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:23.909> almost<00:01:24.119> looking<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:24.659> overkill

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
that it's almost looking like overkill

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.429 
that it's almost looking like overkill
and<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:27.210> really<00:01:27.420> see<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.689> before<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.110> after

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
and you really see the before and after

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.649 
and you really see the before and after
i'm<00:01:28.619> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.130> split<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.090> two<00:01:30.240> before<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
i'm going to split this two before and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.510 
i'm going to split this two before and
after<00:01:30.960> i<00:01:30.990> use<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> why<00:01:31.560> shortcut<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.159> my

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
after i use the why shortcut on my

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.270 
after i use the why shortcut on my
keyboard<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.180> i'm<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> zoom<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.170> here

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
keyboard and i'm going to zoom in here

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.469 
keyboard and i'm going to zoom in here
so<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.579> see<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.939> amount<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.270> grain

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
so you can see the amount of grain

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.060 
so you can see the amount of grain
that's<00:01:36.689> added<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.829> looks

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
that's added and it just looks

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.370 
that's added and it just looks
ridiculous<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.110> course<00:01:40.229> i'm

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
ridiculous right now so of course i'm

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.130 
ridiculous right now so of course i'm
going<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.619> dial<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.979> back<00:01:41.040> down<00:01:41.750> i'll<00:01:42.750> put<00:01:43.049> it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
going to dial that back down i'll put it

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.929 
going to dial that back down i'll put it
at<00:01:43.229> about<00:01:43.320> 25<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.380> see<00:01:46.759> something<00:01:47.759> of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
at about 25 so you can see something of

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.020 
at about 25 so you can see something of
that<00:01:47.970> film<00:01:48.899> grain<00:01:49.439> look<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.159> feel<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
that film grain look and feel to the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.969 
that film grain look and feel to the
image<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.110> also<00:01:52.259> adjust<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.619> size

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
image and you can also adjust the size

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.859 
image and you can also adjust the size
of<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.250> grain<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.420> make<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> grain

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
of the grain so you can make the grain

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.840 
of the grain so you can make the grain
superb<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.380> again<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.710> course<00:01:55.890> I'm<00:01:56.130> Way<00:01:56.520> over

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
superb it again of course I'm Way over

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.719 
superb it again of course I'm Way over
exaggerating<00:01:57.810> here<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.520> also

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
exaggerating here and you can also

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.520 
exaggerating here and you can also
adjust<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.270> roughness<00:02:00.689> as<00:02:00.869> well<00:02:01.049> which<00:02:01.409> i

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
adjust the roughness as well which i

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.069 
adjust the roughness as well which i
will<00:02:01.590> also<00:02:01.829> way<00:02:02.189> over<00:02:02.610> exaggerate<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.930> can

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
will also way over exaggerate so you can

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.840 
will also way over exaggerate so you can
see<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.380> type<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.590> effect<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.219> happens<00:02:05.670> and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
see the type of effect that happens and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.920 
see the type of effect that happens and
we'll<00:02:05.909> go<00:02:06.060> ahead<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.240> increase<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.750> grain

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
we'll go ahead and increase the grain

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.639 
we'll go ahead and increase the grain
back<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:08.970> see<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.470> much

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
back in so you can see you have so much

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.850 
back in so you can see you have so much
granular

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
granular

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.980

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
pun intended so much granular control

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.680 
pun intended so much granular control
over<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.530> quality<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.010> grain<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:15.850> noise<00:02:16.330> in

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
over the quality of grain and noise in

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.170 
over the quality of grain and noise in

particular look and feel or to match a
pre-existing<00:02:23.950> film<00:02:24.430> set<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.150> that's<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.600> way

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
pre-existing film set so that's the way

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.960 
pre-existing film set so that's the way
you<00:02:25.780> can<00:02:26.140> make<00:02:26.290> adjustments<00:02:26.580> with<00:02:27.580> grain

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
you can make adjustments with grain

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.720 
you can make adjustments with grain
inside<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.840> lightroom<00:02:29.290> 3<00:02:29.620> there's<00:02:30.280> also<00:02:30.460> one

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
inside of lightroom 3 there's also one

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.900 
inside of lightroom 3 there's also one
final<00:02:31.150> point<00:02:31.300> notice<00:02:31.720> how<00:02:31.870> i<00:02:31.900> just<00:02:32.700> use<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
final point notice how i just use the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.820 
final point notice how i just use the
slide<00:02:34.270> control<00:02:34.630> feature<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.260> took<00:02:35.710> the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
slide control feature and took the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.010 
slide control feature and took the
amount<00:02:36.040> down<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.280> zero<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.390> now<00:02:37.510> these<00:02:37.720> two

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
amount down to zero so now these two

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.440 
amount down to zero so now these two
bottom<00:02:38.350> settings<00:02:38.740> don't<00:02:39.070> apply<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:40.120> have<00:02:40.330> to

have some amount of grain in there in
