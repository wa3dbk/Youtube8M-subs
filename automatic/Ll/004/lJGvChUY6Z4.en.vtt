00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.480 
so right now you over to the attack tab
and<00:03:31.580> as<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:33.360> can<00:03:33.510> see<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.870> there<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.490> five

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
and as you can see you there is five

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.330 
and as you can see you there is five
dollars<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:36.300> can<00:03:36.330> get<00:03:36.630> an<00:03:36.870> hour<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.860> booting

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
dollars you can get an hour of booting

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.260 
dollars you can get an hour of booting
so<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:39.030> know<00:03:39.180> he'll<00:03:40.020> be<00:03:40.580> 3600<00:03:41.580> you<00:03:41.880> can<00:03:42.120> also

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
so you know he'll be 3600 you can also

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.560 
so you know he'll be 3600 you can also
ideal<00:03:42.810> for<00:03:42.930> about<00:03:43.350> an<00:03:43.470> hour<00:03:43.590> for<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.520> always<00:03:44.910> to

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
ideal for about an hour for is always to

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:57.860 
ideal for about an hour for is always to
be<00:03:45.860> 074<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:57.030> then<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.300> have<00:03:57.420> your<00:03:57.450> friend<00:03:57.690> can

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
be 074 and then you have your friend can

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:06.130 
be 074 and then you have your friend can
enable<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.500> then<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:04.500> this<00:04:05.310> is<00:04:05.490> sort<00:04:05.670> of<00:04:05.820> the

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
enable and then and this is sort of the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:15.760 
enable and then and this is sort of the
newbie<00:04:07.140> way<00:04:07.640> um<00:04:12.530> that<00:04:13.530> just<00:04:13.710> happen<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.160> a

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
newbie way um that just happen to a

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.610 
newbie way um that just happen to a
freefall<00:04:16.770> game<00:04:17.810> that's<00:04:18.810> what<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.050> get<00:04:19.110> it<00:04:19.320> to

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
freefall game that's what I get it to

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:30.140 
freefall game that's what I get it to
start<00:04:19.830> the<00:04:19.920> stick<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:27.530> don't<00:04:28.530> want<00:04:28.880> my<00:04:29.880> peas

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
start the stick I don't want my peas

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:37.550 
start the stick I don't want my peas
from<00:04:30.390> it<00:04:33.980> yeah<00:04:34.980> I<00:04:35.010> don't<00:04:36.110> happens<00:04:37.110> to<00:04:37.290> me<00:04:37.380> often

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
from it yeah I don't happens to me often

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.290 
from it yeah I don't happens to me often
with<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:37.950> program<00:04:38.190> because<00:04:38.670> I<00:04:38.700> don't<00:04:39.000> let<00:04:39.270> it

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
with the program because I don't let it

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.440 
with the program because I don't let it
um<00:04:39.600> I<00:04:40.100> keep<00:04:41.100> firewall<00:04:41.550> up<00:04:41.700> so<00:04:41.970> they<00:04:42.090> don't<00:04:42.270> get

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
um I keep firewall up so they don't get

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.510 
um I keep firewall up so they don't get
a<00:04:42.510> bot<00:04:42.750> on<00:04:42.930> my<00:04:43.110> computer<00:04:43.560> so<00:04:44.010> I<00:04:44.100> can<00:04:44.130> do<00:04:44.400> it

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
a bot on my computer so I can do it

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.150 
a bot on my computer so I can do it
above<00:04:45.980> so<00:04:46.980> um<00:04:47.780> yeah<00:04:48.780> stop<00:04:49.200> losing<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.830> there's

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
above so um yeah stop losing it there's

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.420 
above so um yeah stop losing it there's
about<00:04:50.460> one<00:04:50.850> two<00:04:51.330> three<00:04:51.780> four<00:04:52.230> six<00:04:53.100> seven

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
about one two three four six seven

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.820 
about one two three four six seven
people<00:04:55.790> yeah<00:04:56.790> alright<00:04:57.380> and<00:04:58.380> then<00:04:58.560> use<00:04:58.800> a

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
people yeah alright and then use a

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.030 
people yeah alright and then use a
Microsoft<00:04:59.580> server<00:05:00.290> so<00:05:01.290> don't<00:05:01.470> have<00:05:01.590> the<00:05:01.710> 68

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
Microsoft server so don't have the 68

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.540 
Microsoft server so don't have the 68
and<00:05:02.640> don't<00:05:02.880> hit<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.150> 65<00:05:04.040> sometimes<00:05:05.040> you<00:05:05.430> can

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
and don't hit the 65 sometimes you can

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.190 
and don't hit the 65 sometimes you can
hit<00:05:05.670> a<00:05:05.700> 68<00:05:06.270> but<00:05:07.280> kind<00:05:08.280> of<00:05:08.340> all<00:05:08.460> depends<00:05:08.910> and<00:05:09.200> the

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
hit a 68 but kind of all depends and the

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.630 
hit a 68 but kind of all depends and the
host<00:05:10.290> of<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.590> game<00:05:10.740> is<00:05:11.010> going<00:05:11.190> to<00:05:11.340> be<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.520> one

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
host of the game is going to be the one

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.190 
host of the game is going to be the one
with<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:11.880> most<00:05:12.060> packets<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.720> in<00:05:13.050> most

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
with the most packets and in most

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.510 
with the most packets and in most
packets<00:05:13.680> out<00:05:14.000> so<00:05:15.140> I'm<00:05:16.140> also<00:05:16.350> another<00:05:16.710> easy<00:05:17.340> way

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
packets out so I'm also another easy way

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.250 
packets out so I'm also another easy way
to<00:05:17.580> see<00:05:17.850> if<00:05:18.000> somebody<00:05:18.480> turns<00:05:18.810> off<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.080> router

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
to see if somebody turns off the router

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.130 
to see if somebody turns off the router

you're<00:05:36.780> most<00:05:37.320> likely<00:05:37.560> going<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:37.950> be<00:05:38.040> hitting

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
you're most likely going to be hitting

the<00:05:40.000> host<00:05:40.180> off<00:05:40.480> so<00:05:41.370> let's<00:05:42.370> check<00:05:42.580> out<00:05:42.760> though

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
the host off so let's check out though

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:56.120 
the host off so let's check out though
that<00:05:42.910> is<00:05:43.330> that<00:05:43.870> would<00:05:44.140> be<00:05:44.320> 75<00:05:46.590> 75<00:05:47.700> 80<00:05:51.360> 390<00:05:54.660> 4.43
