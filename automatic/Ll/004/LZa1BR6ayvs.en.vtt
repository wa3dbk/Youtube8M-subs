of<00:01:44.240> memorization<00:01:45.049> you<00:01:45.290> would<00:01:45.799> want<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.369> try<00:01:47.240> at

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
of memorization you would want to try at

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.649 
of memorization you would want to try at
least<00:01:47.750> to<00:01:48.350> get<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:49.340> copy<00:01:49.640> ahead<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:50.390> time<00:01:50.630> like

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
least to get the copy ahead of time like

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.499 
least to get the copy ahead of time like
the<00:01:51.020> day<00:01:51.200> before<00:01:51.229> you<00:01:52.130> should<00:01:52.240> practice<00:01:53.240> that

the day before you should practice that

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.230 
the day before you should practice that
copy<00:01:53.810> just<00:01:54.560> because<00:01:54.920> there's<00:01:55.189> only<00:01:55.369> one<00:01:55.820> line

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.749 
copy just because there's only one line
it<00:01:56.930> doesn't<00:01:57.229> mean<00:01:57.649> that<00:01:57.680> there's<00:01:58.399> only<00:01:58.549> one

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
it doesn't mean that there's only one

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.999
