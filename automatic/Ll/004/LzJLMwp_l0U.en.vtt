00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
on one side of the braid and I'm going

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:59.050 
on one side of the braid and I'm going
to<00:01:45.800> do<00:01:45.980> that<00:01:46.190> all<00:01:46.400> the<00:01:46.460> way<00:01:46.790> down

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.600 

so<00:02:00.060> what<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.050> braid<00:02:01.470> that<00:02:01.890> has<00:02:02.310> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
so what we have is a braid that has a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.610 
so what we have is a braid that has a
beautiful<00:02:03.240> sort<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.480> scalloped<00:02:03.960> edge<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.410> one

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
beautiful sort of scalloped edge on one

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.920 
beautiful sort of scalloped edge on one
side<00:02:04.980> and<00:02:05.580> when<00:02:06.030> you're<00:02:06.150> happy<00:02:06.270> with<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.720> you

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
side and when you're happy with that you

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.690 
side and when you're happy with that you
can<00:02:07.260> tie<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.590> end<00:02:07.860> off<00:02:08.010> with<00:02:08.220> fat<00:02:08.460> hair

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
can tie the end off with fat hair

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.750 
can tie the end off with fat hair
colored<00:02:09.030> elastic<00:02:09.510> and<00:02:10.400> then<00:02:11.400> we're<00:02:11.550> going<00:02:11.670> to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
colored elastic and then we're going to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.340 
colored elastic and then we're going to
essentially<00:02:12.390> repeat<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.990> same<00:02:13.200> motion<00:02:14.240> on

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.250 

so<00:02:23.250> I'm<00:02:23.370> splitting<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.880> hair<00:02:24.030> into<00:02:24.300> three

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.500

when we've gone as far as we'd like to
go<00:02:33.489> just<00:02:34.180> pulling<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:34.690> braid<00:02:34.959> on<00:02:35.230> the

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
go just pulling the braid on the

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.460 
go just pulling the braid on the
opposite<00:02:36.340> side<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.970> give<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.080> that<00:02:38.200> lovely
