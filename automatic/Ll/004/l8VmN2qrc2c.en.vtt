00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.810
 it's sure it's not the best 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.849
 Friday that we could hope a lot 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.439
 a lot of rain some tests 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.180
 aerodynamic this morning then this after 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.680
 noon we did not even take the wheel the 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.230
 track since there was so much 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.980
 so much water that it was useless 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.939
 so it's true it's a little bit 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.350
 disappointing that we would have liked to do more 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.820
 now we're pretty good news for 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.620
 Saturday and Sunday so I hope it 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.129
 is going to be the case and we will have 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.989
 a good car 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.730
 me the sun in a general way we 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.980
 is rather all happy to have him I 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.839
 would say since it's ja it's a small 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.249
 little less a a lottery in terms of 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:48.019
 qualifications in a race and then we 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.999
 know that the lotus here should be 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.649
 powerful so I hope it will be the 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:53.329
 case tomorrow that the test session there 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.159
 found out well that we will be able to 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.539
 do the settings work on the 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.120
 car we want even if it's going to be 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.989
 settings a little smaller 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.019
 compared to what we usually do 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.220
 and then attacked the qualification in 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.990
 hoping to get a good place 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.830
 wake up all the teams and that's 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.690
 to bring small improvements 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.360
 actually despite the break 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.190
 mandatory two weeks so we have 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.740
 a few new things on the 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.390
 car I hope that 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.659
 what will show tomorrow that she 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.070
 works well and is in any case going 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.500
 continue to work 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.080
 bring changes every time if 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.310
 possible and then make better use of 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.780
 what we have in our hands and accuses 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.579
 because it's quite special actually 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.189
 with this famous raidillon this wall when we 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.860
 arrives in front of him with a big fat 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.140
 compression and a beautiful passage 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.570
 and then and then and then the whole circuit of 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.360
 spa and beautiful the place the circuit the 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.439
 traced the unevenness now we know 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.700
 that its weather is always a little bit 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.890
 capricious and today he showed it 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.319
 the big game is Sunday lunch 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.640
 during the pilots parade count the 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.890
 number of French flags so 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.450
 actually with the proximity of the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.740
 border I hope we will count 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.049
 more than usual with jean eric 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.200
 vergne and it's always hot at 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.200
 heart
