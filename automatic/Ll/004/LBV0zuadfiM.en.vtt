00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.369
 was about the experiences a group of 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.349
 babies that usually turned in 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.939
 adventures due to coincidences and 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.579
 mainly thanks to its great 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.320
 imagination became so popular that 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.750

 despite being a series about innocents 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.539
 babies the creators we managed 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.579
 to put several details that could 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.469
 go unnoticed or jokes that were 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.879
 exclusively for adults who saw 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.039
 in the program that is what we will see 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.659
 right now in one of the first 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.339
 chapters take in the bag of a 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.740
 mailman where a magazine is located 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.659
 about babies that for some reason have 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.280
 a central point expandable as a 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.259
 playboy in the second season take 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.939
 trolleys that give light care the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.500
 paternal grandfather of tomic in front of 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:29.940
 have them talking some movies 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:32.399
 comfortable to abduct and you can not be more 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.380
 direct that that one of the most 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.970
 remembered is when angelica pretends with 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.009
 leg person and the doctor gives you the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.780
 reason incorrectly causing the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.090
 poor juice and diddy have to obey 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.590
 all your whims in addition to demonstrate 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.149
 that angelic enjoys suffering 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.459
 oblivious to a point bordering the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.530
 psychopathic there's something more interesting about 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.140
 the doctor's records a file 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.509
 what does it say about o what does it mean about the tone 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.740
 up on another occasion take and receive a 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.720
 inflatable clown like stripe 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.220
 a so-called pop or carlitos that 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.140
 initially I did not want to play with the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.299
 term obsessing was convened not 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.470
 wanting to play something else what he does 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.470
 that your friends are starting to worry 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.470
 paper 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.360
 ping minibus do you think that was a 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.950
 simple coincidence later there was 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.750
 he made a feature of home movies 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.519
 that bore the whole family in 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.049
 special to his father-in-law the grandfather Boris 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.360
 who makes no effort to avoid 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.250
 demonstrate how uncomfortable you are to the point 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.560
 who decides to call a doctor 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.420
 practice because doctor jack 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.610
 kevorkian better known as a doctor 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.310
 death in the USA was a surgeon who 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.600
 helped to perform assisted suicides 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.910
 that returns the both will have and any 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.040
 mimic smile when listening in another 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.720
 chapter carlos the father of carlitos 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.490
 find solving a crossword that 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.080
 a support a paid telephone service 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.870
 which makes all the sense 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.760
 solve it I guess and in between he calls 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.270
 hugo to take care of tommy giving way to 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.270
 this conversation 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.140
 I wonder what kind of service has been 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.090
 imagined hugo at a certain moment take 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.070
 has a revelation if the animals are 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.200
 so happy without the need to wear clothes 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.120
 then he should not use it either 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.190
 when phil and you come to visit 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.370
 try to convince them to adopt their 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.370
 decision 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.180
 and once convinced they begin to 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.200
 undress and discover that they are not 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.200
 exactly the same 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.180
 in a couple of chapters after Carlotta 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.560
 the angelic mother is very worried 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.420
 by the arrival of the owners of a 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.100
 company that want to buy that are very 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.620
 conservatives for what he is giving 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.660
 many indications to your assistant so 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.720
 appreciated that candame to hire 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.370
 jerÃ­a is 99 apn by marvel thor se 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.320
 refers to some global map 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.330
 producer a photographer known for his 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.910
 controversial works that include 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.459
 sadomasochism brutality and especially 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.320
 for his photos of homosexual eroticism in 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.060
 the same chapter pearls must carry 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.380
 tommy to angelica his work which 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.380
 causes a series of problems 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.289
 clarence thomas is a member of the 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.620
 supreme American court that the 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.729
 90s was accused of sexual harassment 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.530
 during the special it never stops 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.090
 represents the life of the Jews when 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.430
 they were submitted by the 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.840
 Greeks in between this we see a 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.720
 store with a text in Hebrew 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.070
 that word can mean 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.830
 circumcised which explains why 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.210
 offer a cut in the rate and the 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.100
 fifth season take has been accused 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.020
 wrongly to have stolen and busted 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.600
 a ball for which he is handcuffed 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.160
 through a Chinese finger trap 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.840
 Once he manages to escape he has a 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.280
 idea about what you can use to put in 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.280
 the hole and open the trap 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.190
 well actually with the screwdriver 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.920
 but several must have imagined 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.410
 something else already ending the movie we 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.240
 delivers several interesting moments for 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.920
 example when I say and argue with your 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.550
 friends about the possible weak sex ' 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.550
 carlota 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.280
 pity that the phone interrupted him 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.420
 because full proverb is born under 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.420
 winner look for happiness 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.290
 while dee dee is about to give 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.030
 birth a deal I'll see you take advantage of 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.280
 visit the motherhood where are the 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.290
 newborns these sing a song 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.560
 where they mention their show to the new 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.560
 world 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.600
 and by accident cart turns on the 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.600
 light giving way to this 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.680
 so ends my review of the moments 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.599
 of adventures in diapers of course is 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.699
 There may be many more scenes 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.349
 what will I be waiting for your comments 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.940
