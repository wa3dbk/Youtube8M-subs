00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello everyone and welcome to the channel 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.919
 hbo of time cpj is today in 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.889
 this video I propose a challenge a 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.509
 challenge to realize the max of sir 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.950
 lub why because I looked at our 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.170
 old videos we had made especially 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.910
 the challenge sir lub burpee this 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.170
 sir lub sorry and I told myself 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.330
 it's true we've never done just 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.100
 the max of sir lub so i'm going to the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.109
 room I film you ends is taking advantage 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.390
 also to film the pump max will be 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.019
 in a next video very quickly 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.019
 here we go 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.730
 booty 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.570
 or almost 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.720
 to better 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.950
 m 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 Oh 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.520
 and that's why I made 17 dead loeb 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.960
 I admit I was a little disappointed I thought 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.970
 power spent past twenty 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.350
 so here I was not in super 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.120
 form either simply I put a 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.640
 little bit overrated I took advantage 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.650
 also to turn my maximum spawning 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.550
 so I did right after I go out the 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.720
 video very soon 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.700
 I put the link from elsewhere from 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.440
 that she is available I admit that I have 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.940
 really not been good either but good 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.100
 that's what allows you to test yourself 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.050
 also and well I offered them for 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.760
 to be able to beat me again and 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.590
 it was not of course to test this challenge 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.600
 put your body in the comments 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.369
 of course be honest or post 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.470
 directly the video with the link on will go 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.119
 of course check all that if you have 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.530
 want alex take up the challenge put the 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.960
 in the comments so that he too 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.429
 face his max in europe and now 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.590
 without further ado we move on to 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.110
 questions answers our max video 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.850
 traction so it's an old video 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.930
 we had done our maximum of traction 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.780
 indeed a little over 30 I 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.540
 believe it's 31 and 33 and so prime 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.250
 florian high school commentary that tells us 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.510
 I propose a max challenge of Mr. Loeb 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.770
 in a minute walla I admit it's him 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.340
 who gave me the idea so I did not do 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.200
 in one minute 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.730
 but i did the max of mister loeb 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.590
 so thanks for then second 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.300
 question that tells them 94 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.040
 can anyone tell me how much 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.239
 and what size is it great 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.100
 drawn so right there it made me 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.630
 pleasure then I read but it looks 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.000
 especially light back it makes it limit 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.870
 skinny good already it hurt me I admit 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.870
 I was not good and so I'm 1 m 82 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.010
 I had to do 76,117 on the old 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.110
 video is dropped a little bit heavier 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.810
 I took a little before the summer and 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.800
 third question and ftd because is that 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.970
 it is possible to do push-ups in 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.680
 an arm I do not think but good knows 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.209
 never bah yeah it's possible there are 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.980
 who do it of course we even downright 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.870
 do several and even have guys who 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.459
 happens to pass sir the ofppt an arm 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.280
 and now we go to comments 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.250
 who kills and the comment that kills and 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.500
 returns to boub 75000 is not 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.040
 pulls that they compensate to death with 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.769
 legs 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.150
 so lol wholesale fake so already if they are 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.049
 tractions and there are several who have 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.030
 put that in the comments 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.470
 it's just that if you are told do 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.150
 your maximum traction of course you 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.620
 will help you with the whole body 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.910
 okay if you're hanging on a 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.410
 cliff that we tell you must absolutely 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.600
 that you go up there you're not going 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.799
 do it quiet in strict traction 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.940
 to say 'wait up like that 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.500
 I'm doing in room 1 you're going to do 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.359
 as you can here it is the same 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.990
 principle we tell you does the max does the 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.640
 max possible on the planned measures game 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.660
 but cars lover of the momentum of course 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.500
 these loved ones that surf strict 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.030
 we do a lot less 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.950
 and even if you watch the video well 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.360
 maximum traction there is a wall in front 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.740
 which prevents us from gaining momentum 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.510
 otherwise I assure you we would have 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.190
 could rock it again and that's it 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.720
 sure i hope this video she has you 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.920
 please do not hesitate to put in the 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.290
 comments if you have other ideas 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.820
 challenge for alex for me or any 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.470
 simply that we fight each other or both 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.510
 by the way we do the same thing on 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.160
 our second channel alex and pj where we 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.530
 test a lot of sports and we challenge 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.910
 alex against me and of course if you 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.830

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.330
 we start with pleasure I tell you 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.880
