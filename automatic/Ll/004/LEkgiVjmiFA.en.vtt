00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:04.980
 so there is psychology plays like 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.300
 usually but here too the interview top 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.190
 flop with angie so tapir is a 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.440
 better influence whatever in the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.710
 rap or in things in my worst 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.710
 influence 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.740
 listen I will not say who is a stone 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.119
 a flop because in the end even if there is 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.710
 stuff that some too i have that 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.230
 I can listen that some people 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.910
 too con appears to me final it's going 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.500
 influence so fell down to forge 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.670
 my personality you understand artistic 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.769
 or what then I would not say it's me 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.350
 of their influence even rush hour 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.700
 it's me wow it's the beautiful 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.079
 trace my brother we will take me to 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.010
 really influence my loved ones you see 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.079
 what they are close to me every 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.430
 days and you see the gas damage from 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.920
 the entourage or the guys who hang out 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.629
 around me as sbm or to be the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.789
 guys who tortured me but my most 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.160
 big influence on him in addition between 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.180
 do you agree then you did 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.250
 many keys by one but always 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.949
 beautiful real I find sure that this 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.510
 the entourage or even the personal roof if 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.980
 you had a better and worse memory 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.719
 during a clip shoot an anecdote 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.270
 very short 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.220
 our reflections but frankly every 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.549
 cdc clips bad memories almost 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.760
 all 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.250
 1 because the town has had one 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.580
 clip is it true super cold we were 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.259
 outside 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.119
 finally we had no killer desire on 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.619
 do not know what we wanted to do 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.850
 was looking everywhere in the pines 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.409
 different places to find 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.759
 funny stuff business and / or and have 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.210
 stalled phew 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.010
 the last time 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.700
 we felt the team of kings because 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.830
 I have a past all that it was great 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.210
 nice, you really see it's the best 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.070
 of the best clip memory because 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.479
 we were in a big villa finally 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.860
 in a big house we were 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.500
 horse and all your playful you see it's 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.119
 cool but hey it's still boring a 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.190
 that we must not believe that on any one 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.899
 trip we are dissolved 48 th and 40,000 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.460
 taking different details we come on the 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.899
 morning 9 o'clock we talk in the evening it is 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.729
 two o'clock in the morning sure we're tired 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.440
 okay I'll go personally 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.970
 I take it I do not do it an hour and 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.680
 half I can say that my eyes were 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.630
 exposed I was die I could not 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.250
 so let's look at the clip anyway 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.270
 preferred to do that remains one of 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.039
 last of the entourage 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.110
 we have these the entourage of the months 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.030
 after sending my worst memories type 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.380
 if I want if I can come back on 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.429
 it's really the whole team that are 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.120
 not sensitive and we have a lot 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.780
 of equipped to die tomorrow last time I 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.880
 wanted to leave 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.280
 weiner is not released we clipped too 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.959
 think like a boss we did not appreciate 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.180
 months we did a lot of clips that 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.830
 was not at the level we had 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.100
 always set people it's these 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.690
 people were kind enough to see them then if you 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.620
 also had an anecdote on stage because 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.570
 that you did you still want a 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.450
 shot of scene with entourage so a 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.930
 anecdote on stage an anecdote that I 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.850
 can we have this one we'll say the 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.370
 last one relates to the planes around me 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.920
 I was already allowed to be arm you see 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.180
 she was on stage and everything and I know 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.110

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.820
 pushed and I think it's my brother 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.500
 by the way pushed me into the audience 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.690
 sees the public and late I'm not ready 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.360
 I'm trying to catch up with you, but he 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.769
 is a big guy that you said 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.340
 it's hard to catch up with me month they 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.350
 were still successful but missing 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.340

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.200

 the anecdote of Seine is the best 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.340
