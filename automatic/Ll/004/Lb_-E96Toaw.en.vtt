00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hi, I'm going to explain quickly in 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.960
 what does this mean I want you to see the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.319
 image that is appearing in your 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.319
 screen 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.430
 and I want you to think about what color the 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.320
 I'll explain to you again why a lot 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.119
 People see it in a color that you do not see it 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.279
 this has a scientific explanation 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.439
 there is a medical explanation I will do 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.029
 that you see the dress of the two forms 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.970
 that is the dress of white with gold or 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.619
 black with blue I think you see it in 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.989
 this video of the two forms I'm not going to 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.489
 change the image but I'll make 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.739
 Do a little exercise with your list 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.140
 and I'll show you how everything works 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.300
 in our eye we have something called 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.820
 retina retina cones are found 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.160
 are the ones that make us capture the colors 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.340
 mainly the colors blue green and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.460
 red and based on these colors we can 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.489
 form the other colors 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.710
 in this image we can see that the part 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.949
 which is golden or failing the part 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.260
 that is black has a little gold and 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.430
 a little bit of black basically in the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.890
 image and the blue part 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.890
 has some white too then it is 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.360
 valid to see it in the two ways is normal 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.880
 however has a lot to do with the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.410
 light with what you are seeing it does not have 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.940
 to see emotionally that is 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.980
 unfortunately part 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.620
 since you feel sad or you feel 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.750
 happy has to do with enlightenment and 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.910
 with your eye we detect some 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.620
 colors before others and also has 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.600
 what to do with your genetics is like when 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.990
 made someone likes parsley 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.720
 and make them parsley others say that they 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.670
 tastes like soap or when we talk a 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.400
 lotion or perfume that we like but 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.250
 other people do not like them that way too 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.410
 happens with the view we press things 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.090
 differently however I have 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.700
 realized that a lot of people say no 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.790
 sees of the two forms does not look white 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.610
 red or blue with black I'll tell you 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.550
 easily because his eye is designed 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.620
 in a very particular way and see the 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.630
 colors that easier the hill can 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.970
 interpret now that I'm going to make it look 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.800
 the dress of another color where are you going 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.650
 dress tightly close your eyelids 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.159
 but not completely do not see 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.890
 and between only a few lights on his eyelids 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:21.720
 let her eyes of chinitos and veil of 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.579
 spill tell me if it looks the same as what 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.730
 You saw I assure you that you will not see 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:28.890
 the same is going to look different now it's going 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.829
 to know in the opposite way to what 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.379
 you normally saw it, explanation is 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.720
 in the light that is in genetics in the 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.250
 fusion interpretation things to your 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.140
 brain 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.900
 if it is an optical effect 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.940
 but it has nothing mystical if you like it 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.720
 life subscribe you can not miss 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.720
