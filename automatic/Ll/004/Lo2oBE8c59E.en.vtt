00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
there's a specific ideal that we as

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
Americans hold which is you know that we

Americans hold which is you know that we
are<00:04:55.820> free<00:04:56.210> that<00:04:56.570> we<00:04:56.690> have<00:04:56.900> rights<00:04:57.280> that<00:04:58.280> we

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
are free that we have rights that we

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.640 
are free that we have rights that we
have<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.700> right<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:59.240> succeed<00:04:59.720> and<00:05:00.080> you<00:05:00.530> know

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
have the right to succeed and you know

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.190 
have the right to succeed and you know
we<00:05:00.800> have<00:05:00.980> this<00:05:01.100> idea<00:05:01.910> of<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.540> American<00:05:02.930> dream

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
we have this idea of the American dream

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.470 
we have this idea of the American dream
and<00:05:04.040> that's<00:05:04.280> you<00:05:04.610> know<00:05:04.640> that's<00:05:04.760> great<00:05:05.300> in

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
and that's you know that's great in

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.110 
and that's you know that's great in
theory<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:06.080> on<00:05:06.200> paper<00:05:07.960> but<00:05:09.640> it's<00:05:10.640> only<00:05:10.910> been

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
theory and on paper but it's only been

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.219 
theory and on paper but it's only been
the<00:05:11.180> case<00:05:11.450> for<00:05:11.510> a<00:05:11.810> certainty<00:05:12.400> group<00:05:13.400> of<00:05:13.520> people

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
the case for a certainty group of people

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.270 
the case for a certainty group of people
but<00:05:15.229> that<00:05:15.410> doesn't<00:05:15.530> mean<00:05:15.800> that<00:05:15.890> we<00:05:16.010> should<00:05:16.190> be

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
but that doesn't mean that we should be

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.010 
but that doesn't mean that we should be
a<00:05:16.310> less<00:05:16.610> patriotic<00:05:16.820> that<00:05:17.630> doesn't<00:05:17.930> mean

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
a less patriotic that doesn't mean

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.510 
a less patriotic that doesn't mean
because<00:05:18.350> it's<00:05:18.380> not<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.770> reality<00:05:19.040> that<00:05:19.280> it

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
because it's not the reality that it

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.730 
because it's not the reality that it
can't<00:05:19.729> be<00:05:19.850> the<00:05:19.970> future<00:05:20.330> because<00:05:21.320> those<00:05:21.590> are

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
can't be the future because those are

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.409 
can't be the future because those are
the<00:05:21.770> things<00:05:22.040> that<00:05:22.250> we<00:05:22.370> should<00:05:22.520> work<00:05:22.669> to<00:05:22.940> work

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
the things that we should work to work

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.800 
the things that we should work to work
towards<00:05:23.780> as<00:05:23.900> Americans<00:05:24.590> you<00:05:25.490> know<00:05:25.810> our

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
towards as Americans you know our

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.040 
towards as Americans you know our
country<00:05:27.200> is<00:05:27.320> not<00:05:27.470> what<00:05:27.680> it<00:05:27.710> could<00:05:27.950> be<00:05:27.979> but<00:05:29.050> we

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
country is not what it could be but we

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.980 
country is not what it could be but we
now<00:05:30.200> see<00:05:30.500> that<00:05:30.650> there<00:05:30.830> it<00:05:31.070> has<00:05:31.250> potential<00:05:31.990> and

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
now see that there it has potential and

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.230 
now see that there it has potential and
frankly<00:05:33.740> I<00:05:33.830> feel<00:05:34.370> like<00:05:34.520> I've<00:05:34.820> always<00:05:34.970> known

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
frankly I feel like I've always known

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.550 
frankly I feel like I've always known
that<00:05:35.270> it<00:05:35.510> had<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:35.780> potential<00:05:36.110> we've<00:05:36.350> just

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
that it had the potential we've just

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.380 
that it had the potential we've just
never<00:05:36.710> reached<00:05:36.979> it<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:37.400> he's<00:05:37.520> never<00:05:37.729> really<00:05:37.970> I

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
never reached it and he's never really I

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.750 
never reached it and he's never really I
don't<00:05:38.930> think<00:05:39.229> we've<00:05:39.620> really<00:05:39.740> given<00:05:40.460> it<00:05:40.640> the

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
don't think we've really given it the

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.719 
don't think we've really given it the
chance<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:42.740> that's<00:05:43.070> what<00:05:43.190> he<00:05:43.280> said<00:05:43.490> you<00:05:43.610> know

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
chance and that's what he said you know

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.020 
chance and that's what he said you know
he<00:05:45.130> Reverend<00:05:46.130> Thompson<00:05:46.310> was<00:05:46.640> just<00:05:46.820> kind<00:05:46.970> of
