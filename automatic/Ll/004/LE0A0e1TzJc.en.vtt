00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.610
 hello people today there is again 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.890
 tutorial namely an improvement we 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.660
 that's about five months ago 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.279
 I agree with the compact mpv 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.680
 this and today I show you how 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.180
 One two years improves once like 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.040
 to grow a better antenna what 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.989
 is quite easy and the second time like 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.940
 you connect an external camera 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.530
 special connection and then this 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.850
 I'll show you that now 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.070
 fast as I mean mine so I have 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.050
 it is here once the connection of this 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.360
 camera are here in this connection 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.400
 and I turn it over once and the 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.409
 now here the picture at once 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.000
 cameraman filmed me and now 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.339
 can the runners compact mpv stand that way 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.010
 every camera had afterwards 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.350
 of course gopro mirror reflex or 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.540
 just any other camera that 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.310
 I'll show you all for a few minutes 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.750
 however, he needs all the documents he needs 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.820
 As always you will find schematics 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.799
 video describes a lot of fun for this 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.360
 titles you only need three components as 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.710
 First you deliver these glover tunnels 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.330
 for 5.8 ghz 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.979
 all you have to do is look at that 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.900
 the connection is the right one there 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.329
 once rp it was over and noodles 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.210
 eat connection of the rp only in connection 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.880
 has no pin and the middle of the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.930
 sma connection had to here a pin 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.450
 just look for a connection 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.130
 Senders compact mpv system has with me 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.450
 is now one here with a pin in it 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.179
 So I need here at the antenna 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.890
 no pin on you need one more 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.880
 Selection switch with a toggle switch 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.340
 a two choices a 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.749
 pretty cheap component and now so 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.280
 a seemingly socket 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:57.189
 We can then connect the video cable 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.479
 connect all the components you can find in 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.659
 the description is linked to a 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.700
 schematics as tools require one 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.280
 helping hand soldering of course one 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.170
 Soldering an absolutely its a 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.060
 Side cutter around a sharp knife 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.430
 and a screwdriver around housing to 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.660
 open there still a lighter around the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.930
 Shrink tubes disappeared 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.630
 Of course, use a nonsense as well 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.930
 then main two drills 1 6 mm 102 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.160
 millimeter of course a cordless screwdriver 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.540
 First we install the new and 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.159
 Of course, better guess tel 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.380
 we just go for it 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:34.670
 the old one off and do the new look 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.600
 mainz angled 90 degrees if that is so 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.190
 we can just with one 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.740
 lighter or with the price 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.410
 make the cable something true and then 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.510
 we can also offer something so 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.950
 pointing up to me now and 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.910
 already we have new appointments installed 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.060
 and now you have a better one 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.050
 picture quality and even more coverage 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.200
 of course look that all is well 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.090
 is fixed but thus looks like now 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.950
 let's build the video input books 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.560
 For that we take how fast the antenna 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.660
 off and screw now is compact mpv 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.040
 system on if that helped now 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.530
 Who will be the electronics of yours 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.880
 we've got it going and 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.010
 to make a small change 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.780
 and this from marshal to be 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.280
 we pass the video signal 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.290
 can switch once from the 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.120
 built- in camera on then 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.120
 These cinch jacks where we will later 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.650
 an external camera can connect 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.810
 There are two ways he does that 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:32.620
 you can make this once before from 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:35.210
 Thus, the Connect is always the usd 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.100
 on your video on it blinded or after 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.170
 the usd module is then just simply 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.640
 only the feature on it that east only 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.770
 on the games camera video 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.770
 dazzled I go very close and close 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.810
 that is before the easter thus the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.880
 voltage values ​​and the time that the oz t 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.450
 on the picture on the picture signals 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.080
 on it dead 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.360
 that's why he's like that on both cameras 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:02.140
 here the white cable of the lot 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:05.630
 camera here and will now 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.720
 cut through and to one of the outer 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.600
 pins the switch on and that 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.380
 cable the other way cable which to 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.520
 usd leads to the middle i have 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.790
 now here a middle pin of the 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.760
 switch the input video input for 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.640
 the usd is based on one of the 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.650
 outer here the camera and the other 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.510
 outer then come our video signal 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.860
 which comes with cinch sockets 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.120
 Schematic could also be in the video 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.850
 Download description there counts 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.290
 yes everything is exactly how connected 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.890
 Do you have another free pin? 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.220
 of the card a yellow cable is loosened 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.600
 which now to the middle pin 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.070
 cinch jacks so goes to the 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.170
 video signal which then from the 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.350
 external camera is fast 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.350
 Sign in 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.440
 Now we have another connection 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.990
 from the outside of the housing is the cinch 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.380
 sockets on one of our electronics 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.480
 do 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.940
 I have a black cable for this 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:11.200
 - represents and that it's up to the 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:13.690
 outside of the cinch sockets as well 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.450
 of course you can see here in here 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.160
 the middle of the yellow card that 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.760
 video signal cable and here on the 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.530
 outside of the cinch sockets here outside 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.600
 on mother then I have her 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.490
 black cables to stupid for - the 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.890
 black cables and now as I said 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.890
 all our poles of electronics 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.350
 since the referring - cable which has a 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.220
 get-here's one of minuspol 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.050
 usd gelautet 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.510
 Now I need the switch 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.250
 a drill had to go through a hole in 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.090
 make the outer wall and then I can 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.090
 close the housing again 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.640
 special switches installed and he 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.040
 works pretty well 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.210
 so that everything belongs now we can 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.860
 close the housing again 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.420
 the film is no longer a residue for me 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.130
 there are and then we can 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:12.990
 careful of all electronics like one 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:15.440
 press space and the housing again 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.440
 screw together 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.430
 that was it 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.330
 got us to the antenna mount 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.830
 already the spv to us again completely 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.880
 below can try that 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.740
 actually one should now 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.940
 I have it here once 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.500
 again , the internal camera sink 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.630
 turned on, I turn on the top 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.460
 the mirror reflex which he lies now 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.530
 I walk in with the mirror reflex 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.290
 garden and then you can see 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.220
 what i do about our external camera 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.220
 can record 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.540
 So here is a garden we have 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.150
 for example that the and cut feel 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.320
 dream of the hessian flashlight and 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.850
 If you walk now we will come 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.580
 probably closer to the windmill as well 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:07:01.660
 do not see that the widest range 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:01.660
 just because you have a bunch in operation 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.970
 wonderful I hope you have the video 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.410
 like 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.200
 Now you can have our test video 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.550
 watching over the compact could stand 

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.590
 just click here on the monitor 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.240
 we have the compact mpv like that 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.800
 stand on a model car installed 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.420
 and the model car from beamer 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.470
 remotely now I can still 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.390
 make a small announcement in the 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.310
 next week we will be a series 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.230
 start where we show how to fpv 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.590
 plane builds itself from scratch 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.430
 the airplane and stand as a real home 

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:47.810
 if that interests you 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.810
 just subscribe until next time
