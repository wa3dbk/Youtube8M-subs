 to do a pickup with braids this 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.940
 hairstyle is super easy to make and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.010
 works better if you have not so hair 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.330

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.430
 cool because you shampoo and 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.140
 cockle exotic conditioner that 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.119
 It gives a lot of vitality and freshness to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.010
 hair after washing it and before 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.529
 I know I put my hair cream 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.660
 combing be sexy chic curls from the middle 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.340
 of hair to the tips this to 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.559
 have a better finish in the next 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.930
 step since we have the cream applied and 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.579
 dry hair with a plate we make 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.190
 natural waves to facilitate the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.670
 combed this we do it in all the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.670
 head 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.140
 Now let's separate the hair first 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.690
 in two sections one on each side of 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.720
 the head then we are separating them 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.190
 also in two one part forward and one 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.289
 behind 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.780
 but first I'm going to take a bit of the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.820
 left lock to the right to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.210
 that the line is to one side and not the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.210
 medium 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.320
 the loans with hooks 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.480
 temporarily to continue with the 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.610
 picked we selected one of the 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.460
 back strands and we make a braid 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.430
 of three at the tip we hold with a 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.530
 league then very carefully we pull 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.750
 all the braided parts to give you a 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.420
 more sloppy finishing this we do 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.920
 with the two back strands 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.740
 we continue raising one of the presses 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.280
 we bend and fasten with hooks 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.100
 hiding the tip of the braid 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.790
 then we put the braid on the other side 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.790
 and we repeat 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.860
 and it is going as we want 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.650
 now we move to the front locks 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.840
 one first and the other then we do 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.540
 a braid not so tight and the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.150
 we hold with a league then we do what 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.530
 same on the other side of these braids 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.780
 we also give them one more touch 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.230
 untidy dropping them with a lot 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.230
 watch out 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.410
 now we take them back and 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.650
 hiding the tips we hold everything 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.379
 with hooks 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.030
 gave is too easy and I do not know 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.799
 worry about combing your hair a lot or 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.689
 put the handle on it since our purpose 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.970
 is to give a more casual touch to the 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.800
 style without neglecting the elegant and 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.380
 Romantic 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.000
 and since we talk about romanticism he decides 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.730
 use a color that goes very well with the 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.110
 word love and this is the red color that 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.810
 this time I use it in my dreams with the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.880
 enamel neil finn in tones breaking and 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.740
 complementing the look I'm going to sit down 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.530
 lips with labial mart ford color 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.570
 enma lizbeth I'm already ready with many 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.490
