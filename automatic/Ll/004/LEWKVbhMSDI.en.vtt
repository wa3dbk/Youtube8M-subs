00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
that's looking good let's cover this

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.789 
that's looking good let's cover this
with<00:01:23.880> our<00:01:24.119> water<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.500> could<00:01:25.650> use<00:01:25.770> chicken

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
with our water and you could use chicken

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.710 
with our water and you could use chicken
stock<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.820> could<00:01:26.970> use<00:01:27.090> vegetable<00:01:27.689> stock

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
stock here you could use vegetable stock

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.109 
stock here you could use vegetable stock
even<00:01:28.229> some<00:01:28.770> fish<00:01:29.070> stock<00:01:29.369> would<00:01:29.549> work<00:01:29.729> really

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
even some fish stock would work really

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.780 
even some fish stock would work really
well<00:01:30.329> with<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:32.100> cover<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.670> can

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
well with this so just cover and you can

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.789 
well with this so just cover and you can
see<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.600> prob<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.960> centimeter<00:01:34.590> over

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
see it's prob about a centimeter over

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.340 
see it's prob about a centimeter over
the<00:01:35.040> rice<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> flavors<00:01:36.540> 2<00:01:37.079> bay

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the rice there are the flavors 2 bay

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.590 
the rice there are the flavors 2 bay
leaves<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.829> think<00:01:38.220> are<00:01:38.340> crucial<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.240> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
leaves I think are crucial for this a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.060 
leaves I think are crucial for this a
little<00:01:40.200> bit<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.500> salt<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.460> pinch<00:01:41.700> so

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
little bit of salt so just a pinch so

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.800 
little bit of salt so just a pinch so
the<00:01:44.070> lid<00:01:44.220> goes<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.520> now<00:01:44.790> we're<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.540> place

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the lid goes on now we're going to place

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.569 
the lid goes on now we're going to place
