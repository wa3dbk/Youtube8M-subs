00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
YouTube started any simple idea can be

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.910 
YouTube started any simple idea can be
taken<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.640> used<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:09.180> our<00:04:09.989> technique<00:04:10.590> he<00:04:10.799> go

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920
