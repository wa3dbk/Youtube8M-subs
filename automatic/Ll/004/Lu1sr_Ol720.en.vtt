00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.019 
Autodesk Inventor so without further ado
let's<00:00:15.450> go<00:00:15.660> ahead<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.139> take<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> look<00:00:16.789> I'm<00:00:17.789> going

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
let's go ahead and take a look I'm going

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.370 
let's go ahead and take a look I'm going
to<00:00:18.119> start<00:00:18.390> out<00:00:18.480> with<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.810> flat<00:00:19.109> piece<00:00:19.350> of

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
to start out with this flat piece of

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.260 
to start out with this flat piece of
sheet<00:00:19.710> metal<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.130> I'm<00:00:20.520> going<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.789> use<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.090> to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
sheet metal and I'm going to use that to

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.420 
sheet metal and I'm going to use that to
generate<00:00:21.689> my<00:00:21.869> eye<00:00:21.900> feature<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.650> can<00:00:23.070> save<00:00:23.310> this

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
generate my eye feature I can save this

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.950 
generate my eye feature I can save this
for<00:00:23.670> later<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.029> reuse<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.449> if<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.630> ever<00:00:24.750> make

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
for later and reuse it if I ever make

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.529 
for later and reuse it if I ever make
any<00:00:25.109> changes<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.880> we'll<00:00:26.880> start<00:00:27.090> out<00:00:27.210> by<00:00:27.359> making

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
any changes so we'll start out by making

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.529 
any changes so we'll start out by making
a<00:00:27.750> sketch<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.490> I'm<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.789> draw<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> circle

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
a sketch and I'm going to draw a circle

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.630 
a sketch and I'm going to draw a circle
that<00:00:30.810> represents<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.439> outside<00:00:31.859> profile<00:00:32.369> of

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
that represents the outside profile of

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.389 
that represents the outside profile of
my<00:00:32.910> emboss<00:00:33.469> notice<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.649> I'm<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.040> name

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
my emboss notice that I'm going to name

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.729 
my emboss notice that I'm going to name
the<00:00:35.579> parameter<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> can<00:00:36.899> recall<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.590> at<00:00:37.680> a

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
the parameter so I can recall it at a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.330 
the parameter so I can recall it at a
later<00:00:37.890> date

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.820 

once<00:00:46.030> that's<00:00:46.210> renamed<00:00:46.690> I<00:00:46.960> can<00:00:47.380> go<00:00:47.470> ahead<00:00:47.620> and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
once that's renamed I can go ahead and

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.040 
once that's renamed I can go ahead and
call<00:00:47.980> up<00:00:48.130> a<00:00:48.220> second<00:00:48.700> circle<00:00:48.910> this<00:00:49.810> will

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
call up a second circle this will

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.560 
call up a second circle this will
represent<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.890> inside<00:00:51.520> surface<00:00:52.150> of<00:00:52.180> my

represent the inside surface of my

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.870 
represent the inside surface of my
emboss<00:00:52.870> I'm<00:00:53.830> going<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.430> use<00:00:54.550> an<00:00:54.670> offset

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
emboss I'm going to use an offset

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.120 
emboss I'm going to use an offset
dimension<00:00:55.540> this<00:00:55.660> time<00:00:55.930> and<00:00:56.170> I'm<00:00:56.620> going<00:00:56.860> to<00:00:56.950> set

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
dimension this time and I'm going to set

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.490 
dimension this time and I'm going to set
it<00:00:57.220> equal<00:00:57.400> to<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:58.000> thickness<00:00:58.240> parameter<00:00:58.600> this

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
it equal to the thickness parameter this

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.440 
it equal to the thickness parameter this
will<00:00:59.710> allow<00:00:59.980> it<00:01:00.130> to<00:01:00.250> change<00:01:00.280> when<00:01:00.880> I<00:01:00.910> change<00:01:00.970> my

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
will allow it to change when I change my

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.189 
will allow it to change when I change my
material<00:01:02.050> thickness

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.740 

now<00:01:05.680> one<00:01:06.009> more<00:01:06.189> step<00:01:06.490> we're<00:01:06.970> going<00:01:07.210> to<00:01:07.299> grab<00:01:07.509> a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
now one more step we're going to grab a

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.660 
now one more step we're going to grab a
center<00:01:08.049> point<00:01:08.290> and<00:01:08.470> add<00:01:08.830> that<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.430> center

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
center point and add that to the center

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.120 
center point and add that to the center
of<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:09.880> sketch<00:01:10.150> this<00:01:10.960> will<00:01:11.229> allow<00:01:11.860> me<00:01:12.009> to

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
of the sketch this will allow me to

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.160 
of the sketch this will allow me to
locate<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.729> punch<00:01:12.939> when<00:01:13.299> I<00:01:13.330> place<00:01:13.689> it<00:01:13.960> on<00:01:14.110> my

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
locate the punch when I place it on my

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.910 
locate the punch when I place it on my
part

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.649 

with<00:01:18.430> that<00:01:18.580> step<00:01:18.820> done<00:01:19.030> we'll<00:01:19.240> finish<00:01:19.420> the

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
with that step done we'll finish the

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.360 
with that step done we'll finish the
sketch<00:01:19.870> and<00:01:20.200> we'll<00:01:20.350> switch<00:01:20.590> to<00:01:20.620> our<00:01:20.890> modeling

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
sketch and we'll switch to our modeling

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.250 
sketch and we'll switch to our modeling
tools<00:01:21.610> notice<00:01:22.360> we're<00:01:22.479> going<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.630> use<00:01:22.810> modeling

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
tools notice we're going to use modeling

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.110 
tools notice we're going to use modeling
tools<00:01:23.470> not<00:01:24.040> sheet<00:01:24.370> metal<00:01:24.580> tools<00:01:24.820> to<00:01:24.970> create

tools not sheet metal tools to create
this<00:01:25.420> that's<00:01:25.870> okay<00:01:26.550> so<00:01:27.550> I'll<00:01:27.640> go<00:01:27.670> ahead<00:01:27.790> and

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
this that's okay so I'll go ahead and

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.140 
this that's okay so I'll go ahead and
take<00:01:28.150> my<00:01:28.210> extrusion<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:28.900> change<00:01:29.229> my<00:01:29.380> settings

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
take my extrusion and change my settings

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.520 
take my extrusion and change my settings
making<00:01:31.150> sure<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.570> add<00:01:31.690> a<00:01:31.720> depth<00:01:32.110> which<00:01:32.380> I'm

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
making sure to add a depth which I'm

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.359 
making sure to add a depth which I'm
going<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:32.770> add<00:01:32.950> make<00:01:33.250> thickness<00:01:33.910> x<00:01:34.390> two<00:01:34.660> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
going to add make thickness x two and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.640 
going to add make thickness x two and
I'll<00:01:36.369> add<00:01:36.550> a<00:01:36.580> taper<00:01:37.000> of<00:01:37.300> negative<00:01:37.840> 15<00:01:37.990> degrees

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
I'll add a taper of negative 15 degrees

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.080 
I'll add a taper of negative 15 degrees
to<00:01:38.680> make<00:01:39.040> sure<00:01:39.160> I<00:01:39.190> have<00:01:39.490> an<00:01:39.640> appropriate<00:01:39.940> taper

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.120 

once<00:01:43.780> that's<00:01:43.960> done<00:01:44.229> I'll<00:01:44.530> go<00:01:44.770> ahead<00:01:44.979> and

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
once that's done I'll go ahead and

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.719 
once that's done I'll go ahead and
accept<00:01:45.399> that

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.090 

get<00:01:49.360> that<00:01:49.509> in<00:01:49.719> and<00:01:49.930> now<00:01:50.500> we<00:01:50.560> have<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.890> first

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
get that in and now we have the first

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.149 
get that in and now we have the first
step<00:01:51.399> of<00:01:51.520> our<00:01:51.640> emboss<00:01:52.409> next<00:01:53.409> I'll<00:01:53.619> find<00:01:54.039> the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
step of our emboss next I'll find the

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.609 
step of our emboss next I'll find the
sketch<00:01:54.460> inside<00:01:54.969> my<00:01:55.119> browser<00:01:55.390> right<00:01:56.049> click<00:01:56.110> and

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.069 

now<00:02:01.640> we're<00:02:01.880> going<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.149> extrude<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.659> center

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
now we're going to extrude the center

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.480 
now we're going to extrude the center
circle<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.649> this<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.100> going<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.369> represent

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
circle and this is going to represent

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.880 
circle and this is going to represent
the<00:02:04.850> inside<00:02:05.390> of<00:02:05.479> my<00:02:05.630> emboss<00:02:05.929> so<00:02:06.500> I<00:02:06.530> want<00:02:06.829> to

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
the inside of my emboss so I want to

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.190 
the inside of my emboss so I want to
make<00:02:07.100> sure<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.399> remove<00:02:07.700> material<00:02:07.939> and<00:02:08.539> I'm

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
make sure to remove material and I'm

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.170 
make sure to remove material and I'm
going<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.530> set<00:02:09.679> this<00:02:09.800> equal<00:02:10.129> to<00:02:10.190> thickness<00:02:10.700> so

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
going to set this equal to thickness so

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.410 
going to set this equal to thickness so
it<00:02:11.209> holds<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.720> correct<00:02:12.080> shape<00:02:12.879> I'll<00:02:13.879> also<00:02:14.180> go

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
it holds the correct shape I'll also go

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.369 
it holds the correct shape I'll also go
to<00:02:14.480> my<00:02:14.629> taper<00:02:14.870> choose<00:02:15.800> show<00:02:16.310> dimensions<00:02:16.879> and

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
to my taper choose show dimensions and

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.630 
to my taper choose show dimensions and
select<00:02:18.379> the<00:02:18.470> taper<00:02:18.709> angle<00:02:18.950> for<00:02:19.280> my<00:02:19.370> previous

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
select the taper angle for my previous

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.850 
select the taper angle for my previous
feature<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.900> those<00:02:21.140> off<00:02:21.530> line<00:02:22.069> up<00:02:22.220> correctly

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.890 

now<00:02:26.280> one<00:02:26.550> more<00:02:26.760> step<00:02:27.000> for<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.270> feature<00:02:27.480> we're

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
now one more step for this feature we're

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.070 
now one more step for this feature we're
going<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.320> go<00:02:28.440> ahead<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.010> add<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.490> Phylis

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
going to go ahead and add the Phylis

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.110 
going to go ahead and add the Phylis
large<00:02:31.080> fill<00:02:31.410> it's<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.770> surfaces<00:02:32.730> that

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
large fill it's on the surfaces that

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.990 
large fill it's on the surfaces that
would<00:02:33.300> require<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.690> large<00:02:34.020> fill<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:35.000> notice

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
would require a large fill in notice

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.160 
would require a large fill in notice
that<00:02:36.120> i'm<00:02:36.240> going<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.450> use<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.810> thickness

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
that i'm going to use the thickness

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:45.490 
that i'm going to use the thickness
parameter<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.860> reuse<00:02:38.160> those

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.040 

once<00:02:46.190> we<00:02:46.340> get<00:02:46.460> those<00:02:46.640> set<00:02:46.940> up<00:02:47.060> correctly

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.360 

you

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.940 

we'll<00:02:55.940> accept<00:02:56.360> those<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:57.050> then<00:02:57.590> we'll<00:02:57.739> add

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
we'll accept those and then we'll add

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.369 
we'll accept those and then we'll add
some<00:02:57.980> smaller<00:02:58.700> Phillips<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.660> represent<00:03:00.170> the

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
some smaller Phillips to represent the

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.380 
some smaller Phillips to represent the
corresponding<00:03:01.190> Phillips<00:03:01.550> on<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.730> inside

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
corresponding Phillips on the inside

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.410 
corresponding Phillips on the inside
surface<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.900> this<00:03:03.680> emboss

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.650 

so<00:03:10.080> now<00:03:10.260> our<00:03:10.440> emboss<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.430> done<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.150> next<00:03:12.180> step

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
so now our emboss is done the next step

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.540 
so now our emboss is done the next step
is<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.960> go<00:03:13.050> ahead<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.440> extract<00:03:13.650> this<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.220> make

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
is to go ahead and extract this and make

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.790 
is to go ahead and extract this and make
this<00:03:14.700> an<00:03:14.850> eye<00:03:14.970> feature

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
this an eye feature

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.770 
this an eye feature
one<00:03:17.460> thing<00:03:17.670> we<00:03:17.760> may<00:03:17.910> want<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.180> do<00:03:18.330> is<00:03:18.450> go<00:03:18.570> ahead

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
one thing we may want to do is go ahead

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.510 
one thing we may want to do is go ahead
and<00:03:18.900> test<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.290> thickness<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.890> make<00:03:20.070> sure<00:03:20.280> that

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
and test the thickness to make sure that

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.550 
and test the thickness to make sure that
this<00:03:20.670> emboss<00:03:21.120> updates<00:03:21.780> correctly<00:03:22.200> should<00:03:22.440> we

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
this emboss updates correctly should we

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.800 
this emboss updates correctly should we
change<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.980> material<00:03:23.400> thickness<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:24.000> I'm

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
change the material thickness and I'm

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.500 
change the material thickness and I'm
going<00:03:25.080> to<00:03:25.110> go<00:03:25.260> ahead<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.970> test<00:03:26.970> for<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.270> with

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
going to go ahead and test for that with

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.080 
going to go ahead and test for that with
the<00:03:27.660> measure<00:03:27.840> tool<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:29.400> can<00:03:29.550> see<00:03:29.790> the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
the measure tool and you can see the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.120 
the measure tool and you can see the
thickness<00:03:30.360> does<00:03:30.810> change<00:03:31.200> correctly<00:03:31.710> so<00:03:32.100> let's

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
thickness does change correctly so let's

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:41.339 
thickness does change correctly so let's
go<00:03:32.400> ahead<00:03:32.490> and<00:03:32.670> get<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:32.910> guy<00:03:32.970> going

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.540 

so<00:03:42.349> now<00:03:42.470> with<00:03:42.620> him<00:03:42.769> done<00:03:42.980> we'll<00:03:43.160> go<00:03:43.250> ahead<00:03:43.459> and

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
so now with him done we'll go ahead and

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.250 
so now with him done we'll go ahead and
reset<00:03:43.849> our<00:03:43.910> thickness

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.589 

go<00:03:47.769> to<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:48.010> manage<00:03:48.310> tab<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:48.849> let's<00:03:49.030> extract

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
go to the manage tab and let's extract

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.080 
go to the manage tab and let's extract
our<00:03:49.840> I<00:03:49.870> feature<00:03:50.400> we'll<00:03:51.400> go<00:03:51.519> ahead<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:51.879> choose

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
our I feature we'll go ahead and choose

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.820 
our I feature we'll go ahead and choose
the<00:03:52.299> features<00:03:52.629> we<00:03:52.780> want<00:03:53.019> either<00:03:53.349> from<00:03:53.739> the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
the features we want either from the

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.400 
the features we want either from the
screen<00:03:54.099> or<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.580> browser

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.260 

make<00:03:58.190> sure<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.370> designate<00:03:58.910> this<00:03:59.060> is<00:03:59.240> a

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
make sure to designate this is a

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.420 
make sure to designate this is a
sheetmetal<00:03:59.630> punch<00:04:00.080> and<00:04:00.440> notice<00:04:01.130> how<00:04:01.280> it

it a face so it can set up its fill it's
that's<00:05:18.979> this<00:05:19.310> opposite<00:05:19.909> face<00:05:20.150> right<00:05:20.449> here

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:22.879 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:26.970 

once<00:05:23.479> that's<00:05:23.689> done

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980

I<00:05:27.070> can<00:05:27.700> go<00:05:27.760> ahead<00:05:27.880> and<00:05:28.120> go<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.270> size<00:05:28.540> and<00:05:28.930> change

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
I can go ahead and go to size and change

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.840 
I can go ahead and go to size and change
the<00:05:29.470> size<00:05:29.680> if<00:05:30.010> I<00:05:30.100> want<00:05:30.310> to<00:05:30.370> make<00:05:30.490> a<00:05:30.520> different

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.130 
the size if I want to make a different
size<00:05:31.500> so<00:05:32.500> let's<00:05:32.530> go<00:05:32.770> ahead<00:05:32.950> and<00:05:33.070> put<00:05:33.190> in<00:05:33.280> a<00:05:33.340> size

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
size so let's go ahead and put in a size

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.290 
size so let's go ahead and put in a size
finish<00:05:35.140> it<00:05:35.290> and<00:05:35.440> in<00:05:36.160> goes<00:05:36.430> my<00:05:36.460> emboss<00:05:36.970> but<00:05:37.240> you

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
finish it and in goes my emboss but you

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.970 
finish it and in goes my emboss but you
can<00:05:37.420> see<00:05:37.570> this<00:05:37.690> is<00:05:37.870> way<00:05:38.230> too<00:05:38.290> big<00:05:38.710> I've

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980
