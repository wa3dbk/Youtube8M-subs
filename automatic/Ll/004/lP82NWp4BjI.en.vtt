and give it a little bit of an
industrial<00:02:38.670> feel<00:02:38.879> I<00:02:39.120> don't<00:02:39.870> want<00:02:40.049> a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
industrial feel I don't want a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.750 
industrial feel I don't want a
specifically<00:02:41.099> a<00:02:41.190> very<00:02:41.430> clean<00:02:41.730> bike<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:43.760> it's

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
specifically a very clean bike and it's

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.050 
specifically a very clean bike and it's
going<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.120> be<00:02:45.769> painted<00:02:46.769> eventually<00:02:47.280> flat

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
going to be painted eventually flat

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.650 
going to be painted eventually flat
black<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:49.099> probably<00:02:50.099> with<00:02:50.370> either<00:02:51.030> silver<00:02:51.629> or

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
black and probably with either silver or

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.199 
black and probably with either silver or
gold<00:02:53.209> nuts<00:02:54.209> bolts<00:02:54.629> put<00:02:55.560> into<00:02:55.829> this<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.250> made<00:02:57.060> two

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
gold nuts bolts put into this I made two

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.539 
gold nuts bolts put into this I made two
of<00:02:57.239> them<00:02:57.480> one<00:02:57.840> for<00:02:57.989> each<00:02:58.049> side<00:02:58.379> so<00:02:59.190> I'm<00:02:59.280> still

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
of them one for each side so I'm still

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.860 
of them one for each side so I'm still
cleaning<00:02:59.790> up<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.150> fender<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.569> I'll<00:03:00.690> put

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
cleaning up the fender and I'll put

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.440 
cleaning up the fender and I'll put
those<00:03:00.989> on<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.950> put<00:03:02.190> everything<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:05.450> the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
those on and put everything in a the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.130 
those on and put everything in a the
code<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.920> flat<00:03:07.920> black<00:03:08.220> eventually<00:03:09.060> that's<00:03:09.989> all

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
code of flat black eventually that's all

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.650 
code of flat black eventually that's all
sieving<00:03:10.440> intention<00:03:10.950> for<00:03:11.159> the<00:03:11.340> rear<00:03:12.239> fender

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
sieving intention for the rear fender

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.229 
sieving intention for the rear fender

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
but I haven't got that far yet so I'll

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.960 
but I haven't got that far yet so I'll

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
carburetor and I show how that's going

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.670 
carburetor and I show how that's going

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
well in the meantime this is how far we

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.240
