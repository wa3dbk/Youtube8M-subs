00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello, comrades, how are you waiting? 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.960
 very well we are here in a top video 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.179
 5 vehicles before starting and as 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.370
 I always repeat this video it's about 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.080
 a personal opinion so if you're not 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.630
 agree with me before giving it to 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.000
 Russians dislike and my dead will carry you 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.250
 I encourage you to leave your particular top 5 of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.560
 vehicles in bates and 4 in the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.119
 comments to rate the vehicles 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.640
 in this top of taken into account two 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.160
 factors the performance of each vehicle 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.080
 in combat and its design fits in 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.000
 that I have distinguished between each 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.610
 model of each country of the same class 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.190
 of vehicles not only for its design but 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.739
 also for its efficiency in combat that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.200
 although some do not know it varies in 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.260
 some small details to keep in mind 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.920
 let's start we start flying in the post 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.230
 5 we have the sub 25 tm from food the fighter 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.239
 of Russian attack as many of you know 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.460
 can do real massacres with the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.590
 attack fighter if no one knocks his 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.660
 armament is very varied from pods 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.760
 the missiles air-ground the missiles of 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.070
 television and even the famous jodan that 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.480
 so much used by expert pilots 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.310
 the attack fighter 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.290
 Can easily adapt to any 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.390
 situation but the weak point are the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.190
 twists rather slow so he has all 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.230
 those of losing against a fighter pilot 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.780
 furtive from the same skill level if 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.000
 for something has highlighted the sub-25 tm from 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.400
 food among all attack fighters is 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.890
 by its design under my point of view is 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.170
 the most beautiful of all is small but 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.270
 bully and another point to highlight is your 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.460
 smaller size to the fighters of 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.010
 attack Chinese and Yankees allowing 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.690
 that his hit box or his area damage him 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.940
 minor therefore is a tad more 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.180
 difficult to tear down we keep talking about 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.310
 aerial vehicles put 4 for the a 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.380
 6 little bird helicopter 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.030
 yang recognition the helicopters of 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.860
 recognition in battlefield always 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.720
 they have been quite chetos for that of 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.270
 that you can take two engineers 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.340
 over repairing something that I would suppress 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.470
 would occupy to a large extent because some 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.480
 Sometimes it becomes impossible to knock it down 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.010
 all this without counting on your armament the 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.710
 which can specialize against 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.320
 terrestrial or aerial targets or even 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.610
 a mixture of the two styles of the two 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.140
 helicopter versions of 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.300
 recognition that there is in the game I have 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.140
 chosen in the h 6 little bird as the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.300
 best of the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.160
 for being visually much more beautiful and 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.440
 especially for being noticeably more 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.720
 small relative to what zeta 11 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.760
 Allows your hit box to be smaller 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.990
 and can make more risky maneuvers 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.270
 for claustrophobic places it could not 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.120
 missing a good tank we arrived at the post 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.160
 3 where we find the t90 there is no 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.410
 a lot to explain, not the tanks are the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.450
 mechanized heart of the infantry and if 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.950
 one knows how to use it wisely they can be 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.410
 a nightmare for the enemy 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.300
 the best thing is that you are a 'hub' or you are a 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.280
 pro you will always have fun with a 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.600
 tank I have chosen the 90's as the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.489
 representative of all tanks 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.230
 heavy for its design I think this 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.150
 most beautiful modern tank of all 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.980
 although if you tell me choose a tank 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.470
 based solely on performance 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.630
 the Chinese type 99 would be the winner 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.310
 while the m1 abrams who is his 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.989
 great blind spot failure in the ass and 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.489
 the Russian t90 has problems of 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.340
 stability and tends to skid 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.950
 too much the Chinese type 99 does not have 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.080
 none of those problems alert 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.780
 attention because we enter the area ope 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.130
 in the over power zone of the game put 2 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.310
 for the attack ship tve 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.260
 the boat as I was not going to be in this 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.240
 podium to remind us by cooler to 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.760
 that is with a weapon that is scary and 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.770
 an amazing resistance to be about 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.780
 a water vehicle the cheetah boat 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.670
 it will always be there until the gnr 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.260
 fein to remind us that we have to 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.640
 use lubricant if we want to 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.200
 violate more carefully 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.300
 this vehicle is so removed that until 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.490
 I dedicate a video here I leave it for you 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.050
 if you want to take a look the only 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.300
 weak point of the chet or brands are the 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.430
 aerial vehicles especially the hunting of 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.590
 attack so if you have to take cas 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.820
 enemy if your air force is a 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.250
 shit 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.020
 you can start praying considered the 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.940
 chj tovar that of uve 15 superior to 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.770
 american model for its design more 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.610
 stylized than the Yankee model and with 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.620
 a smaller heat box like no who 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.660
 I was going to be ranked 1 of this top 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.390
 the god of war the ultimate expression 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.210
 of camper and zaciÃ³n ladies and gentlemen the 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.280
 anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft anti-infantry 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.709
 anti boats anti transport and anti 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.900
 tanks serves for all there has ever been 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.370
 a transited vehicle like this one even 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.860
 after it has been captured by several 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.479
 Sometimes antiaircraft continues to give strength 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.129
 I remember at the beginning of the game when 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.020
 you could attack the enemy base in the 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:31.180
 map of the an kang dam without moving 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.099
 from yours, what's more funnin 'about this 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.620
 vehicle is that it harms the 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:38.469
 V6 shields and tanks 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.870
 heavy thing that has no point 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:42.610
 felt that without counting their missiles 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.560
 of active radar that require the 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.090
 intellect of a potato to know what 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.189
 use them correctly 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.840
 also dedicate a video to this god 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:52.120
 of the war, I leave it here for you 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.979
 you want to see it I recommend it is not 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.020
 with no antero especially both 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.819
 they have their pros and cons while 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.500
 that the Russian version can be turned on 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:01.330
 itself with the caterpillars the version 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.849
 Yankee is faster thanks to having 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.529
 wheels good comrades and this has been 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:07.900
 everything for today I hope you liked it 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:11.500
 the video if so, leave your like to see if 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.080
 we can get to 430 likes difficult but 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.780
 with such handsome comrades sure 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.220
 it will be 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.020
 and do not forget to leave in the 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.720
 comments your particular top 5 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.440
 vehicles a salute comrades and up to the 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.440
 next video 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.520
 by a 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
 7 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.990
 or
