00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.350
 or not 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.860
 ah 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.010
 ah 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.360
 yes 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.190
 my goal was to win today or try not to 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.500
 lose get that first goal and 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.000
 tomorrow when the opponent comes we will be 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.390
 preparations we will start preparing for 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.250
 play I am I am one of those who think 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.340
 that we depend on what we 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.810
 let's really trust my team and 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.060
 we are capable of the best and of 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.060
 the worst is to try to be 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.530
 many times the best as today a 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.300
 team that knew how to suffer did not know 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.280
 handle the party that has suffered that to 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.590
 Sometimes things do not go as you want 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.940
 but we have been able to give you the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.290
 back to the scoreboard 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.120
 they do not know the people who have come and 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.100
 how grateful we are that we 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.380
 have supported because for us it was 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.720
 important with the opportunity to come 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.330
 here to mestalla to play the stadium very 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.300
 great and then it could be done 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.760
 too much empty but but I 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.709
 I think a lot of people have come 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.660
 that has not stopped that is with us and 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.069
 How nice I think the players have 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.260
 felt wrapped up about it has been a 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.090
 difficult and quite long season 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.640
 because, well 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.140
 the era the season was going to be much more 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.390
 ambitious in terms of objectives but 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.629
 I do not have to fight for a final 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.970
 less ambitious goal that is the 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.280
 permanence and good to be in promotion 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.600
 after the last games I think that 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.310
 it is a gift 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.780
 important to win today to go with good 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.220
 inertia with a victory a 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.390
 eliminatory people have turned to 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.370
 we are also the 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.920
 valencia and he thanked us very much 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.390
 because sv these last two goals I 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.390
 thanks to the push of them
