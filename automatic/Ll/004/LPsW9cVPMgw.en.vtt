the<00:02:22.070> comparison<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.549> movie<00:02:24.239> that<00:02:24.360> was

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
the comparison of the movie that was

close

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.100 

so<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:37.050> effect<00:02:37.170> what<00:02:37.830> our<00:02:38.040> vision<00:02:38.519> is<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.870> take

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
so in effect what our vision is to take

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.430 
so in effect what our vision is to take
this<00:02:40.500> technology<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.670> develop<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.390> tool<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.140> a

that<00:02:50.610> statue

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
that statue

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.360 
that statue
something<00:02:52.319> more<00:02:52.440> effective<00:02:52.980> something

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
something more effective something

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.940 
something more effective something
that's<00:02:53.550> closer<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.209> reality<00:02:54.440> then<00:02:55.440> he<00:02:55.860> has

extreme loading for structures this is

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.050 
extreme loading for structures this is
truly<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.709> breakthrough<00:03:43.889> because<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.639> science

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
truly a breakthrough because the science

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.930 
truly a breakthrough because the science
up<00:03:45.209> into<00:03:45.389> this<00:03:45.540> point<00:03:45.810> does<00:03:46.319> not<00:03:46.350> allow<00:03:46.889> for

up into this point does not allow for
those<00:03:47.940> phenomena<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:49.470> what<00:03:49.799> we<00:03:49.920> found

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
those phenomena so what we found

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.640 
those phenomena so what we found
ourselves<00:03:50.340> in<00:03:50.850> is<00:03:51.030> in<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.299> unique<00:03:51.569> position

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
ourselves in is in a unique position
