00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
games I can definitely see why he's got

a<00:02:33.989> great<00:02:34.170> poke<00:02:34.439> check<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.709> always<00:02:35.040> connects

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
a great poke check that always connects

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.160 
a great poke check that always connects
and<00:02:35.609> he's<00:02:35.790> tallied<00:02:36.269> up<00:02:36.389> a<00:02:36.599> countless<00:02:36.989> amount

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
of takeaways on top of that he's got

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.819 
of takeaways on top of that he's got
great<00:02:39.659> discipline<00:02:40.109> and<00:02:40.260> didn't<00:02:40.530> make<00:02:40.650> a

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
great discipline and didn't make a

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.920 
great discipline and didn't make a
single<00:02:41.010> trip<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.609> penalty<00:02:41.939> box<00:02:42.060> but<00:02:42.840> the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
single trip to the penalty box but the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.629 
single trip to the penalty box but the
reason<00:02:43.230> he<00:02:43.260> didn't<00:02:43.739> get<00:02:43.829> a<00:02:43.889> ten<00:02:44.129> out<00:02:44.189> of<00:02:44.250> ten<00:02:44.430> is

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
reason he didn't get a ten out of ten is

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.270 
reason he didn't get a ten out of ten is
because<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.420> his<00:02:45.540> face<00:02:45.840> offs<00:02:46.109> I<00:02:46.469> believe<00:02:47.040> it's

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
because of his face offs I believe it's

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.250 
because of his face offs I believe it's
the<00:02:47.489> one<00:02:47.760> skill<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.359> has<00:02:48.569> been<00:02:48.840> decreased

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
the one skill that has been decreased

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.830 
the one skill that has been decreased
the<00:02:49.409> most<00:02:49.620> since<00:02:49.859> NHL<00:02:50.219> 14<00:02:50.430> last<00:02:51.389> year<00:02:51.569> he<00:02:51.689> was

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
the most since NHL 14 last year he was

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.599 
the most since NHL 14 last year he was
great<00:02:52.109> on<00:02:52.139> the<00:02:52.290> draw<00:02:52.560> but<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:53.159> year<00:02:53.370> he<00:02:53.489> went

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
great on the draw but this year he went

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.240 
great on the draw but this year he went
32<00:02:54.120> for<00:02:54.329> 51<00:02:54.780> giving<00:02:55.379> him<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.590> 63<00:02:56.220> percent

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
32 for 51 giving him a 63 percent

and when he does go down hard he's very
quick<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.819> get<00:05:09.909> back<00:05:10.120> up<00:05:11.460> defensive<00:05:12.460> it's<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.389> 9

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
quick to get back up defensive it's a 9

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.540 
quick to get back up defensive it's a 9
I<00:05:13.900> think<00:05:14.409> Datsik<00:05:14.770> still<00:05:14.979> has<00:05:15.130> the<00:05:15.250> edge<00:05:15.370> on

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
I think Datsik still has the edge on

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.189 
I think Datsik still has the edge on
Virgie<00:05:15.909> when<00:05:16.030> it<00:05:16.150> comes<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:16.509> pure<00:05:16.750> defensive

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
Virgie when it comes to pure defensive

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.409 
Virgie when it comes to pure defensive
ability<00:05:17.650> he<00:05:18.220> intercepted<00:05:18.610> more<00:05:18.849> passes<00:05:19.270> and

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
ability he intercepted more passes and

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.809 
ability he intercepted more passes and
totaled<00:05:19.840> more<00:05:20.020> takeaways<00:05:20.590> however<00:05:21.310> Bergeron

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:21.819 
totaled more takeaways however Bergeron

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.580 
totaled more takeaways however Bergeron
was<00:05:22.030> better<00:05:22.300> on<00:05:22.389> the<00:05:22.539> draw<00:05:22.780> well<00:05:23.319> I<00:05:23.349> don't

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
was better on the draw well I don't

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.200 
was better on the draw well I don't
think<00:05:23.650> he<00:05:23.889> was<00:05:23.979> as<00:05:24.130> good<00:05:24.190> as<00:05:24.370> he<00:05:24.490> was<00:05:24.520> last<00:05:24.909> year

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
think he was as good as he was last year

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.709 
think he was as good as he was last year
he<00:05:25.539> still<00:05:25.840> went<00:05:26.080> 35<00:05:27.009> for<00:05:27.280> 50<00:05:27.610> giving<00:05:27.969> in<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.240> 70

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:28.719 
he still went 35 for 50 giving in a 70

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:30.930 
he still went 35 for 50 giving in a 70

his physical ability is okay it's
nothing<00:06:08.860> special<00:06:09.099> so<00:06:09.460> between<00:06:10.029> the<00:06:10.180> two<00:06:10.210> I

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
nothing special so between the two I

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.990 
nothing special so between the two I
would<00:06:10.630> definitely<00:06:11.139> suggest<00:06:11.380> Datsyuk<00:06:12.279> he's

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
would definitely suggest Datsyuk he's

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.969 
would definitely suggest Datsyuk he's
quicker<00:06:13.270> with<00:06:13.479> the<00:06:13.569> puck<00:06:13.779> he's<00:06:14.199> faster<00:06:14.710> on<00:06:14.860> his

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
quicker with the puck he's faster on his

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.499 
quicker with the puck he's faster on his
skate<00:06:15.250> and<00:06:15.490> I<00:06:15.580> feel<00:06:15.849> like<00:06:16.029> he's<00:06:16.180> the<00:06:16.300> bigger

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:16.509 
skate and I feel like he's the bigger

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.360 
skate and I feel like he's the bigger
threat<00:06:16.750> when<00:06:17.020> he's<00:06:17.139> on<00:06:17.229> the<00:06:17.319> ice<00:06:17.469> but<00:06:18.130> again

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
threat when he's on the ice but again

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.430 
threat when he's on the ice but again
this<00:06:18.550> is<00:06:18.699> just<00:06:18.729> my<00:06:18.909> opinion<00:06:19.180> on<00:06:19.539> it<00:06:19.659> guys<00:06:19.750> these
