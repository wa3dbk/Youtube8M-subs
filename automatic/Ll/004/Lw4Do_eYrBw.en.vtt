window and these are the funny plastic

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.740 
window and these are the funny plastic
clips<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.770> hold<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.190> in<00:01:20.250> place<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.660> not

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
clips that hold it in place so it's not

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.800 
clips that hold it in place so it's not
tacked<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.590> or<00:01:22.830> putty<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.460> anything<00:01:23.810> these

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
tacked in or putty or anything these

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.700 
tacked in or putty or anything these
pieces<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.679> plastic<00:01:27.110> it<00:01:28.110> took<00:01:28.290> about<00:01:28.409> an<00:01:28.619> hour

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
pieces of plastic it took about an hour

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.640 
pieces of plastic it took about an hour
to<00:01:28.920> measure<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.580> glass<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.450> I'm<00:01:30.930> hoping<00:01:31.500> I've

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
to measure the glass and I'm hoping I've

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.590 
to measure the glass and I'm hoping I've
got<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.040> right<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:33.000> really<00:01:33.270> wasn't<00:01:33.450> very

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
got it right it really wasn't very

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.120 
got it right it really wasn't very
obvious<00:01:34.200> what<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.530> were<00:01:34.590> meant<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.860> measure

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
obvious what you were meant to measure

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.880 
obvious what you were meant to measure
so<00:01:36.090> let's<00:01:36.390> find<00:01:36.659> out<00:01:36.900> whether<00:01:37.259> I've<00:01:37.590> made<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
so let's find out whether I've made a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.630 
so let's find out whether I've made a
dog's<00:01:38.130> breakfast<00:01:38.640> or<00:01:38.850> I've<00:01:39.090> done<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> okay<00:01:40.259> I

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.010 

think<00:01:44.640> we'll<00:01:44.850> get<00:01:44.970> rid<00:01:45.150> of<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> broken<00:01:45.720> glass

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
think we'll get rid of the broken glass

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:56.880 
think we'll get rid of the broken glass
first

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.990 

okay<00:01:59.920> this<00:02:00.920> is<00:02:01.159> truly<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:02.090> hideous<00:02:02.780> system<00:02:03.409> and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
okay this is truly a hideous system and

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.139 
okay this is truly a hideous system and
it<00:02:05.000> beat<00:02:05.240> me<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:06.399> managed<00:02:07.399> to<00:02:07.429> get<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.939> nasty

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
it beat me I managed to get the nasty

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.600 
it beat me I managed to get the nasty
pieces<00:02:08.629> of<00:02:08.929> plastic<00:02:09.410> in<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:10.180> unfortunately<00:02:11.500> I

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
pieces of plastic in and unfortunately I

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.539 
pieces of plastic in and unfortunately I
can<00:02:13.610> see<00:02:13.849> daylight<00:02:16.299> too<00:02:17.299> much<00:02:17.540> daylight

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
can see daylight too much daylight

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.460 
can see daylight too much daylight
measured<00:02:19.549> wrong<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.150> it's<00:02:21.049> back<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.379> the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
measured wrong and it's back to the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.860 
measured wrong and it's back to the
drawing<00:02:21.590> board<00:02:22.330> well<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.420> don't<00:02:23.660> feel

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
drawing board well I don't feel

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.900 
drawing board well I don't feel
completely<00:02:24.349> incompetent<00:02:24.739> now<00:02:25.250> because<00:02:25.760> when

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
completely incompetent now because when

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.140 
completely incompetent now because when
I<00:02:25.940> measured<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:26.840> panel<00:02:27.319> was<00:02:27.500> like<00:02:27.709> this

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
I measured it this panel was like this

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.729 
I measured it this panel was like this
in<00:02:29.150> actual<00:02:29.510> fact<00:02:31.660> snap<00:02:32.660> back<00:02:32.959> into<00:02:32.989> place<00:02:33.380> and

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
in actual fact snap back into place and

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:48.610 
in actual fact snap back into place and
that<00:02:40.150> counts<00:02:41.150> for<00:02:41.209> my<00:02:41.510> error<00:02:43.810> okay<00:02:45.849> well<00:02:47.620> so

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
that counts for my error okay well so

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.220 
that counts for my error okay well so
here's<00:02:48.829> my<00:02:49.010> second<00:02:49.430> piece<00:02:49.519> of<00:02:49.579> glass<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.420> got

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
here's my second piece of glass I got

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.440 
here's my second piece of glass I got
really<00:02:51.650> great<00:02:51.829> service<00:02:52.459> from<00:02:52.640> koala<00:02:53.030> at<00:02:53.209> last

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
yeah I a piece of engineering I've ever

00:03:31.500 --> 00:04:00.010 
yeah I a piece of engineering I've ever
come<00:03:31.770> across

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.520

that is the most hideous piece or

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.280 
that is the most hideous piece or
god-awful<00:04:08.970> engineering<00:04:09.970> I've<00:04:10.270> ever<00:04:10.780> clapped

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
god-awful engineering I've ever clapped

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.120 
god-awful engineering I've ever clapped
eyes<00:04:11.530> on<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:14.640> am<00:04:15.640> never<00:04:15.970> going<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:16.389> be<00:04:16.510> it<00:04:16.600> lazier

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130
