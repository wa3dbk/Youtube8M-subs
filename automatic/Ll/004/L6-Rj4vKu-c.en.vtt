00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.980
 christophe a real professional in 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.170
 all the meanings of the word 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.540
 it's a huge chance for the 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.400
 cloakroom for the result on the ice 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.900
 it's a bit of the quiet leader of 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.420
 this team the climb in liga 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.280
 the goal of lhc is no longer a secret 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.500
 and in this quest cristobal huet 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.970
 could play a decisive role in 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.620
 welcoming a malay the experienced 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.350

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.570
 planned in by his arrival a project where 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.470
 I want to hunt nhl this year so 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.829
 it's a bit surprised that it's in 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.540
 league b 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.610
 so I really have expectations either 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.110
 the man of the situation in assets 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.420
 able to make a difference 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.280
 playoffs hired for four years summer 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.320
 last in order to finally make 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.880
 to mount the league team to cheer is 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.670
 aware of club expectations 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.350
 I'm bleeding and yet it's a 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.710
 position where I want date I want 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:22.930
 we 're not there for now 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:25.630
 I hope to help the team and the team 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.630
 thanks to his experience and a cut 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.729
 stanley 290 games played in nhl and a 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.360
 title of Swiss champion with lugano en 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:37.250
 99 brief a liga format keeper 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.350
 we know that they stop first door and 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.510
 then now the defenders get on 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.370
 focused just learning good 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.170
 when there is and then 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.730
 also benefits from its good recovery 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.650
 which is quite exceptional so 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.850
 makes it easier for defenders 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.700
 we almost feel 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.470
 matches he is he is too passive 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.830
 so no for us I do not think so 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.810
 that fishing will not be imposed chris 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.370
 taub and in the series against ajoie the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.560
 porter from Lausanne started to come out 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.050
 the big game especially in a first 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.430
 match won 6 1 by his team in the 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.229
 first eight minutes he made some 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.600
 three decisive stops to finish 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.290
 at lausanne apple our calm and then 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.840
 pass the shoulder 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.760
 and then the second match well we have 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.209
 succeeded in seeing rallying medicine as 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.220
 the fine breads pl us vulnerable 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.440
 remains that evening in ajoie they 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.110
 stop 33 of the 34 shots that are 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.489
 addressed a remarkable statistic that 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.970
 earned him to be voted best player of 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.880
 the part 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.860
 that 's always all that all 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.060
 acquired even before each time it's up to 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.700
 new his new story 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.230
 every game is different and that's it 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.150
 think we must forget tribute 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.579
 today 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.739
 how to think about the next game this 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.659
 year with booing the lhc can feed 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.220
 certain ambitions even though the path 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.220
 towards the promotion is still long
