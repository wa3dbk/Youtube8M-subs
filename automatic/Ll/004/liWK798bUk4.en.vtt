00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.150
 p 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.549
 maybe it can only be produced by the way is that the the pop 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.009
 The experts 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.009
 visibly angry 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.460
 it's about regularity 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.460
 beyond a slump of solid material in this tournament 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:30.050
 the team was regular always stayed among the best in 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.050
 of argentina is the thing good thing more than 500 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.420
 We could not keep there 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.380
 overcoming a lot of weather obstacles throughout the year 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.380
 We all had good times and bad times 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.860
 the good thing that we went back to overcome now we recently saw another is another 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.020
 another slump and we overcome them once again 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.740
 the team recovered as 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.150
 to those four or five parties of navarra madrid and we can finish 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.150
 closing improving the second closing 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.989
 the remains 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.989
 efe 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.160
 I will not accept what it does 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.150
 much more important than this xerez 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.920
 we found ourselves possessed to fight the title 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.010
 one is present 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.940
 the most important thing and it will make it slower 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.820
 to be honest and we have and those things but 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.219
 the other the most important was what allowed us to play after 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.840
 the mind to keep in mind the rivals at the moment rivals world friends 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.080
 the others 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.340
 the other one arrives turimo judo fire against the best Argentine team 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.659
 then within that headquarters 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.120
 the xerez 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.290
 much more 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.950
 most important of states such credits last game was more showy and 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.160
 according to more goals and 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.160
 and that team played better we kept the Basque 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.350
 invite almost all parties 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.410
 they are different times so it seems to me that the other 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.410
 it's much more remarkable for what it puts in front of the previous 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.899
 very well 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.899
 this seems 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:18.400
 not only 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.969
 on the contrary in this year 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.919
 but it was not physical at 0% 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.709
 juridically 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.929
 There are others from 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:30.379
 that a single team on the court 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.379
 but after percent of the championship I do not think 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.339
 I do not think there is 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.539
 at the time he prospered 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.539
 about the relief the smoke fugitives office 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.229
 in the three parties that does not peel us or clearly pro 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:49.509
 was presented 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.879
 will continue with the backbone of a team not very important 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.839
 p 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:57.179
 maybe this year we did not have 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:59.839
 to the scorer that last February 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.109
 what yes 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.689
 joaquin 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.029
 turn the hero without having a streak that started the past 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:09.899
 eto'o fakih 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.429
 another one we will be giving something else 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:14.769
 we did not have the great scorer 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.769
 he says I think I know 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.269
 he split much more then let him 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.199
 in team bull then 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.019
 percent and just that but also how is 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.579
 beyond the result of the accident to 15 consecutive games of the team 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.579
 it worked like p 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.159
 in the senate now for him the Hebrew army 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:38.150
 It seems 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.189
 or the party with colon in santa fe 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.519
 like good 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.269
 because for what we played 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.609
 by how 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.229
 let's be that game for everything that was at stake I think that 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:58.149
 parallel to the bridge mayorga or receipt but I think that at the level it was removed 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:59.999
 the best 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:02.309
 after 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.799
 the tournament 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.079
 at the time of selecting the team also responded well solid 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.230
 dbb 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.009
 ohl -2 we know that we are not an old team 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.279
 Juan and not 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:17.099
 strassera that is very clear 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.479
 it happened now in the last matches but it seems to me that 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.939
 it's not 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:25.960
 what we are, we are a hard team and it seems that 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.909
 oliver has handed out cook 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.860
 He agreed that it was the best of all 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.409
 in that we are a difficult team 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.439
 what rivals do not see as a difficult team 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:39.889
 in all the lines 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.449
 I think of you and me and we are a direct team 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.059
 we are a team that defends itself well 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:50.189
 querol the very clear by the numbers 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.139
 and to take advantage of the moment because sometimes we 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.559
 we do not have that chance 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:59.169
 I said clearly but I think we are a team that did not change its form of 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.069
 play and I want to continue with the fourth game we think you do not like 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.839
 undertake 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:06.259
 we had a moment 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.990
 hard throughout the season and I will always be 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.169
 he recovered 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.930
 the team no no 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.039
 never lost two first leg matches 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.599
 and that also speaks of this the personality of the club to get out of the 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.050
 Bad times 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.059
 keep the good ones 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:23.050
 and try to progress 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.719
 the youngest daughter of the season 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:25.800
 on the whole 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.729
 technical staff 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.319
 percentage I do not know 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.699
 you can not know 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.749
 it is as important the work of Roberto as one of the three played as nothing 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:37.870
 at least 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.870
 in the same group that has the whole world 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.180
 after the world 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.319
 says manuel v 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:57.319
 this Thursday 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.710
 our tastes 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.969
 min the president is difficult 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:09.949
 the companies 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.349
 get rid 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:13.029
 yes
