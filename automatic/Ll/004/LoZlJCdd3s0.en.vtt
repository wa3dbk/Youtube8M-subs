again<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.260> first<00:01:05.410> half<00:01:05.680> of<00:01:05.890> this

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
again and in the first half of this

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.880 
again and in the first half of this
video<00:01:06.520> I<00:01:06.870> slowed<00:01:07.870> it<00:01:08.050> down<00:01:08.280> only<00:01:09.280> because<00:01:10.890> um

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
video I slowed it down only because um

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.000 
video I slowed it down only because um
because<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:14.730> sort<00:01:15.730> of<00:01:15.850> like<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.470> first<00:01:17.710> half

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
because it's sort of like the first half

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.930 
because it's sort of like the first half
was<00:01:18.310> really<00:01:18.970> bad<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.810> it<00:01:20.800> was<00:01:20.860> on<00:01:21.130> an<00:01:21.400> 11

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
was really bad and it was on an 11

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.820 
was really bad and it was on an 11
minute<00:01:22.060> video<00:01:22.480> so<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:23.320> would<00:01:23.440> take<00:01:23.590> really

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
minute video so it would take really

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.640 
minute video so it would take really
long<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.250> process<00:01:24.430> and<00:01:25.120> stuff<00:01:25.390> so<00:01:26.080> I<00:01:26.110> just<00:01:26.320> cut

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
long to process and stuff so I just cut

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.680 
long to process and stuff so I just cut
it<00:01:26.800> down<00:01:26.950> I<00:01:27.370> hope<00:01:27.910> it<00:01:28.030> doesn't<00:01:28.330> bother<00:01:28.450> you

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
the friend code system on the old ds's

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.790 
the friend code system on the old ds's
you<00:04:37.850> used<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.210> have<00:04:38.390> to<00:04:38.630> enter<00:04:39.200> in<00:04:39.350> a<00:04:39.470> friend

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
you used to have to enter in a friend

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.030 
you used to have to enter in a friend
code<00:04:40.010> that<00:04:40.220> was<00:04:40.280> like<00:04:40.430> 12<00:04:40.840> digits<00:04:41.840> long<00:04:42.410> you

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
code that was like 12 digits long you

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.980 
code that was like 12 digits long you
still<00:04:43.340> have<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.670> do<00:04:43.790> this<00:04:44.030> but<00:04:44.270> here's<00:04:44.810> where

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
still have to do this but here's where

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.020 
still have to do this but here's where
the<00:04:45.170> cool<00:04:45.530> part<00:04:45.800> comes<00:04:46.040> in<00:04:46.190> you<00:04:46.640> only<00:04:46.820> have<00:04:47.000> to

the cool part comes in you only have to

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.030 
the cool part comes in you only have to
enter<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.510> once<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:48.050> it's<00:04:48.260> like<00:04:48.410> for<00:04:48.830> all

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
enter it once and it's like for all

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.090

that should have been a double but
anyway<00:04:58.520> um<00:04:59.620> instead<00:05:00.620> of<00:05:00.650> having<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:01.070> enter<00:05:01.640> in

owned to have a friend on that game it's

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.030 
owned to have a friend on that game it's
universal<00:05:08.810> so<00:05:08.990> you<00:05:09.050> can<00:05:09.290> do<00:05:09.410> it<00:05:09.530> from<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:09.860> home

a<00:05:17.720> portable<00:05:18.140> system<00:05:18.800> I<00:05:18.980> don't<00:05:19.850> think<00:05:19.880> PSP<00:05:20.510> to

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
a portable system I don't think PSP to

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.170 
a portable system I don't think PSP to
do<00:05:21.890> that<00:05:22.160> it's<00:05:22.880> pretty<00:05:23.210> unlikely<00:05:23.480> um<00:05:24.310> it's<00:05:25.310> 3d

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
do that it's pretty unlikely um it's 3d

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.750 
do that it's pretty unlikely um it's 3d
that's<00:05:26.570> sort<00:05:26.900> of<00:05:26.990> a<00:05:27.050> gimmick<00:05:27.710> for<00:05:27.740> me<00:05:28.070> but<00:05:28.310> it

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
that's sort of a gimmick for me but it

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.580 
that's sort of a gimmick for me but it
does<00:05:29.030> seem<00:05:29.270> pretty<00:05:29.330> cool<00:05:29.810> i'll<00:05:30.080> have<00:05:30.230> to<00:05:30.410> see

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
does seem pretty cool i'll have to see

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.970 
does seem pretty cool i'll have to see
it<00:05:30.650> in<00:05:31.300> with<00:05:32.300> my<00:05:32.330> own<00:05:32.630> eyes<00:05:32.810> to<00:05:33.440> believe<00:05:33.830> it

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
it in with my own eyes to believe it

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.040 
it in with my own eyes to believe it
well<00:05:34.520> i<00:05:34.730> believe<00:05:34.850> it<00:05:35.330> but<00:05:35.480> i<00:05:35.510> mean<00:05:35.720> like<00:05:35.780> i

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
well i believe it but i mean like i

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.530 
well i believe it but i mean like i
don't<00:05:36.770> even<00:05:36.830> know<00:05:37.010> if<00:05:37.220> it's<00:05:37.370> that<00:05:37.730> cool<00:05:38.630> but<00:05:39.500> um

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
don't even know if it's that cool but um

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.600 
don't even know if it's that cool but um
the<00:05:41.540> 3d<00:05:42.080> I<00:05:42.790> mean<00:05:43.870> it's<00:05:44.870> pretty<00:05:45.200> cool<00:05:45.470> and<00:05:45.800> I

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
the 3d I mean it's pretty cool and I

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.480 
the 3d I mean it's pretty cool and I
would<00:05:47.390> still<00:05:47.750> get<00:05:47.960> the<00:05:48.170> 3ds<00:05:48.590> even<00:05:49.100> if<00:05:49.220> it<00:05:49.370> was

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
would still get the 3ds even if it was

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.450 
would still get the 3ds even if it was
in<00:05:49.640> 2d<00:05:50.000> but<00:05:50.600> what's<00:05:51.260> the<00:05:51.470> cool<00:05:51.680> thing<00:05:51.950> is<00:05:51.980> it's

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
in 2d but what's the cool thing is it's

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.250 
in 2d but what's the cool thing is it's
not<00:05:52.640> always<00:05:52.970> in<00:05:53.240> 3d<00:05:53.570> so<00:05:53.750> it's<00:05:53.900> not<00:05:54.020> going<00:05:54.200> to

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
not always in 3d so it's not going to

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.960 
not always in 3d so it's not going to
like<00:05:54.410> hurt<00:05:54.620> your<00:05:54.800> eyes<00:05:54.950> or<00:05:55.160> anything<00:05:55.520> and

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
like hurt your eyes or anything and

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.940 
like hurt your eyes or anything and
people<00:05:56.120> are<00:05:56.390> freaking<00:05:56.900> out<00:05:57.050> about<00:05:57.290> the<00:05:57.560> 3d

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
people are freaking out about the 3d

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.640 
people are freaking out about the 3d
warnings<00:05:58.760> they<00:05:59.540> said<00:05:59.780> the<00:05:59.960> same<00:06:00.230> thing<00:06:00.620> about
