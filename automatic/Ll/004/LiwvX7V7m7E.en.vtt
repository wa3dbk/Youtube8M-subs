device as well so it's just kind of like
a<00:01:30.060> paint<00:01:30.299> program<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.840> you're<00:01:30.960> telling<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
a paint program but you're telling it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.929 
a paint program but you're telling it
what<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> create<00:01:32.280> based<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> type<00:01:32.909> of

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
what to create based on the type of

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.120 
what to create based on the type of
brush<00:01:33.240> you're<00:01:33.390> selecting<00:01:33.780> yeah<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.680> um<00:01:34.890> I

okay now show us how you kind of create

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.140 
okay now show us how you kind of create
some<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.829> dynamic<00:03:06.250> of<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.489> character<00:03:06.879> and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
some of the dynamic of the character and

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.300 
some of the dynamic of the character and
whatnot<00:03:07.390> so<00:03:07.569> this<00:03:07.989> this<00:03:08.319> how<00:03:08.530> we<00:03:08.590> control<00:03:09.010> the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
whatnot so this this how we control the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.860 
whatnot so this this how we control the
brain<00:03:09.519> this<00:03:09.730> our<00:03:09.940> brain<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> lot<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.720> our

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
brain this our brain so a lot of our

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.809 
brain this our brain so a lot of our
objects<00:03:11.290> have<00:03:11.530> what<00:03:11.799> we<00:03:11.890> call<00:03:12.040> default<00:03:12.519> brains

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
objects have what we call default brains

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.580 
objects have what we call default brains
this<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.180> one<00:03:13.299> of<00:03:13.329> them<00:03:13.480> here<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:13.930> right<00:03:14.560> now

you can kind of follow our logic so when

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.020 
you can kind of follow our logic so when
do<00:03:16.329> logic<00:03:16.599> so<00:03:16.900> when<00:03:17.139> a<00:03:17.349> espresso<00:03:17.680> do<00:03:18.069> jump<00:03:18.370> when

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030

your<00:04:56.040> game<00:04:56.370> using<00:04:56.790> the<00:04:56.880> Kinect<00:04:57.120> ok<00:04:57.750> now

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
your game using the Kinect ok now

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.180 
your game using the Kinect ok now
another<00:04:57.930> question<00:04:58.530> here<00:04:58.740> obviously<00:04:58.920> you're

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
another question here obviously you're

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.300 
another question here obviously you're
demoing<00:04:59.460> this<00:04:59.730> on<00:04:59.910> 8.1<00:05:00.720> right<00:05:00.870> now<00:05:00.990> ok<00:05:01.710> you

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
demoing this on 8.1 right now ok you

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.620 
demoing this on 8.1 right now ok you
mentioned<00:05:02.610> Xbox<00:05:03.060> one<00:05:03.240> so<00:05:03.390> how<00:05:03.480> do<00:05:03.540> they

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
mentioned Xbox one so how do they

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.660 
mentioned Xbox one so how do they
interact<00:05:03.660> so<00:05:04.500> it's<00:05:04.710> a<00:05:04.800> cross<00:05:04.980> platform<00:05:05.160> game

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
interact so it's a cross platform game

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.160 
interact so it's a cross platform game
so<00:05:05.880> you<00:05:05.940> can<00:05:06.120> start<00:05:06.300> creating<00:05:06.480> on<00:05:06.750> one<00:05:06.930> device

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
so you can start creating on one device

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.900 
so you can start creating on one device
and<00:05:07.440> finish<00:05:07.680> creating<00:05:07.950> on<00:05:08.070> another<00:05:08.310> device<00:05:08.430> or

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
and finish creating on another device or

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.220 
and finish creating on another device or
you<00:05:09.060> can<00:05:09.180> create<00:05:09.360> on<00:05:09.540> one<00:05:09.720> device<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.140> your
