wanted<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.729> have<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.940> all<00:02:09.000> metal<00:02:09.300> then

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
wanted to have it all metal then

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.080 
wanted to have it all metal then
obviously<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.170> do<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.470> one

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
obviously I do that one

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.119 
obviously I do that one
but<00:02:11.390> think<00:02:11.569> this<00:02:11.660> looks<00:02:11.840> pretty<00:02:11.930> cool<00:02:12.170> there

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
but think this looks pretty cool there

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.309 
but think this looks pretty cool there
is<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.280> trick<00:02:13.730> with<00:02:13.970> Mahima<00:02:14.330> gates<00:02:14.690> as<00:02:14.900> well<00:02:15.110> if

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
is a trick with Mahima gates as well if

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.170 
is a trick with Mahima gates as well if
you<00:02:15.410> did<00:02:15.560> not<00:02:15.709> know<00:02:15.980> if<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.430> open<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.910> right

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
you did not know if you open the right

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.070 
you did not know if you open the right
door<00:02:17.239> you<00:02:17.900> click<00:02:18.080> on<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.319> right<00:02:18.470> door<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:20.780> will

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
door you click on the right door it will

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.640 
door you click on the right door it will
it<00:02:21.950> will<00:02:22.099> close<00:02:22.340> or<00:02:22.910> open<00:02:23.000> outwards<00:02:23.629> if<00:02:23.989> you

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
it will close or open outwards if you

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.050 
it will close or open outwards if you
click<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.160> left<00:02:25.400> door<00:02:25.580> it<00:02:25.760> should<00:02:25.910> open

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
click on the left door it should open

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.699 
click on the left door it should open
inwards<00:02:26.569> I<00:02:26.660> mean<00:02:26.810> try<00:02:27.050> this<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.379> make<00:02:27.470> sure<00:02:27.500> it

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
inwards I mean try this and make sure it

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.640 
inwards I mean try this and make sure it
works<00:02:27.799> properly<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.640> know<00:02:29.239> just<00:02:30.019> kidding<00:02:30.319> it

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
works properly I know just kidding it

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.920 
works properly I know just kidding it
does<00:02:30.860> both<00:02:31.099> it's<00:02:31.670> not<00:02:31.910> doing<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.299> it's<00:02:32.629> great

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
does both it's not doing it it's great

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.890 
does both it's not doing it it's great
so<00:02:33.920> with<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.790> other<00:02:34.940> gate<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.480> would<00:02:35.599> do<00:02:35.750> that

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
so with the other gate it would do that

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.720 
so with the other gate it would do that
so<00:02:35.959> if<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.290> clicked<00:02:36.530> on<00:02:36.590> one<00:02:36.860> you'd<00:02:37.129> go<00:02:37.280> in<00:02:37.489> if

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
so if you clicked on one you'd go in if

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.100 
so if you clicked on one you'd go in if
you<00:02:37.790> could<00:02:37.940> put<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.120> on<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.269> other<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.750> go<00:02:38.870> out

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
you could put it on the other and go out

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.050 
you could put it on the other and go out
and<00:02:39.860> weird<00:02:40.250> that's<00:02:40.400> not<00:02:40.580> doing<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:40.879> for<00:02:40.970> this

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
and weird that's not doing it for this

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.170 
and weird that's not doing it for this
one<00:02:41.560> but<00:02:42.560> oh<00:02:42.590> well<00:02:42.830> I<00:02:43.160> think<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.819> just<00:02:43.910> has<00:02:44.090> the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
one but oh well I think it just has the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.819 
one but oh well I think it just has the
same<00:02:44.360> mechanics<00:02:44.810> as<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.989> regular<00:02:45.349> stone<00:02:45.620> gate

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
same mechanics as a regular stone gate

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.930 
same mechanics as a regular stone gate
but<00:02:46.160> yeah<00:02:46.970> might<00:02:47.239> as<00:02:47.299> well<00:02:47.420> try<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.690> out<00:02:48.940> but

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
but yeah might as well try it out but

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.059 
but yeah might as well try it out but
definitely<00:02:50.840> really<00:02:51.019> cool<00:02:51.049> definitely<00:02:51.620> really

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
definitely really cool definitely really

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.289 
definitely really cool definitely really
handy<00:02:52.400> when<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:52.610> have<00:02:52.760> these<00:02:52.910> big<00:02:53.120> old

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
handy when you have these big old

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.880 
handy when you have these big old
dinosaurs<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:53.989> need<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.200> get<00:02:54.319> in<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.590> out<00:02:54.680> of

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
dinosaurs you need to get in and out of

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.420 
dinosaurs you need to get in and out of
your<00:02:55.040> base<00:02:55.569> yeah<00:02:56.650> so<00:02:57.650> that's<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.099> for<00:02:58.370> this

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
your base yeah so that's it for this

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.339 
your base yeah so that's it for this
video<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:59.000> hope<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.329> guys<00:02:59.510> enjoyed<00:03:00.049> this

video I hope you guys enjoyed this

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.030 
video I hope you guys enjoyed this
gigantic<00:03:01.280> behemoth<00:03:02.269> gate<00:03:02.480> it's<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.530> big<00:03:03.799> and

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
gigantic behemoth gate it's so big and

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.680 
gigantic behemoth gate it's so big and
Wow

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
Wow

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.720

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
it looks really cool I did I think I did

it looks really cool I did I think I did
a<00:03:07.760> really<00:03:07.940> good<00:03:08.120> job<00:03:08.180> placing<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:09.049> I<00:03:09.799> had<00:03:10.700> to

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
a really good job placing it I had to

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.490 
a really good job placing it I had to
destroy<00:03:10.970> a<00:03:11.090> lot<00:03:11.390> of<00:03:11.569> walls<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.930> place<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.319> but

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
destroy a lot of walls to place it but

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.309 
destroy a lot of walls to place it but
it<00:03:12.860> was<00:03:13.010> worth<00:03:13.129> it<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:13.640> it's<00:03:13.760> worth<00:03:14.230> thank<00:03:15.230> you

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
have a good time you know crafting these

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.349 
have a good time you know crafting these
guys<00:03:21.079> and<00:03:21.410> placing<00:03:21.709> them<00:03:21.859> in<00:03:21.980> your<00:03:22.130> base<00:03:22.359> there

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
guys and placing them in your base there

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:24.610 
guys and placing them in your base there
are<00:03:23.480> other<00:03:23.660> bases<00:03:24.049> on<00:03:24.139> the<00:03:24.170> server<00:03:24.470> that

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
are other bases on the server that

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.199 
are other bases on the server that
actually<00:03:24.920> have<00:03:25.040> nothing<00:03:25.220> but<00:03:25.519> behemoth<00:03:26.000> gates

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
actually have nothing but behemoth gates

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.699 
actually have nothing but behemoth gates
just<00:03:26.569> so<00:03:26.780> that<00:03:26.989> they<00:03:27.139> don't<00:03:27.260> have<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.560> worry

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
just so that they don't have to worry

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.979 
just so that they don't have to worry
about<00:03:27.769> walls<00:03:28.130> at<00:03:28.370> all<00:03:28.549> so<00:03:28.970> it's<00:03:29.480> a<00:03:29.569> really<00:03:29.870> kind

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
about walls at all so it's a really kind

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.199 
about walls at all so it's a really kind
of<00:03:30.079> cool<00:03:30.260> idea<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.769> it<00:03:30.859> kind<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.519> allows<00:03:31.940> for

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
of cool idea and it kind of allows for

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.780 
of cool idea and it kind of allows for
an<00:03:32.299> easier<00:03:32.690> build<00:03:32.989> but<00:03:33.340> at<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.489> other<00:03:34.519> day

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
an easier build but at the other day

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.979 
an easier build but at the other day
it's<00:03:34.940> very<00:03:35.239> costly<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:36.079> build<00:03:36.680> all<00:03:36.829> this<00:03:37.010> but

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
it's very costly to build all this but

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.839 
it's very costly to build all this but
whatever<00:03:38.989> whatever<00:03:39.290> floats<00:03:39.620> your<00:03:39.739> boat

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
whatever whatever floats your boat

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.220 
whatever whatever floats your boat
anyways<00:03:40.849> that's<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.299> for<00:03:41.450> this<00:03:41.690> video<00:03:41.959> have<00:03:42.169> a

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
anyways that's it for this video have a

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.259 
anyways that's it for this video have a
good<00:03:42.319> day<00:03:42.470> thank<00:03:42.739> you<00:03:42.769> so<00:03:42.950> much<00:03:43.099> please<00:03:43.880> like
