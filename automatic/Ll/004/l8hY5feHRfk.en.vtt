 the clerical mesmer of which comes Clinton the character interpreted by that afflict 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.390
 my movies 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.210
 I'll shop does not do much of your world trunk and assumes the user already 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.210

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.520
 very 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.920
 the mechanics of the typical team of action games in third person and who does not 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.450
 fights your opponents with potent weak and long range attacks 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.650
 some special skills are in the air to give some variety and are 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.690
 necessary to kill certain types of enemies 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.260
 combat the best feature of the game that offers several types of 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.689
 get doctors all ready to congratulate the hero 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.370
 but even there I owe light and in the presence it seems that they do not escape 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.910
 a more critical eye 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.110
 such as the militia system that are at risk that insist on leaving the player in the 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.140
 hand when there are several henchmen on the screen 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.980
 the problem is accentuated by the camera that moves alone 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.430
 vision is impaired when the kingdom is in tight places or practicing 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.760
 his acrobatic skills 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.360
 virtual walls is such a difficult task while 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.360
 a new operating system 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.050
 part of the game that should be simple 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.020
 like jumping platforms become a martyrdom due to the camera 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:28.080
 but also of other weaker famous ones 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.080
 light motorcycles is to perennize the daspu 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:36.009
 however these sessions of the game are so predictable and ended up being a 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:37.909
 little forgotten proposal 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.240
 the player follows by huge stones 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.100
 and should avoid obstacles to one of the groups 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.510
 and other maneuvers as simple as walking from left to right 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.999
 these alliances races are pending this desire to turn off the 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.999
 video here 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.929
 what saved evolutionary throne is the multiply mode 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:04.890
 up to 10 people fight sands 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:05.930
 that make good use 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.119
 the use of the characters' abilities and vehicles 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:12.699
 players can jump and summon their most out with the 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.009
 at the touch of a button 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:16.419
 civic movement 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:17.669
 is not exploited 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.699
 one player campaign 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:23.100
 the camera mirror guitar playing the third person games 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.469
 attack with dudu and trauma 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:29.279
 if producers had paid more attention to key elements such as 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:29.859
 that 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.050
 tron evolution 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.769
 it would be a very good game 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.950
 The way it's annoying, it can not do simple things. 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.560
 how to jump between platforms 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.809
 I'll focus on the attacks on an opponent 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:47.219
 the worst of it is to see which quoted the greatest icon of so much service rendered 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:48.899
 listing 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:50.679
 the related teachers 

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:53.589
 the best for fans of the franchise and stick with the movies 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:56.369
 works of infinitely superior quality 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:57.999
 then there's a finish
