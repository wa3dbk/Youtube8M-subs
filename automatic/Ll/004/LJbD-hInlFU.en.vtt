00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.980
 sweet I am here with my today 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.740
 read month for the month of june 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.750
 I have this 100 1400 230 pages 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.410
 once again not too much 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.960
 a lot was 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.920
 but it does make almost 50 pages 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.800
 per day 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.269
 and if you hear it that sounds like that 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.700
 actually not that bad 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.579
 I'm in favor of me for 50 pages 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.050
 always about one hour need 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.719
 it is okay I think so one 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.090
 One hour a day reading started 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.390
 month with red like the sea of ​​maggie 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.110
 stepfather and from this book I have 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.239
 70 pages read 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.850
 I found the beginning actually quite good 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.440
 but somehow it does not have me like that yet 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.770
 cast a spell but I believe 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.320
 I definitely find water 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:04.799
 like the after summer brings the light 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.110
 in your eyes trilogy and yes so far 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.700
 is not bad but i had 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.180
 in between then either always 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.570
 I'm looking for another book and yes then 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.070
 I read this book here 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.130
 of gray from james or james as well 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.840
 This book always has over 600 pages 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.720
 and got two stars from me 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.930
 I did not have any rizzi turns 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.930
 yet or 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.710
 I do not think so either because 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:45.119
 that would be so negative book 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.740
 and yes that would not be so you 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.899
 some of you probably wonder 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.600
 you still why two stars 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.880
 First, I think the cover is not 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.490
 all over 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.670
 I like that a lot and I like it 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.220
 Also this match a bit so 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.230
 I think so 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.330
 kinda cool and the second star goes 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.509
 The beginning of the book actually gives way 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.150
 not at all bad but found it then 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:20.260
 this disturbed christian came into play 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.790
 it was somehow too colorful and anna me 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.150
 has somehow not to 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.160
 positive changes then I have this 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.250
 wonderful book here I official 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.800
 four and a half stars have given why 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.990
 the half star deduction I know it too 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.870
 not exactly because it was 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.930
 book very very good but i think so 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.320
 that was somehow because that is now 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.780
 I'm not so spellbound by 1000 percent 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.670
 so it has somehow pulled it 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.440
 was not that I am almost addicted 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.190
 after the book became like that now 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.990
 example was body princess or something 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.650
 and with another book I'll be the same 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.940
 in the video mention but year 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.280
 four and a half stars are already 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.989
 pretty good that will be nine 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.459
 of ten stars and yes I wanted now 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.030
 I also believe a bock day 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.890
 rotate 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.360
 I do not know if that is still true 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.480
 has a lot of sense because I do not already 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.040
 know more the details and it was 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.140
 very good and I can 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.420
 The only one to recommend the two 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.269
 by the way were project on books books 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.850
 I've broken just like 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.239
 this is a project hamburgs book 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.060
 was 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:35.140
 I have read exactly 200 pages of it 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.940
 and I had it on before 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.860
 actually started under, I thought 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.900
 I somehow had 20 pages like this 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.019
 but I am now on page 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.820
 2 100 and I had it all already 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.910
 I read, I was somehow still 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.130
 farther than now and it pulls me 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.140
 somehow this time not so in 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.750
 the spell so it was probably the last 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.090
 not so in the language that is 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.610
 Although great that you are so different 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.410
 finds stories as to 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.650
 for example everything in wonderland or something 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.900
 others 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.670
 I have seen the year as a criticism 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.540
 I think that's cool, if you like 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.180
 but other stories find that again 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.030
 unfortunately still does not draw me like that 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.549
 really in his spell and let's see 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.380
 I will as someday sometime 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.960
 especially because I already finish 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.259
 somehow stand this between band ii 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.600
 and have a pity if I could find 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:32.270
 but then would not continue 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.070
 yes let's see you can tell me yes 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.380
 the row in schwalbacher value after the 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.940
 first or even today 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.970
 after two with his maybe already 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.530
 gets better even though I have got 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.990
 probably up to 300 then up 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.120
 actually read because the actual 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:53.030
 part has somehow I think with 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:57.530
 300 pages or so this one has 5 609 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.300
 500 almost and then a book that 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.280
 I really did not have to mention 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.770
 more than 1000 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.900
 I read it on you the 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.820
 you 've seen this last month and 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.949
 I have three pages out of this 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:15.169
 book read here, yes we do not talk 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.240
 over it then a book I in 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.669
 bought hamburg and that is the 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.610
 the first part of the vampires academy me 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:26.030
 I have 62 so far from this book 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:30.080
 but still can not find it 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.669
 so great but yes as I said 62 pages 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.729
 you can not decide much yet 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.760
 Although it could be like the sea 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:40.280
 but somehow but that many 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.990
 he would have to find this series so great 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.909
 probably something else will come for me 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.210
 somehow I find it funny 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:51.949
 that all have such Russian names 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:54.770
 but yes let's see and then a book 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.449
 that's why not everyone else was lying 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.050
 to let 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.699
 at the latest when the second came silver 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.050
 book of dreams i just had to 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:09.380
 start immediately 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:13.130
 and yesterday yesterday was just grid 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.880
 June and until the day I was up 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.550
 page 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.070
 108 I have 108 pages in one day 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:22.190
 read what is really much for me 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:25.310
 But you always have to keep these books 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.980
 devour and now I am so here 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:33.350
 So I'm on my way, I think 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:36.860
 page 300 289 and I'll probably be one 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:39.590
 quit feather today or tomorrow because of it 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.420
 is just so good again but so far 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.280
 I still think part 1 is best 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.640
 a lot have written to me they found 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.070
 this one better than part one but 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:52.610
 who knows what else is coming so many 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.890
 but I do not know yet and yes 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.800
 are then the books of my this 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.990
 month june let's see how july like that 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.090
 Will I finally do it all? 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.370
 somehow quit books 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:09.350
 or will I have five more 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:12.230
 at the beginning yes, but at the moment I am easy 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.810
 in such a phase in the me if I 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:18.020
 starting a book is simply essential 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.780
 want to read on and in one piece 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:24.320
 just want to read and hope 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:29.210
 Not so many books and I say so 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:31.040
 then the reason if you have more 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.560
 such books knows then tell me 

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.790
 times describes 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:38.030
 maybe I have one or the other 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:42.110
 nor me he or she just has up 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:44.360
 my good as last after and 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:47.360
 recommends me books if he wants 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.780
 yes my twitter account is like 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.820
 always said in the infobox and me 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.000
 I'm always happy about new people 

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.890
 want me 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.530
 that was it also of me I wish 

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:03.640
 Have a wonderful day and see you 

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.640
 next time you live
