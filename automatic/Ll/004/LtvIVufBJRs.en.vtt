00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.540
 How about friends of people beta mexico 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.170
 today's video I want to show you how 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.180
 increase the level of the water column 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.730
 of a 4 day bet 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.730
 yesterday I pulled out the male yesterday 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.430
 the male we have to take as 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.710
 let's see that the fry are from this 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.949
 way since they swim horizontally 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.490
 as we know for the first two days 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.640
 until the third day they feed on the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.659
 energy reserve of your yolk sac 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.210
 already after they absorb it they lose 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.760
 that large amount of weight that for them 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.980
 they are not allowed to swim like this 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.680
 horizontally 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.680
 this is a 44 day bet 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:37.510
 we see the water level that is already very 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:42.100
 low are four fingers more or less 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:46.720
 and because the heater is that it 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.270
 has evaporated part of the water then what 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.910
 what I'm going to do is just raise the level 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.560
 from the fish tank where I have them from 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:58.600
 in the small 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:04.180
 so to increase a little 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:07.330
 oxygen and apart you can improve a 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.210
 little water quality so that 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.420
 develop faster 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.970
 as we know, until the week is that 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.460
 they should be changed to one more space 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:25.330
 big to a fish tank or aquarium 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.330
 with greater capacity but meanwhile 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:35.890
 there I am adding a drop for 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.000
 that is a small amount I do not add 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.080
 completely 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.740
 or directly the water but with the 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.880
 help from 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:51.110
 an eclosion deco that well washed or other 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.480
 that we can manufacture for this use 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.209
 specifically 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.870
 then we put it in the part in a 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.870
 high part 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.230
 and we open the key 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.410
 a little bit so that it's falling off 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.430
 from little to little water 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.540
 we do it this way so as not to cause 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.540
 thermal shock 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.690
 and not cause the death of the fry 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.359
 in this case the water is falling up 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.150
 of the almond leaf that 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.819
 it worked as a nest 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.329
 and by the water temperature of the 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.730
 small tank of this fish tank and that of the 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.730
 water from here outside I have it at 30 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.480
 degrees alone 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.220
 then it costs 20 degrees if 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.000
 we add this water 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.340
 directly to the aquarium as 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.310
 we would cause a shock the shock ends 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.410
 thermal that I commented to them and 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.180
 would cause the death of the fish of 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.739
 the fry in this case 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:09.760
 so this is an idea of how 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:11.340
 increase the water column and not 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.640
 do not 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.220
 as it is said to affect the parameter of the 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.070
 temperature but the water will be 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.930
 constant 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:26.410
 the temperature and it will not affect the 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.410
 fry 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.900
 there are some there are some 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:37.569
 small fry of 4 10 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.270
 from a scholarship bet 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.670
 and then I took it there and I told them 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.810
 first food of 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.810
 confused god 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.009
 aizega a piece of lettuce also 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.409
 stay 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:56.820
 and it is already morning and they 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:59.390
 businesswoman to see some art 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.330
 good friends this is a 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:06.250
 a little advice I hope to help you and a 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.250
 greeting to all thanks
