00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.980
 well here we are at the top of the m 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.690
 once again second time my first time 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.870
 cristian cristian greetings in the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.070
 camera 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:24.070
 He beat those fears because he was already 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.600
 I was staying like the ones from there already 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.760
 Carmen 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.310
 and they did not want to pass for this side 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.840
 because there is a part 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.990
 in this part 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.390
 a rock 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.230
 give to the fly 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.230
 but good 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:48.870
 There is nothing left to say but one more time 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.890
 satisfied 100% 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.640
 that this is what removes fatigue 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.640
 to admire 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.570
 the teak 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.570
 for the other 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.820
 when you look away at a cross 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:22.230
 it's again in christian taking camera 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.230
 an arrow that survived life 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.090
 was his companion then the way 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.090
 on the hill of the mitres 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.290
 we already know the last time 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.240
 I was serious 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.900
 a video here in the m I said that I would go 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.900
 to the goals of beak perico and pico 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.900
 pyramid 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.680
 and he should be clear monterrey 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.680
 on the one hand down there 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.980
 in the hill of the chair true what 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.280
 We fail to see but right now and that 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.280
 plug 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.170
 until the cross that marks the summit 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.170
 of the has 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.710
 2000 something of 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.150
 m 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.150
 above sea level 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.030
 a 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.110
 but for more videos that see if the 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.840

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.510
 tomÃ¡s point you did not come 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.510
 to the other 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.880
 another part can work working 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.040
 and we call down because 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.670
 there you see the clouds what 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.670
 hopefully 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.750
 I wish we did not grow up 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.890
 also ropes 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.890
 I love you mama 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.140

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.570
 but he arrived in Christian 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.570
 the water is 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.490

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.480

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.080

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.820

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.640
 with a degree 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.190
 is where they thought I say if it's half 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.440
 laborious but not impossible I say already 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.160
