cooks<00:01:10.280> on<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.670> grill<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.149> then<00:01:11.630> they<00:01:11.750> put<00:01:11.960> a

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
cooks on the grill and then they put a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.029 
cooks on the grill and then they put a
little<00:01:12.080> dab<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:16.000> oil<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:17.300> that<00:01:18.259> will<00:01:18.590> help<00:01:18.770> the

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
little dab of oil and that will help the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.410 
little dab of oil and that will help the
spice<00:01:19.670> absorb<00:01:20.409> into<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.530> meat<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:21.920> also<00:01:22.420> it

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
spice absorb into the meat and also it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.880 
spice absorb into the meat and also it
won't<00:01:23.630> stick<00:01:23.810> on<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.020> grill<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.530> has<00:01:24.680> dual

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
won't stick on the grill so it has dual

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.160 
won't stick on the grill so it has dual
purpose<00:01:25.250> I'll<00:01:26.210> put<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.479> little<00:01:26.600> salt<00:01:26.930> on<00:01:27.140> that

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
purpose I'll put a little salt on that

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.469 
purpose I'll put a little salt on that
because<00:01:27.500> I<00:01:27.710> know<00:01:27.770> that<00:01:28.070> that<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:29.119> makes<00:01:29.390> you

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
because I know that that that makes you

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:30.760 
because I know that that that makes you
doesn't<00:01:29.750> have<00:01:29.869> salt<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.320> I'm<00:01:30.409> going<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.560> solve

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
doesn't have salt and I'm going to solve

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.800 
doesn't have salt and I'm going to solve
both<00:01:31.009> sides<00:01:31.310> with<00:01:31.580> an<00:01:31.640> icy<00:01:31.970> salt<00:01:34.720> then<00:01:35.720> I'm

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
both sides with an icy salt then I'm

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.480 
both sides with an icy salt then I'm
going<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.020> place<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:36.229> on<00:01:36.470> a<00:01:36.530> hot<00:01:36.799> grill<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:37.310> lamb
