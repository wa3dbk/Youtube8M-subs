00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
demonstrate where the blues notes would

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.020 
demonstrate where the blues notes would
fall<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> minor<00:01:04.080> pentatonic<00:01:04.880> you<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
fall in the minor pentatonic you get a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.940 
fall in the minor pentatonic you get a
blues<00:01:06.330> note<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.260> flatted<00:01:08.250> 5th<00:01:08.580> note

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.800 

and<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.370> major<00:01:14.580> pentatonic<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.540> can<00:01:15.690> add

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and in the major pentatonic you can add

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.180 
and in the major pentatonic you can add
a<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.170> minor<00:01:16.620> third<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.730> that<00:01:17.910> scale<00:01:21.860> to<00:01:22.860> give<00:01:23.040> it

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
a a minor third to that scale to give it

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.010 
a a minor third to that scale to give it
a<00:01:23.310> bluesier<00:01:23.790> sound<00:01:25.160> and<00:01:26.160> often<00:01:27.060> these<00:01:27.180> scales

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
a bluesier sound and often these scales

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.109 
a bluesier sound and often these scales
are<00:01:28.320> blended<00:01:28.740> together<00:01:31.760> to<00:01:32.760> come<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.000> with

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
are blended together to come up with

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.020 
are blended together to come up with
bluesy<00:01:33.930> jazzy<00:01:34.350> type<00:01:34.770> phrases<00:01:35.160> so<00:01:35.850> what<00:01:36.000> I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
bluesy jazzy type phrases so what I

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.550 
bluesy jazzy type phrases so what I
would<00:01:36.210> recommend<00:01:36.300> is<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.930> work<00:01:37.200> out<00:01:37.410> these

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
would recommend is to work out these

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.520 
would recommend is to work out these
scales<00:01:37.950> around<00:01:38.340> each<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.640> those<00:01:38.729> chord<00:01:39.090> forms

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
scales around each of those chord forms

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.800 
scales around each of those chord forms
with<00:01:40.530> out<00:01:40.890> first<00:01:41.460> without<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> blues<00:01:42.600> notes

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
with out first without the blues notes

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.900 
with out first without the blues notes
and<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.050> with<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.440> blues<00:01:43.649> notes<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.160> then

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
and then with the blues notes and then

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
experiment with combining them obviously

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.999 
experiment with combining them obviously
learning<00:01:48.119> licks<00:01:48.330> by<00:01:48.630> players<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.740> hear
