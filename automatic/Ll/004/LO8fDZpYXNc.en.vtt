00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.370
 always from mobile world congress in 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.800
 company of Lucian librandi of nvidia 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.929
 which tells us about project shield hi 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.870
 everyone is Luciano di nvidia them 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.910
 we have our new project here 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.789
 shield this name we gave then 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.600
 which really looks like a shield 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.840
 then we see the features 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.240
 fundamentals shield is based on the new 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.760
 tegra 4 processor that we just have 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.530
 launched at a computing power 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.780
 fabulous since 72 graphics core respect 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.610
 to make a comparison with the tegra 3 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.899
 tegra 3 had only 12 so 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.129
 you can imagine the computing power 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:48.210
 chart are android standard 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:51.000
 the screen is 5 inches 720p then a 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.579
 300 dpi interesting thing as I said 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.530
 android the screen is touchscreen 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.940
 there is an interesting feature that 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.579
 this one then just click on 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.949

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.739
 the interface where there are the various days 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.600

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.100
 games that are installed inside 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.140

 download the games from the tegrazone site is 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.530
 another interesting thing this is 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.750
 project shield can be interfaced with 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.369

 nvidia with kepler architecture since a 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.080
