Hey! I'm Misha Tivikov

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.000
I want to show you how I made Spider Arcade

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.500
I think, you guys will understand what is happening on the screen

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
So, I put in subtitles only major steps of my work

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.700
In original footage I had alone spider on his web

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.700
Instead tripod I used handheld camera for focus spider on center

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.700
I used Adobe After Effects in post-production

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.700
After Color Correction I used tracker Mocha for AE on blured clouds

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
All objects were linked with Null with Tracking data

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.700
Each object was created and animated separately

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.700
For weapons and items I used Optical Flares

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.700
For mobs I used plugin Element 3D. 
One basic model of Fly with different textures

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.700
For explosions, smoke and fire I used stock footages with color correction

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.700
Lightsabers created with preset from VideoCopilot

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.700
For each animation I picked individual sound FX

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.700
I used expressions to control different groups of sounds

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:56.700
That's all. I hope you enjoyed this video. Good luck!
