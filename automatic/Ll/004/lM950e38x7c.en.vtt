00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.740
 charger price armenia 12 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.530
 designed to charge 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.450
 sealed lead acid 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.200
 rechargeable battery 12 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.529
 volt capacitance under 4 to 15 and there five hours 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.019
 device realize 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.539
 optimal two-step 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.390
 battery charging procedure 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.570
 battery allows you to charge the battery 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.079
 as quickly as possible and without damage 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.939
 the device is fully automated yet 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.989
 but input and output overloads 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:32.670
 chains 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.670
 this can be used for 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.370
 cases requiring long-term storage 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.640
 komolli authors state constant

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.260
 power consumption you want 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.340
 no more than twenty five Vlad 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.200
 charger can work in two 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.090
 modes 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.200
 automatically moving from one 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.970
 regime of another dependence on 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.489
 state of your communicator tests

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.680
 the battery voltage will be 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.540
 increase and when it reaches 14 4 8 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.800

 5 device off 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.220
 the voltage on the communicators will begin 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.130
 to decline 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.860

 the process can be monitored with 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.899
 indicator devices by 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.649
