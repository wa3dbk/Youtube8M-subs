00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
almost every night I would come out to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.910

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
chicken feeder and we're getting feed

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.929 
chicken feeder and we're getting feed
everywhere<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.299> realized<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.729> had<00:01:20.729> I

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
everywhere so I realized that I had I

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.870 
everywhere so I realized that I had I
had<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.150> save<00:01:21.450> myself<00:01:21.689> some<00:01:21.960> time<00:01:22.700> every<00:01:23.700> night

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
had to save myself some time every night

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.359 
had to save myself some time every night
and<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.420> had<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.720> save<00:01:25.560> my<00:01:25.590> parents<00:01:25.920> money

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
and that I had to save my parents money

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.789 
and that I had to save my parents money
it's<00:01:26.939> because<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:28.049> were<00:01:28.110> wasting<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.590> lot<00:01:28.740> of

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
it's because we were wasting a lot of

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.890 
it's because we were wasting a lot of
chicken<00:01:29.220> feed<00:01:29.430> every<00:01:30.270> time<00:01:30.479> they<00:01:30.630> would<00:01:30.720> not

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
chicken feed every time they would not

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.780 
chicken feed every time they would not
get<00:01:31.020> over<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.840> started<00:01:33.840> thinking<00:01:34.640> what<00:01:35.640> was

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
get over so I started thinking what was

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.600 
get over so I started thinking what was
a<00:01:35.850> way<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.689> could<00:01:37.159> get<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> chicken

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
a way that I could get the chicken

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.280 
a way that I could get the chicken
feeder<00:01:38.820> off<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.420> ground<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.079> couldn't

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
feeder off the ground so they couldn't

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.679 
feeder off the ground so they couldn't
step<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.970> figured<00:01:42.030> out<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.360> had<00:01:42.479> to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
step in it and I figured out I had to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.600 
step in it and I figured out I had to
make<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> hanging<00:01:43.320> feeder<00:01:43.939> so<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.240> had<00:01:45.479> an<00:01:45.570> idea

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
make a hanging feeder so I had an idea

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.139 
make a hanging feeder so I had an idea
what<00:01:47.610> about<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> 2-liter<00:01:48.390> bottle<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.790> decided

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
what about a 2-liter bottle so I decided

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.810 
what about a 2-liter bottle so I decided
to<00:01:51.299> cut<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.960> large<00:01:52.619> portion<00:01:53.040> out<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.579> side

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
to cut a large portion out of the side

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.690 
to cut a large portion out of the side
of<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.060> 2-liter<00:01:54.450> bottle<00:01:54.780> drill<00:01:55.530> two<00:01:55.979> holes<00:01:56.009> in

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
of a 2-liter bottle drill two holes in

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.840 
of a 2-liter bottle drill two holes in
either<00:01:57.299> end<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.430> put<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> string

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
either end of it and put a string

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.580 
either end of it and put a string
through<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:01.159> two<00:02:02.159> sets<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.729> holes<00:02:03.290> then<00:02:04.290> I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
through the two sets of holes then I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.340 
through the two sets of holes then I
found<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:05.040> spot<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.369> their<00:02:05.490> chicken<00:02:05.820> coop<00:02:06.350> where

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
found a spot in their chicken coop where

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.839 
found a spot in their chicken coop where
it<00:02:07.469> would<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.619> easy<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.979> fill<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.550> chicken

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
it would be easy to fill the chicken

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.440 
it would be easy to fill the chicken
feeder<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.170> easy<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.940> open<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.270> close

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
feeder and to be easy to open and close

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.760 
feeder and to be easy to open and close
the<00:02:12.660> lid<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.170> wouldn't<00:02:13.379> enter

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the lid so it wouldn't enter

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.420 
the lid so it wouldn't enter
with<00:02:13.980> any<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.280> their<00:02:14.550> other<00:02:14.580> activity<00:02:16.130> so<00:02:17.130> I

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
with any of their other activity so I

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.350 
with any of their other activity so I
decided<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:18.060> hang<00:02:18.630> up<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.850> two<00:02:20.850> in<00:02:21.000> her<00:02:21.060> bottle

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
decided to hang up the two in her bottle

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.650 
decided to hang up the two in her bottle
chicken<00:02:21.720> feeder<00:02:21.930> on<00:02:22.170> one<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:23.660> crossbars

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
chicken feeder on one of the crossbars

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.790 
chicken feeder on one of the crossbars
in<00:02:25.760> their<00:02:26.760> chicken<00:02:27.090> coop<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.560> worked

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
in their chicken coop and this worked

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.180 
in their chicken coop and this worked
really<00:02:29.070> well<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:31.080> was<00:02:31.320> perfect<00:02:31.710> at<00:02:31.860> chest

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
really well it was perfect at chest

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.190 
really well it was perfect at chest
level<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.700> they<00:02:32.850> couldn't<00:02:33.180> get<00:02:33.750> their<00:02:33.900> feet<00:02:34.080> up

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
level so they couldn't get their feet up

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.960 
level so they couldn't get their feet up
on<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.560> knock<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.740> over<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.460> they

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
on it and knock it over and they

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.380 
on it and knock it over and they
couldn't<00:02:36.270> spill<00:02:36.600> feet<00:02:36.780> out<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:38.120> also<00:02:39.120> I

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
couldn't spill feet out of it also I

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.570 
couldn't spill feet out of it also I
could<00:02:39.660> swing<00:02:39.870> slightly<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.070> two<00:02:41.250> chickens

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
could swing slightly so the two chickens

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.370 
could swing slightly so the two chickens
could<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.030> at<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.540> same<00:02:42.720> time<00:02:42.990> without

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
could be that at the same time without

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.340 
could be that at the same time without
being<00:02:43.830> each<00:02:44.040> other's<00:02:44.340> way<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.840> design<00:02:46.140> of

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
being each other's way the design of

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.050 
being each other's way the design of
this<00:02:46.530> chicken<00:02:46.950> feeder<00:02:47.160> also<00:02:47.550> made<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.850> such

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
this chicken feeder also made it such
