00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.459 

I<00:00:07.790> think<00:00:08.790> at<00:00:08.910> first<00:00:09.150> when<00:00:09.870> we<00:00:09.900> all<00:00:10.170> learned

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
I think at first when we all learned

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.890 
I think at first when we all learned
about<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:10.830> was<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> little<00:00:11.280> bit<00:00:11.460> confusing<00:00:11.969> kind

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
about it was a little bit confusing kind

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.020 
about it was a little bit confusing kind
of<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.049> shock<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.710> kind<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.400> knew<00:00:14.610> about<00:00:14.759> each

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
of a shock and kind of knew about each

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.180 
of a shock and kind of knew about each
other<00:00:15.240> but<00:00:15.570> not<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.049> capacity<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.619> we<00:00:17.070> were

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
other but not in a capacity that we were

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.590 
other but not in a capacity that we were
paying<00:00:17.400> attention<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> other<00:00:17.970> players<00:00:18.390> in

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
paying attention to the other players in

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.050 
paying attention to the other players in
the<00:00:18.690> field<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.230> was<00:00:20.130> reading<00:00:20.520> for<00:00:20.699> something

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the field I was reading for something

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.529 
the field I was reading for something
that<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.210> didn't<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:21.650> some<00:00:22.650> reason<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.100> say<00:00:23.279> no

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
that I didn't like some reason to say no

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.490 
that I didn't like some reason to say no
as<00:00:24.539> I'm<00:00:24.810> learning<00:00:25.350> about<00:00:25.470> Tomo<00:00:27.050> I'm<00:00:28.050> finding

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
as I'm learning about Tomo I'm finding

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.019 
as I'm learning about Tomo I'm finding
myself<00:00:28.650> having<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.189> same<00:00:29.429> kinds<00:00:29.910> of

as<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.390> was<00:00:33.510> learning<00:00:33.719> about<00:00:33.899> CyberKnife

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
as I was learning about CyberKnife

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.740 
as I was learning about CyberKnife
people<00:00:36.420> tend<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.930> stay<00:00:37.590> remain<00:00:38.370> same<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.450> all

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
people tend to stay remain same in all

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.250 
people tend to stay remain same in all
ways<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.980> merger<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.879> be<00:00:42.090> kind<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

ovarian cancer in 2002 it would have

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.510 
ovarian cancer in 2002 it would have
helped<00:01:09.659> if<00:01:09.960> my<00:01:10.439> mother<00:01:10.650> hadn't<00:01:11.010> suffered<00:01:11.189> so

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520

which<00:01:14.939> probably<00:01:15.780> could<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.080> been<00:01:16.229> treated

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
which probably could have been treated

which probably could have been treated
with<00:01:16.740> radiotherapy<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.850> we'd<00:01:18.119> had

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
with radiotherapy if we'd had

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.940 
with radiotherapy if we'd had
tomotherapy<00:01:18.930> or<00:01:19.530> CyberKnife<00:01:20.159> at<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.549> time<00:01:20.790> I
