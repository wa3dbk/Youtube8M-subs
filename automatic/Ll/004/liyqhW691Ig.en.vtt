about why that game was so good a little
bit<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.870> foreplay<00:00:49.140> before<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:50.129> hit<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.820> I

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
super and in fact I think it's the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.510

reason<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.960> got<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.410> Super<00:00:58.739> Nintendo<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> kid

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
you have the option to do it so it's not

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.390 
you have the option to do it so it's not
overly<00:02:18.480> complicated<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:19.319> really<00:02:19.829> crazy<00:02:20.069> but

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
overly complicated not really crazy but

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.819 
overly complicated not really crazy but
it's<00:02:20.519> very<00:02:20.670> rkd<00:02:21.269> and<00:02:21.540> it's<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.750> lot<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:21.989> fun<00:02:22.319> and

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
it's very rkd and it's a lot of fun and

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.589 
it's very rkd and it's a lot of fun and
at<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> same<00:02:23.190> time<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.489> still<00:02:23.819> do<00:02:24.120> have<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:24.480> do

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
at the same time you still do have to do

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.420 
at the same time you still do have to do
real<00:02:24.930> things<00:02:24.959> like<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.620> want<00:02:25.799> to<00:02:25.860> try<00:02:26.099> and

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
real things like you want to try and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.610 
real things like you want to try and
optimize<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.329> get<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.660> straightest<00:02:28.200> path<00:02:28.379> you

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
optimize to get the straightest path you

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.670 
optimize to get the straightest path you
possibly<00:02:29.069> can<00:02:29.569> but<00:02:30.569> it's<00:02:30.750> not<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:31.200> from

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
possibly can but it's not like from

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.470 
possibly can but it's not like from
Curry's<00:02:32.040> MO<00:02:32.280> or<00:02:32.579> if<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.819> don't<00:02:33.030> break<00:02:33.269> it

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
Curry's MO or if you don't break it

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.539 
Curry's MO or if you don't break it
exactly<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.049> right<00:02:34.200> second<00:02:34.829> you're<00:02:35.430> gonna

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
exactly the right second you're gonna

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.900 
exactly the right second you're gonna
fly<00:02:35.879> off<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.329> course<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:38.280> one<00:02:38.579> thing<00:02:38.790> that's

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
fly off the course and one thing that's

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.550 
fly off the course and one thing that's
very<00:02:39.030> important<00:02:39.750> with<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:39.989> game<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.260> it

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
very important with this game is it

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.800 
very important with this game is it
always<00:02:40.829> tries<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.400> keep<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.970> glow<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.629> to

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
always tries to keep that glow of to

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.380 
always tries to keep that glow of to
certain<00:02:43.170> speed<00:02:43.829> even<00:02:44.610> when<00:02:44.910> you're<00:02:45.030> sort<00:02:45.299> of

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
certain speed even when you're sort of

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.240 
certain speed even when you're sort of
hitting<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:45.900> it's<00:02:46.079> just<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.379> strip<00:02:46.799> and<00:02:47.069> it

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
hitting in it's just that strip and it

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.740 
hitting in it's just that strip and it
doesn't<00:02:47.579> really<00:02:47.730> break<00:02:48.030> from<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.359> gameplay

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
doesn't really break from the gameplay

doesn't really break from the gameplay
close<00:02:49.109> you<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.350> bit<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.680> could<00:02:50.190> cost<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.819> the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
close you a bit and could cost you the

close you a bit and could cost you the

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
the SNES could really do graphic and

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.000 
the SNES could really do graphic and

fluid<00:04:47.310> movement

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
fluid movement

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.279 
fluid movement
of<00:04:48.530> these<00:04:48.830> brights<00:04:49.189> animations<00:04:50.030> oh<00:04:50.300> yeah<00:04:50.599> it

of these brights animations oh yeah it
really<00:04:51.650> does<00:04:51.979> look<00:04:52.430> like<00:04:52.490> a<00:04:53.330> moving<00:04:53.780> car<00:04:54.080> and

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:54.379 
really does look like a moving car and

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.490 
really does look like a moving car and
for<00:04:54.650> a<00:04:54.680> launch<00:04:55.009> title<00:04:55.370> this<00:04:56.330> is<00:04:56.509> extremely

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
for a launch title this is extremely

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.800 
for a launch title this is extremely
impressive<00:04:57.770> like<00:04:58.430> it's<00:04:58.610> just<00:04:58.849> really<00:04:59.509> the

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
impressive like it's just really the

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.050 
impressive like it's just really the
fluidity<00:05:00.169> is<00:05:00.409> what<00:05:00.620> sells<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:01.099> for<00:05:01.280> me<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.879> the

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
fluidity is what sells it for me and the

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.129 
fluidity is what sells it for me and the
only<00:05:02.210> thing<00:05:02.479> in<00:05:02.599> this<00:05:02.659> game<00:05:02.719> that<00:05:02.990> really

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
only thing in this game that really

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.839 
only thing in this game that really
doesn't<00:05:03.349> look<00:05:03.500> that<00:05:03.560> good<00:05:04.490> is<00:05:04.699> the

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
doesn't look that good is the

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.309 
doesn't look that good is the
perspective<00:05:05.210> that<00:05:05.539> we're<00:05:05.900> supposed<00:05:06.050> to<00:05:06.229> be

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
perspective that we're supposed to be

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.050 
perspective that we're supposed to be
like<00:05:06.500> high<00:05:06.830> above<00:05:07.189> the<00:05:07.370> ground

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
like high above the ground

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.520 
like high above the ground
there's<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.449> interesting<00:05:08.840> College<00:05:09.169> shadow

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
there's the interesting College shadow

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.429 
there's the interesting College shadow
up<00:05:09.800> backside<00:05:10.340> that<00:05:10.550> make<00:05:11.210> you<00:05:11.419> know<00:05:11.990> that

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:12.439 
up backside that make you know that

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.420 
up backside that make you know that
we're<00:05:12.590> supposed<00:05:12.650> to<00:05:12.860> be<00:05:12.949> above<00:05:13.069> the<00:05:13.129> ground

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
we're supposed to be above the ground

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.420 
we're supposed to be above the ground
but<00:05:13.580> overall<00:05:13.969> just<00:05:14.090> look<00:05:14.620> great<00:05:15.620> but<00:05:16.280> then

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
but overall just look great but then

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.249 
but overall just look great but then
again<00:05:16.520> it<00:05:17.270> is<00:05:17.360> kind<00:05:17.780> of<00:05:17.870> not<00:05:18.550> important<00:05:19.550> no<00:05:20.509> if

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
again it is kind of not important no if

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.290 
again it is kind of not important no if
they<00:05:21.409> did<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.680> FX<00:05:22.039> chip<00:05:22.400> -<00:05:22.729> they<00:05:22.969> might<00:05:23.180> have

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
they did the FX chip - they might have

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.640 
they did the FX chip - they might have
been<00:05:23.389> able<00:05:23.539> to<00:05:23.659> do<00:05:23.780> some<00:05:23.990> cool<00:05:24.259> perspective

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
been able to do some cool perspective

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.700 
been able to do some cool perspective
stuff<00:05:25.340> but<00:05:25.669> this<00:05:26.120> game<00:05:26.360> never<00:05:26.810> got<00:05:27.199> a<00:05:27.469> real

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
stuff but this game never got a real

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.249 
stuff but this game never got a real
kart<00:05:28.370> release<00:05:28.879> for<00:05:29.300> its<00:05:29.389> sequel<00:05:29.900> so<00:05:30.139> they

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 
kart release for its sequel so they

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:34.510 
kart release for its sequel so they
couldn't<00:05:30.469> use<00:05:30.710> any<00:05:30.979> of<00:05:31.069> that<00:05:31.159> -<00:05:31.780> whoa<00:05:33.250> that<00:05:34.250> guy
