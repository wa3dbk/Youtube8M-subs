00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:12.629
 hello and welcome for this test of 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.820
 rock raider 9 2 from decathlon so 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.349
 I present my bike so it's a 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.640
 long lasting effect what does that make a 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.390
 little moment already that I roll with this 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.279
 bike so fork and damper in 132 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.910
 shox sector rock clothing at the front 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.950
 in the back we had to merge with three 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.980
 positions I will explain a little 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.890
 after how does it work the 9.2 system 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.739
 questions of wheels that are 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.339
 crocs stride front brake disc 180 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.309
 rear brake discs in 160 fork 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.039
 lockable handlebar and brakes elixir so 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.329
 that was the presentation and 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.030
 I like to take a little walk in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.260
 wood or make a little video and I'm 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.109
 found a nice little place to 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.260
 debrief then on the I think of 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.260
 made 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.060
 and here we came to the end of this 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.330
 speed so I'm really moving 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.890
 very very nice to ride so if it is 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.750
 again the roads 26 as you said 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.650
 see you later 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.750
 unlike the next model that 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.239
 set in motion 25.3 also the system 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.850
 9 to change a little bit too in the 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.959
 new model so at the points 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.590
 strong of this bike is the damper 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.709
 back 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.260
 with these three points of three positions 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.610
 adjustment therefore very rigid for the 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.959
 road that falls a little bit 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.360
 the damper therefore decreases the hunt 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.860
 lift the back of the bike so for the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.030
 the coasts or the road or the coasts in 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.570
 path not too stony it's 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.790
 really great 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.790
 the intermediate position on which you 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.400
 allows you to serve 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.010
 the damper sound that's too hard but 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.090
 without it being too soft for either 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.100
 for not too much pumped in the ribs 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.630
 so the system 9 for pumping it's 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.709
 not bad it's not revolutionary but 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.030
 it's not bad and the 3rd position so 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.480
 it's the flexible position for 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.769
 downhill 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.110
 so that's also extraordinary 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.670
 it's magic, it lowers the back of the 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.720
 bike so in the ribs sapped in the 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.430
 descents I mean that increases the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.630
 hunt then that allows us 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.410
 to attack in the downhill really 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.210
 safely 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.530
 really nice braking 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.840
 of elixir 3 so really very nice in 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:54.890
 disk 180 to the front if I'm wrong 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:57.150
 and 130 at the back of the wheels cross ride 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.040
 bring them the original good pilot 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.090
 will not be not bad but now 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.290
 he thinks he's a little bit and like 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.800
 I say it's been a while since I roll 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.560
 with this bike 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.560
 so that's the positives so 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.610
 very rigid 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.590
 the awesome rear shock the fork 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.590
 showa hugging without comment it's 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.739
 really great with the blocking 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.330
 August which I added pedals 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.100
 automatic cash because I like 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.100
 well be well feel bike in the 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.140
 descent the weak points of this bike 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.340
 so it's only been nine months since I 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.870
 ride with this bike I have a little game 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.690
 in the system 9 at the aria good I can 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.370
 not your taste show you here but con 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.100
 with pedals mouth we do not go 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.930
 actually rolling account but that's 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.990
 know we really see it by operating 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.310
 the pedal lever and so I want 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.480
 bring back to decathlon jewelry would look like a 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.110
 little what it is after this 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.460
 that they told me that I wanted her 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.470
 participate in trials with me 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.550
 I hope to try soon 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.550
