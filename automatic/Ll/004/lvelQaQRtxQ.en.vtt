00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 yes hello today is about makeup 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.799
 problems in the summer go and maybe 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.210
 also a little bit about the new one 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.210
 alignment of a channel 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.600
 yes, I already have the hall for you 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.119
 shown often enough 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.640
 because that's the first video of a new one 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.640
 series is and today I'm glad to see you 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.700
 to present the second video 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.980
 There are more and more videos of this kind 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.660
 now on my channel follow this 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.360
 You did not see that here because of that 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.950
 I have for the otto blog should be fully 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.149
 I've made a few for myself 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.100
 months ago blogger and otto found that 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.960
 I could tell you that 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.929
 that's just really cool videos 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.570
 I see what I personally do 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:55.329
 at the soli blog it is great that it is 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.350
 a fashion blog with beauty impact 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.640
 is and that's just not a size zero 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.120
 fashionblog is so that is quite 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.710
 for the more stuffy among you too 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.000
 maybe not me too 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.480
 so count so I have one 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.450
 Clothes size 42 to 44 which he honestly 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.550
 also said the normal standard is and 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.290
 not what the fashion industry or 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.240
 maybe social platforms as well 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:25.420
 instagram or youtube with something 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.250
 very staged stories comes along 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.460
 so I think it's super that is 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.310
 just one company dares another 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.979
 to go away and I like you a link 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.740
 Definitely in the infobox so that you 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.329
 Just look at the blog 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.880
 In any case, I wish you much now 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.340
 fun with the video such videos you can 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.950
 in the future then on the sony blog 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.380
 also see that would be very happy if 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.149
 you go over there and now we have 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.149
 just make-up problems in the summer 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.850
 yes the summer is coming and make up in the 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.070
 summer may be such a problem so far 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.870
 Therefore, do not make up the solution 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.810
 and in thick sunglasses 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.880
 well, does not work well 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.950
 that's why my tips against sweaty 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.370
 make up first you should do so 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.080
 tinted brother what is also pointed 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.400
 as you can see here very impressive 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.630
 can ask for 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.100
 that is not so difficult and runs 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.320
 You should also shadow the city 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.930
 so use cream eyeshadow 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.440
 so stay the whole day where yours 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.440
 have full 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.180
 and she could be quite wonderful as well 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.180
 eyeliner 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.250
 may be missing waterproof, of course 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.020
 mascara which also still has the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:03:00.740
 advantage that we have the swing of the wm 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:03:02.180
 franz majcen holds better than normal and 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.220
 Of course, a long-lasting 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.350
 lipstick here is pretty cool because 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.690
 he also still the color on the 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.700
 lips just changed once 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.700
 ask and then all day 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.960
 already finished, we soon prepared for 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.660
 a sparkling tearing prague and yours 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.490
 but make-up remains where it is 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.740
 want so now could be the sun 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.560
 enjoy and do all that you can 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.580

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.890

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.110

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.110
