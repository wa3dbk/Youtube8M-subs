 hi friends my name is old 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.410
 hernandez and in this video I'm going to 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.410
 show possible combinations of feels 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.460
 each time has 40 eighth notes 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.460
 ah 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.510
 of those 45 hours the first one the 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.020
 third and fourth 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.020
 ah 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.570
 Y 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.360
 touch this idea four times in the 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.360
 different drums 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.379
 applied to the battery sounds like this 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.010
 another option is to touch the first the 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.060
 second and the fourth without eighth of each 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.119
 weather 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.119
 to 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.880

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.440
 ah 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.280
 now combine these two ideas 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.080
 ah 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.580
 ah 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.340
 remember to practice this with 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.080
 frequency to expand your repertoire of 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.970
 films good friends 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.100

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.610
