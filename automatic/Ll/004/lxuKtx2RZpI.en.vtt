00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.540
 the bible is not a great holy book 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:06.189
 deception was told by mauro 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.779
 biglino scholar of history of the 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:09.790
 religions producing ancient Hebrew 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.800
 for over twenty years on behalf of 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.660
 editions of St. Paul in the Vatican in a 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.670
 public meeting in the middle of the water e 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.619
 port sports outside where the writer 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.869
 told the discoveries made in 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.880
 thirty years of analysis of sacred texts in 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.550
 a double conference with total with the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.289
 writer mirella santamato discovered 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.999
 that contradict the truths contained 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.140
 in the Bible starting with identity 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.810
 of God 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.960
 we invited mauro biglino 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.510
 professor who 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.280
 a real biblicist a person of one 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.800
 remarkable culture that he wrote 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.500
 also many books on the bible e 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.079
 on the interpretation that these books 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.210
 so called sacred then in reality 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.059
 we say that the things said in these 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.540
 books are not so sacred and therefore 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:57.170
 this brought a reflection too 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.690
 a very important knowledge of the 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.079
 ours and our mental patterns 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.899
 the first part will therefore be its own 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.080
 turned to the stories they made to us 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:11.690
 believe to be true but in reality they are not true 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.479
 they are false this is the whole first part 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.910
 that will be up to mauro biglino who 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.750
 presents his book the bible is not a 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.929
 holy book 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.240
 the second part and this is why 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:28.729
 deceptions have managed to be so 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.770
 hidden for so many centuries because it is also 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.050
 true that not only that the stories there 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.390
 they said they are true are false 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.659
 but it is also true that those who have us 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.600
 said to be false they are actually true 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.570
 this is the part we say of which 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.720
 I will talk about how in reality 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.329
 in the ancient initiatory stories that we 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.899
 we call fairy tales that are very few 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.750
 are 45 in our culture are 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:01.280
 really started that make us understand 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.710
 how can we really learn to live 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.130
 happy and happy this is one 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.130
 very important knowledge which 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.380
 unfortunately we have forgotten myself 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.959
 I give an example 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.030
 I give a very simple example why 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.209
 these ancient stories have been handed down 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.910
 over millennia and it's strange that one thing 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.950
 that it had to be so false whether it was in 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.810
 reality handed down over the millennia because the 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.000
 things do not last if they are not true 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.069
 this was the first move I got 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.530
 let go to investigate these ancient ones 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.110
 stories that have and will see it 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.780
 people here in the room when we do the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.420
 comparison with the so-called sacred texts 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.090
 which are just as old have many 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.400
 points in common the apple of eva is not 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.290
 other than the apple of snow white the apple 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.080
 poisoned of knowledge 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.140
 the one that gives the witch or the one who gives 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.769
 the serpent and the serpent is nothing else 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.390
 that precisely the being reptilian the dragon 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:05.150
 where so many fairy tales are, let's say 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.519
 focus on this archetypal figure 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.880
 so there are plenty of points 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.980
 connection between the ancient stories though 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.360
 strangely those that end badly 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.880
 with the expulsion from paradise with pin tg 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.190
 you must repent 6 sinner and so on 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.040
 etc. end in a dramatic way 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.830
 even the sons of Adam and Eve who 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.989
 they are good and they kill each other 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.640
 each other then a terrible story 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:39.840
 this must be considered true 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.810
 word of god and sacred those which instead 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.209
 with a lot of initiatory evidence 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.319
 overcome being eaten by a beast 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:52.140
 from a wolf being poisoned by an apple 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.510
 know getting into the balls in the woods 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.480
 obscure of our unconscious et cetera 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.359
 etc. but then they finally make us 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.590
 meet the truth that is love then 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:06.600
 true love is nothing but the truth 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.209
 those that finally the soul 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.230
 can understand how to live happily e 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.799
 happy 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.289
 no that is false that is not good the 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.850
 great professor of books 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.530
 of sacred books in particular 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.019
 through these his translations is 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.820
 managed to notice them particularities 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.830
 that put a little doubt what it is 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.930
 was the truth always told 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.270
 so there is much doubt in the sense 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.889
 that obviously the translations done 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.479
 especially with the method of the 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.250
 literal translations I made for 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.349
 many years for the San Paolo editions 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.750
 obviously highlight let's say one 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.950
 story we say decidedly different from 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.250
 the one that was told 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.690
 in particular from the details but is a 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.340
 fundamental detail that the ancient 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.660
 Testament never speaks of god I would say 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.280
 that this is fundamental 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.170
 and from this obviously all 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.120
 I can't help but ask why 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.490
 because why was there a story told 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.770
 history that is not true as a login because 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.510
 if they had told us the true story 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.130
 they could not have built this 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.160
 which they built and then it was 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.990
 only with the help of interpretations 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.850
 obviously not responding to 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.130
 literality of the text that was 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.760
 possible to do what we all know 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.380
 in short, however, I read some of her 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.780
 of his theories his theory is that 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.450
 in fact there was something anyway 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.380
 someone who somehow is 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.360
 intervened so 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.040
 well surely when i say that not 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.260
 He speaks of God I mean that the ancient 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.420
 testament tell the story in the 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.400
 which individuals are involved in 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.440
 have had a relationship with that people in 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.300
 particular an individual that what 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.490
 then it is known by the name of yahoo is that 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.350
 was made to become god but that for 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.090
 luck for us everything was less than god 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.310
 because all this because it was done to us 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.920
 believe precisely that the stories told 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.300
 in the bible they are true while the fairy tales 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.030
 they are false 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.830
 then the only logical breathing a 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.560
 this is absurd because theoretically 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.770
 live badly because they want us 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.450
 we live badly it is a question of power 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.230
 that is the patriarchal power that one is 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:08.260
 established about 6000 years ago wanted 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:10.880
 obviously enslave dominate 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.370
 entire populations the war itself is 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.920
 was created to dominate others 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.110
 populations and also the structure 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.500
 pyramid we inherited 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.890
 by the ancient Egyptians where at the top 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.410
 of the pyramid was the head of the pharaoh 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:30.500
 then all down as i 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.660
 dignitaries up to the slaves is 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.960
 a social structure that even now 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.510
 we use and are so rooted in 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.240
 our unconscious to consider it almost 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.370
 the only possibility we cannot achieve 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.290
 almost no longer even to conceive another 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.720
 kind of company thing instead 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:51.440
 in antiquity in antiquity more 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.980
 deep existed still exists too 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:57.500
 in ours in some small realities i 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:07:00.830
 countries and still in our campaigns co 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:04.750
 instead there is a one type company 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:08.000
 circular of matrilineal type of type 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.340
 solidarity people help each other 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.980
 and survival is assured thanks 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.950
 to solidarity and not to the 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:18.800
 prevarication or domination over the other 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:22.250
 so they are two different social concepts 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.320
 they took turns in history 

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.120
 long humanity for many 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.010
 millennia 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.410
 until unfortunately the worst one 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:34.960
 according to me that is the vertical one 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.960
 the patriarchal one has won
