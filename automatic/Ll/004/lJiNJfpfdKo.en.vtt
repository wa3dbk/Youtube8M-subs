entirely unusual for us so hopefully we

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
forgot to charge the other iPad so I had

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:16.939 
forgot to charge the other iPad so I had
to<00:06:15.809> go<00:06:15.899> get<00:06:16.050> my<00:06:16.110> iPad<00:06:16.499> and<00:06:16.529> I<00:06:16.619> forgot<00:06:16.860> about

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
to go get my iPad and I forgot about

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:19.040 
to go get my iPad and I forgot about
that<00:06:17.069> and<00:06:17.189> then<00:06:17.519> we<00:06:17.999> forgot<00:06:18.300> cards<00:06:18.689> so<00:06:18.839> James

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
that and then we forgot cards so James

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.309 
that and then we forgot cards so James
is<00:06:19.199> walking<00:06:19.559> to<00:06:19.649> his<00:06:19.740> place<00:06:20.009> which<00:06:20.729> is<00:06:20.879> like

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 
is walking to his place which is like

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.929 
is walking to his place which is like
not<00:06:22.319> that<00:06:22.589> far<00:06:22.949> from<00:06:23.159> here<00:06:23.339> but<00:06:23.579> I<00:06:23.610> guess<00:06:23.789> it's

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:23.939 
not that far from here but I guess it's

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:29.230 
not that far from here but I guess it's
not<00:06:24.029> close<00:06:24.419> by<00:06:24.629> considering<00:06:25.519> he's<00:06:26.519> still<00:06:26.759> gone

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.659 

to<00:06:29.870> get<00:06:30.020> cards<00:06:30.289> I<00:06:30.500> just<00:06:30.919> like<00:06:31.220> to<00:06:31.310> point<00:06:31.460> out

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
to get cards I just like to point out

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.420 
to get cards I just like to point out
that<00:06:32.449> we<00:06:32.660> were<00:06:32.780> doing<00:06:33.020> really<00:06:33.199> well<00:06:33.440> for<00:06:33.830> like

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
that we were doing really well for like

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.879 
that we were doing really well for like
batteries<00:06:34.880> and<00:06:35.120> cards<00:06:35.479> and<00:06:35.630> stuff<00:06:35.930> and<00:06:36.229> then

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
batteries and cards and stuff and then

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.379 
batteries and cards and stuff and then
James<00:06:37.250> and<00:06:37.490> I<00:06:37.580> had<00:06:38.330> to<00:06:38.479> go<00:06:38.630> pick<00:06:39.410> up<00:06:39.560> a<00:06:40.389> windsock

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
James and I had to go pick up a windsock

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:44.140 
James and I had to go pick up a windsock
for<00:06:41.870> the<00:06:42.080> lapel<00:06:42.650> mic<00:06:42.860> and<00:06:43.190> so<00:06:43.789> we<00:06:43.970> weren't

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
for the lapel mic and so we weren't

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.200 
for the lapel mic and so we weren't
there<00:06:44.449> when<00:06:45.139> and<00:06:45.470> they<00:06:46.310> left<00:06:46.580> the<00:06:47.090> other

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
there when and they left the other

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.890 
there when and they left the other
people<00:06:47.569> left<00:06:47.780> so<00:06:48.620> I<00:06:49.130> think<00:06:50.060> that's<00:06:50.539> the<00:06:50.720> reason

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
people left so I think that's the reason

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.650 
people left so I think that's the reason
is<00:06:51.289> that<00:06:51.580> apparently<00:06:52.580> they<00:06:52.819> completely<00:06:53.300> fall

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 
is that apparently they completely fall

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:00.279 
is that apparently they completely fall
apart<00:06:53.710> if<00:06:54.710> James<00:06:55.069> and<00:06:55.280> I<00:06:55.340> aren't<00:06:55.580> there<00:06:59.289> that

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 
apart if James and I aren't there that

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.100 
apart if James and I aren't there that
is<00:07:00.440> our<00:07:00.620> word<00:07:01.090> you<00:07:02.090> may<00:07:02.210> have<00:07:02.449> noticed<00:07:02.810> the<00:07:03.020> way

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
is our word you may have noticed the way

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.809 
is our word you may have noticed the way
my<00:07:03.349> hair<00:07:03.770> is<00:07:03.860> blowing<00:07:04.159> around<00:07:04.250> that<00:07:04.580> it<00:07:04.699> is<00:07:04.789> a

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:04.819 
my hair is blowing around that it is a

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:08.140 
my hair is blowing around that it is a
little<00:07:05.150> windy<00:07:05.479> here<00:07:05.659> today<00:07:05.960> and<00:07:06.229> so<00:07:07.220> normally

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.150 
little windy here today and so normally

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.839 
little windy here today and so normally
that<00:07:08.630> can<00:07:09.020> be<00:07:09.139> a<00:07:09.169> big<00:07:09.349> problem<00:07:09.500> for<00:07:09.949> the

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:10.849 
that can be a big problem for the

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:12.580 
that can be a big problem for the
especially<00:07:11.630> for<00:07:11.870> the<00:07:11.960> lapel<00:07:12.229> mic<00:07:12.409> because

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.590 
especially for the lapel mic because

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.010 
especially for the lapel mic because
it's<00:07:12.800> very<00:07:12.979> sensitive<00:07:13.159> and<00:07:13.639> so<00:07:14.569> we<00:07:14.900> were

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
it's very sensitive and so we were

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.270 
it's very sensitive and so we were
experimenting<00:07:15.710> with<00:07:15.740> putting<00:07:16.069> it<00:07:16.159> in

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 
experimenting with putting it in

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.040 
experimenting with putting it in
different<00:07:16.430> spots<00:07:16.880> you<00:07:17.120> know<00:07:17.240> on<00:07:17.509> the<00:07:17.720> lapel

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
different spots you know on the lapel

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.570 
different spots you know on the lapel
and<00:07:18.380> on<00:07:18.500> the<00:07:18.590> inside<00:07:18.830> of<00:07:18.889> the<00:07:19.039> pail<00:07:19.280> and

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:19.580 
and on the inside of the pail and

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.029 
and on the inside of the pail and
nothing<00:07:20.389> was<00:07:20.479> really<00:07:20.659> working<00:07:20.780> and<00:07:21.259> so<00:07:21.770> what

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039 
nothing was really working and so what

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:24.879 
nothing was really working and so what
we<00:07:22.130> ended<00:07:22.310> up<00:07:22.430> doing<00:07:22.490> is<00:07:23.409> I'm<00:07:24.409> actually<00:07:24.650> I

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:24.889 
we ended up doing is I'm actually I

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:27.520 
we ended up doing is I'm actually I
actually<00:07:25.009> have<00:07:25.310> it<00:07:25.460> on<00:07:25.610> the<00:07:26.090> inside<00:07:26.539> not<00:07:27.259> only

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:27.530 
actually have it on the inside not only

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.189 
actually have it on the inside not only
inside<00:07:27.860> my<00:07:28.039> jacket<00:07:28.069> but<00:07:28.550> actually<00:07:28.849> inside<00:07:29.479> my

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 
inside my jacket but actually inside my

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.950 
inside my jacket but actually inside my
turtleneck<00:07:30.919> here<00:07:31.360> almost<00:07:32.360> sprayed<00:07:32.720> in<00:07:32.840> my

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 
turtleneck here almost sprayed in my

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.909 
turtleneck here almost sprayed in my
armpit<00:07:34.810> luckily<00:07:35.810> the<00:07:36.080> armpit<00:07:36.469> acts<00:07:36.680> as<00:07:36.889> a

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:36.919 
armpit luckily the armpit acts as a

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:40.270 
armpit luckily the armpit acts as a
natural<00:07:37.159> echo<00:07:37.789> chamber<00:07:38.210> so<00:07:38.990> the<00:07:39.560> audio<00:07:40.099> that

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280 
natural echo chamber so the audio that

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.620 
natural echo chamber so the audio that
it's<00:07:40.400> getting<00:07:40.550> is<00:07:40.789> actually<00:07:41.090> quite<00:07:41.270> good<00:07:41.419> and

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:41.630 
it's getting is actually quite good and

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:55.800 
it's getting is actually quite good and
it's<00:07:42.050> all<00:07:42.289> protected<00:07:42.919> from<00:07:43.610> the<00:07:43.940> wind

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:55.810 

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.520 

this<00:07:56.810> show<00:07:57.110> is<00:07:57.440> really<00:07:57.770> hard<00:07:58.040> because<00:07:58.660> they<00:07:59.660> we

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:00.530 
this show is really hard because they we

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.030 
this show is really hard because they we
nice<00:08:00.800> I<00:08:01.160> here
