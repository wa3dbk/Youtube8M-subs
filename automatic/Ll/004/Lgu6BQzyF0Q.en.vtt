00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.790
 Good day to all my name is Grigory this 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:11.099
 transfer to look at the child 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.030
 Today I will talk about the best films 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.030
 about angels 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.700
 Immediately it should be noted that films about 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.460
 Angels can be safely divided by 2 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.680
 groups first conditional group I personally 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.000
 attributed all the films that are genre 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.550
 melodrama drama 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.580
 romantic comedy or just 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.380
 family film to the second as a group and 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.740
 took all the movies that fall under 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.020
 action genre ie plot dynamic 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.400
 fast pretty interesting and, at the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.260
 same time scary 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.630
 in fact, these are all films that are genre 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.970
 border on horror movies trailers 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.890
 or crazy black comedies 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.130
 specifically in this issue I will speak 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.780
 about the second option drove to and so the movie 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.490
 first from which you definitely need 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.820
 start this famous film 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.820
 Konstantin 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.720
 this film is 2005 starring 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.870
 keanu reeves 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.730
 the film is based on the famous comic strip 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.400
 this film tells the story of john 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.140
 Constantine think everyone watching the plot 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.970
 the movie is famous for it pretty 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.540
 interesting and intertwining life of the main 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.830
 a hero with problems that constantly 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.580
 slips life in the face of demons and 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.560
 angels 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.390
 this film deserves attention if you 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.760
 suddenly they didn't see him definitely 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.200
 look and if you saw yes sure 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:08.240
 agree to watch this movie 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:12.930
 why i'm hebrile something personally i rarely 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:17.420
 I went to church probably prayed enough to 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.420
 the second film is a legion film 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.400
 this movie is the year 2009 bath role 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.320
 the floor of bettany is also very famous 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.220
 film telling the story of the archangel 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.140
 Michael 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.870
 short plot such god finally 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.630
 lost faith in humanity and sent 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.760
 his angels to earth to those in the erased 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.410
 all of humanity from the face of the earth is 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.330
 quite an interesting film can not 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.760
 say that this is a true masterpiece but still 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.370
 if you like movies about angels about 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.650
 the eternal struggle between good and evil is a movie 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.350
 I can look I advise 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.630
 he no longer believes in any of you i 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.420
 knew that this day would come only not 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.520
 I thought that I would see him live and drop it 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.480
 you percy what the fuck are you mumbling 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.430
 angel obsessed people are all fairy tales and kf 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.280
 the third film is a black comedy 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.280
 dogma dogma 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.480
 this film was released in 1999 and its 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.940
 output produced a whole wave of controversy and 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.430
 any thoughts about biblical 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.260
 writings the plot of the film is that in principle for 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.690
 black comedy is commonplace 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.580
 very provocative nonetheless this 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.500
 the film deserves attention because in 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.629
 this movie starred owl galaxy 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.580
 famous Hollywood actors more 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.280
 Moreover, despite its absurdity film 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.019
 carries a few philosophical 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.540
 reasoning I'm in love with you and we 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:49.629
 above you cut because you know these guys 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:53.829
 how we don't fall from heaven like a fourth 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:55.049
 gabriel movie or angel of light angel 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.720
 Sveta 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.430
 this 2007 movie starring andy 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.190
 whitfield older are known thanks 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.930
 the first season of the most famous series 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.359
 spartak blood and sand 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.000
 unfortunately after the release of the first season 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:13.269
 andy became very sick for the second season 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.120
 alas for fans of the whole world he died 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.789
 but back to the movie film angel of light 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.570
 very atmospheric plot of the film in short 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.880
 such is 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.740
 another reality somewhere between heaven and 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.900
 the earth between hell and heaven 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.539
 there is a world in which to start 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.780
 to prevail darkness and god in this world was 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:34.419
 Angel Gabriel is sent which must 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.789
 banish darkness and rekindle the lost 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.889
 light if you have not seen this movie boldly 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.840
 watch the movie pretty good 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.880
 don't know if you can find him with 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.150
 good translation but in principle even 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.150
 if not a good film recommend it builds 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:53.380
 order to destroy the fallen and return the city 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.180
 to the light and by nature you can not 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:00.280
 kill the innocent 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:05.960
 and like the fifth movie of prophecy 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:08.030
 prophecy is a 1995 film in 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.400
 starring christopher walken 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.020
 it is very interesting and very good 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.030
 the film which is only the first 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.110
 part of a large series of films about 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.120
 the prophecies 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.770
 the film tells the story of an angel 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.370
 who was sent to earth to 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:25.069
 pick up the soul of the colonel after which he 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.229
 had to destroy the whole world but him 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:29.300
 fiercely trying to prevent 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.880
 los angeles cops and 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.620
 teacher from arizona is a movie 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.599
 sound despite the fact that above already 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.599
 many years ago he is still 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:41.330
 very interesting unusual and its possible 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.340
 I generally recommend to revise 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.889
 many years after the end of the spiritual 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.199
 seminary in the shower we stayed phrases from 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.330
 the epistles of apostle paul and discuss barely 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:53.509
 whether not the strangest place in the bible and 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.240
 the wine still remained in heaven not 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:59.979
 lived with a terrible weapon and square six 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.979
 movie angel heart 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.520
 this is also not a new movie released in 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.150
 1987 but he is the roles of poke and robert 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.310
 de niro 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.789
 here it should be noted that this film was given 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.909
 atmospheric ki interesting and frightening 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:19.400
 the film takes place in 1955 in 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:22.280
 New York to a private camp detective 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.430
 angel treats is is so first with 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.080
 request to find a talented musician 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.690
 good actors here is a good script 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.330
 This is a good quality film that 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.940
 deserves attention I really would not want 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.120
 seem tactless but allow 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.120
 still look at your ID 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.120
 of course 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.460
 some in general about this group but 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:48.740
 remind what the next issue is that 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.030
 watched will be dedicated to the best films 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.190
 about angels so surely 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.280
 look don't forget to subscribe to 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:59.229
 our youtube channel if you think about it 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.229
