00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.150

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.380
 really especially if you have skin 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.900
 fat to be able to give him less 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.479
 thanks then I wanted to talk to you about a 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.030
 product that is less dosed in h to mekh 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.280
 excellent too is the triec mehal 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.380
 it's really super hervÃ© you see 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.900
 Christmas is wonderful as a product 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.549
 it's for people who have 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.979
 severe skin imperfections 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.119
 to mitigate them 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.399
 so if I have a hint for skins 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.229
 fat did not use two products 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.729
 for aggressive because it's not good 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.439
 because that for fitting over 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.509
 sebum so what I advise you to 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.130
 soap-free soap dambach pure rate that 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.350
 is really excellent that leaves you 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.450
 the skin soft to the touch and even are 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.079
 touched so here I wanted to you 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.540
 to speak also 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.009
 if you have a button you have farted and 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.200
 that you want to disinfect it I want 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.880
 tell you about a natural product that is 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.180
 very good is the tree oil at tvo 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.860
 I was just a drop on a cotton 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.060
 rod and wanted to apply the button 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.969
 who could be on the face 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.049
 if they are not beaten but nothing 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.430
 after that I wanted to talk to you about 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.070
 natural products that are 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.200
 very effective also to put on the skin 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.910
 it's the lemon you cut the lemon and 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.040
 the lemon juice you apply it on the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.600
 face attention if you put some 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.170
 lemon is very photo embellish 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.460
 500 photosensitizers that is to say that 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.110
 do not expose yourself to the sun just 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.280
 after what they have months on 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.410
 times I do not decide the right terms 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.540
 but I am not a dermatologist 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.910
 that's if you have acne scars 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.320
 the potato is very good you cut 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.300
 and in small pieces and you apply it 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.740
 on faces and that allows date and at 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.150
 date the scars that I tell you 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.370
 it's not bullshit it seems 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.470
 but it's not con 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.630
 apparently I would have heard also that 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.880
 iso betadine if applied to the 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.850
 face in the form of soap between 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.640
 quotes it disinfects the 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.910
 face and so that an action 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.640
 antibacterial so that's it then for 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.550
 dry out your button there is this kind of 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.959
 two normaderm sticks that you apply 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.570
 on the button and so it's done with 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.890
 fruit acids that allow 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.980
 buttons to dry faster and that 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.680
 also allows to hide the sticks 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.690
 mercader that's it I think I've got you 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.340
 talked about all the products cochet finally 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.860
 I wanted to tell you one more thing 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.600
 honey is really beautiful for the 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.860
 skin you have to leave you can 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.440
 apply it directly to the skin or 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.090
 make masks so honey too and 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.650
 you can also make 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.140
 preparations based on bicarbonate 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.519
 sodium is very very good here if you 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.850
 have listened to all my advice you go 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.989

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.250

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.250
