to<00:00:13.380> really<00:00:13.710> use<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.040> machine<00:00:14.219> because<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.759> is

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
to really use this machine because it is

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.670 
to really use this machine because it is
different<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.450> don't<00:00:15.599> flick<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.870> switch<00:00:15.900> it

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
different you don't flick a switch it

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.710 
different you don't flick a switch it
takes<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.010> lot<00:00:17.250> more<00:00:17.279> user<00:00:17.850> interaction<00:00:18.600> when

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
takes a lot more user interaction when

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.660 
takes a lot more user interaction when
you<00:00:18.810> actually<00:00:18.930> want<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.260> prove<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.670> Charlie

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
so we're gonna go ahead and do that

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.500 
so we're gonna go ahead and do that
right<00:00:23.160> here<00:00:23.490> I'm<00:00:23.640> going<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.850> grind<00:00:24.060> with<00:00:24.269> my<00:00:24.390> my

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
right here I'm going to grind with my my

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.160 
right here I'm going to grind with my my
cap<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.080> don't<00:00:25.859> sell<00:00:26.210> so<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.510> grind<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.960> gonna

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
cap and don't sell so the grind is gonna

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.630 
cap and don't sell so the grind is gonna
be<00:00:28.289> quite<00:00:28.529> similar<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.039> most<00:00:29.220> espresso

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
be quite similar to most espresso

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.310 
be quite similar to most espresso
machines<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.240> be<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.330> nice<00:00:30.480> fine<00:00:30.810> commercial

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
machines can be a nice fine commercial

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.990 
machines can be a nice fine commercial
espresso<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.489> that'll<00:00:32.820> be<00:00:32.910> good<00:00:33.090> so

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.410

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
now in here have a double but it does

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.120 
now in here have a double but it does
come<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.840> single<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.470> being<00:00:44.040> the

come with a single and being the

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.680 
come with a single and being the
Millennium<00:00:44.580> it<00:00:44.760> does<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:45.150> a<00:00:45.180> little<00:00:45.390> Springs

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
Millennium it does have a little Springs

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:56.549 
Millennium it does have a little Springs
to<00:00:45.900> the<00:00:45.930> basket<00:00:46.380> it's<00:00:46.560> nice<00:00:46.830> and<00:00:47.100> tight

when you're tamping if your lap Livonia

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.290 
when you're tamping if your lap Livonia
is<00:00:58.870> past<00:00:59.170> you<00:00:59.920> know<00:01:00.010> your<00:01:00.280> mm<00:01:00.850> it's<00:01:00.940> gonna<00:01:01.090> be<00:01:01.269> a

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
is past you know your mm it's gonna be a

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.740 
is past you know your mm it's gonna be a
51<00:01:01.780> mil<00:01:02.100> otherwise<00:01:03.100> you're<00:01:03.340> gonna<00:01:03.399> have<00:01:03.519> 40<00:01:04.030> 49

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
51 mil otherwise you're gonna have 40 49

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.039 
51 mil otherwise you're gonna have 40 49
ml<00:01:05.170> so<00:01:05.860> linear<00:01:06.580> models<00:01:07.000> are<00:01:07.119> really<00:01:07.210> good<00:01:07.509> to

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
ml so linear models are really good to

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.539 
ml so linear models are really good to
help<00:01:08.200> with<00:01:08.409> heat<00:01:08.560> dissipation<00:01:09.009> so<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.400> can

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
help with heat dissipation so you can

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.859 
help with heat dissipation so you can
brew<00:01:09.759> more<00:01:10.000> than<00:01:10.150> a<00:01:10.180> couple<00:01:10.390> of<00:01:10.509> shots<00:01:10.720> of

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869

brew more than a couple of shots of
espresso<00:01:10.960> for<00:01:11.470> each<00:01:11.799> souks<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.729> lock<00:01:12.909> it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
espresso for each souks and to lock it

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.760 
espresso for each souks and to lock it
in<00:01:13.210> you<00:01:13.330> saw<00:01:13.479> what<00:01:13.630> I<00:01:13.659> did<00:01:13.720> there<00:01:14.080> put<00:01:14.560> it<00:01:14.680> in

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
in you saw what I did there put it in

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.800 
in you saw what I did there put it in
the<00:01:14.860> center<00:01:15.280> and<00:01:15.460> then<00:01:15.940> you<00:01:15.970> talk<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.570> left

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
the center and then you talk to the left

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.480 
the center and then you talk to the left
which<00:01:17.710> is<00:01:17.830> a<00:01:17.860> little<00:01:18.070> different<00:01:18.369> than<00:01:18.460> a

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
which is a little different than a

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.399 
which is a little different than a
traditional<00:01:18.610> espresso<00:01:19.240> machine<00:01:19.600> which<00:01:20.259> you

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
traditional espresso machine which you

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.800 
traditional espresso machine which you
would<00:01:20.530> stock<00:01:20.799> from<00:01:21.190> this<00:01:21.399> position<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:22.390> turn

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
would stock from this position and turn

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.100 
would stock from this position and turn
right<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:24.430> we're<00:01:24.520> gonna<00:01:24.640> go<00:01:24.790> ahead

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
right so we're gonna go ahead

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.560 
right so we're gonna go ahead

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
now I'm gonna lift up and then let the

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.780 
now I'm gonna lift up and then let the
chamber<00:02:04.299> fill<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:06.040> grinds<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.490> course

you<00:02:07.000> should<00:02:07.329> notice<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:07.930> start<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.500> slight

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
you should notice I start a slight

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.650 
you should notice I start a slight
dribble<00:02:09.340> from<00:02:09.549> here<00:02:09.880> with<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.269> water<00:02:10.479> being

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
dribble from here with the water being

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.259 
dribble from here with the water being
pushed<00:02:10.959> through<00:02:11.110> with<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.590> boiler<00:02:11.890> pressure

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
pushed through with the boiler pressure

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.580 
pushed through with the boiler pressure
doesn't<00:02:13.269> always<00:02:13.540> happen<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:13.989> this<00:02:14.079> case

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
doesn't always happen in this case

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.080

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
seems that I must have tapped bit too

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.699 
seems that I must have tapped bit too
hard<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:16.540> it's<00:02:16.690> not<00:02:16.780> blowing<00:02:17.320> up<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.650> I'm

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
hard so it's not blowing up and I'm

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.650 
hard so it's not blowing up and I'm
gonna<00:02:17.799> start<00:02:18.040> applying<00:02:18.340> pressure<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:19.510> let

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
gonna start applying pressure to let

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:32.910 
gonna start applying pressure to let
that<00:02:19.810> blow<00:02:20.200> start

let that chamber fill up and I got that

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:54.250 
let that chamber fill up and I got that
force<00:02:44.610> fly<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.670> pressure

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260
