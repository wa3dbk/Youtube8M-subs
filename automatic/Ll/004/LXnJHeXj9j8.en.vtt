fish I put all the seasonings into the
mixture<00:00:21.150> here<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:24.199> the<00:00:25.199> heavy<00:00:25.410> cream<00:00:26.119> with<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
with the Cajun seasoning that's where I

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.490 
with the Cajun seasoning that's where I
season<00:00:39.329> everything<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.750> find<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.320> works

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
season everything I find that it works

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.220 
season everything I find that it works
better<00:00:40.800> than<00:00:41.399> if<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.670> attempt<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.110> season<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
better than if you attempt to season the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.799 
better than if you attempt to season the
fish<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.190> most<00:00:44.430> people<00:00:44.579> don't<00:00:45.059> season<00:00:45.690> it

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
fish and most people don't season it

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.569 
fish and most people don't season it
evenly<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.440> way<00:00:46.590> all<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> seasonings<00:00:47.430> in

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
evenly this way all the seasonings in

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.560 
evenly this way all the seasonings in
the<00:00:47.670> batter<00:00:47.879> that's<00:00:48.690> egg<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.230> heavy<00:00:49.379> cream<00:00:50.570> so

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
the batter that's egg and heavy cream so

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.500 
the batter that's egg and heavy cream so
first<00:00:51.870> we're<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.260> take<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> fish

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
first we're going to take the fish

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.680 
first we're going to take the fish
skinless<00:00:54.510> put<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.440> into<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> flour<00:00:56.480> this<00:00:57.480> way

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
skinless put it into the flour this way

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.450 
skinless put it into the flour this way
the<00:00:57.840> batter<00:00:58.050> will<00:00:58.350> adhere<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> better<00:00:59.190> and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the batter will adhere to it better and

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.029 
the batter will adhere to it better and
then<00:01:00.359> after<00:01:00.719> you're<00:01:00.809> done<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:01.620> all<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.890> that

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
then after you're done with all of that

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.509 
then after you're done with all of that
it's<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.850> fairly<00:01:03.090> simple<00:01:03.210> recipe<00:01:04.019> if<00:01:04.860> there

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it's a fairly simple recipe if there

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.230 
it's a fairly simple recipe if there
that's<00:01:05.670> done<00:01:06.320> then<00:01:07.320> we'll<00:01:07.470> dip<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> into<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
that's done then we'll dip it into the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.399 
that's done then we'll dip it into the
mixture<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.479> cornmeal<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.390> coconut<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> then

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
mixture of cornmeal and coconut and then

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.620 
mixture of cornmeal and coconut and then
we'll<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.650> ahead<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.830> fry<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:17.240> now<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.450> this

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
we'll go ahead and fry it now at this

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.890 
we'll go ahead and fry it now at this
point<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.170> don't<00:01:20.159> use<00:01:20.400> my<00:01:20.430> fingers

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
point I don't use my fingers

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.710 
point I don't use my fingers
just<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.560> put<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.800> fish<00:01:22.980> in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> flower<00:01:23.520> but<00:01:24.480> I

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
just to put the fish in the flower but I

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.450 
just to put the fish in the flower but I
don't<00:01:24.990> want<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> get<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.470> batter<00:01:25.800> with<00:01:26.160> flour

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
don't want to get this batter with flour

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.670 
don't want to get this batter with flour
all<00:01:26.820> over<00:01:26.850> my<00:01:27.180> fingers<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.750> always<00:01:28.140> use<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
all over my fingers so I always use a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.670 
all over my fingers so I always use a
fork<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:30.260> mix<00:01:31.260> things<00:01:33.080> get<00:01:34.080> this<00:01:34.260> coated

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
fork to mix things get this coated

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.540 
fork to mix things get this coated
nicely

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.550 

the<00:01:38.060> next<00:01:38.360> step<00:01:38.510> we're<00:01:38.690> going<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.900> go<00:01:39.050> into<00:01:39.320> the

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
the next step we're going to go into the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.740 
the next step we're going to go into the
cornmeal

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.740 

had<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.500> down<00:01:48.710> nicely

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.660 

now<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.620> first<00:01:52.830> time<00:01:52.980> I'm<00:01:53.040> making<00:01:53.490> this

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
now this the first time I'm making this

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.920 
now this the first time I'm making this
with<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> mixture<00:01:55.050> of<00:01:56.060> coconut<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.540> cornmeal

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
with the mixture of coconut and cornmeal

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.670 
with the mixture of coconut and cornmeal
I<00:01:58.320> think<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.250> work<00:01:59.430> out<00:01:59.610> well<00:01:59.910> so

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
I think it's going to work out well so

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.910 
I think it's going to work out well so
do<00:02:01.680> all<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.010> pieces<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:03.680> press<00:02:04.680> down

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
do all the pieces like this press down

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.999 
do all the pieces like this press down
get<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> good<00:02:06.020> firm<00:02:07.020> coating<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:10.009> that's

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
get a good firm coating on there that's

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.750 
get a good firm coating on there that's
nice<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:12.270> then<00:02:12.630> we're<00:02:12.780> going<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.959> saute<00:02:13.230> it

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
nice and then we're going to saute it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.330 
nice and then we're going to saute it
semi<00:02:14.760> deep-fried<00:02:15.830> well<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.980> breading<00:02:17.280> is

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
semi deep-fried well the breading is

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.000 
semi deep-fried well the breading is
done<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.880> there<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.690> little<00:02:19.590> bit<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
done and there is a little bit of the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.280 
done and there is a little bit of the
cornmeal<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.490> coconut<00:02:21.480> left<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:21.959> this<00:02:22.110> was<00:02:22.260> a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
cornmeal and coconut left so this was a

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.710 
cornmeal and coconut left so this was a
half<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.650> pound<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:23.180> fish<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.480> there's<00:02:24.690> a

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
half a pound of fish and there's a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.020 
half a pound of fish and there's a
batter<00:02:24.959> there<00:02:25.260> too<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.770> would<00:02:26.580> say<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.000> you

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
batter there too I would say that you

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.470 
batter there too I would say that you
could<00:02:27.239> put<00:02:27.390> another<00:02:28.820> not<00:02:29.820> another<00:02:29.850> half<00:02:30.360> a

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
could put another not another half a

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.470 
could put another not another half a
pound<00:02:30.830> but<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.040> batter<00:02:32.370> would<00:02:32.730> be<00:02:32.790> enough<00:02:33.239> for

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
pound but the batter would be enough for

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.430 
pound but the batter would be enough for
a<00:02:33.540> one<00:02:34.050> pound<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.440> fish<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:37.200> would<00:02:37.350> be

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440

smoke<00:06:13.730> so<00:06:14.730> I<00:06:14.760> cut<00:06:15.060> it<00:06:15.180> down<00:06:15.680> just<00:06:16.680> about

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
smoke so I cut it down just about

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.420 
smoke so I cut it down just about
halfway<00:06:17.190> the<00:06:17.580> flame

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.290 

and<00:06:22.760> continue<00:06:23.720> that<00:06:23.900> until<00:06:23.930> it's<00:06:24.410> done<00:06:25.300> I'm

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
and continue that until it's done I'm

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.520 
and continue that until it's done I'm
leaving<00:06:26.600> the<00:06:26.720> flame<00:06:26.990> turned<00:06:27.470> down<00:06:27.710> halfway

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
leaving the flame turned down halfway

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.610 
leaving the flame turned down halfway
because<00:06:31.570> this<00:06:32.570> fish<00:06:32.810> has<00:06:32.840> not<00:06:33.170> cooled<00:06:33.410> off

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
because this fish has not cooled off

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.240 
because this fish has not cooled off
this<00:06:33.800> oil<00:06:34.100> that's<00:06:34.310> cooking<00:06:34.610> just<00:06:34.940> fine<00:06:36.160> and<00:06:37.160> I

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
this oil that's cooking just fine and I

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.610 
this oil that's cooking just fine and I
would<00:06:37.430> say<00:06:37.460> that<00:06:38.020> actually<00:06:39.020> it's<00:06:39.140> enough<00:06:39.440> to

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
would say that actually it's enough to

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.850 
would say that actually it's enough to
two<00:06:39.800> people<00:06:40.870> there's<00:06:41.870> my<00:06:42.170> plate<00:06:44.230> and<00:06:45.230> you're
