00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:12.719
 and well hi the world and mister payong 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.209
 and we find it for a video of a 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.550
 tutorial of how much use and well helped 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.349
 his handicap 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.240
 so first know that to transfer 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.670
 payment of bandits whole range of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.679
 the eclipse and it's very easy to crack 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.880
 calm andy if you want you can 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:32.070
 go see his stuff there is the tutorial 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.180
 how to crack wenger good then 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.670
 season but I will explain the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.130
 video that follows then or use 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.890
 already there is one of his exits so 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.470
 new of your file 20 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.650
 to register when you have filmed so 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:53.130
 there I will choose one you can put 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.340
 in your videos you can choose 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.930
 in fact the program you steal the inter 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.670
 so then you can put the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.100
 icham front window always in front 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.979
 always have the front the program that 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.170
 you install that you generate so if 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.270
 I turn on google for example and that I 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.890
 tick this box such window will be 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.799
 always in front of google or in front of all 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.530
 the other programs then have the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.659
 video would have shortcuts or angers 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.060
 recorded and stop the video moment to 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.119
 woo the little stars and for 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.340
 pause or if it's the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.439
 subtraction terminal then you can 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.579
 tick the box no of what receive 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.249
 so that's to say you do not see 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.319
 your mouse when when you 

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:37.350
 record arts prayed to the little ones 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:39.359
 settings in their eyes the sound we're going to have 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.399
 two sources of the self source 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:44.159
 this windows 7 so that's the sound of my 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.960
 kiss and microphone so that's the sound 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.139
 of the microphone with which you hear the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.670
 voice 

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.350
 after we can do some 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.200
 settings you just have to watch 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.819
 after there are two more micro key areas 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.069
 secondary so that is to say that the 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.130
 two are finding themselves wheel on a 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:01.319
 single audio track and will spend a ton 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.060
 so when you call here his 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.189
 ground recording devices 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.400
 secondary that is to say that this evoked 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.590
 check this box 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.270
 ah, you have to scrounge on me 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.310
 it's my recourse if it's the key 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.470
 additional so we will have to press there 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.820
 for you to hear me that I do not 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.490
 no I do not want to stay in bissau 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.650
 shower by a rate rather nothing so he 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.350
 is the logo then you can add a 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.670
 logo to the video does so when you 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.790
 add you can choose its opacity 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.160
 and that's his incapacity his position where 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.830
 it turns out is obviously the image that 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:41.250
 you want for that's good then my 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:46.480
 format settings are as follows 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.840
 so you put here 720 and then you 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.850
 make 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.510
 ada and then normally it must be 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.320
 actually put in automatically 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.320
 audio adapter then fps 30 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.030
 here I do not want to be here it's 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.130
 thirty thousand obviously but 24 years 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:12.250
 like that it's automatically after he 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:13.900
 is codec is to choose mpeg-1 so holy 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.650
 John who trained that we must check well 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.489
 the webber brb in fact it's a 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.780
 system that when who rules the 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.450
 light intensities so he's not going 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.570
 spend a lot of energy for 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.280
 save a black image 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.140
 so what improves the 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.850
 quality when you have images that 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.019
 asks for a high intensity then 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.840
 quality you love aprilia audio 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.970
 serono channels I have my brain 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.959
 frequency you must well m 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:53.019
 44 cents so voila when 400 orders 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.690
 pcm and then you do ok so that's it 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.330
 after the preselections know ahead 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.730
 like before gold pictures here that's gonna be 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.440
 shortened to capture 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.320
 screen 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.269
 so me that too numeric keypad so the 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.040
 additional touch after he repeated the 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.810
 catch so if you want to do 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.540
 several snapshot as a result 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.670
 so I advise you to check 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.840
 this box no cursor like that when 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.250
 you make a catch 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.720
 san does not show the heart to the organ and the 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.320
 format if you can choose me it's 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.560
 another quality 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:33.080
 after here marked about so at 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.530
 offer these info your your 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.449
 software 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.919
 so me he is hunted down as you see 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:41.750
 already said so then excused me say 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.630
 that but I do not know if you have 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.220
 heard I think that's good then 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.630
 here is something in Spanish I do not know 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.150
 what does it mean 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.790
 had disappointed but if you have the version the 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.229
 French version click here he must 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.270
 to be marked hide so that allows to 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.450
 hide this window there after the garlic is 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.139
 there is the size of your format 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.840
 Registration 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:09.229
 so if I do now 512 it's okay 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.460
 save that some 512 out of 384 of 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.820
 the screen so I'm going to do you go 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.830
 see you see he records doubt the 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.110
 part that I select and I can 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.780
 still move the window while that 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.560
 record I will still deliver 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.729
 in full screen that's how I am 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.380
 then there you can move in 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.820
 using the keyboard keys but 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.740
 me it's easier by doing like 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.570
 that two sliders aulas you can 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.190
 directly when you click on them 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.440
 forms to be told a format quickly done 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:40.760
 you can customize the size of the 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.460
 customize then here that's up is 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.410
 quick to make big or small 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.349
 we were serving store your last 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.349
 format selection and salam is 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:54.800
 automatically then after that it's 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:59.450
 again for the options there was small 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.480
 camera in order to do that little 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.130
 camera 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.960
 these puffs an atony while 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.700
 recording here what is paused 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.370
 here it's to stop recording 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.030
 so I have not if you want to say but there 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.640
 it's the opacity 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:16.240
 so that's where the lighting intensity 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.120
 from a window or if it takes five years 60 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.480
 know how to display a lot less times 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:26.560
 so here I think yes so too 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.180
 when I told you for the tracks 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.280
 audio 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.680
 here when you make two mixed sounds 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.300
 or when you do both are 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.070
 separated so when you do not hide 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.810
 it's both directions and barred so I 'll tell you 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:42.040
 kills to show calm and the gastrointestinal 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.630
 guys this project also crack if you 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.910
 want to do a tutorial if you want that 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.710
 I'm redoing a tutorial how to criticize 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.770
 gastros 12 he says 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:56.350
 otherwise I would not reopen fesci 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:59.920
 like these to take a third then 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:02.440
 why and here it's the audio track of my 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.710
 swing which alas at the track domont 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:12.550
 his screen and if I ever checked the 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:17.260
 case if ever at pq leman if I had if 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.500
 I checked the box mix them in two 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:23.010
 time 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.010
 montier billion seemed given evening 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.850
 this would give circle the two under 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.960
 together there is no track 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.720
 so here I think it's all for 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.250
 for this tutorial then I hope you 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.650
 have appreciated do not hesitate to put in 

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.870
 gm if you had better so me I you

 tell while a video there you and

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.740
 chacha
