00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.890
 Welcome to the geneva course in this class. 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.189
 let's change with the shape objects 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.189
 dynamics 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.990
 let's start creating an object by 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.480
 example a circle on properties for 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.189
 this cycle in the advanced tab 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.970
 we can change its intensity of 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.800
 red lost ozu places values from 0 to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.490
 1 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.380
 let's create three voters in turkey 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.380
 selector that we will call red 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:48.360
 ranging from 0 11 second sector called 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.969
 of green also varying from 0 to 1 and 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.640
 order a third sector and we will call 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.640
 blue and that will also range from zero not 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:09.960
 Let's put them all in 0 and now in 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.570
 circle properties on the basic tab 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.380
 Let's hide your label and on the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.990
 advanced 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.840
 Let's put the name of the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.780
 our red reader after the sector 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.710
 green and finally requested blue on the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.420
 abstained 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.900
 Let's set up the fashion fill 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.900
 to be 100 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.220
 Let's also hide the b and 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.049
 now change the sectors perceive how 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.950
 color will be changed entirely 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.810
 fully green red 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.090
 blue or even combining the sectors 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.170
 red-green getting red yellow 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:01.020
 blue green getting white or still good 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:04.350
 best south getting magenta green blue 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.610
 If we get a year we can change the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.610
 sectors to get the much desired 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.410
 we are the test 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:23.910
 We seek voter call radius r 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:25.620
 of 03 increase of 0.01 let's create 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.300
 three points 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.300
 the abec points 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.290
 we now pass the central circle or the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:42.750
 of radius r centered at v and radius r 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:46.230
 centered on itself is also lightning and let's 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.350
 on properties for the circus we go 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.769
 change your color red green and blue 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.250
 following this exponential function is - 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.250
 a square 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.599
 let's put a version of this function 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.599
 for other things too 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.900
 Let's go now in the other two circuses. 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.160
 these functions by changing the 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.160
 position of each 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.090
 let's now choose all objects 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:33.720
 circus ask to display your dash and 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.840
 encouraging the sector as r 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.440
 world circles your ray to your body 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.440
 will change 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.960
 we passed a new test 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.380
 Let's create some straight lines the first 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:06.240
 stage and gouaches to second and equal - x 0 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.240
 at 0x1 to 0 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.160
 we will now create an industry that will have the 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.220
 let's say t name 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:25.300
 we passed it having a minimum of 0 maximum of 2 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:27.640
 pe with increment of 0.01 we are 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.640
 now a function for example is x 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:34.270
 equal to being x 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.070
 Let's hide this function. 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.960
 let's create a point 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.960
 dt T eff 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.610
 let's now use the 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.150
 reflection and reflect this point on 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.310
 to the straight and gouache after the 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:05:05.800
 point created in relation to the other 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:05:08.500
 following this logic now put the 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.790
 Latvians 0 in point there is how to choose 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:17.350
 properties for all points let's 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:20.950
 prompts to display the stroke and 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:24.550
 colors are from point a to canada 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:26.620
 coordinate y of point a and the full block 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.370
 punctuation modified by the gang in 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.169
 Hight point 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:34.960
 you could have these shapes as you 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:38.370
 Now let's animate the selector and then 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.370
 we will have a figure generated 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.490
 us to the sector 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.640
 pressing against the epp to cherish 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:58.070
 window we will change the function by 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:59.690
 example xbx the block winning dx animated 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.650
 again selector we will have another 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.650
 figure being generated 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.550
 you could generate several figures 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.560
 just changing the chart 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.340
 This was one more class of the course of 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.260
 algebra
