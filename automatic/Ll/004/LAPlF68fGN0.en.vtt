00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.559
 called doomsday which by the way 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.350
 saying did not come on December 21st round 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.330
 today or yesterday but I don't know when 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.750
 lay out this this saw this card because 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.570
 what but now 21 rented well let's see 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.769
 general yes map is made for the site 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.410
 um si double lot . ok what the fuck is that 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.820
 happened no no this can not be 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.149
 I must run the mine until I do not 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.800
 flunked who did not flunked the law 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:50.730
 ok not important to give them a ration you don't know 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:54.449
 the helmet is enchanted ok with if we collect and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.079
 Probably a dream we take by sharpness and 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.660
 recoil alkey and where spent own 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.860
 ben knows spent then must be 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.489
 but apparently they are not okay lan went then 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.320
 down mine 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.100
 I don't know yet 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.250
 Who 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.830
 j dude you wait for it 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:26.520
 cardboard battle with monsters or what is it 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:30.299
 it probably should be included 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.020
 peaceful complexity for it I don't know no 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.140
 the stairs broke it and so should 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.100
 dude okay then why are they 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.590
 comment 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.679
 I have no idea what he was here I 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.319
 I don't know, okay, maybe we should 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:49.440
 that we can get nothing at all 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.630
 not necessary happens but by the way wiggle 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:58.350
 I'll probably remove the camera because I'm so 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:02.340
 it's nicer chtol okay I don't know 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.500
 by the way, too, the tape whether it is necessary, I, I do not 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.860
 I know what to do because I don’t 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.600
 was written 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.730
 you must fight with monsters or just 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.410
 run around there to do some quests 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.410
 Well, most likely quests of course yes 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.280
 performs but but damn and how it is 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.910
 already filled up with what is necessary to survive and 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.920
 make a pickaxe 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.130
 I remember that I put the wooden beams 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:31.049
 whale wood beams slurp so it's on 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.940
 survival card is obtained or ok 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.390
 let's get this 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.570
 cut down survival mode or rather not 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.310
 survival this one here 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.829
 it's hard to not want to bet because 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.230
 why why do it because but not 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.989
 it was written on dick I don’t know 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.560
 ok let's put the workbench do 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.560
 us a pickaxe 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:58.079
 then let's make wooden 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.049
 we are left okay workbench stands here i 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:04.470
 while I'm going to break this passage 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.079
 which fell down and see what's there 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.459
 In general, what is there Sulla I do not know how much 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:16.769
 There at all layers interestingly know yes perishing 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:18.960
 ok ok but maybe we all 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:25.830
 up or maybe even down 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:27.990
 what for what what what is it damn I'm 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:37.890
 Generally in the direction of the cap or maybe 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:39.660
 no ok there is there i found a way to adac 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.290
 it means you need to cut down this garbage 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.650
 are obtained but I did not know honestly 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.650
 guys 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.570
 then pro blue something here they are not 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.890
 obscure and because everything is lit by 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:55.860
 idiot even for protection done ok 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:04:00.090
 a chest that cannot be opened but now 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:07.290
 we'll open it up and up stewed mushrooms okay in 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:08.880
 In principle, we probably go further or or I 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.740
 I don't know, but it seems to me that this 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.080
 suspicious and by the way yes I am for you 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.650
 something found in this output is output 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.110
 let's drive there so 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.770
 let's see what we get there and I see there 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:26.400
 the house should be faster tee to some kind of epic 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.810
 doomsday a and lava lava ok 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.630
 somehow it sounds we go we go 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:38.760
 run-run FPS fell 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.740
 fps rose fps fell rose ok who 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.900
 I lived here, I do not remember, I guess 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:51.840
 a resident who immediately specify the logic and 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:53.820
 ok, why do I take it all I myself do not 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.750
 I know why this is super well, let's go like this 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:01.380
 let us put on our mind take if they take 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.810
 with pretty okay who lived here lived 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.660
 resident awesome toilet 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.130
 very epic in the oven and let's 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.140
 let's take a fig case 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:17.970
 I think useful for verstachok okay okay 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:19.050
 idea if we were there or where there yes 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.360
 here we lived there 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.720
 how could we not know what we are here 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.900
 Neighbor II don't understand the logic of the author of the map 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.849
 but that it is not clear that this is necessary 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.300
 thirty 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:37.789
 meteor ditch seemed to me from monsters well 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:42.020
 okay shovel we have no okay but 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:45.199
 meteors per hour have not see on the floor 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.879
 ok let's try this prikopat that 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:51.830
 can we need to make a shovel 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:57.559
 let's make a spade right from here hey 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:06:00.979
 hey what's from everything's fine now let's do 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:03.169
 stone shovel of course we can not 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:08.240
 all the diamonds we cannot do so 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:11.629
 irochka earring shit baby foot shorter 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.539
 score afford such luxury luxury 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:18.409
 well let me actually have everything 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:24.469
 okay and let's duel okay let's go 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:26.419
 further and there are two doors 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:29.240
 lost consciousness from dude not lost 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:37.719
 consciousness and this is the end 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:37.719
 that's the end ok ok 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:44.479
 guys I stubbed to be honest this 

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:47.059
 it looks like I know what it looks like 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:49.579
 I think it's like a face or something Madame 

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:52.099
 I do not know what kind of madam but really looks like 

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:53.569
 on madame okay okay this is the end judging by 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:55.430
 all and let's read what's next 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:57.679
 if you like the carriage to do 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.589
 continuation well continuation of course 

00:06:57.679 --> 00:07:03.079
 I think it would not hurt because the card 

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:06.860
 generally a little epic in it absolutely 

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:09.709
 No, but they want something epic for me of course 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:13.189
 same but she is so so so honestly 

00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:15.409
 imagine what are we going on if not 

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:19.249
 do no well of course dude 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:22.069
 because honestly this is by itself 

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:25.669
 imagine the design is interesting but the plot 

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:31.629
 pancake the fact that in some house the inhabitant lived 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:34.189
 it's somehow by the captain that they do n't know and 

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:36.199
 but I don't know how to say this. 

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:37.389
 you can actually continue because 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:39.680
 really map 

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:42.200
 at least some attention really 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.970
 deserves and yes and normes
