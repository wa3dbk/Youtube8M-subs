everybody's fished a jig and pig before
and<00:00:01.890> there's<00:00:02.040> no<00:00:02.250> doubt<00:00:02.520> they're<00:00:02.730> very

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
and there's no doubt they're very

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.930 
and there's no doubt they're very
effective<00:00:03.360> as<00:00:03.750> jigs<00:00:04.350> or<00:00:04.589> as<00:00:04.920> swim<00:00:05.310> baits<00:00:05.580> or

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
effective as jigs or as swim baits or

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.870 
effective as jigs or as swim baits or
even<00:00:06.750> as<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.870> topwater<00:00:07.680> baits<00:00:07.950> skimming<00:00:08.790> them

even as a topwater baits skimming them
over<00:00:09.150> mats<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.809> type<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.080> thing<00:00:10.380> but

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
over mats and that type of thing but

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.190 
over mats and that type of thing but
there's<00:00:11.550> definitely<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:12.150> limitation<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.080> the

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
there's definitely a limitation on the

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
a jig head and used as a top water I

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.209 
a jig head and used as a top water I
started<00:00:36.930> by<00:00:37.020> taking<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.469> twin<00:00:37.770> tail<00:00:38.010> design

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
started by taking a twin tail design

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.729 
started by taking a twin tail design
that<00:00:38.670> Larry<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.180> had<00:00:39.300> used<00:00:39.510> for<00:00:39.660> making<00:00:40.559> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
that Larry and I had used for making a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.369 
that Larry and I had used for making a
wiggly<00:00:41.190> tail<00:00:41.510> that<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.660> never<00:00:42.840> really<00:00:43.110> used

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
wiggly tail that we never really used

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.229 
wiggly tail that we never really used
but<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> love<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.129> design<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> tail<00:00:44.969> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
but I love the design of the tail and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.369 
but I love the design of the tail and
I've<00:00:45.329> used<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.930> number<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.230> different

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
I've used it for a number of different

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.869 
I've used it for a number of different
things<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.280> had<00:00:47.430> some<00:00:47.579> different

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
things like you had some different

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.260 
things like you had some different
topwater<00:00:48.360> baits<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.110> type<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.379> thing<00:00:50.270> so

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
topwater baits and that type of thing so

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.290 
topwater baits and that type of thing so
I<00:00:51.300> sculpted<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.960> body<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.910> simple

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
I sculpted a body that was just a simple

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.240 
I sculpted a body that was just a simple
kind<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.660> football<00:00:54.899> shape<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.890> would<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
kind of football shape that would be the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.490 
kind of football shape that would be the
beginning<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.879> jig<00:00:57.329> trailer<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.410> I

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
beginning of a jig trailer and I

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.580 
beginning of a jig trailer and I
attached<00:00:58.920> with<00:00:59.340> sculpey<00:00:59.899> the<00:01:00.899> twin<00:01:01.170> tail<00:01:01.410> that

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
attached with sculpey the twin tail that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.789 
attached with sculpey the twin tail that
I<00:01:01.649> cast<00:01:01.949> out<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.340> resin<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> using<00:01:04.379> modeling

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
I cast out of resin so using modeling

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.190 
I cast out of resin so using modeling
clay<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.189> make<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> flatbed<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.210> lay<00:01:06.600> our<00:01:06.810> jig

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
clay we make a flatbed and lay our jig

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.899 
clay we make a flatbed and lay our jig
trailer<00:01:07.650> into<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> clay<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:10.610> then<00:01:11.610> carefully

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
trailer into the clay and then carefully

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.510 
trailer into the clay and then carefully
sculpt<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.020> clay<00:01:13.350> up<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> halfway<00:01:14.220> point

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
sculpt the clay up to the halfway point

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.870 
sculpt the clay up to the halfway point
around<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.450> lure<00:01:15.979> this<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.189> going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.430> act<00:01:17.640> as

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
around the lure this is going to act as

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.300 
around the lure this is going to act as
a<00:01:17.909> second<00:01:18.450> half<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.900> our<00:01:18.990> mold<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.009> pour

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
a second half of our mold so we can pour

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.219 
a second half of our mold so we can pour
the<00:01:20.490> first<00:01:20.729> half

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.890 

once<00:01:24.159> we<00:01:24.280> have<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:24.490> trailer<00:01:24.700> clade<00:01:25.119> up<00:01:25.299> we<00:01:25.750> can

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
once we have the trailer clade up we can

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.359 
once we have the trailer clade up we can
strike<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.259> mold<00:01:26.530> box<00:01:26.740> using<00:01:27.189> some

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
strike the mold box using some

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.660 
strike the mold box using some
corrugated<00:01:27.700> plastic<00:01:28.860> some<00:01:29.860> super<00:01:30.189> glue<00:01:30.369> and

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
corrugated plastic some super glue and

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.560 
corrugated plastic some super glue and
some<00:01:31.060> hot<00:01:31.299> melt<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.720> seal<00:01:31.930> it<00:01:32.080> to<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.320> bottom

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.020 

then<00:01:38.020> we<00:01:38.200> make<00:01:38.380> some<00:01:38.409> locators<00:01:39.190> so<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.850> two

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
then we make some locators so the two

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.750 
then we make some locators so the two
halves<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.540> mold<00:01:40.750> will<00:01:40.960> align<00:01:41.430> mix<00:01:42.430> up<00:01:42.610> our

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
halves the mold will align mix up our

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.300 
halves the mold will align mix up our
quick-set<00:01:43.360> silicone<00:01:43.930> rubber<00:01:44.200> mixed<00:01:45.100> in<00:01:45.220> a

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
quick-set silicone rubber mixed in a

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.080 
quick-set silicone rubber mixed in a
ten-to-one<00:01:45.820> by<00:01:46.210> weight<00:01:46.450> ratio<00:01:47.700> once<00:01:48.700> we<00:01:48.880> mix

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
ten-to-one by weight ratio once we mix

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.790 
ten-to-one by weight ratio once we mix
it<00:01:49.300> thoroughly<00:01:49.510> we<00:01:50.110> go<00:01:50.229> ahead<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.470> pour<00:01:50.770> it

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
it thoroughly we go ahead and pour it

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.550 
it thoroughly we go ahead and pour it
slowly<00:01:51.040> into<00:01:51.550> our<00:01:51.670> mold<00:01:51.910> box<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:53.140> then<00:01:53.380> let<00:01:53.530> it

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
slowly into our mold box and then let it

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.150 
slowly into our mold box and then let it
cure<00:01:53.860> overnight<00:01:55.229> once<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.350> quick<00:01:56.560> set<00:01:56.770> is<00:01:56.860> cured

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
cure overnight once a quick set is cured
