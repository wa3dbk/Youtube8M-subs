00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.619 

trying<00:00:00.690> to<00:00:00.780> get<00:00:00.900> a<00:00:00.930> good<00:00:01.140> idea<00:00:01.199> of<00:00:02.179> how<00:00:03.179> this<00:00:03.449> is

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
trying to get a good idea of how this is

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.619 
trying to get a good idea of how this is
all<00:00:03.810> going<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.410> go<00:00:04.680> together<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.540> what<00:00:06.540> I'll

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
all going to go together and what I'll

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.509 
all going to go together and what I'll
probably<00:00:06.779> do<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.319> set<00:00:07.560> everything<00:00:07.980> up<00:00:08.099> just

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
probably do is set everything up just

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.610 
probably do is set everything up just
tack<00:00:08.940> weld<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.389> together<00:00:09.570> just<00:00:10.290> with<00:00:10.440> little

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
tack weld it together just with little

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.690 
tack weld it together just with little
blitz<00:00:11.010> from<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.400> welding<00:00:13.309> welding<00:00:14.309> machine

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
blitz from the welding welding machine

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.359 
blitz from the welding welding machine
and<00:00:15.030> then<00:00:15.509> I'll<00:00:15.690> put<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.619> wheels<00:00:16.830> on<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.130> and

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
and then I'll put the wheels on it and

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.950 
and then I'll put the wheels on it and
make<00:00:17.730> sure<00:00:17.760> everything<00:00:18.330> works<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.750> then<00:00:18.869> if

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
make sure everything works and then if

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.599 
make sure everything works and then if
it<00:00:19.080> does<00:00:19.260> I'll<00:00:19.439> finish<00:00:19.619> welding<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.430> that's

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
it does I'll finish welding it so that's

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:29.439 
it does I'll finish welding it so that's
kind<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.910> what<00:00:21.060> I'm<00:00:21.180> doing<00:00:21.449> right<00:00:21.600> now

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.350 

measuring<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.599> three<00:00:34.579> let's<00:00:35.579> see<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.180> is

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
measuring in three let's see this is

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.660 
measuring in three let's see this is
this<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.140> be<00:00:37.640> three<00:00:38.640> and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
this is going to be three and

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.440 
this is going to be three and
three-quarters

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
three-quarters

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.900 
three-quarters
three<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.600> three-quarters<00:00:43.640> I'll<00:00:44.640> measure

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
three and three-quarters I'll measure

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.200 
three and three-quarters I'll measure
those<00:00:45.239> with<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> line<00:00:45.780> here<00:00:46.610> using<00:00:47.610> my<00:00:47.640> silver

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
those with a line here using my silver

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.279 
those with a line here using my silver
sharpie<00:00:51.440> now<00:00:52.440> I've<00:00:52.710> determined<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:54.960> want

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
sharpie now I've determined that I want

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.889 
sharpie now I've determined that I want
the<00:00:55.469> back<00:00:55.680> pipe<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.910> back<00:00:57.120> pipes<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.719> back

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the back pipe the back pipes the back

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.380 
the back pipe the back pipes the back
widths<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.739> 23<00:00:59.250> inches<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.820> I've<00:00:59.940> actually

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
widths to be 23 inches and I've actually

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:08.180 
widths to be 23 inches and I've actually
written<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.410> down<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> table<00:01:02.520> here

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.460 

that's<00:01:09.190> just<00:01:09.520> about<00:01:09.790> what<00:01:10.000> I've<00:01:10.210> got<00:01:10.420> 23<00:01:11.229> right

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
that's just about what I've got 23 right

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.320 
that's just about what I've got 23 right
there<00:01:14.370> and<00:01:15.370> this<00:01:15.580> is<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.820> kind<00:01:15.970> of<00:01:16.090> thing<00:01:16.300> that

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
there and this is the kind of thing that

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.469 
there and this is the kind of thing that
can<00:01:16.810> take<00:01:17.050> quite<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.409> while<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:19.000> basically

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
can take quite a while and basically

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.030 
can take quite a while and basically
drive<00:01:19.840> you<00:01:20.050> out<00:01:20.229> of<00:01:20.350> your<00:01:20.530> mind

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
drive you out of your mind

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.240 
drive you out of your mind
once<00:01:22.030> you<00:01:22.240> get<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.950> you'll<00:01:24.100> have<00:01:24.220> a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
once you get it then you'll have a

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.130 
once you get it then you'll have a
pretty<00:01:24.610> good<00:01:25.500> you'll<00:01:26.500> have<00:01:26.650> a<00:01:26.680> frame<00:01:27.100> that's

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
pretty good you'll have a frame that's

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.270 
pretty good you'll have a frame that's
not<00:01:29.140> going<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.410> start<00:01:29.710> going<00:01:29.890> around<00:01:30.160> in

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
not going to start going around in

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:40.360 
not going to start going around in
circles<00:01:30.310> by<00:01:30.880> itself<00:01:31.229> now<00:01:32.229> I<00:01:32.259> got<00:01:32.500> 71

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.440 

this<00:01:40.970> triangulation<00:01:41.600> only<00:01:42.410> works<00:01:43.450> that's

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
this triangulation only works that's

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.710 
this triangulation only works that's
perfect<00:01:45.140> this<00:01:46.130> triangulation<00:01:46.730> only<00:01:47.480> works<00:01:47.950> if

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
perfect this triangulation only works if

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.710 
perfect this triangulation only works if
you<00:01:50.720> measure<00:01:51.110> these<00:01:51.470> two<00:01:51.770> sides<00:01:52.600> in<00:01:53.600> other

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
you measure these two sides in other

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.840 
you measure these two sides in other
words<00:01:53.960> this<00:01:54.230> distance<00:01:54.830> from<00:01:55.040> here<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.730> end

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
words this distance from here to the end

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.150 
words this distance from here to the end
has<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.450> be<00:01:56.750> identical<00:01:57.380> from<00:01:57.590> here<00:01:57.860> to<00:01:58.040> the

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
has to be identical from here to the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.640 
has to be identical from here to the
other<00:01:58.190> end<00:01:58.780> otherwise<00:01:59.780> it<00:02:00.050> really<00:02:00.260> won't<00:02:00.440> work

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
other end otherwise it really won't work

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.400 
other end otherwise it really won't work
so<00:02:00.680> before<00:02:01.460> you<00:02:01.700> do<00:02:02.000> your<00:02:02.210> triangulation<00:02:03.200> make

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
so before you do your triangulation make

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.430 
so before you do your triangulation make
sure<00:02:03.620> that<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:04.790> disk<00:02:05.120> these<00:02:05.690> distances

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
sure that the this disk these distances

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:25.179 
sure that the this disk these distances
are<00:02:06.700> identical<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:07.850> that's<00:02:08.240> what<00:02:08.420> we've<00:02:08.570> done

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.699 

I've<00:02:26.189> got<00:02:26.400> my<00:02:26.549> frame<00:02:26.819> ready<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.709> finally

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
I've got my frame ready I finally

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.729 
I've got my frame ready I finally
adjusted<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.730> side<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.030> side<00:02:30.269> so<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:30.840> my<00:02:31.140> my

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
adjusted it side to side so that my my

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.000 
adjusted it side to side so that my my
cross<00:02:32.069> triangulation<00:02:33.000> works<00:02:33.530> I've<00:02:34.530> got<00:02:34.799> my

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
cross triangulation works I've got my

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.130 
cross triangulation works I've got my
width<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.970> front<00:02:36.239> of<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.390> frame<00:02:36.569> narrowed

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
width of the front of the frame narrowed

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.110 
width of the front of the frame narrowed
here<00:02:37.409> so<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.799> when<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.099> tires<00:02:38.400> turn<00:02:38.819> they

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
here so that when the tires turn they

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.479 
here so that when the tires turn they
don't<00:02:39.269> hit<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.599> frame<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.079> hope<00:02:40.409> we'll<00:02:41.400> find

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
don't hit the frame I hope we'll find

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.509 
don't hit the frame I hope we'll find
out<00:02:41.909> and<00:02:42.209> what<00:02:42.989> I'm<00:02:43.079> going<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.260> do<00:02:43.440> now<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.829> I've

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
out and what I'm going to do now is I've

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.039 
out and what I'm going to do now is I've
also<00:02:44.819> fish<00:02:45.510> mouth<00:02:45.780> these<00:02:46.680> tubes<00:02:47.659> so<00:02:48.659> that<00:02:48.840> we

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
also fish mouth these tubes so that we

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.530 
also fish mouth these tubes so that we
get<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.230> nice<00:02:49.470> fit<00:02:49.799> here<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.370> now<00:02:51.209> I'm<00:02:51.269> going<00:02:51.420> to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
get a nice fit here and now I'm going to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:32.020 
get a nice fit here and now I'm going to
tack<00:02:51.690> weld<00:02:51.959> it

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.130 

okay<00:03:33.030> now<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.450> frame<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.290> nicely<00:03:35.250> tapped<00:03:36.019> if<00:03:37.019> I

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140

wouldn't<00:03:39.599> be<00:03:39.750> too<00:03:39.930> hard<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.730> don't<00:03:41.730> think<00:03:42.060> I'll

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
wouldn't be too hard I don't think I'll

wouldn't be too hard I don't think I'll
have<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:43.040> but<00:03:44.040> I'm<00:03:44.129> going<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.370> put<00:03:44.549> some<00:03:44.730> wheels

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
on it and look at it before I final weld

00:03:48.959 --> 00:04:21.230 
on it and look at it before I final weld
the<00:03:49.170> whole<00:03:49.380> frame

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:21.240 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.390 

but<00:04:22.240> in<00:04:22.450> terms<00:04:22.750> of<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.080> wheel<00:04:23.890> hitting<00:04:24.310> the

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
but in terms of it wheel hitting the

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.950

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
think about putting in these these

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.750 
think about putting in these these
bearing<00:04:31.120> hangers<00:04:31.480> here
