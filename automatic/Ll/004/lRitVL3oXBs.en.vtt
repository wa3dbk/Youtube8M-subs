00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
I have been vegan for I guess about

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.660 
I have been vegan for I guess about
three<00:00:04.380> weeks<00:00:05.009> now<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:06.140> I<00:00:07.220> have<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.370> say<00:00:08.400> it

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
three weeks now and I have to say it

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.000 
three weeks now and I have to say it
hasn't<00:00:08.880> been<00:00:09.210> too<00:00:09.840> bad<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.440> thought<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.920> was

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
hasn't been too bad I thought it was

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.709 
hasn't been too bad I thought it was
going<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.280> be<00:00:11.429> difficult<00:00:11.730> for<00:00:12.000> me<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.360> not<00:00:12.509> eat

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
going to be difficult for me to not eat

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.490 
going to be difficult for me to not eat
meat<00:00:13.160> or<00:00:14.160> any<00:00:14.549> like<00:00:14.880> animal<00:00:15.780> based<00:00:15.929> products

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
really explored to too much into the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.149 
really explored to too much into the
vegan<00:01:08.130> world<00:01:08.310> um<00:01:09.260> but<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.320> plan<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.860> because

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159

vegan world um but I plan on it because
you<00:01:11.220> know<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:11.790> probably<00:01:12.000> gonna<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
you know I'm probably gonna do it for a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.620 
you know I'm probably gonna do it for a
while<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.049> set<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.740> do<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.250> month<00:01:14.630> but

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
while I set out to do it for a month but

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.660 
while I set out to do it for a month but
i<00:01:15.689> think<00:01:16.020> i<00:01:16.640> may<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.850> longer<00:01:18.240> than<00:01:18.600> that

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
i think i may do it longer than that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
i think i may do it longer than that
after<00:01:20.670> watching<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:22.049> video<00:01:22.170> why<00:01:22.560> should<00:01:22.740> i

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.199 
um and but that's cuz i also meant eaten
a<00:02:13.099> lot<00:02:13.130> of<00:02:13.370> fridays<00:02:13.790> i<00:02:13.910> think<00:02:14.090> i<00:02:14.150> should

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
a lot of fridays i think i should

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.710 
a lot of fridays i think i should
probably<00:02:14.510> not<00:02:14.750> do<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.080> um<00:02:15.790> but<00:02:16.790> um<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.569> I

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
probably not do that um but um and I

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.420 
probably not do that um but um and I
haven't<00:02:18.019> been<00:02:18.110> super<00:02:18.590> consistent<00:02:18.830> with<00:02:19.280> my

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
haven't been super consistent with my

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.400 
haven't been super consistent with my
work<00:02:19.640> out<00:02:19.819> either<00:02:20.030> so<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:20.690> think<00:02:20.959> once<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.230> get

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
work out either so I think once I get

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.699 
work out either so I think once I get
super<00:02:21.800> consistent<00:02:22.069> with<00:02:22.310> my<00:02:22.430> workout<00:02:22.819> um

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
super consistent with my workout um

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.650 
super consistent with my workout um
eating<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:25.010> little<00:02:25.160> bit<00:02:25.400> more<00:02:25.670> clean<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.450> little

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
eating a little bit more clean a little

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.050 
eating a little bit more clean a little
bit<00:02:26.810> more<00:02:26.989> fresh<00:02:27.640> vegetables<00:02:28.640> rather<00:02:28.880> than

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
bit more fresh vegetables rather than

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.150 
bit more fresh vegetables rather than
cooked<00:02:29.330> vegetables<00:02:29.900> I'm<00:02:30.650> going<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.920> get<00:02:31.010> back

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
cooked vegetables I'm going to get back

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.100 
cooked vegetables I'm going to get back
into<00:02:31.310> my<00:02:31.519> juicing<00:02:31.970> then<00:02:32.269> I<00:02:32.360> probably<00:02:32.569> see<00:02:32.900> a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
into my juicing then I probably see a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.140 
into my juicing then I probably see a
little<00:02:33.350> bit<00:02:33.500> quicker<00:02:33.739> results<00:02:34.040> with<00:02:34.640> weight

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
little bit quicker results with weight

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.940 
little bit quicker results with weight
loss<00:02:35.180> or<00:02:35.600> whatever<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.530> good<00:02:36.739> thing<00:02:36.769> is

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
loss or whatever but the good thing is

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.620 
loss or whatever but the good thing is
