00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:32.539 
see with its little point will just
reach<00:03:23.620> into<00:03:23.980> those<00:03:24.430> areas<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:29.340> give<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.609> that

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
reach into those areas and give you that

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.960 
reach into those areas and give you that
blending<00:03:33.549> touch<00:03:33.970> in<00:03:34.690> there<00:03:35.109> that<00:03:36.099> is<00:03:38.970> so

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
blending touch in there that is so

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.930 
blending touch in there that is so
useful<00:03:40.269> in<00:03:40.930> small<00:03:41.410> areas<00:03:42.069> and<00:03:42.340> with<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.730> Point

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
useful in small areas and with the Point

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.110 
useful in small areas and with the Point
C<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:47.260> can<00:03:47.470> just<00:03:47.709> get<00:03:47.889> into<00:03:48.190> all<00:03:48.819> those<00:03:49.060> little

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
C you can just get into all those little

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.800

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.210 

now<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:25.950> might<00:04:26.460> blend<00:04:26.940> with<00:04:27.330> this<00:04:27.540> brush

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
now you might blend with this brush

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:36.550 
now you might blend with this brush
let's<00:04:29.220> say<00:04:29.520> we<00:04:29.730> have<00:04:29.970> an<00:04:30.150> area<00:04:30.450> of<00:04:34.610> color<00:04:35.610> and

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
let's say we have an area of color and

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:50.070 
let's say we have an area of color and
you<00:04:37.560> want<00:04:37.890> to<00:04:42.980> add<00:04:43.980> a<00:04:44.040> shadow

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.610 

or<00:04:50.789> I'm<00:04:51.789> gonna<00:04:52.000> do<00:04:52.240> it<00:04:52.389> by<00:04:52.690> you<00:04:52.990> know<00:04:53.020> picking

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
or I'm gonna do it by you know picking

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.350 
or I'm gonna do it by you know picking
up<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.949> one<00:04:54.099> color<00:04:54.340> putting<00:04:54.789> it<00:04:54.879> on<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.240> then

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
up the one color putting it on and then

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.749 
up the one color putting it on and then
picking<00:04:55.780> up<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.139> other<00:04:56.319> color<00:04:56.650> but<00:04:56.919> you<00:04:57.520> could

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
picking up the other color but you could

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:03.089 
picking up the other color but you could
double<00:04:58.120> load<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:59.830> know<00:04:59.949> by<00:05:00.099> tipping<00:05:01.979> see<00:05:02.979> how

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
double load you know by tipping see how

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.180 
double load you know by tipping see how
you<00:05:03.190> can<00:05:03.430> blend<00:05:03.729> that<00:05:03.940> down<00:05:04.270> in<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:05.560> advantage

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
you can blend that down in the advantage

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:13.469 
you can blend that down in the advantage
of<00:05:06.400> your<00:05:06.550> blender<00:05:07.860> suite<00:05:08.860> ones<00:05:09.099> is

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.769 

the<00:05:13.960> shortness<00:05:14.499> of<00:05:14.650> your<00:05:14.830> blender<00:05:15.419> is<00:05:16.419> the

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779 
the shortness of your blender is the

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:20.159 
the shortness of your blender is the
touch<00:05:17.020> of<00:05:17.259> the<00:05:17.349> brush<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:18.240> even<00:05:19.240> if<00:05:19.809> you're

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
touch of the brush and even if you're

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.939 
touch of the brush and even if you're
working<00:05:20.409> with<00:05:20.919> a<00:05:20.949> fast<00:05:21.400> drying<00:05:21.819> medium<00:05:22.949> and

working with a fast drying medium and

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:29.969 
working with a fast drying medium and
paint<00:05:26.939> this<00:05:28.050> stiffness<00:05:29.050> of<00:05:29.289> this<00:05:29.620> little

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
paint this stiffness of this little

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:37.409 
paint this stiffness of this little
point<00:05:33.839> will<00:05:34.839> let<00:05:35.110> you<00:05:35.349> keep<00:05:35.620> blending<00:05:36.419> and

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
point will let you keep blending and

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:50.860 
point will let you keep blending and
blending

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.110 

now<00:05:51.800> you<00:05:51.860> can<00:05:52.130> leave<00:05:52.340> it<00:05:52.520> as<00:05:52.610> rough<00:05:52.940> as<00:05:53.090> you

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
now you can leave it as rough as you

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.890 
now you can leave it as rough as you
want<00:05:54.550> for<00:05:55.550> the<00:05:55.669> last<00:05:55.910> couple<00:05:56.120> years<00:05:56.360> we're

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
want for the last couple years we're

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.040 
want for the last couple years we're
using<00:05:57.139> a<00:05:57.380> lot<00:05:57.620> more<00:05:58.120> texture<00:05:59.120> and<00:05:59.510> things<00:05:59.780> into

using a lot more texture and things into
our<00:06:00.410> our<00:06:00.650> stroke<00:06:01.310> work<00:06:04.630> it'll<00:06:05.630> come<00:06:05.900> in

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
our our stroke work it'll come in

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.280 
our our stroke work it'll come in
several<00:06:06.470> sizes<00:06:06.740> to<00:06:07.550> start<00:06:07.880> with<00:06:08.120> and<00:06:09.020> then

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
several sizes to start with and then

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.890 
several sizes to start with and then
we'll<00:06:09.440> listen<00:06:09.770> to<00:06:10.220> your<00:06:10.430> responses<00:06:11.360> to<00:06:11.660> the

we'll listen to your responses to the

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.469 
we'll listen to your responses to the
brush<00:06:12.199> and<00:06:13.870> determine<00:06:14.870> whether<00:06:15.110> we<00:06:15.410> need<00:06:16.479> more

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
brush and determine whether we need more

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:22.090 
brush and determine whether we need more

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
sizes the large size especially is going

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.920 
sizes the large size especially is going
to<00:06:22.250> be<00:06:22.750> expensive<00:06:23.979> it<00:06:24.979> may<00:06:25.430> be<00:06:25.570> when<00:06:26.570> it<00:06:26.690> goes

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
to be expensive it may be when it goes

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.219 
to be expensive it may be when it goes
to<00:06:27.350> the<00:06:27.500> large<00:06:27.860> size<00:06:28.330> that<00:06:29.330> you<00:06:29.660> would<00:06:29.870> prefer

there<00:06:54.350> will<00:06:54.710> be<00:06:54.740> a<00:06:55.490> domed<00:06:56.180> round<00:06:57.139> blender<00:06:58.840> it's

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
there will be a domed round blender it's

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.590 
there will be a domed round blender it's
coming<00:07:00.350> in<00:07:00.500> at<00:07:00.620> the<00:07:00.770> same<00:07:01.039> time<00:07:01.100> and<00:07:01.850> again

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
look at the bristles I still got water

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:11.860 
look at the bristles I still got water
in<00:07:10.130> this<00:07:10.400> one<00:07:10.610> because<00:07:10.700> I<00:07:10.940> was<00:07:11.090> using<00:07:11.389> it<00:07:11.690> this

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 
in this one because I was using it this

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.580 
in this one because I was using it this
morning<00:07:12.139> but<00:07:12.950> see<00:07:13.280> the<00:07:14.090> they're<00:07:14.690> shorter<00:07:15.200> here
