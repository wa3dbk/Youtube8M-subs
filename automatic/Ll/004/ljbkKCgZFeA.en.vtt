hello<00:00:14.920> today<00:00:15.519> we're<00:00:15.639> going<00:00:15.759> to<00:00:15.820> look<00:00:15.879> at<00:00:16.090> a

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
hello today we're going to look at a

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.529 
hello today we're going to look at a
long<00:00:16.960> sweeping<00:00:17.680> exercise<00:00:18.340> it's<00:00:18.910> based<00:00:19.150> on<00:00:19.390> the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
long sweeping exercise it's based on the

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.060 
long sweeping exercise it's based on the
building<00:00:20.020> blocks<00:00:20.230> that<00:00:20.320> we<00:00:20.410> saw<00:00:20.650> last<00:00:20.830> week

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
building blocks that we saw last week

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.720 
building blocks that we saw last week
last<00:00:21.670> week<00:00:21.759> we<00:00:21.970> saw<00:00:22.770> C<00:00:23.770> major<00:00:23.919> a<00:00:24.070> minor<00:00:24.250> I<00:00:24.490> think

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
last week we saw C major a minor I think

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.319 
last week we saw C major a minor I think
it<00:00:24.820> was<00:00:25.140> just<00:00:26.140> one<00:00:26.200> arpeggio<00:00:26.800> in<00:00:26.980> well<00:00:27.340> on<00:00:27.849> the

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
it was just one arpeggio in well on the

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:35.220 
it was just one arpeggio in well on the
front<00:00:29.079> on<00:00:29.470> the<00:00:29.560> fifth<00:00:29.739> string<00:00:31.379> for<00:00:32.379> major<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
front on the fifth string for major and

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.079 
front on the fifth string for major and
for<00:00:35.410> minor<00:00:35.620> so<00:00:36.220> I'm<00:00:36.339> going<00:00:36.489> to<00:00:36.519> combine<00:00:36.699> them

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:37.089 
for minor so I'm going to combine them

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:39.420 
for minor so I'm going to combine them
in<00:00:37.239> a<00:00:37.330> way<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:37.780> fits<00:00:38.080> a<00:00:38.350> major<00:00:38.530> scale<00:00:38.800> as<00:00:39.309> you

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
in a way that fits a major scale as you

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.040 
in a way that fits a major scale as you
know<00:00:39.580> a<00:00:39.790> major<00:00:40.030> scales<00:00:40.330> are<00:00:40.570> made<00:00:40.720> of<00:00:40.809> seven

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
know a major scales are made of seven

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.840 
know a major scales are made of seven
notes<00:00:41.230> and<00:00:41.620> for<00:00:42.070> each<00:00:42.160> of<00:00:42.280> these<00:00:42.370> seven<00:00:42.670> notes

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
notes and for each of these seven notes

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.150 
notes and for each of these seven notes
you<00:00:42.970> can<00:00:43.030> build<00:00:43.360> a<00:00:43.480> chord<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.800> if<00:00:44.890> you're<00:00:45.010> born

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
you can build a chord so if you're born

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.520 
you can build a chord so if you're born
in<00:00:45.250> C<00:00:45.430> major<00:00:45.579> we<00:00:45.879> would<00:00:46.030> have<00:00:46.210> C<00:00:46.839> major<00:00:46.989> D<00:00:47.199> minor

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
in C major we would have C major D minor

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.210 
in C major we would have C major D minor
E<00:00:47.920> minor<00:00:47.949> F<00:00:48.460> major<00:00:48.820> G<00:00:49.479> major<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:50.199> minor<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:50.920> B

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
E minor F major G major a minor and B

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.149 
E minor F major G major a minor and B
diminished<00:00:51.460> now<00:00:52.299> since<00:00:53.110> C<00:00:53.680> major<00:00:53.830> that<00:00:54.129> is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
diminished now since C major that is

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:56.369 
diminished now since C major that is
actually<00:00:54.549> the<00:00:54.699> very<00:00:54.879> beginning<00:00:55.299> of<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.570> of

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
actually the very beginning of the of

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:57.990 
actually the very beginning of the of
the<00:00:56.589> neck<00:00:56.799> it<00:00:57.220> would<00:00:57.339> be<00:00:57.430> like<00:00:57.670> to<00:00:57.760> be<00:00:57.790> like

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
the neck it would be like to be like

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.759 
the neck it would be like to be like
this

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
this

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.169 
this
open<00:01:00.769> strings<00:01:01.100> we're<00:01:01.550> going<00:01:01.699> to<00:01:01.789> start<00:01:02.030> from

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
open strings we're going to start from

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:03.040 
open strings we're going to start from
the<00:01:02.300> second<00:01:02.629> chord

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
the second chord

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.950 
the second chord
it's<00:01:03.170> from<00:01:03.559> DM<00:01:04.159> ad<00:01:04.430> minor<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:05.600> then<00:01:05.780> all<00:01:05.869> we

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
it's from DM ad minor and then all we

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.840 
it's from DM ad minor and then all we
have<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.170> do<00:01:06.259> is<00:01:06.380> simply<00:01:06.530> do<00:01:07.189> D<00:01:07.369> minor<00:01:07.610> E<00:01:07.759> minor

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
have to do is simply do D minor E minor

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.179 
have to do is simply do D minor E minor
and<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:08.810> on<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.290> when<00:01:09.560> we<00:01:09.590> get<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:09.860> see<00:01:10.040> mate

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
and so on and when we get to see mate

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.460 
and so on and when we get to see mate
you're<00:01:10.369> going<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.610> go<00:01:10.820> one<00:01:11.420> further<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:12.170> go

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
you're going to go one further and go

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.770 
you're going to go one further and go
back<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.130> D<00:01:13.250> minor<00:01:13.490> all<00:01:14.149> right<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.570> core

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
back to D minor all right so the core

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:22.100 
back to D minor all right so the core
gonna<00:01:14.960> look<00:01:15.110> to<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.380> deck<00:01:15.649> today<00:01:15.979> our<00:01:16.930> D<00:01:17.930> minor

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:37.140 

a<00:01:23.110> minor<00:01:27.030> F<00:01:28.030> major<00:01:28.090> G<00:01:30.150> major<00:01:31.150> a<00:01:33.270> minor<00:01:36.150> big

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
a minor F major G major a minor big

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.450 
a minor F major G major a minor big
minute<00:01:39.720> C<00:01:40.720> major

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
minute C major

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.830 
minute C major
I<00:01:42.520> demand<00:01:44.940> as<00:01:45.940> you<00:01:46.090> can<00:01:46.240> see<00:01:46.420> we're<00:01:46.630> in<00:01:46.659> the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
I demand as you can see we're in the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.180 
I demand as you can see we're in the
scale<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.170> C<00:01:47.440> major<00:01:47.619> we're<00:01:47.890> only<00:01:48.010> using

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
scale of C major we're only using

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.149 
scale of C major we're only using
natural<00:01:48.700> notes<00:01:48.940> but<00:01:49.690> since<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.619> second<00:01:50.950> core

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
natural notes but since the second core

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.670 
natural notes but since the second core
is<00:01:51.280> D<00:01:51.760> it's<00:01:52.030> much<00:01:52.210> easier<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.540> play<00:01:52.780> rather

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
is D it's much easier to play rather

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.680 
is D it's much easier to play rather
than<00:01:53.800> using<00:01:54.190> C<00:01:54.520> with<00:01:54.670> open<00:01:54.909> strings<00:01:55.210> then

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
than using C with open strings then

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.289 
than using C with open strings then
we'll<00:01:55.840> start<00:01:55.990> from<00:01:56.140> there<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.530> we'll<00:01:56.860> do<00:01:57.299> D

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
we'll start from there and we'll do D

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.820 
we'll start from there and we'll do D
minor<00:01:58.509> E<00:01:58.720> minor<00:01:58.750> and<00:01:59.290> so<00:01:59.560> on

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
minor E minor and so on

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.499 
minor E minor and so on
and<00:01:59.920> then<00:02:00.159> go<00:02:00.250> back<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.520> D<00:02:00.640> minor<00:02:01.030> now<00:02:01.330> this

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
and then go back to D minor now this

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.969 
and then go back to D minor now this
exercise<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.960> not<00:02:02.080> really<00:02:02.350> music<00:02:02.680> well<00:02:02.830> I<00:02:02.860> mean

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
exercise is not really music well I mean

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.740 
exercise is not really music well I mean
there<00:02:03.100> are<00:02:03.310> people<00:02:03.520> who<00:02:03.640> actually<00:02:03.880> play<00:02:04.360> solos

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
there are people who actually play solos

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.510 
there are people who actually play solos
with<00:02:04.869> this<00:02:04.990> stuff<00:02:05.170> just<00:02:05.200> playing<00:02:05.649> chords<00:02:06.070> and

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
with this stuff just playing chords and

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.880 
with this stuff just playing chords and
their<00:02:06.729> arpeggios<00:02:07.119> up<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.420> down<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.659> neck<00:02:07.690> I<00:02:08.050> I

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
their arpeggios up and down the neck I I

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.859 
their arpeggios up and down the neck I I
don't<00:02:09.190> quite<00:02:09.610> subscribe<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.270> that<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.600> think

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
don't quite subscribe to that I think

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.470 
don't quite subscribe to that I think
it's<00:02:11.050> much<00:02:11.319> more<00:02:11.440> interesting<00:02:11.680> if<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.010> use

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
it's much more interesting if you use

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.820 
it's much more interesting if you use
arpeggio<00:02:13.480> techniques<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:14.290> imply<00:02:14.650> different

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
arpeggio techniques to imply different

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.890 
arpeggio techniques to imply different
chords<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.550> different<00:02:15.910> modes<00:02:16.090> but<00:02:16.630> this<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.870> a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
chords and different modes but this is a

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.660 
chords and different modes but this is a
good<00:02:17.080> exercise<00:02:17.530> because<00:02:17.650> it's<00:02:18.190> based<00:02:18.489> on

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
good exercise because it's based on

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.900 
good exercise because it's based on
simple<00:02:19.330> blocks<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.260> will<00:02:20.350> allow<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.590> to

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
simple blocks and it will allow you to

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.180 
simple blocks and it will allow you to
really<00:02:21.910> get<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.150> technique<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:23.830> know<00:02:23.950> into

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
really get the technique you know into

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.460 
really get the technique you know into
your<00:02:24.340> fingers<00:02:24.640> then<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.239> can<00:02:25.390> move<00:02:25.480> on<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:26.320> do

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
your fingers then you can move on to do

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.320 
your fingers then you can move on to do
more<00:02:27.310> melodic<00:02:27.489> stuff<00:02:27.820> that<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.000> can<00:02:28.150> see

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
more melodic stuff that you can see

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.030 
more melodic stuff that you can see
these<00:02:28.690> videos<00:02:29.050> usually<00:02:29.410> are<00:02:29.560> either

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
these videos usually are either

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.670 
these videos usually are either
technical<00:02:30.820> or<00:02:31.030> melodic<00:02:31.540> so<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.140> would<00:02:32.440> like<00:02:32.530> to

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
technical or melodic so I would like to

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.759 
technical or melodic so I would like to
do<00:02:32.800> both<00:02:33.220> things<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:33.970> this<00:02:34.300> case<00:02:34.510> it's<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:35.200> very

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
do both things in this case it's a very

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.590 
do both things in this case it's a very
technical<00:02:36.010> exercise<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.300> know<00:02:37.390> don't

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
technical exercise so you know don't

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.559 
technical exercise so you know don't
don't<00:02:38.470> get<00:02:38.650> too<00:02:39.489> disappointed<00:02:39.670> if<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.269> work

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
don't get too disappointed if you work

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.180 
don't get too disappointed if you work
hard<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.140> then<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.560> doesn't<00:02:41.830> really<00:02:41.950> sound

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
hard and then it doesn't really sound

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.240 
hard and then it doesn't really sound
that<00:02:42.489> natural<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.319> musical<00:02:44.319> but<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.160> know

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
that natural that musical but you know

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.009 
that natural that musical but you know
you<00:02:45.310> would<00:02:45.489> like<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.819> technique<00:02:46.450> natural<00:02:46.900> to

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
you would like the technique natural to

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.620 
you would like the technique natural to
you<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.380> then<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:47.739> can<00:02:47.860> still<00:02:48.100> use<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.299> do

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
you and then you can still use it to do

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.060 
you and then you can still use it to do
you<00:02:49.959> know<00:02:50.049> more<00:02:50.200> melodic<00:02:50.350> stuff<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.890> more

one more thing before we go is the basic

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.620 
one more thing before we go is the basic
technique<00:04:35.520> of<00:04:35.610> sweet<00:04:35.850> picking<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.180> think<00:04:36.419> most

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
technique of sweet picking I think most

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.120 
technique of sweet picking I think most
of<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:36.870> if<00:04:36.990> you're<00:04:37.169> doing<00:04:37.590> this<00:04:37.680> exercise<00:04:38.100> you

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
of you if you're doing this exercise you

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.220 
of you if you're doing this exercise you
kind<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.520> know<00:04:38.639> about<00:04:38.669> it<00:04:39.030> one<00:04:39.840> thing<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.169> I

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
kind of know about it one thing that I

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.590 
kind of know about it one thing that I
would<00:04:40.350> like<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.500> stretch<00:04:41.460> is<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.030> importance

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
would like to stretch is the importance

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.260 
would like to stretch is the importance
of<00:04:42.780> doing<00:04:43.020> just<00:04:43.470> one<00:04:43.800> motion<00:04:44.070> so<00:04:44.550> try<00:04:44.970> not<00:04:45.000> to

that's<00:04:53.820> a<00:04:53.880> mistake<00:04:54.030> because<00:04:54.510> you<00:04:54.570> would

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
that's a mistake because you would

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.520 
that's a mistake because you would
really<00:04:55.200> hit<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.590> roof<00:04:55.830> of<00:04:56.810> nearly<00:04:57.810> comfortable

really hit a roof of nearly comfortable
speed<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:58.860> can<00:04:59.010> use<00:04:59.160> because<00:04:59.640> each<00:05:00.120> time<00:05:00.419> you

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
speed you can use because each time you

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.450 
speed you can use because each time you
hit<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.810> note<00:05:01.020> you're<00:05:01.320> using<00:05:01.530> a<00:05:01.710> lot<00:05:01.860> of<00:05:01.890> you

and<00:05:04.260> that<00:05:04.350> takes<00:05:04.590> away<00:05:05.300> takes<00:05:06.300> time<00:05:06.540> so<00:05:06.930> the

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
and that takes away takes time so the

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.390 
and that takes away takes time so the
more<00:05:07.410> time<00:05:07.590> you<00:05:07.710> use<00:05:08.180> for<00:05:09.180> each<00:05:10.070> you<00:05:11.070> know<00:05:11.100> for
