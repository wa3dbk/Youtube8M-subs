dimension so your makeup looks like it's

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.940 
dimension so your makeup looks like it's
just<00:01:49.119> so<00:01:49.450> flowing<00:01:49.869> into<00:01:50.140> one<00:01:50.350> another<00:01:50.590> and

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
just so flowing into one another and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.310 
just so flowing into one another and
it's<00:01:51.100> natural<00:01:51.610> like<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.630> less<00:01:52.810> colors<00:01:53.170> you

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
it's natural like the less colors you

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.620 
it's natural like the less colors you
use<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:56.380> more<00:01:56.590> flat<00:01:56.860> look<00:01:57.420> mortal<00:01:58.420> if<00:01:58.539> you

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
use the more flat look mortal if you

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.690 
use the more flat look mortal if you
blend<00:01:58.899> together<00:01:59.110> and<00:01:59.530> kind<00:01:59.740> of<00:01:59.799> mix<00:02:00.039> up<00:02:00.220> the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
blend together and kind of mix up the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.789 
blend together and kind of mix up the
more<00:02:00.940> intense<00:02:01.270> then<00:02:01.509> like<00:02:01.659> dramatic<00:02:02.140> get

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
more intense then like dramatic get

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.920 
more intense then like dramatic get
subtle<00:02:03.399> because<00:02:03.909> you're<00:02:04.030> blending<00:02:04.330> metrics

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
subtle because you're blending metrics

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.479 
subtle because you're blending metrics
