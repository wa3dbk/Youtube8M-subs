and<00:02:47.730> I've<00:02:48.730> got<00:02:48.940> trials<00:02:49.330> in<00:02:49.420> about<00:02:49.680> 10<00:02:50.680> days<00:02:50.710> so

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
and I've got trials in about 10 days so

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.240 
and I've got trials in about 10 days so
my<00:02:52.270> god<00:02:52.600> I'm<00:02:53.020> not<00:02:53.170> really<00:02:53.350> if<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.770> don't<00:02:54.130> dwell

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
my god I'm not really if I don't dwell

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.830 
my god I'm not really if I don't dwell
there<00:02:54.580> then<00:02:54.850> I'm<00:02:54.970> pretty<00:02:55.210> limited<00:02:55.630> but

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
there then I'm pretty limited but

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.490 
there then I'm pretty limited but
hopefully<00:02:56.400> my<00:02:57.400> girls<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.730> go<00:02:57.910> on<00:02:58.300> women<00:02:59.140> again

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
hopefully my girls to go on women again

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.920 
hopefully my girls to go on women again
maybe<00:03:00.010> 58<00:03:00.640> even<00:03:01.030> took<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.850> then<00:03:04.570> if<00:03:04.840> a

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
maybe 58 even took and then if a

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.990 
maybe 58 even took and then if a
qualifier<00:03:05.350> there<00:03:05.560> then<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:05.980> think<00:03:06.370> it's<00:03:06.550> world

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
qualifier there then I think it's world

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.320 
qualifier there then I think it's world
youth<00:03:07.950> championships<00:03:08.950> there<00:03:09.250> or<00:03:09.850> something

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
youth championships there or something

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.190 
youth championships there or something
so<00:03:11.230> yeah<00:03:11.830> maybe<00:03:12.330> gone<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.630> scene<00:03:13.870> to

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
so yeah maybe gone to the scene to

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.699 
so yeah maybe gone to the scene to
moderate<00:03:14.680> now<00:03:14.830> I<00:03:15.100> got<00:03:15.700> away<00:03:15.790> my<00:03:16.090> yeah<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.440> what

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
moderate now I got away my yeah and what

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.410 
moderate now I got away my yeah and what
about<00:03:17.739> 2012<00:03:18.550> obviously<00:03:18.970> we've<00:03:19.060> got<00:03:19.180> one<00:03:19.390> more

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
about 2012 obviously we've got one more

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.449 
about 2012 obviously we've got one more
in<00:03:19.750> pics<00:03:20.019> coming<00:03:20.260> on<00:03:20.470> does<00:03:20.860> that<00:03:21.040> excite<00:03:21.400> you

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
in pics coming on does that excite you

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.580 
in pics coming on does that excite you
is<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.970> something<00:03:22.180> that's<00:03:22.480> on<00:03:22.660> you<00:03:22.810> arising<00:03:23.140> is

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
is it something that's on you arising is

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.500 
is it something that's on you arising is
on<00:03:23.800> your<00:03:24.070> readout<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:24.850> made<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.120> same<00:03:25.330> for

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
on your readout so made the same for

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.050 
on your readout so made the same for
London<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.019> I<00:03:26.320> think<00:03:26.530> I'd<00:03:26.620> be<00:03:26.769> athletes<00:03:27.340> kind

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
London and I think I'd be athletes kind

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.630 
London and I think I'd be athletes kind
of<00:03:28.150> aspiring<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.870> make<00:03:29.050> it<00:03:29.320> but<00:03:29.590> I'm<00:03:30.310> kind<00:03:30.550> of

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
of aspiring to make it but I'm kind of

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.070 
of aspiring to make it but I'm kind of
fat<00:03:30.850> from<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.090> country<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.600> minute<00:03:31.900> there's

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
fat from the country the minute there's

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.440 
fat from the country the minute there's
like<00:03:32.290> 4<00:03:32.769> 20<00:03:33.280> year<00:03:33.400> olds<00:03:33.670> faster<00:03:34.060> than<00:03:34.150> me<00:03:34.269> so

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
like 4 20 year olds faster than me so

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.690 
like 4 20 year olds faster than me so
it's<00:03:34.930> probably<00:03:35.170> not<00:03:35.380> that<00:03:35.590> great<00:03:36.130> chance<00:03:36.489> me

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
it's probably not that great chance me

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.020 
it's probably not that great chance me
going<00:03:37.060> but<00:03:37.269> suppose<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.320> can<00:03:38.470> always<00:03:38.680> try

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
going but suppose you can always try

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.350 
going but suppose you can always try
yeah<00:03:40.030> sure<00:03:40.769> what<00:03:41.769> my<00:03:41.980> veggie<00:03:42.400> on<00:03:42.700> it<00:03:42.850> on<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.060> day

yeah sure what my veggie on it on a day

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.530 
yeah sure what my veggie on it on a day
to<00:03:43.420> day<00:03:43.630> basis<00:03:44.320> you<00:03:44.500> know<00:03:44.530> what<00:03:44.920> it<00:03:45.239> is<00:03:46.239> it<00:03:46.420> you

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
to day basis you know what it is it you

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.870 
to day basis you know what it is it you
have<00:03:46.690> goals<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.530> how<00:03:47.620> do<00:03:47.680> they<00:03:47.830> motivate<00:03:48.580> you

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
have goals and how do they motivate you

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.020 
have goals and how do they motivate you
when<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.420> get<00:03:49.660> in<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:50.050> train<00:03:50.260> every<00:03:50.709> day<00:03:51.030> and

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
when you get in and train every day and

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.420 
when you get in and train every day and
I<00:03:52.810> just<00:03:53.560> think<00:03:53.739> about<00:03:53.890> winning<00:03:54.310> really<00:03:54.850> like

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
I just think about winning really like

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.009 
I just think about winning really like
before<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.670> race<00:03:57.850> or<00:03:58.180> join<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.660> race<00:03:58.810> is

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
before the race or join the race is

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.440 
before the race or join the race is
always<00:03:59.320> things<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.980> really<00:04:00.940> don't<00:04:01.239> want<00:04:01.390> to

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
always things I really don't want to

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.380 
always things I really don't want to
lose<00:04:01.630> so<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.709> just<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.220> kind<00:04:03.459> of<00:04:03.550> pushes<00:04:03.970> me<00:04:04.269> on

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
lose so I just that kind of pushes me on

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.940 
lose so I just that kind of pushes me on
so<00:04:04.780> same<00:04:05.590> training<00:04:05.980> really

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
so same training really

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.430

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
sets do you do you think really make a

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.909 
sets do you do you think really make a
difference<00:04:20.489> when<00:04:20.820> you<00:04:20.940> get<00:04:21.209> their<00:04:21.590> skill<00:04:22.590> sets

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
difference when you get their skill sets

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.180 
difference when you get their skill sets
really<00:04:23.430> sometimes<00:04:24.290> like<00:04:25.290> obviously<00:04:25.979> you<00:04:26.100> got

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
really sometimes like obviously you got

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.070 
really sometimes like obviously you got
off<00:04:26.310> great<00:04:26.490> skin<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:27.090> make<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.600> top<00:04:27.810> so

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
off great skin to make the top so

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.800 
off great skin to make the top so
suppose<00:04:28.350> that's<00:04:28.620> where<00:04:29.090> were<00:04:30.090> you<00:04:30.270> kind<00:04:30.690> of

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
50s fly which is pretty pretty high at a

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.840 
50s fly which is pretty pretty high at a
time<00:04:49.550> but<00:04:50.550> of<00:04:50.760> that<00:04:51.060> kind<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.479> think<00:04:52.850> really

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
time but of that kind I think really

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.730 
time but of that kind I think really

considered to be a main rivals at the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.680 
considered to be a main rivals at the
moment<00:04:56.130> give<00:04:56.490> me<00:04:56.550> three<00:04:56.789> examples<00:04:57.180> of<00:04:57.539> people

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
moment give me three examples of people
