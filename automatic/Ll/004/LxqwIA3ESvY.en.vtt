now previous research has shown that
students<00:03:05.530> in<00:03:05.739> economic<00:03:06.280> classes<00:03:06.489> are<00:03:06.970> more

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
students in economic classes are more

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.720 
students in economic classes are more
likely<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:09.239> describe<00:03:10.470> greed<00:03:11.470> as<00:03:11.769> a<00:03:11.830> good<00:03:12.370> thing

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
likely to describe greed as a good thing

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.000 
likely to describe greed as a good thing
and<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.650> there<00:03:15.519> is<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:16.350> sense<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.680> is<00:03:17.829> not

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
and so there is a sense that this is not

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.280 
and so there is a sense that this is not
only<00:03:18.160> self<00:03:18.609> selective<00:03:19.180> in<00:03:19.359> some<00:03:19.570> respects<00:03:20.049> but

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
only self selective in some respects but

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.539 
only self selective in some respects but
also<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:22.239> wealthier<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.810> become<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:24.400> more

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
also the wealthier you become the more

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.559 
also the wealthier you become the more
insulated<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:26.700> essentially<00:03:27.700> inward-looking

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
insulated and essentially inward-looking

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.819 
insulated and essentially inward-looking
you<00:03:29.350> become<00:03:30.720> one<00:03:31.720> experiment<00:03:32.350> invited<00:03:32.739> a
