so<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:53.250> studied<00:00:53.640> these<00:00:53.760> problems<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.390> created

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
so we studied these problems and created

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.880 
so we studied these problems and created
these<00:00:55.469> which<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.550> call<00:00:56.789> color<00:00:57.180> cables<00:00:57.890> our

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
these which we call color cables our
