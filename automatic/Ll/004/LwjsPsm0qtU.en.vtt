lashline this isn't gonna end up looking

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.189 
lashline this isn't gonna end up looking
like<00:04:16.199> raccoon<00:04:16.919> eyes<00:04:17.209> because<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:19.049> way

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
like raccoon eyes because the the way

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.719 
like raccoon eyes because the the way
that<00:04:19.229> we're<00:04:19.620> doing<00:04:20.039> this<00:04:20.250> so<00:04:20.549> we're<00:04:20.699> just

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
that we're doing this so we're just

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.330 
that we're doing this so we're just
going<00:04:21.060> with<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.329> light<00:04:21.600> hand<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.139> not<00:04:22.440> doing<00:04:23.190> it

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
going with a light hand and not doing it

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.219 
going with a light hand and not doing it
too<00:04:23.550> hard<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:24.120> guess<00:04:24.360> it's<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.720> best<00:04:24.810> way<00:04:25.199> to

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
too hard I guess it's the best way to

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.950 
too hard I guess it's the best way to
say<00:04:25.620> also<00:04:26.250> if<00:04:26.940> you're<00:04:27.150> wondering<00:04:27.570> about<00:04:27.660> my

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020

save my life I am wearing contacts by

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.110 
save my life I am wearing contacts by
the<00:04:33.720> way<00:04:33.960> so<00:04:34.770> yeah<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.490> just<00:04:35.550> thought<00:04:35.820> that<00:04:36.030> it

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
the way so yeah I just thought that it

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.999 
the way so yeah I just thought that it
would<00:04:36.240> make<00:04:36.389> the<00:04:36.570> eye<00:04:36.600> look<00:04:36.750> pop<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.500> little<00:04:37.860> bit

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
would make the eye look pop a little bit

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.430 
would make the eye look pop a little bit
more<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.669> it<00:04:39.270> would<00:04:39.330> be<00:04:39.509> fair<00:04:39.840> for<00:04:40.110> some<00:04:40.289> of<00:04:40.410> my

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
more and it would be fair for some of my

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.010 
more and it would be fair for some of my
blue-eyed<00:04:41.009> subscribers<00:04:41.880> since<00:04:42.509> the<00:04:42.720> first

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.450 
area and I'm not gonna put on any blush
because<00:05:42.599> the<00:05:43.169> eye<00:05:43.380> look<00:05:43.710> is<00:05:43.860> already<00:05:44.250> is

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
because the eye look is already is

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.339 
because the eye look is already is
dramatic<00:05:44.940> enough<00:05:45.330> so<00:05:45.659> I<00:05:45.690> just<00:05:45.960> thought<00:05:46.169> that's

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349
