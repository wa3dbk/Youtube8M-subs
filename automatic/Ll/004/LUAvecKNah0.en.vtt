00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.530
 what about such a community under film on day 5 of 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.929
 February finally you give after three 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.309
 attempts managed to make it on the ct the 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.769
 nocturnal mold was activated 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.929
 successfully this means that by 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.960
 end we have the first night map 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:23.570
 in battlefield 4 which is infiltration 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.939
 off shanghai night-time toilet 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.529
 Shanghai is certainly a breakthrough for 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.960
 to be able to take a look at what would be 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.939
 playing on a night map took a turn 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.440
 to the map since we can find only 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.360
 land vehicles giving the 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.489
 opportunity for the map to become a 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.379
 little more linear in terms of just 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.180
 infantry this means that no 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.829
 we have to be concerned about being 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.110
 seeing ground and air since there is no 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.270
 helicopters now we will arrive a good 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.980
 finally use the lanterns that despite 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.739
 that it's good you can use them in 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.329
 reality is to be thought as it will reveal 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.789
 your position to your enemy in a way 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.800
 easier that's why I opted for the 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.750
 tactical flashlight so that it was only 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.850
 activated when you are aiming which 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.949
 He is also very reliable about 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.119
 night vision town halls of 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.250
 they really have a range of vision 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.090
 reduced and that often makes 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.490
 when we visit 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.909
 enemy and aim we can not see it 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.590
 even with the 2x increase I feel that 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.409
 here there must be a modification of 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.630
 range of vision of these attachments and 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.579
 a slight color change of how it 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.380
 detects the enemy since many times 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.810
 we can only see the weapons as 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.700
 they shine but not the body of the enemy 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.590
 another point that I thought would not look 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.429
 but many players were thinking 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.859
 is the world of campers in all the way 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.869
 nightly and unfortunately is in the 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.189
 correct of several rounds that I was 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.780
 trying on this map touched me on 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.479
 special one where the majority of the team 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.670
 they were snipers in this case the 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.140
 enemy team which takes away what 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.509
 interesting this way since it's pretty 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.700
 difficult to spot someone in a high place 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.770
 far away there are many things that are missing 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.939
 balance but we know well that this is 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.069
 a test and in the future 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.659
 updates for the act we will see 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.360
 changes in this area in night mode 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.909
 Another important thing to mention is the 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.709
 change capture point ce since 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.899
 now it is on the ground floor what 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.910
 which is excellent since now not all 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.290
 They are on the top floor covering a 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.030
 goal that many times will be almost 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.130
 impossible to recover 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.350
 and there was an extreme camping in the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.790
 roof of the building and exit in the 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.920
 elevators was not a very good option 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.930
 this change is small but it was a 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.459
 balance to the map very good but I 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.260
 I would choose not to let the enemy 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.180
 have regeneration points on the roof 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.890
 of the tower because for me it 's all 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.720
 advantage that they get to camp in the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.550
 ceilings but despite everything said 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.650
 let me tell you that the map looks 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.630
 spectacular the atmosphere is very 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.610
 good you can really feel the change 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.980
 of gameplay you have to be more 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.680
 attentive and can already be given or comes 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.510
 of the city councils that make you say 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.670
 4 when you see a guy with a flashlight 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.530
 On a map with a lot of light, the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.709
 Infantry mode and many other things 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.940
 they stay very different moves to the map 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.030
 taking advantage that we are talking about 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.769
 oil is an excel is excellent the new 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.470
 change that kits since they do not 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.870
 you have to always be waiting for the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.430
 time that felt eternal in the best 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.160
 balance in the waiting time which 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.110
 it's really excellent but it would be good 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.940
 that the mode of health generation was 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.340
 how to leave it 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.850
 I hope we see that change for the 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.190
 first aid kits in my opinion of help instead 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.810
 of helping to balance the classes what 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.270
 happened was that the assault class was 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.040
 weakened already limits us to be seeing 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.110
 or exposing the enemy game to 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.880
 power to generate health but good 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.210
 nothing that does not reread a good kit 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.190
 first aid however it was like that already 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.810
 custom to use the kit for places 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.820
 of types of close encounter where 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.780
 we had enough enemies but 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.400
 let's hope this change is 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.170
 considered for the next patch the 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.080
 which will be applied in the month of March 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.940
 of which there is still no day for 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.400
 publish but it is official that it is in 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.680
 March since it is the means that 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.870
 I mention we are going to see changes in going 2004 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.190
 and also comes harley told them that 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.720
 there was no official listing of these 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.190
 changes but nevertheless the few 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.030
 changes that I can tell you that yes 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.100
 will see in this new patch is this what 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.300
 which is the color of change 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.240
 interface in aerial vehicles and 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.300
 terrestrial as well as that of the 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.490
 indicators of damage and therefore we are few 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.230
 changes that are needed but for the 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.420
 moment, I only think that they are the 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.880
 approved 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.340
 and well, how do you like the map? 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.310
 of we call the infiltration in shanghai 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.240
 they think they have the night maps 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.340
 or it will be something else to complain with daisy 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.110
 tell me what you think about it you already know that 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.820
 If you liked the video, share it and 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.380
 it would be of luxury the views are 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.320
 previous material visit stands
