00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.540

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.960
 December was released here on 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.640
 Brazil now has the opportunity to look 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.539
 this gadget here goes a little bit more 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.789
 and understood that this box comes here 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.160
 Let's open first, then I'll 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:40.590
 talking about the specifications to the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:46.710
 same simple time so much freshness 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:50.030
 The essential thing that comes here is a strip 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.030
 of paper holding a phone 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:01.550
 device in a battery compartment with a 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:12.110

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.700
 Let's look at this other little box. 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:29.930
 charger with this same USB 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.930
 a headset 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:39.630
 talk a little device now 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.100
 appliance is 124 grams very light weight 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.580
 it's much bigger 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.240
 the finish resembles a little bit 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.600
 I think the iphone a little bit the device 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.780
 sony is resembling sônia that it has glass 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.400
 us on the back is also not handsome 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.930
 appliance 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.270
 I find something beautiful that I like 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.790
 rounded part of the front 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.110
 She looks good in the face to talk to 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.360
 also handle 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.660
 you have this impression it is neither 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.480
 I bought the finish, it's cool 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.130
 the device is very beautiful and this rate 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.220
 metal was cool too, it gives a 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.200
 value is a value and 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.000
 following with the specs of the device 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.220
 Let's talk about his screen on the wood. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.480
 a 5-inch screen 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:35.640
 let's see how it looks here in your hd 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:39.200
 bonfire has motivated the s3 also 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:44.430
 I would not have been asking, right? 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.670
 look just one common look on this screen 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.670
 on here 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.660
 to be pretty handsome the footprint 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:58.430
 He is very hot and comfortable in his hand. 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:06.489
 one hand with 12 lightly 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:09.519
 Thick enough pleats is cool 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.920
 really cool really 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:19.280
 Let's go on with the pecs 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:26.390
 processor with affection should not be 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:31.390
 with the cornea 1.8 the cortex a9 is a good 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:34.390
 external observer there is no answer 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.390
 interesting 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.299
 so we can work a lot 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:45.860
 as well as the 2 gb of ram internal memory 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:51.319
 of 16 sixteen that is well has a 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:55.090
 micro usb input that can put the 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.090
 card up to 64 gigs 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.579
 Speaking a little, let's go to the camera. 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:06.799
 such a great differential of this apparatus 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:08.599
 it comes with a mega g3 rear camera 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:13.880
 with a led flash 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:15.739
 so it 's really cool for the photo but the 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.109
 differential of this device before 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.079
 that still could in the launch is the camera 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.260
 front on the front there is a 8 camera 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.190
 megapixels that the ideal for the market 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.020
 Brazilian who is fissured by jungles 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:36.380
 and get some jokes 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:39.139
 in within about 8 mega with a 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.479
 beautification function then it is well 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:45.560
 cool, you can improve photo 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:48.440
 before you will get there within the options you 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.150
 have here capture smile then just the 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.889
 Can you take pictures with you? 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.820
 sure this catch 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:58.909
 you can have the options of glass 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.550
 have several effects that create 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.470
 you can 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.290
 Looks it 's normal to see your put filters 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.030
 voice notes is a good camera well and 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:11.080
 complete under complete 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.600
 they worked hard to bring a 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.850
 experience with people with blood and 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.910
 which has a lot of choice and in a simple way 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.370
 for the provisional joint user going 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.360
 being like the self does not have much 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.310
 resource 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:30.010
 I think the bad experience is pretty cool. 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.530
 who is hotter can say no 17 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.320
 years following these specifications has 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:39.010
 an FM radio that is also 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:42.820
 Brazilians do not like Brazil 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.330
 the device and the battery is very 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.100
 good 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.810
 she is even a little above what we 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.830
 We usually see around here. 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:53.170
 a battery of 2,500 my skin a life 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.110
 Nice, bye, to the couple. 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.570
 it will probably be a day 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.730
 the use of fixed assets or 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:06.430
 way who is with 1 35% of the battery 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:08.290
 nor an estimate that it has no 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:13.540
 estimate is not what has already been used 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:15.310
 What you do not know is four days. 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.730
 Let's test the love, tell you 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.730
 as it is 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.730
 so this is it this is so much 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.380
 interesting device when arriving at 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.970
 Brazilian market with an option 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.510
 interesting ne 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.520
 It's something worth showing to 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.040
 have an idea of the thickness of the 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.620
 headphone connector né wenger 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.450
 practically the size here on the side 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.100
 of the very thin apparatus 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.620
 I believe it to be the best that 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:51.280
 iphone 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:53.740
 possibly it's a summer as it comes 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.090
 there the first impressions that were 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.350
 here the unfolding of the night will tell 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:00.630
 for you a little use like that was 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:04.960
 use this appliance here for a while 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:07.060
