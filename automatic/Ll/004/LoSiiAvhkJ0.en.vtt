00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hey there guys how's it going so today I

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.570 
hey there guys how's it going so today I
wanted<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.810> show<00:00:04.020> you<00:00:04.049> this<00:00:04.500> really<00:00:05.009> cheap

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
wanted to show you this really cheap

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.410 
wanted to show you this really cheap
squid<00:00:06.000> farm<00:00:06.620> and<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.280> 1.8<00:00:08.970> squid<00:00:09.210> farm

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
squid farm and this is a 1.8 squid farm

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.950 
squid farm and this is a 1.8 squid farm
and<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:10.250> came<00:00:11.250> up<00:00:11.400> with<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.610> because<00:00:11.870> Jay<00:00:12.870> L

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
and I came up with this because Jay L

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.240 
and I came up with this because Jay L
made<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> video<00:00:13.469> where<00:00:13.769> he's<00:00:13.860> trying<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.130> make

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
made a video where he's trying to make

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.269 
made a video where he's trying to make
like<00:00:14.429> super<00:00:14.880> efficient<00:00:15.560> like<00:00:16.560> super<00:00:17.130> good

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
like super efficient like super good

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.099 
like super efficient like super good
rate<00:00:17.490> squid<00:00:17.940> farms<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.539> that's<00:00:18.750> how<00:00:18.900> good

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
rate squid farms and that's how good

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.029 
rate squid farms and that's how good
that's<00:00:19.289> like<00:00:19.590> what<00:00:19.920> he<00:00:20.070> does<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:21.470> he's<00:00:22.470> his

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
that's like what he does but he's his

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.509 
that's like what he does but he's his
theory<00:00:23.369> was<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.699> put<00:00:23.850> guardians<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:25.519> squid

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
theory was to put guardians in the squid

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.269 
theory was to put guardians in the squid
farm<00:00:26.789> area<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.320> like<00:00:28.529> that's

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
farm area and it's just like that's

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.580 
farm area and it's just like that's
that's<00:00:29.939> way<00:00:30.090> too<00:00:30.119> much<00:00:30.390> work<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:30.779> my<00:00:31.170> goal<00:00:31.349> here

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
that's way too much work so my goal here

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.030 
that's way too much work so my goal here
was<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.769> make<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.160> really<00:00:32.610> cheap<00:00:33.030> squid<00:00:33.420> farm

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
was to make a really cheap squid farm

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.380 
was to make a really cheap squid farm
just<00:00:35.040> something<00:00:35.370> super<00:00:35.730> simple<00:00:35.880> super<00:00:36.210> easy

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
just something super simple super easy

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.410 
just something super simple super easy
and<00:00:37.160> yeah<00:00:38.160> that's<00:00:38.309> what<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and yeah that's what I have here so a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.310 
and yeah that's what I have here so a
squid<00:00:40.200> spawn<00:00:40.559> between<00:00:41.600> later<00:00:42.980> 46<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:45.320> 62

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
squid spawn between later 46 and a 62

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.369 
squid spawn between later 46 and a 62
inclusively<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.719> if<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:48.899> stand<00:00:49.050> up<00:00:49.170> here

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
inclusively so if we stand up here

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.150 
inclusively so if we stand up here
should<00:00:49.590> say<00:00:49.860> oh<00:00:50.250> between<00:00:51.120> 63<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.690> 46<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.530> 63

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
should say oh between 63 and 46 so 63

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.660 
should say oh between 63 and 46 so 63
and<00:00:53.460> then<00:00:53.579> all<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.600> way<00:00:54.690> down<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:55.050> here<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
and then all the way down to here and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.189 
and then all the way down to here and
the<00:00:56.670> idea<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.420> basically<00:00:57.809> let<00:00:58.020> me<00:00:58.079> get

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the idea here is basically let me get

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.930 
the idea here is basically let me get
far<00:00:58.350> enough<00:00:58.440> away<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.739> they'll<00:00:58.980> spawn<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
far enough away so they'll spawn the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.049 
far enough away so they'll spawn the
idea<00:01:00.329> here<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.500> at<00:01:02.399> some<00:01:02.730> point<00:01:02.940> they'll

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
idea here is that at some point they'll

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.609 
idea here is that at some point they'll
just<00:01:03.239> eventually<00:01:03.420> randomly<00:01:04.140> kind<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.409> cross

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
just eventually randomly kind of cross

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.320 
just eventually randomly kind of cross
over<00:01:04.860> into<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> air<00:01:05.580> box<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.270> middle

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
over into the air box here in the middle

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.500 
over into the air box here in the middle
and<00:01:06.659> fall<00:01:07.170> down<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.880> this<00:01:08.880> distance<00:01:09.270> right

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
and fall down and this distance right

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.140 
and fall down and this distance right
here<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.840> enough<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.799> go<00:01:11.369> by<00:01:11.640> fall<00:01:11.820> damage

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
here is enough to just go by fall damage

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.960 
here is enough to just go by fall damage
so<00:01:12.390> getting<00:01:12.840> rid<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.080> them<00:01:13.229> instantly<00:01:13.970> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
so getting rid of them instantly the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.140 
so getting rid of them instantly the
rate<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.540> thing<00:01:15.810> was<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:17.100> about<00:01:17.520> between

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
rate of this thing was is about between

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.630 
rate of this thing was is about between
1,500<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:18.930> 2,000<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.830> sacks<00:01:20.280> per<00:01:20.750> hour<00:01:22.640> Jael

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
1,500 and 2,000 in sacks per hour Jael

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.330 
1,500 and 2,000 in sacks per hour Jael
had<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.600> 20<00:01:25.049> guardians<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> water<00:01:25.950> area

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
had like 20 guardians in a water area

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.640 
had like 20 guardians in a water area
and<00:01:26.460> had<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:26.850> 5,000<00:01:27.479> exact<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.500> like

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
and had like 5,000 exact I was just like

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.420 
and had like 5,000 exact I was just like
I<00:01:29.750> see<00:01:30.750> no<00:01:30.990> theoretical<00:01:31.439> purpose<00:01:32.100> where<00:01:32.310> you

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
I see no theoretical purpose where you

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.039 
I see no theoretical purpose where you
would<00:01:32.549> ever<00:01:32.670> need<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.119> many<00:01:33.329> insects<00:01:33.810> in

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
would ever need that many insects in

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.719 
would ever need that many insects in
fact<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.470> cutting<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.040> thing<00:01:35.100> size<00:01:35.490> in

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
fact just cutting this thing size in

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.160 
fact just cutting this thing size in
half<00:01:35.850> would<00:01:36.060> probably<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.509> absolutely<00:01:36.930> fine

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
half would probably be absolutely fine

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.899 
half would probably be absolutely fine
but<00:01:39.680> although<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.979> need<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.430> wide<00:01:41.640> gap

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
but although you do need a to wide gap

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.560 
but although you do need a to wide gap
here<00:01:42.290> because<00:01:43.759> if<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.420> wide

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
here because if it's one wide

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.270 
here because if it's one wide
occasionally<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> squids<00:01:46.740> will<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:46.979> able<00:01:47.130> to

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
occasionally the squids will be able to

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.190 
occasionally the squids will be able to
swim<00:01:47.520> through<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> air<00:01:48.240> block<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.810> into<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
swim through the air block and into the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.100 
swim through the air block and into the
other<00:01:49.290> side<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.710> water<00:01:49.890> again<00:01:50.329> and<00:01:51.329> then

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
other side of the water again and then

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.510 
other side of the water again and then
yeah<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.590> some<00:01:52.799> poppers<00:01:53.159> down<00:01:53.340> here

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
yeah I just have some poppers down here

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.490 
yeah I just have some poppers down here
to<00:01:53.610> collect<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.390> one's<00:01:54.630> 8<00:01:54.840> 1<00:01:55.049> that

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
to collect and then this one's 8 1 that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.050 
to collect and then this one's 8 1 that
just<00:01:55.950> seems<00:01:56.130> pretty<00:01:56.189> big<00:01:56.579> enough<00:01:56.790> just

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
just seems pretty big enough just

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.749 
just seems pretty big enough just
because<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.009> squids<00:01:59.280> are<00:01:59.399> hitting<00:01:59.640> their

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
because the the squids are hitting their

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
because the the squids are hitting their
mobcap<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.450> more<00:02:00.810> spawning<00:02:01.170> area<00:02:01.560> isn't

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
mobcap so more spawning area isn't

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.170 
mobcap so more spawning area isn't
really<00:02:02.070> going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.280> increase<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.850> thing<00:02:03.030> too

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
really going to increase this thing too

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.560 
really going to increase this thing too
drastically<00:02:05.090> but<00:02:06.090> then<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.390> don't<00:02:06.450> want

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
drastically but then if you don't want

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.350 
drastically but then if you don't want
to<00:02:06.719> use<00:02:06.840> all<00:02:07.020> these<00:02:07.140> hoppers<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:08.360> cheaper

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
to use all these hoppers a a cheaper

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.250 
to use all these hoppers a a cheaper
solution<00:02:09.599> would<00:02:10.080> be

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
solution would be

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.740 
solution would be
so<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:11.980> cheaper<00:02:12.430> solution<00:02:12.610> might<00:02:13.030> be<00:02:13.060> something

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
so a cheaper solution might be something

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.259 
so a cheaper solution might be something
like<00:02:13.780> this<00:02:13.959> where<00:02:14.349> you<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.970> squids

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
like this where you just have the squids

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.759 
like this where you just have the squids
fall<00:02:16.450> into<00:02:16.659> here<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.019> then<00:02:17.110> this<00:02:17.260> minecart

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
fall into here and then this minecart

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.140 
fall into here and then this minecart
goes<00:02:17.920> around<00:02:18.129> and<00:02:18.340> picks<00:02:18.610> up<00:02:18.760> all<00:02:18.849> the<00:02:18.909> ink

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
goes around and picks up all the ink

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.170 
goes around and picks up all the ink
sacs<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.920> minecart<00:02:21.280> extended<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:22.090> the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
sacs and the minecart extended to the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.059 
sacs and the minecart extended to the
negative<00:02:22.629> directions<00:02:23.200> like<00:02:23.620> one<00:02:23.860> block

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
negative directions like one block

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.650 
negative directions like one block
further<00:02:26.190> because<00:02:27.190> otherwise<00:02:27.580> ink<00:02:28.150> sacs<00:02:28.420> can

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
further because otherwise ink sacs can

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.690 
further because otherwise ink sacs can
get<00:02:28.810> like<00:02:28.959> stuck<00:02:29.140> on<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.620> outer<00:02:29.950> edge<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.370> not

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
get like stuck on the outer edge and not

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.750 
get like stuck on the outer edge and not
get<00:02:30.879> picked<00:02:31.030> up<00:02:31.239> but<00:02:31.450> yeah<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:33.580> me<00:02:33.670> this

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
get picked up but yeah so to me this

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.640 
get picked up but yeah so to me this
just<00:02:34.030> seems<00:02:34.209> like<00:02:34.269> a<00:02:34.360> pretty<00:02:35.049> good<00:02:35.170> squid<00:02:35.500> from

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
just seems like a pretty good squid from

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.309 
just seems like a pretty good squid from
hurt<00:02:35.879> you<00:02:36.879> could<00:02:37.060> even<00:02:37.390> devise<00:02:37.810> some<00:02:38.019> system

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
hurt you could even devise some system

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.680 
hurt you could even devise some system
of<00:02:38.440> like<00:02:38.560> Pistons<00:02:39.040> they<00:02:39.160> just<00:02:39.340> kind<00:02:39.519> of

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
of like Pistons they just kind of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.479 
of like Pistons they just kind of
collects<00:02:40.690> all<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.989> drops<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:42.159> guys<00:02:42.310> can

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
collects all the drops and you guys can

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.170 
collects all the drops and you guys can
figure<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.849> out<00:02:43.000> but<00:02:44.280> all<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.700> all<00:02:45.849> up<00:02:46.000> here

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
figure that out but all in all up here

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.520 
figure that out but all in all up here
this<00:02:46.329> is<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.510> part<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:46.840> I'm<00:02:46.989> like<00:02:47.140> concerned

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.420 
it's efficient works well so a nice
cheap<00:02:54.160> ink<00:02:54.790> farm<00:02:55.150> for<00:02:55.329> 1.8<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:56.049> yeah<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:57.310> that

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
cheap ink farm for 1.8 so yeah so that

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.569 
cheap ink farm for 1.8 so yeah so that
all<00:02:57.549> I<00:02:57.609> have<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.879> show<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.120> guys<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:59.340> I'll<00:03:00.340> do<00:03:00.519> a

you guys can understand how to what's

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.920 
you guys can understand how to what's
going<00:03:05.650> on<00:03:05.769> here<00:03:06.209> okay<00:03:07.209> first<00:03:07.599> things<00:03:07.840> first

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
going on here okay first things first

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.229 
going on here okay first things first
you're<00:03:08.440> going<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.620> start<00:03:08.680> out<00:03:08.950> with<00:03:09.069> 2<00:03:09.430> 3<00:03:09.819> by<00:03:09.970> 8

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
you're going to start out with 2 3 by 8

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.660 
you're going to start out with 2 3 by 8
platforms<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.230> they're<00:03:11.440> going<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.680> be<00:03:11.950> have<00:03:12.640> a

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
platforms and they're going to be have a

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.699 
platforms and they're going to be have a
two-block<00:03:13.090> gap<00:03:13.299> in<00:03:13.480> between<00:03:13.629> and<00:03:14.079> if<00:03:14.620> you

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
two-block gap in between and if you

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.229 
two-block gap in between and if you
stand<00:03:14.859> on<00:03:15.069> top<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.280> them<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.639> should<00:03:15.910> be<00:03:15.940> on

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
stand on top of them you should be on

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.509 
stand on top of them you should be on
layer<00:03:16.450> 46<00:03:17.169> because<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:17.709> is<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:18.010> first<00:03:18.280> and

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
layer 46 because that is the first and

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.190 
layer 46 because that is the first and
lowest<00:03:18.790> layer<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.269> squid<00:03:19.510> spawn<00:03:19.810> on<00:03:19.930> so

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
lowest layer that the squid spawn on so

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.750 
lowest layer that the squid spawn on so
they're<00:03:20.739> just<00:03:20.799> trying<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.130> maximize<00:03:21.609> the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
they're just trying to maximize the

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.780 
they're just trying to maximize the
height<00:03:21.910> here<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.239> they<00:03:22.329> spawn<00:03:22.569> in<00:03:22.599> and<00:03:23.790> then

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
height here that they spawn in and then

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.550 
height here that they spawn in and then
build<00:03:25.209> yourself<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.630> little<00:03:25.750> perimeter<00:03:26.260> on<00:03:26.530> the

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
build yourself a little perimeter on the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.860 
build yourself a little perimeter on the
edge<00:03:26.769> of<00:03:26.919> this<00:03:27.040> thing<00:03:27.250> here<00:03:27.549> ideal<00:03:28.450> we<00:03:28.660> just

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
edge of this thing here ideal we just

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.330 
edge of this thing here ideal we just
pretty<00:03:29.169> much<00:03:29.260> use<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.680> cheapest<00:03:30.010> block<00:03:30.190> at

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
pretty much use the cheapest block at

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.620 
pretty much use the cheapest block at
your<00:03:30.430> disposal<00:03:30.760> here<00:03:31.060> just<00:03:31.269> has<00:03:31.389> to<00:03:31.510> be<00:03:31.599> a

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
your disposal here just has to be a

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.449 
your disposal here just has to be a
solid<00:03:31.989> block<00:03:32.169> I<00:03:32.500> just<00:03:32.799> made<00:03:32.919> this<00:03:33.040> glass<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:33.430> I

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
solid block I just made this glass so I

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.839 
solid block I just made this glass so I
could<00:03:33.639> see<00:03:33.790> inside<00:03:34.030> there<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:35.500> then<00:03:36.400> go<00:03:36.639> ahead

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
could see inside there and then go ahead

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.920 
could see inside there and then go ahead
and<00:03:36.970> just<00:03:37.169> place<00:03:38.169> signs<00:03:38.560> all<00:03:38.919> across<00:03:39.430> this<00:03:39.760> a

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
and just place signs all across this a

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.569 
and just place signs all across this a
middle<00:03:40.930> area<00:03:41.139> here<00:03:41.470> not<00:03:41.650> at<00:03:41.889> the<00:03:42.069> same<00:03:42.280> level

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
middle area here not at the same level

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.849 
middle area here not at the same level
as<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.940> wood<00:03:43.359> floor<00:03:43.630> but<00:03:43.780> one<00:03:44.019> level<00:03:44.260> up<00:03:44.500> like

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
as the wood floor but one level up like

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.520 
as the wood floor but one level up like
that<00:03:45.840> all<00:03:46.840> right<00:03:46.959> there<00:03:47.109> you<00:03:47.139> go

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
that all right there you go

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.289 
that all right there you go
now<00:03:47.650> we're<00:03:47.829> going<00:03:47.919> to<00:03:47.980> extend<00:03:48.459> this<00:03:48.669> perimeter

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
now we're going to extend this perimeter

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.309 
now we're going to extend this perimeter
upwards<00:03:50.049> here<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:51.480> then<00:03:52.480> your<00:03:52.840> perimeter

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
upwards here and then your perimeter

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.229 
upwards here and then your perimeter
should<00:03:53.500> extend<00:03:53.889> all<00:03:54.099> the<00:03:54.129> way<00:03:54.370> up<00:03:54.489> until<00:03:54.700> when

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
should extend all the way up until when

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.930 
should extend all the way up until when
you<00:03:55.359> stand<00:03:55.690> on<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.410> read<00:03:56.709> on<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.280> y-value<00:03:57.609> of

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
you stand on it you read on a y-value of

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.289 
you stand on it you read on a y-value of
63<00:03:58.840> because<00:03:59.109> 62<00:03:59.889> so<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:00.790> next<00:04:01.060> layer<00:04:01.209> down

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
63 because 62 so the next layer down

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.140 
63 because 62 so the next layer down
where<00:04:02.019> is<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:03.129> first<00:04:03.340> layer<00:04:03.579> that<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:03.849> squids

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
where is the first layer that the squids

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.170 
where is the first layer that the squids
will<00:04:04.480> spawn<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.620> going<00:04:06.220> up<00:04:06.340> from<00:04:06.549> height<00:04:06.730> the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
will spawn and going up from height the

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.720 
will spawn and going up from height the
top<00:04:07.840> of<00:04:08.019> their<00:04:08.139> spawning<00:04:08.410> range<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:09.519> want<00:04:09.669> to

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
top of their spawning range that want to

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.920 
top of their spawning range that want to
actually<00:04:09.849> vote<00:04:10.209> 1<00:04:10.449> to<00:04:10.599> 12<00:04:10.810> but<00:04:12.629> anyway<00:04:13.629> so<00:04:13.720> then

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
actually vote 1 to 12 but anyway so then

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.469 
actually vote 1 to 12 but anyway so then
next<00:04:14.290> what<00:04:14.620> we're<00:04:14.739> going<00:04:14.859> to<00:04:14.889> do<00:04:15.099> is<00:04:15.479> just

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
next what we're going to do is just

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.979 
next what we're going to do is just
build<00:04:16.840> a

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
build a

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.740 
build a
some<00:04:18.350> lines<00:04:18.650> of<00:04:18.919> any<00:04:19.250> block<00:04:19.549> along<00:04:20.470> here<00:04:21.490> and

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
some lines of any block along here and

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.960 
some lines of any block along here and
there<00:04:23.750> should<00:04:23.960> be<00:04:24.110> a<00:04:24.380> gap<00:04:24.620> of<00:04:24.860> two<00:04:25.130> between

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
there should be a gap of two between

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.909 
there should be a gap of two between
each<00:04:26.599> of<00:04:26.660> these<00:04:26.960> lines<00:04:27.199> and<00:04:27.530> each<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.860> these

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
each of these lines and each of these

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.159 
each of these lines and each of these
lines<00:04:28.130> from<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.370> edge<00:04:28.580> and<00:04:28.960> then<00:04:29.960> you're<00:04:30.110> just

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
lines from the edge and then you're just

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.800 
lines from the edge and then you're just
going<00:04:30.319> to<00:04:30.410> take<00:04:30.530> some<00:04:30.770> water<00:04:30.949> and<00:04:31.720> get<00:04:32.720> an

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
going to take some water and get an

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.059 
going to take some water and get an
infinite<00:04:33.050> water<00:04:33.289> source<00:04:33.410> nearby<00:04:33.650> or

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069 
infinite water source nearby or

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.159 
infinite water source nearby or
something<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:34.669> yeah<00:04:35.569> just<00:04:35.840> go<00:04:35.930> along<00:04:36.110> the

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
something and yeah just go along the

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.659 
something and yeah just go along the
edge<00:04:36.349> there<00:04:36.680> place<00:04:36.919> all<00:04:37.099> that<00:04:37.220> water<00:04:37.400> down

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
edge there place all that water down

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.680 
edge there place all that water down
same<00:04:38.479> thing<00:04:38.509> with<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.870> other<00:04:38.990> side<00:04:40.630> now<00:04:41.630> you

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
same thing with the other side now you

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.920 
same thing with the other side now you
can<00:04:41.870> destroy<00:04:42.199> this<00:04:42.440> wood<00:04:43.009> here<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.870> I<00:04:44.870> should

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
can destroy this wood here and I should

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.129 
can destroy this wood here and I should
note<00:04:45.259> that<00:04:45.289> a<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:46.340> squid<00:04:46.880> rates<00:04:47.120> or<00:04:47.780> your

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
note that a the squid rates or your

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.480 
note that a the squid rates or your
squid<00:04:48.440> spawning<00:04:48.770> rates<00:04:48.919> are<00:04:49.069> going<00:04:49.190> to<00:04:49.280> be<00:04:49.370> the

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
squid spawning rates are going to be the

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.779 
squid spawning rates are going to be the
best<00:04:49.699> if<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.770> don't<00:04:51.770> have<00:04:51.949> any<00:04:52.190> other<00:04:52.400> water

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
best if you don't have any other water

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:53.560 
best if you don't have any other water
nearby

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
nearby

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.370 
nearby
if<00:04:54.070> that's<00:04:55.070> like<00:04:55.190> loaded<00:04:55.699> so<00:04:56.660> what<00:04:57.020> that<00:04:57.139> means

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
if that's like loaded so what that means

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.379 
if that's like loaded so what that means
is<00:04:57.530> just<00:04:57.800> go<00:04:57.919> find<00:04:58.070> any<00:04:58.310> water<00:04:58.520> nearby<00:04:58.910> that

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
is just go find any water nearby that

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.740 
is just go find any water nearby that
and<00:05:00.289> just<00:05:00.590> fill<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:00.889> in<00:05:01.009> I<00:05:01.849> kind<00:05:02.300> of<00:05:02.330> primarily

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
and just fill it in I kind of primarily

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.439 
and just fill it in I kind of primarily
designed<00:05:03.139> this<00:05:03.229> for<00:05:03.289> skywalk<00:05:03.860> so<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:05.270> really

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
designed this for skywalk so you really

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.270 
designed this for skywalk so you really
don't<00:05:05.570> have<00:05:05.690> any<00:05:05.900> worries<00:05:06.199> if<00:05:06.380> you're<00:05:07.190> in

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
don't have any worries if you're in

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.490 
don't have any worries if you're in
Skyblock<00:05:07.699> but<00:05:07.940> yeah<00:05:08.720> so<00:05:08.900> there<00:05:09.020> you<00:05:09.139> go<00:05:09.259> so<00:05:09.409> if

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
Skyblock but yeah so there you go so if

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.140 
Skyblock but yeah so there you go so if
we<00:05:09.620> just<00:05:09.770> move<00:05:10.099> far<00:05:10.430> enough<00:05:10.520> away<00:05:10.759> for<00:05:10.909> a

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
we just move far enough away for a

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.909 
we just move far enough away for a
second<00:05:11.539> switch<00:05:11.840> -<00:05:12.020> yep<00:05:12.349> there<00:05:12.560> we<00:05:12.680> go<00:05:12.770> we<00:05:12.889> got

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
second switch - yep there we go we got

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.310 
second switch - yep there we go we got
squids<00:05:13.340> and<00:05:13.659> next<00:05:14.659> we<00:05:14.780> got<00:05:14.900> to<00:05:15.020> build<00:05:15.169> the

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
squids and next we got to build the

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.790 
squids and next we got to build the
whole<00:05:15.500> platform<00:05:16.340> down<00:05:16.460> here<00:05:16.699> to<00:05:16.819> collect<00:05:16.940> them

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
whole platform down here to collect them

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.309 
whole platform down here to collect them
all<00:05:18.800> right<00:05:18.949> and<00:05:19.069> then<00:05:19.479> your<00:05:20.479> first<00:05:20.690> two<00:05:20.990> blocks

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 
all right and then your first two blocks

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:23.020 
all right and then your first two blocks
of<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.620> collection<00:05:22.070> platform<00:05:22.220> first<00:05:22.849> of<00:05:22.940> all

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
of the collection platform first of all

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.339 
of the collection platform first of all
should<00:05:23.150> be<00:05:23.270> directly<00:05:23.599> underneath<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.050> hole

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
should be directly underneath the hole

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.339 
should be directly underneath the hole
here<00:05:24.590> but<00:05:25.270> they<00:05:26.270> should<00:05:26.509> be<00:05:26.630> 15<00:05:27.080> blocks

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
here but they should be 15 blocks

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.350 
here but they should be 15 blocks
beneath<00:05:27.770> wherever<00:05:28.159> you<00:05:28.370> started<00:05:28.789> the<00:05:28.909> farm<00:05:29.120> so

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
beneath wherever you started the farm so

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.270 
beneath wherever you started the farm so
I<00:05:29.389> started<00:05:29.810> this<00:05:29.930> form<00:05:30.110> at<00:05:30.199> 46<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:30.919> lowest

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
I started this form at 46 the lowest

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.520 
I started this form at 46 the lowest
possible<00:05:31.580> value<00:05:32.180> that<00:05:32.449> the<00:05:32.900> squid<00:05:33.080> spawn<00:05:33.349> and

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
possible value that the squid spawn and

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.430 
possible value that the squid spawn and
so<00:05:33.680> now<00:05:34.039> I'm<00:05:34.130> at<00:05:34.250> 31<00:05:34.960> so<00:05:35.960> now<00:05:36.110> what<00:05:36.229> I'm<00:05:36.320> going

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
then just kind of go around the edge

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.520 
then just kind of go around the edge
here<00:05:49.699> and<00:05:49.880> make<00:05:50.449> a<00:05:50.479> little<00:05:50.719> perimeter<00:05:51.289> just

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
here and make a little perimeter just

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.140 
here and make a little perimeter just
because<00:05:51.889> if<00:05:52.520> you<00:05:52.759> don't

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
because if you don't

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.810 
because if you don't
a<00:05:53.240> few<00:05:53.830> insects<00:05:54.830> aren't<00:05:55.099> going<00:05:55.219> to<00:05:55.310> be<00:05:55.400> able<00:05:55.550> to

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
a few insects aren't going to be able to

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.409 
a few insects aren't going to be able to
kind<00:05:55.969> of<00:05:56.199> fall<00:05:57.199> off<00:05:57.229> the<00:05:57.440> edge<00:05:57.560> here<00:05:57.830> and<00:05:57.979> then

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
kind of fall off the edge here and then

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.700 
kind of fall off the edge here and then
of<00:05:59.419> course<00:05:59.479> if<00:05:59.810> you'd<00:06:00.020> rather<00:06:00.169> do<00:06:00.500> a<00:06:00.530> whole
