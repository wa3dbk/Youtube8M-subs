compression<00:02:26.640> device<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.300> detail<00:02:29.090> here<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.240> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
compression device in detail here on the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.900 
compression device in detail here on the
bench<00:02:30.600> is<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.230> ADI<00:02:31.620> test<00:02:31.980> compression<00:02:32.610> device

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.110 

as<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.990> can<00:02:38.110> see<00:02:38.350> it's<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.650> simple<00:02:39.070> device<00:02:39.760> that

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
as you can see it's a simple device that

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.540 
as you can see it's a simple device that
consists<00:02:40.960> of<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:42.700> gauge<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:44.080> lever<00:02:44.550> which

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
consists of a gauge and a lever which

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.220 
consists of a gauge and a lever which
when<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.820> pull<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.150> lever<00:02:46.360> back<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.960> forth

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
when you pull the lever back and forth

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.360 
when you pull the lever back and forth
it<00:02:48.130> applies<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.460> constant<00:02:49.210> load<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.130> golf

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
it applies the constant load to the golf

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.030 
it applies the constant load to the golf
ball<00:02:54.690> basically<00:02:55.690> all<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.320> do<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:56.680> take<00:02:56.860> the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
ball basically all you do is take the

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.630 
ball basically all you do is take the
golf<00:02:57.190> ball<00:02:58.710> place<00:02:59.710> it<00:02:59.980> in<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.910> holder<00:03:02.640> pull

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
golf ball place it in the holder pull

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:13.210 
golf ball place it in the holder pull
the<00:03:03.820> lever<00:03:04.030> back<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:07.080> then<00:03:08.080> read<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.470> number

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.570 

the<00:03:14.220> gauge<00:03:14.490> will<00:03:14.820> give<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.000> reading<00:03:16.250> from<00:03:17.250> zero

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
the gauge will give a reading from zero

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.350 
the gauge will give a reading from zero
to<00:03:18.240> approximately<00:03:18.810> 120<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:20.670> particular<00:03:20.940> golf

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
to approximately 120 the particular golf

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.470 
to approximately 120 the particular golf
ball<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.810> we<00:03:21.960> just<00:03:22.170> tested<00:03:22.620> here<00:03:23.210> was<00:03:24.210> the

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
ball that we just tested here was the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.430 
ball that we just tested here was the
Nike<00:03:25.200> one<00:03:25.860> tore<00:03:26.220> ball<00:03:26.550> in<00:03:27.110> which<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.260> had<00:03:28.410> a

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
Nike one tore ball in which it had a

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.700 
Nike one tore ball in which it had a
compression<00:03:28.920> rating<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:30.930> approximately<00:03:33.710> 110

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
compression rating of approximately 110

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.670 
compression rating of approximately 110
