00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
explosive capability of this base

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.550 
explosive capability of this base
readings<00:04:38.330> confirm<00:04:38.600> high<00:04:39.020> explosive

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
readings confirm high explosive

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.330 
readings confirm high explosive
capability

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
capability

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.170 
capability
okay<00:04:41.060> I'm<00:04:41.300> gonna<00:04:41.750> detonate<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.320> structure

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.140 

Jackson<00:04:47.180> scan<00:04:47.720> for<00:04:47.900> life<00:04:48.050> signs<00:04:48.790> negative<00:04:49.790> sir

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
Jackson scan for life signs negative sir

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.570 
Jackson scan for life signs negative sir
then<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:51.020> guess<00:04:51.230> its<00:04:51.440> mission<00:04:51.800> accomplished

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
then I guess its mission accomplished

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.900 
then I guess its mission accomplished
