00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
guys one of the first things of note is

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.970 
guys one of the first things of note is
I<00:00:18.420> didn't<00:00:19.050> mention<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.470> morganite<00:00:19.800> 2

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
I didn't mention this in the morganite 2

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.710 
I didn't mention this in the morganite 2
video<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.820> Mortal<00:00:21.060> Kombat<00:00:21.240> 2<00:00:21.420> video

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
video and the Mortal Kombat 2 video

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.800 
video and the Mortal Kombat 2 video
didn't<00:00:22.080> have<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:23.460> story<00:00:23.810> graphics

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
didn't have the the story graphics

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.990 
didn't have the the story graphics
screens<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.590> had<00:00:25.769> sort<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.220> text<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.820> one

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
screens it just had sort of text on one

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.939 
screens it just had sort of text on one
of<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.210> backgrounds<00:00:27.779> which<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.410> no<00:00:28.529> big<00:00:28.560> deal

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
of the backgrounds which is no big deal

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.540 
of the backgrounds which is no big deal
but<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.060> same<00:00:30.240> case<00:00:30.480> with<00:00:30.510> MK<00:00:30.960> 3<00:00:31.140> again<00:00:31.560> I

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
but it's the same case with MK 3 again I

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.680 
but it's the same case with MK 3 again I
think<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:32.969> more<00:00:33.149> important<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
think it's more important that the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.360 
think it's more important that the
characters<00:00:34.110> have<00:00:34.290> their<00:00:34.410> buyers<00:00:34.680> see<00:00:35.219> there

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
characters have their buyers see there

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.190 
characters have their buyers see there
it<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.489> there<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.540> think<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.079> more

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
it is there and I think it's more

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.270 
it is there and I think it's more
important<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> character<00:00:38.129> their

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
important that the character their

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.459 
important that the character their
buyers<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.730> endings<00:00:39.059> which<00:00:39.270> MK<00:00:39.629> 2<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.050> 3<00:00:40.290> have

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
buyers and endings which MK 2 and 3 have

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.119 
buyers and endings which MK 2 and 3 have
so<00:00:40.800> that's<00:00:41.129> really<00:00:41.309> good

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
so that's really good

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.490 
so that's really good

but um in arcade it's small I don't know
it's<00:06:36.020> like<00:06:36.199> the<00:06:36.350> computer<00:06:37.000> evades<00:06:38.000> properly

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
it's like the computer evades properly

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.580 
it's like the computer evades properly

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.070 
weren't experts but they just liked

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.850 
weren't experts but they just liked
Mortal<00:07:10.400> Kombat<00:07:10.700> but<00:07:11.060> they<00:07:11.539> gets<00:07:11.810> they<00:07:12.110> just

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860 
Mortal Kombat but they gets they just

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.760

get<00:07:13.099> through<00:07:13.310> the<00:07:13.430> first<00:07:13.639> match<00:07:14.510> and<00:07:14.870> just

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
get through the first match and just

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.110 
get through the first match and just
make<00:07:15.979> it<00:07:16.099> through<00:07:16.190> the<00:07:16.340> second<00:07:16.729> or<00:07:16.820> third<00:07:16.849> and

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:19.580 
I think the fourth match was Jade on

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.719 
I think the fourth match was Jade on
that<00:07:19.880> fucking<00:07:20.270> River<00:07:20.479> stage<00:07:20.870> and<00:07:21.460> she'll<00:07:22.460> just
