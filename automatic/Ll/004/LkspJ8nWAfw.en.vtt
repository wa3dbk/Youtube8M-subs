00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.210
 yes 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.830
 ah 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.830
 if the team leads we know that we have 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.239
 that go loosening the legs little by little 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.190
 that's normal within the preseason 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.739
 that a tape depends hard that walk very 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.410
 inaccurate but for this they serve these 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.210
 parties to go to accommodate us in what 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.690
 football to release the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.070
 physical work and not adapting to what 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.640
 the system and football have already been 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.640
 that we want 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.060
 we walk a little imprecise I tell you but 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.270
 I feel that it is normal is our second 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.760
 rehearsal and we're having 45 time 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.430
 minutes also not to load and to be able 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.920
 hurt the player so I think that 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.979
 in precision is where we have to be 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.900
 a little more effective the other already what 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.119
 we know we have already worked for two 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.940
 years and a half where the team has 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.770
 have to show that football he has made and 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.420
 you have to keep working just in 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.619
 they must be more precise and look for a 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.330
 little more the structure have liked 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.310
 the synodal 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.229
 yes good rivals necaxa of a team that 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.180
 he's always fighting in the league 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.759
 rise that by being close now 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.410
 an axis also with this good inertia 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.149
 that leads with the rise that what 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.920
 got with the reinforcements with his people 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.869
 on my team that is fighting and 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.840
 getting in because new ones that I will take 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.280
 efforts so for now if 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.960
 good rivals I say the ones that come 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.369
 they are also rivals of hierarchy and 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.860
 let's try to take advantage of them 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.180
 maximum for the team arrives in 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.909
 good tone at the start of the tournament as 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.950
 feel the adaptation of the reinforcements 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.049
 Well, well, like everything, not at the beginning 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.020
 it costs more when an outside one comes to 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.799
 the height and 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.770
 the pace but they come well and they showed 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.539
 in a good way because we are already hope 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.120
 that is soon in shape so that 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.379
 it also starts to have minutes and so it 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.540
 can adapt quickly to what's coming 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.120
 saying system that we're singing if 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.739
 could not have us there the time to 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.989
 be able to be with them 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.599
 we had the rest practically today the 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.750
 people are in selection too so 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.340
 there has not been as a meeting or a 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.739
 celebration as such because you have to celebrate 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.690
 also what happened so it will be that 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.640
 first reunion also having 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.950
 some important absences people from 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.900
 hierarchy that is also important 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.970
 for us people who are in others 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.620
 teams and others in selection but it will be 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.180
 nice that first encounter with our 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.599
 people after having achieved the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.599
 bicampeonato
