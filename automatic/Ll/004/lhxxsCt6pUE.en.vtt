 completely totally sling 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.790

 to put it on our screen 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.050
 final iphone is well worth here we have to 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.479
 found fixing is the first thing we notice 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.250
 is that it is totally as if it were a 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.290
 paper sheet 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.210
 I do not know if you can see here the 0.3 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.210
 millimeters thick that has a 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.820
 totally slim case more than this 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.420
 I really do not know what there can be and good 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.070
 You see here that it comes with the logo of the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.630
 manufacturer today here is a sleeve that in 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.490
 this case we have taken the transparent 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.649
 since in this case they do not fix iphone5 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.140
 of white color nor bodies and we think 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.030
 which is the most appropriate and good 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.619
 let's see how it is 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.400
 we always put it on the side of 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.849
 buttons 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.290
 it's very easy to put on and really yes that 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.890
 is we can I can tell you that really 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.680
 it's recent as if it were a 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.890
 sheet of paper as if it did not 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.230
 absolutely nothing 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.390
 really the model the sleeve mode 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.170
 simao coats as if it were a 1 and a 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.170
 waterproof no 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.500
 and let's tighten the perimeter to 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.819
 make sure that this case 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.209
 correctly put 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.219
 and now we have good, well, look how 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.170
 it's pretty good because 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:47.599
 obviously it is not transparent at one hundred 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.060
 Per hundred, but yes, it is 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.819
 translucent and good lets see with what 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.709
 that silicone an apple apple 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.379
 set as good even the part of 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.170
 crystal and it stops for iphone aluminum 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.450
 5 you see clearly we have an opening 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.840
 for the lens 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.330
 and the flash you see and see what is 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.750
 totally slim it is as if we did not wear 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.360
 nothing 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.070
 obviously the all buttons and 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.100
 the openings for the buttons are 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.880
 Totally free button volume button 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.950
 of newt is worth the rear ports of 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.870
 a few speakers the connection for the 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.790
 lightning and well then take a shock 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.580
 totally free 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.260
 just the feeling that we have is 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.840
 which is a totally lightweight case 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.750
 let's say the iphone as simply not 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.140
 we got absolutely nothing and one then 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.690
 little more to tell you the advances of the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.330
 slim type cases they do not want them 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.550
 like that covers that break the aesthetic 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.580
 from the iphone this case of font 5 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.700
 let's say it's the model indicated as 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.730
 you see from here the model coat also 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.080
 tell you that this model really 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.400
 those who are looking for an anti-shock cover 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.870
 forget you over a sleeve simply 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.140
 to avoid what are chaffs of 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.450
 wear scratches and a little more 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.940
 teeth and if the phone falls 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.800

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.720
 It will not help much, it's not a 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.000
 Sofa cover anti shock is a case 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.709
 just to avoid scratches 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.640
 scratches and letters and more pretension 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.140
 certainly for that cyrus paradise for 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.200

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.720
