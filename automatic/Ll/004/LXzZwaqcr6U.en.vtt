00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.400 
together have a beer no I'm just messing
nobody<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.399> there<00:00:32.669> but<00:00:33.300> yeah<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.780> make<00:00:34.050> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
nobody is there but yeah you just make a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.110 
nobody is there but yeah you just make a
project<00:00:35.360> 99<00:00:36.360> frame<00:00:36.660> only<00:00:37.340> exactly<00:00:38.340> 99<00:00:38.879> frame

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
project 99 frame only exactly 99 frame

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.400 
project 99 frame only exactly 99 frame
which<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.390> basically<00:00:39.960> if<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.860> use<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.750> 30<00:00:42.750> FPS

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
which is basically if you use in 30 FPS

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.500 
which is basically if you use in 30 FPS
so<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:43.829> gonna<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.040> three<00:00:44.370> second<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.910> think<00:00:45.239> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
so it's gonna be three second I think I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.799 
so it's gonna be three second I think I
could<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:46.200> wrong<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:47.430> should<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> be

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
could be wrong but it should have to be

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.619 
could be wrong but it should have to be
90<00:00:49.110> 90<00:00:49.260> frame<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.239> basically<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.360> could<00:00:51.480> be

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
90 90 frame and basically it could be

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.200 
90 90 frame and basically it could be
anything<00:00:51.960> anything<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.800> want<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.059> most
