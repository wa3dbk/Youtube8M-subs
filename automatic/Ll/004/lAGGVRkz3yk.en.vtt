puddle of water that's accumulated then

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.950 
puddle of water that's accumulated then
there's<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.789> valve<00:01:05.510> okay<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.810> water

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
there's the valve okay the water

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:23.820 
there's the valve okay the water
shut-off<00:01:10.520> cutting<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.700> tube

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:37.240 

right<00:01:24.830> here<00:01:25.930> this<00:01:26.930> line<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:28.160> a<00:01:28.310> crap<00:01:35.950> off<00:01:36.950> on

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
right here this line is a crap off on

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.720 
right here this line is a crap off on
top<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.730> the<00:01:37.820> old<00:01:37.940> valve<00:01:38.420> we're<00:01:39.230> just<00:01:39.440> going<00:01:39.620> to

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
top of the old valve we're just going to

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.350 
top of the old valve we're just going to
put<00:01:40.730> two<00:01:40.970> valves<00:01:41.360> in<00:01:41.510> line<00:01:42.550> a<00:01:43.550> reason<00:01:44.030> why<00:01:44.180> we

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
put two valves in line a reason why we

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.870 
put two valves in line a reason why we
did<00:01:44.510> that<00:01:44.540> is<00:01:44.720> because<00:01:44.870> I<00:01:45.140> wanted<00:01:45.410> to<00:01:45.470> get<00:01:45.620> this

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
did that is because I wanted to get this

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.090 
did that is because I wanted to get this
the<00:01:46.880> main<00:01:47.540> valve<00:01:47.840> which<00:01:48.470> is<00:01:48.680> going<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:48.890> be<00:01:48.980> this

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
the main valve which is going to be this

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.540 
the main valve which is going to be this
one

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
one

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.730 
one
up<00:01:50.090> above<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.480> ground<00:01:50.660> so<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:51.260> case<00:01:51.410> we<00:01:51.590> need

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
up above the ground so in case we need

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.910 
up above the ground so in case we need
to<00:01:51.800> shut<00:01:51.980> off<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.310> water<00:01:52.340> again<00:01:52.930> we<00:01:53.930> can<00:01:55.450> next

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
to shut off the water again we can next

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.870 
to shut off the water again we can next
what<00:01:57.920> we're<00:01:58.040> gonna<00:01:58.160> do<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.460> we're<00:01:58.580> gonna<00:01:58.640> take

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
this nut off here this is a compression

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.510 
this nut off here this is a compression
nut<00:02:01.780> with<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.810> compression<00:02:03.350> sleeve<00:02:06.520> your

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
nut with the compression sleeve your

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.919 
nut with the compression sleeve your
compression<00:02:08.000> sleeve<00:02:08.240> looks<00:02:08.390> kind<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:08.750> like<00:02:08.869> a

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
compression sleeve looks kind of like a

turning<00:03:09.440> on<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.799> water<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.370> see<00:03:10.610> if<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.880> leaks

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
turning on the water to see if it leaks

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.479 
turning on the water to see if it leaks
see<00:03:13.130> any<00:03:13.310> water<00:03:13.519> nope<00:03:14.239> I<00:03:14.540> don't<00:03:15.350> either<00:03:15.620> it's

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
see any water nope I don't either it's

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.039 
see any water nope I don't either it's
not<00:03:16.670> well<00:03:16.970> except<00:03:17.390> for<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.570> stuff<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:17.959> the

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
not well except for the stuff in the

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.490 
not well except for the stuff in the
puddle<00:03:18.380> but

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.630 

I<00:03:23.230> think<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.350> looks<00:03:24.560> like<00:03:24.770> it's<00:03:24.950> done

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
I think it looks like it's done
