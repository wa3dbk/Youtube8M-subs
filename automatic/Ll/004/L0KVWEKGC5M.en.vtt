of<00:01:41.940> that<00:01:42.000> tunnel<00:01:42.180> where<00:01:42.480> there's<00:01:42.660> a<00:01:42.720> lot<00:01:42.900> of

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
of that tunnel where there's a lot of

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.770 
of that tunnel where there's a lot of
enemies<00:01:43.290> around<00:01:43.500> somehow<00:01:44.460> those<00:01:44.730> guys<00:01:44.970> didn't

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
enemies around somehow those guys didn't

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.060 
enemies around somehow those guys didn't
manage<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:45.990> kill<00:01:46.110> me<00:01:46.410> I<00:01:46.440> think<00:01:46.620> that<00:01:46.740> guy<00:01:46.950> was

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
manage to kill me I think that guy was

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.430 
manage to kill me I think that guy was
actually<00:01:47.190> even<00:01:47.460> afk<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:48.540> he<00:01:49.140> didn't

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
actually even afk and he didn't

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.230 
actually even afk and he didn't
capitalize<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.220> chance<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.580> get<00:01:50.940> me<00:01:51.090> there

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
capitalize on the chance to get me there

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.050 
capitalize on the chance to get me there
so<00:01:51.420> somehow<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.110> survived<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.190> now<00:01:53.580> it's<00:01:53.820> gonna

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
so somehow I survived and now it's gonna

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.170 
so somehow I survived and now it's gonna
be<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> hard<00:01:54.690> push<00:01:55.020> up<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.220> enemies<00:01:56.640> next

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
be a hard push up to the enemies next

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.360 
be a hard push up to the enemies next
flag<00:01:57.480> so<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.350> pretty<00:01:58.470> much<00:01:58.530> expect<00:01:58.770> enemies

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
flag so I can pretty much expect enemies

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.820 
flag so I can pretty much expect enemies
along<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.730> way<00:01:59.880> now<00:02:00.690> that's<00:02:00.900> being<00:02:01.110> said<00:02:01.410> you

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
along the way now that's being said you

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.590 
along the way now that's being said you
don't<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.190> to<00:02:02.310> ad<00:02:02.490> us<00:02:02.730> around<00:02:03.030> every<00:02:03.420> single

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
don't have to ad us around every single

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.690 
don't have to ad us around every single
corner<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.710> fact<00:02:04.830> you're<00:02:04.980> gonna<00:02:05.100> see<00:02:05.340> here

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
corner and in fact you're gonna see here

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.580 
corner and in fact you're gonna see here
I'm<00:02:06.090> gonna<00:02:06.270> be<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.510> sprinting<00:02:07.080> at<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> moment

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
I'm gonna be you sprinting at the moment

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.199 
I'm gonna be you sprinting at the moment
while<00:02:07.710> reloading<00:02:08.159> I'm<00:02:08.489> gonna<00:02:08.670> take<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:08.970> time

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
while reloading I'm gonna take this time

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.540 
while reloading I'm gonna take this time
to<00:02:09.269> reload<00:02:09.690> my<00:02:09.720> pistol<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.379> well<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
to reload my pistol as well and the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.309 
to reload my pistol as well and the
reason<00:02:11.819> for<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.269> because<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.659> can<00:02:12.900> see<00:02:13.170> by

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
reason for that is because I can see by

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.110 
reason for that is because I can see by
using<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.739> mini-map<00:02:14.159> that<00:02:14.640> there<00:02:14.819> are<00:02:14.940> no

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
using the mini-map that there are no

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.210 
using the mini-map that there are no
enemies<00:02:15.360> around<00:02:15.810> here<00:02:16.230> it's<00:02:16.470> pretty<00:02:16.770> much<00:02:16.890> our

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
enemies around here it's pretty much our

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.470 
enemies around here it's pretty much our
territory<00:02:17.910> all<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.420> way

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
territory all the way

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.360 
territory all the way
I'm<00:02:19.569> pretty<00:02:19.989> much<00:02:20.170> sure<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:21.010> I'm<00:02:21.099> not<00:02:21.310> going

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
I'm pretty much sure that I'm not going

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.369 
I'm pretty much sure that I'm not going
to<00:02:21.580> get<00:02:21.700> killed<00:02:21.940> I'm<00:02:22.239> not<00:02:22.480> gonna<00:02:22.629> run<00:02:22.870> into<00:02:23.349> any

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
to get killed I'm not gonna run into any

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.009 
to get killed I'm not gonna run into any
enemies<00:02:23.980> what's<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.760> reload<00:02:25.150> my<00:02:25.299> weapons<00:02:25.750> their

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
enemies what's I reload my weapons their

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.899 
enemies what's I reload my weapons their
um<00:02:26.230> your<00:02:26.739> mini-map<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.220> really<00:02:27.519> going<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.760> be

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
um your mini-map is really going to be

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.580 
um your mini-map is really going to be
your<00:02:28.060> best<00:02:28.209> friend<00:02:28.330> in<00:02:28.720> reading<00:02:29.470> the

your best friend in reading the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
enemy and where you're going to need to

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.410 
enemy and where you're going to need to
start<00:02:35.830> edia<00:02:36.099> Singh<00:02:36.370> I'm<00:02:36.519> playing<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.180> sort

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
start edia Singh I'm playing that sort

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.080 
start edia Singh I'm playing that sort
of<00:02:37.510> defensive<00:02:38.019> pushing<00:02:38.410> game<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:39.549> this<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:39.940> of

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
of defensive pushing game and this is of

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.759 
of defensive pushing game and this is of
course<00:02:40.269> dependent<00:02:40.840> on<00:02:40.989> how<00:02:41.200> many<00:02:41.260> players<00:02:41.530> are

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
course dependent on how many players are

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.130 
course dependent on how many players are
in<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:41.950> game<00:02:42.129> on<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.400> map<00:02:42.940> itself<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:44.110> the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
in the game on the map itself and in the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.319 
in the game on the map itself and in the
current<00:02:44.560> situation<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.610> this<00:02:45.879> is<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> pretty

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
current situation so this is a pretty

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.759 
current situation so this is a pretty
closed<00:02:46.629> off<00:02:46.810> map<00:02:47.019> there<00:02:47.379> are<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> lot<00:02:47.739> of

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
closed off map there are a lot of

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.740 
closed off map there are a lot of
corridors<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.430> as<00:02:48.790> such<00:02:49.000> there<00:02:49.269> are<00:02:49.299> a<00:02:49.420> lot<00:02:49.720> of

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
corridors and as such there are a lot of

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.259 
corridors and as such there are a lot of
corners<00:02:50.290> for<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.680> ABS<00:02:51.099> around<00:02:51.489> but<00:02:52.090> if<00:02:52.209> you

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
corners for you to ABS around but if you

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.759 
corners for you to ABS around but if you
were<00:02:52.329> playing<00:02:52.599> on<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.750> much<00:02:52.930> more<00:02:53.140> open<00:02:53.349> map

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
were playing on a much more open map

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.259 
were playing on a much more open map
you're<00:02:54.220> not<00:02:54.430> really<00:02:54.640> going<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.819> be<00:02:54.910> wanting<00:02:55.209> to

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
you're not really going to be wanting to

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.119 
you're not really going to be wanting to
alias<00:02:55.750> around<00:02:56.079> every<00:02:56.410> corner<00:02:56.590> since<00:02:56.950> there

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
alias around every corner since there

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.610 
alias around every corner since there
are<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.400> many<00:02:57.519> angles<00:02:58.000> of<00:02:58.120> attack<00:02:58.319> so<00:02:59.319> you<00:02:59.349> sort

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
are so many angles of attack so you sort

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.990 
are so many angles of attack so you sort
of<00:02:59.680> have<00:02:59.829> to<00:02:59.859> get<00:03:00.069> used<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.579> current<00:03:00.849> map
