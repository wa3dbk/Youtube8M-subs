the<00:00:34.410> replica<00:00:44.030> let<00:00:45.030> me<00:00:45.149> say<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.510> replica<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the replica let me say the replica is a

the replica let me say the replica is a
I<00:00:46.800> mean<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.579> shoe<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.180> shouldn't<00:00:48.989> be<00:00:49.079> hard

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
I mean this shoe is it shouldn't be hard

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.650 
I mean this shoe is it shouldn't be hard
to<00:00:49.379> replicate<00:00:49.530> anyway<00:00:50.250> because<00:00:50.420> it's<00:00:51.420> all

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
to replicate anyway because it's all

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.799 
to replicate anyway because it's all
black<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.260> mean<00:00:54.289> not<00:00:55.289> too<00:00:55.530> much<00:00:55.770> details<00:00:56.399> but

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
black I mean not too much details but

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.150 
black I mean not too much details but
this<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> pretty<00:00:59.300> good<00:01:00.300> replica<00:01:00.930> me<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.500> feet

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
this is a pretty good replica me on feet

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
this is a pretty good replica me on feet
these<00:01:02.489> joints<00:01:03.890> it's<00:01:04.890> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.250> hard

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
these joints it's going to be hard

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.460 
these joints it's going to be hard
enough<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:08.280> know<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.939> they're<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.470> replicas

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
enough to know that they're not replicas

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.160 
enough to know that they're not replicas
I<00:01:10.650> mean<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.640> icy<00:01:12.150> net<00:01:12.390> unless<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:12.990> look

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
I mean the icy net unless you know look

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.070 
I mean the icy net unless you know look
for<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.909> that<00:01:14.909> gives<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.270> away<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.689> all<00:01:15.900> right

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
for that that gives it away on all right

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.030 
for that that gives it away on all right
because<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> nut<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.280> super<00:01:17.759> icy<00:01:18.150> clear

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
because the nut is like super icy clear

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.310 
because the nut is like super icy clear
that<00:01:20.040> wet<00:01:20.280> load<00:01:20.570> should<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.630> more<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.110> white

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
that wet load should be more the white

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.670 
that wet load should be more the white
look<00:01:23.689> flat<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:27.570> midsole<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.350> tell<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
look flat the midsole like I tell you a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.660 
look flat the midsole like I tell you a
lot<00:01:28.920> about<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.729> buried<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
lot about because it's buried and the

lot about because it's buried and the
white<00:01:32.850> midsole<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.329> hard<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.659> pick<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:34.020> it's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
white midsole is hard to pick up it's

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.410 
white midsole is hard to pick up it's
very<00:01:35.220> very<00:01:35.610> grainy<00:01:36.409> look<00:01:37.409> at<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> sharp<00:01:37.979> teeth

spoke<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:48.770> inner<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.180> midsole<00:02:52.360> again

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
spoke to the inner of the midsole again

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.530 
spoke to the inner of the midsole again
is<00:02:53.540> more<00:02:53.750> grainy<00:02:54.110> again<00:02:54.590> on<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.890> replica

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
is more grainy again on the replica

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.270 
is more grainy again on the replica
you<00:02:56.540> can<00:02:56.690> see<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.200> authentic<00:02:57.800> just<00:02:57.980> more

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
you can see that the authentic just more

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.690 
you can see that the authentic just more
cleaner<00:02:58.610> smooth<00:03:00.250> pain<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.460> more<00:03:01.700> on<00:03:01.820> point<00:03:03.700> as

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
cleaner smooth pain is more on point as

cleaner smooth pain is more on point as
you<00:03:05.150> can<00:03:05.300> see<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.510> toe<00:03:05.690> box<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.140> right<00:03:06.320> there

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
you can see the toe box is right there

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.720 
you can see the toe box is right there
the<00:03:08.330> authentic<00:03:08.810> comes<00:03:09.020> back<00:03:09.290> nice<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:10.550> rep

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
the authentic comes back nice the rep

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:19.450 
the authentic comes back nice the rep
goes<00:03:10.970> up<00:03:11.240> and<00:03:11.450> it's<00:03:11.540> more<00:03:11.780> bulky<00:03:18.460> there's

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
goes up and it's more bulky there's

goes up and it's more bulky there's
gonna<00:03:19.700> be<00:03:19.850> a<00:03:19.880> good<00:03:20.120> look<00:03:20.300> right<00:03:20.480> here<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.920> rep

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
gonna be a good look right here the rep

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.490
