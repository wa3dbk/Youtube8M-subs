much I think there's a very fine line of

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.560 
much I think there's a very fine line of
between<00:02:00.840> sensuality<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.860> vulgarity<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> a

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
between sensuality and vulgarity so a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.929 
between sensuality and vulgarity so a
judge<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> director<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:05.640> who's

sense<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.360> know<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.660> we<00:02:22.140> figured<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.530> out

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
sense you know and we figured that out

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.620 
sense you know and we figured that out
on<00:02:22.830> day<00:02:22.980> one<00:02:23.190> when<00:02:23.430> we<00:02:23.490> shot<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.910> song<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:24.570> I

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
on day one when we shot the song so I

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.530 
on day one when we shot the song so I
think<00:02:24.720> he's<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.650> credit<00:02:26.040> for<00:02:26.460> doing<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.970> and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
think he's the credit for doing that and

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.320 
think he's the credit for doing that and
creating<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.320> goes<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:29.040> him<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.520> remaking

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
creating that goes to him and remaking

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.100 
creating that goes to him and remaking
and<00:02:30.630> reliving<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.320> magic<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.460> original

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
and reliving the magic of the original

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.630 
and reliving the magic of the original
arch<00:02:34.110> pure<00:02:34.320> because<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.800> song<00:02:35.070> also<00:02:35.250> when<00:02:35.520> I

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
arch pure because that song also when I

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.580

when<00:02:35.850> we<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.450> know<00:02:36.570> YouTube<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.140> psalm<00:02:37.320> today

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
when we you know YouTube the psalm today

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.920 
when we you know YouTube the psalm today
also<00:02:37.830> we<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:38.880> feel<00:02:39.060> oh<00:02:39.210> my<00:02:39.330> god<00:02:39.570> it's<00:02:39.750> just

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
also we just feel oh my god it's just

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.230 
also we just feel oh my god it's just
full<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:40.770> much<00:02:40.950> passion<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.550> sensuality

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
full of so much passion and sensuality

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.600 
full of so much passion and sensuality
to<00:02:42.930> recreate<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.710> of<00:02:43.860> course<00:02:44.040> was<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> task

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
to recreate that of course was a task

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.720 
to recreate that of course was a task
and<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.150> think<00:02:45.480> we've<00:02:45.690> some<00:02:46.380> somewhat<00:02:47.160> managed

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
and I think we've some somewhat managed

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.720 
and I think we've some somewhat managed
it<00:02:48.410> well<00:02:49.910> but<00:02:51.230> other<00:02:52.230> than<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.650> think<00:02:53.130> J<00:02:53.610> or

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
it well but other than that I think J or

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.030 
it well but other than that I think J or
merely<00:02:53.910> chemistry<00:02:54.540> also<00:02:54.990> it<00:02:55.140> was<00:02:55.290> easier<00:02:55.740> had

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
merely chemistry also it was easier had

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.490 
merely chemistry also it was easier had
it<00:02:56.160> been<00:02:56.280> somebody<00:02:56.610> else<00:02:57.170> because<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.290> was<00:02:58.410> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
it been somebody else because it was the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.680 
it been somebody else because it was the
demand<00:02:58.740> hemara<00:02:59.400> end<00:02:59.640> target<00:03:00.030> movie<00:03:00.540> who

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
demand hemara end target movie who

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.060 
demand hemara end target movie who
thought<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:00.900> we<00:03:01.110> have<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.500> bring<00:03:01.740> it<00:03:01.860> about

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
thought that we have to bring it about

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.090 
thought that we have to bring it about
but<00:03:02.310> with<00:03:02.430> J<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.940> became<00:03:03.240> slightly<00:03:03.480> easier<00:03:04.140> as

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
but with J it became slightly easier as

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.790 
but with J it became slightly easier as
luck<00:03:05.370> would<00:03:05.400> have<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:06.030> both<00:03:06.210> of<00:03:06.240> us<00:03:06.480> have

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
luck would have it that both of us have

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.410 
luck would have it that both of us have
worked<00:03:07.800> together<00:03:08.040> before<00:03:08.400> we've<00:03:08.880> hosted<00:03:09.120> a

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
worked together before we've hosted a

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.330 
worked together before we've hosted a
few<00:03:09.600> events<00:03:09.870> here<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.740> there<00:03:10.860> so<00:03:10.980> we<00:03:11.100> there

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
few events here and there so we there

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.830 
few events here and there so we there
was<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.460> familiarity<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.210> know<00:03:12.420> with<00:03:12.600> each

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
was a familiarity you know with each

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.110 
was a familiarity you know with each
other<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.740> think<00:03:13.950> both<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.310> both<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:15.000> us

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
other and I think both of both of us

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.030 
other and I think both of both of us
took<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.480> up<00:03:15.630> very<00:03:15.900> very<00:03:15.990> professionally

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
took it up very very professionally

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.030 
took it up very very professionally
we<00:03:17.430> would<00:03:17.580> really<00:03:18.230> elaborately<00:03:19.230> in<00:03:19.440> detail

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
we would really elaborately in detail

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.130 
we would really elaborately in detail
discuss<00:03:20.550> what<00:03:20.790> we<00:03:20.970> need<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.360> do<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.750> made

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
discuss what we need to do so that made

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.230 
discuss what we need to do so that made
it<00:03:22.170> even<00:03:22.470> more<00:03:22.680> easier<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.250> we<00:03:23.850> know<00:03:23.970> both<00:03:24.150> of

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
it even more easier that we know both of

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.300 
it even more easier that we know both of
us<00:03:24.330> are<00:03:24.450> on<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.570> same<00:03:24.840> page<00:03:25.080> we<00:03:25.920> know<00:03:26.100> we<00:03:26.220> need

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
us are on the same page we know we need

incredible<00:05:43.289> and<00:05:43.620> that's<00:05:43.830> exactly<00:05:44.160> what<00:05:44.460> she's

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
incredible and that's exactly what she's

incredible and that's exactly what she's
translated<00:05:45.780> in<00:05:46.410> pink<00:05:46.890> lips<00:05:47.070> also<00:05:47.400> she's

looking<00:05:47.760> absolutely<00:05:48.539> hot<00:05:48.720> in<00:05:49.020> the<00:05:49.200> song<00:05:49.410> so<00:05:49.440> I

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
looking absolutely hot in the song so I

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.620
