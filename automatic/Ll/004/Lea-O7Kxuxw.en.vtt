wake her up but nothing happens of

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:51.869 
wake her up but nothing happens of
course<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:51.070> next<00:00:51.249> thing<00:00:51.370> I<00:00:51.429> think<00:00:51.489> of<00:00:51.730> is

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
course the next thing I think of is

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.599 
course the next thing I think of is
doing<00:00:52.179> CPR<00:00:52.570> on<00:00:52.600> her<00:00:52.809> right<00:00:52.989> but<00:00:53.859> as<00:00:54.039> I<00:00:54.219> go<00:00:54.399> up<00:00:54.489> to

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
doing CPR on her right but as I go up to

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.910 
doing CPR on her right but as I go up to
her<00:00:54.699> face<00:00:54.940> I<00:00:55.210> can<00:00:55.480> hear<00:00:55.629> her<00:00:55.690> breathing<00:00:55.920> so

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
her face I can hear her breathing so

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.450 
her face I can hear her breathing so
instead<00:00:57.429> I<00:00:57.640> pull<00:00:57.850> out<00:00:57.879> my<00:00:57.969> phone<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.269> dial<00:00:58.600> 911

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
instead I pull out my phone and dial 911

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.559 
instead I pull out my phone and dial 911
eventually<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:00.579> paramedics<00:01:00.999> show<00:01:01.120> up<00:01:01.269> and<00:01:01.449> we
