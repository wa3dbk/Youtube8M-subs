00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.150
 to me 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.150
 Yemen is how you are welcome to a 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.080
 new video and good guys in this 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.130
 occasion we will talk about something very 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.469
 important with respect to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.970
 movements of 0.10 and it is that everything 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.890
 masacci confirmed that to run the 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.180
 infinite worlds in a version you'll have 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.740
 than having at least two cores 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.540
 hundreds more like tablets so it's something 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.430
 that made me a little strange but good 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.869
 if welfare is something for them to know 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.400
 so let's go with the image boys 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.900
 I hope you are passing an excellent 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.730
 Sunday and you can see that this guy 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.410
 question that if the 0.9 points should 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.910
 remove a double nucleus and that definitive 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.350
 it does not have a double core so it takes its 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.910
 partner replies the following guys 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.260
 that you keep a good tour with a 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.239
 core so far because to find 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.860
 the power to do things like these have 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.600
 had to use the two three or four 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.430
 cores so these these two guys 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.049
 that for people with two nuclei I think that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.580
 I already said a lot, the nucleus can run to 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:49.680
 moyÃ¡ man graphic because you will not see any 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.390
 change will even go faster and as 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.920
 the light and for people with a core 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.199
 if he recommends that you continue playing with 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.100
 the worlds that are now at the 0.8 point 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.440
 zero that are 250 which is by 256 ok and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.290
 well, it is also here that they see it 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.060
 like a 0.8 point zero full of things 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.620
 new ok and websites too and if here 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.510
 boys what is 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.760
 Well, if you have a friend with William 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.290
 or an external one with an infinite world by 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.780
 a hundred throw you can be able to play the same 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.310
 even if you have an iphone 4 or an iphone 4 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.630
 ok and then at that necessary moment what 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.250
 which is a list of boys with all 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.170
 the devices that I think I can go 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.210
 and there are more then we axles that will circulate 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.860
 minecraft and 0.10 all devices 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.420
 so knowing a lot for the people 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.360
 that he has even though he took an iphone 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.890
 4 or a fourth generation type or a 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.050
 first generation nexus but that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.340
 You guys can not really run a 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.110
 foundation world and you do not have dual core 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.000
 so are the following magners 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.520
 4s phone and later as it is the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.620

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.710
 exception of the first letters 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.120
 generation and then these crops here 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.920

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.620
