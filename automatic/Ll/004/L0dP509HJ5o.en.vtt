00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.790
 hello everyone and I hope you 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.530
 okay I'm going nickel so we get 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.110
 found for a new tutorial on 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.330
 dofus mans paris where I am going 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.039
 learn to have a lot of green 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.769
 thanks to a loophole that I found so 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.779
 there is nothing to download I specify 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.329
 and you enter your null credentials 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.410
 share so you'll see it's 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.630
 relatively easy 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.630
 it's really by injecting a query 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.579
 to the tofu server what we will be able to 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.050
 generate its origins so I specify to 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.730
 before it does not work on 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.160
 dofus it works only on the site 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.510
 of dofus so we go on our 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.280
 browser we type dofus and we go 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.900
 on the official website of dofus 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.880
 so I'm sorry it's relatively 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.870
 long to charge since I have a 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.850
 pacitel connection that's so we're going 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:07.430
 do with then we'll see what that 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:12.200
 so give you go on the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:17.090
 shop so on the dofus shop 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.450
 of course I'm waiting for his 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.450
 charge 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.370
 hop there you connect then I 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.170
 wanted to clarify that I 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.420
 do not share this night this technique 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.430
 because I 'm pretty exploited and 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.200
 I would like to introduce myself by 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.690
 compared to this low technique that I 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.490
 so you share there who comment and 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.900
 share and brief once again that 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.610
 you are expected once you 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.410
 are identified you go hockey 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.670
 was waiting so here we go in the 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.430
 services tend you go in 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.770
 the services so there you see to your 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.790
 right you have 0 to the green or 1000 that 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.070
 depends what you have on your 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.360
 current character even if you have 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.460
 some ruins it worked 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.090
 so there you go on your desk you 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.530
 go create a new text document 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.900
 so lhi rights new documents 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:16.600
 texts hop on you call it green 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.760
 so back for dofus green progress or 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.620
 double click on it and that's it 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.700
 show a box note you will return 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.370
 this line of code 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.480
 so do not worry if you 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.250
 can not do that if you 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.690
 can not put the line of code 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.160
 I will put it in the description 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.290
 of the video I would put you anyway 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.600
 in case we are not obliged of course 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.130
 block download links 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.150
 Notes 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.200
 you do not have to, you just have to 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.299
 do what I do on the screen otherwise 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.500
 it's in case if you can not do it 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.220
 will still give in the description 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.220
 here 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.060
 so you put your lines of code 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.890
 you 're doing a paste copy of this 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.890
 line of code we will avoid typing them 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.900
 and the hes so green so that's the 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.739
 workers we want that puts us 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.670
 on on the browser in fact so I 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.540
 says it's not just visual 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.270
 ok then there for example 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.739
 there you have green point txt us this 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.360
 we want is the time it is 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.340
 put in bat points so instead of 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.019
 wooden levett texter in bat points so 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.910
 if you do not have an extension you 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.220
 go in your searches down 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.780
 your windows makes you search 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.670
 folder options then you go 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.100
 fall on it and there you go 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.440
 uncheck the box that I show you who 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:44.450
 is unchecked to show extensions 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.330
 and you apply them and validated there 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.500
 you're going to rename it to a low point 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.630
 your blissful point and so there it gives you 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.250
 a little file like that you're going 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.630
 simply double click on it 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.069
 to send the query on dofus 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.890
 attention there it is imperative it is necessary to 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:11.269
 all price close your browser 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:13.280
 after running points beat so there 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.250
 here I throw them now we will 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.630
 return directly to our browser 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.250
 and we will return to the site of dofus 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.560
 so there logically has been credited with 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.729
 our 1000 of nomi lo green so we go 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.000
 go see that so the same in the 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.000
 shop 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:37.120
 we will go to the services and we will 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.120
 will reconnect again 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.500
 you'll see it's pretty 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.970
 impressive so here is the g 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.760
 notice that I was credited with milo 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.830
 green then what are we going to do now 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.050
 we're going to try to generate 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.340
 10 me lo green at once so I specify 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.440
 we can do it as many times as we can 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.170
 wants one could do ten thousand clicks 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.310
 will confess to credit of all the ears 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.490
 opts so here I do it ten times so I 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.740
 reprecise the ogrines you can not 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.720
 use them on dofus so on 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.140
 the dofus computer you can do it 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.550
 only through the browser you can 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.370
 buy for example an orb 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.630
 restorative assimilated to the green you 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.630
 can subscribe thanks to these birds 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.710
 green and have various gifts that you 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.580
 can then resell on dofus 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.020
 you can buy the whole shop 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.410
 in short you can really make yourself 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.630
 pleasure 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.050
 so we reconnect so here I did 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.570
 says click on the date point so 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.620
 on the file we wrote just before 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.320
 so normally I'm going to have eleven 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.300
 mile or green in 10000 since I have 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.070
 generate more than 1000 before so that's it 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.070
 I put eleven thousand auryn forgiveness 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.040
 so we can see that the technique 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.680
 works perfectly thank you 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.210
 to have watched this video I tell you 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.890
 see you next time for a new video 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.000
 it will surely not be a technique of 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.340
 flaws like that it will surely be a 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.870
 tutorial on techniques thiam I 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.680
 tell you to like and commented soon 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.680
 subscribe
