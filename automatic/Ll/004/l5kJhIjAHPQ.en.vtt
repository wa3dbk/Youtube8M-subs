00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 you 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.870
 hello thank you very much for being in a 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.059
 new video of this channel finally 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.550
 we are back in another video of this 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.860
 style and this time we're going to talk 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.110
 about what we are interested in seeing or what 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.840
 we would like to see in the new version of 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.000
 Android already final as we know the version 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.759
 preview for developers has 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.399
 been presented a few days ago 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.530
 some weeks called android l 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.590
 although as we all know the name 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.170
 final is not going to be Android l but Android 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.150
 and some name of some dessert that 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.070
 start with the letter l so for 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.290
 start you can go putting in the 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.900
 comments what name would you like that 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.250
 had the new version of android 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.200
 obviously having the name of a 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.360
 personally I would like that 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.760
 had lollipop has been handled in 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.800
 some rumors this name for the 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.989
 new android version so to me 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.089
 like lollipop you in the comments 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.920
 why name would you like it to have 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.810
 this new version of android just in case 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.579
 you knew I also made some videos 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.310
 previous ones that I would like to see 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.229
 example on android 4.3 and I also made a 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.990
 visual concept of what I would like 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.720
 see in 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.759
 kit kat obviously that's already happened so 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.649
 maybe there are things that did look like 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.270
 once there are things that were not seen so 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.950
 If you want to see those videos, I'll leave you 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.960
 links in the description now yes for 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.210
 start in the video that I would like 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.729
 see in android 4.3 I also mentioned this 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.259
 point and I'll mention it again because I do not 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.539
 has been implemented at least in a way 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.429
 official and that google announces it to 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.860
 public and it's the low latency audio 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:42.350
 this is a problem of the devices 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.590
 Android that ios devices do not 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.049
 they have and it's something that really is almost 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.549
 almost the only thing I like about them 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.409
 you know there are many applications of 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.060
 musical instruments to touch 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.310
 the piano the guitar whatever you want 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.970
 but on android the response time 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.799
 ios is longer than this little 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.049
 Response time is called low 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.720
 latency when I touch the screen in 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.390
 an ios device sounds practically 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.729
 in an immediate way and on android 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.519
 when I touch the screen it takes a 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.739
 short time that already being touching the 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.830
 shape instrument a little more let's say 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.290
 professional resents that little 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.040
 delay so I would like to see 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.079
 already finally on android l second thing that 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.540
 I would like to have implemented is a 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.090
 mode either a safe mode or a mode 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.120
 children as we know there are already brands like lg 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.620
 or samsung who are pretending 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.569
 implement these modes but everyone 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.819
 in his way for example elite in the mode 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.069
 guest that you select certain 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.560
 samsung applications has the kids mode 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.930
 where also the father is supposed 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.970
 only authorizes certain games but 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.549
 there is a certain disorder in this 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.430
 ecosystem and could do well to android 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.579
 as an ecosystem and together have a 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.250
 native form implemented in this way 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.739
 either a safe mode or a children mode a 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.329
 restrictive mode or whatever google 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.189
 I want to call but I think he 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.620
 would come very well to android and bring 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.810
 natively this option since it has been 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.120
 pretty striking in terms of 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.950
 implementation of elche and samsung and this 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.049
 is number two that I would like to see 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.659
 we go quickly to number three and 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.579
 it is more or less like an advance 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.170
 what they told us in the presentation of 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.569
 the preview of android 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.060
 and is that in that presentation they said that 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.830
 they had the project volta let's say it 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.599
 focused on development to reduce 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.370
 the energy consumption of the new 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.470
 Android version and I think this is a 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.750
 point that also manages them quite 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.600
 well just by leaving two 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.790
 one android devices and one ios in the 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.709
 night already with the screen blocked from 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.200
 wifi off and everything you want 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.239
 always when waking up an android has 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.580
 less battery unless it's a 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.140
 battery sufficiently larger than 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.019
 the iphone but what I mean 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.000
 is that in the management of the battery 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.400
 in terms of waiting time when 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.290
 is at rest is very good there is or is 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.090
 efficient enough the battery when the 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.459
 device is already waiting when 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.410
 the android are obviously active 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.150
 they usually have batteries larger than 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.310
 of the iphone so there we are not going to 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.930
 put me to what I want to focus is to 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.910
 the duration of the battery when the 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.769
 device is on hold when it is 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.630
 The screen is turned off and the 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.820
 wifi during this time that the 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.919
 device can not spend almost almost 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.150
 nothing of battery would be great we go with 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.889
 another thing that I would like to see 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.940
 implemented in the new version of 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.000
 android and that 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.250
 remote lock mode very similar to what 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.590
 What is it about me? With icloud, I know I'm 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.270
 taking many things from ios but I think 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.130
 which are points where android 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.800
 needs to be strengthened if you want to continue 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.690
 dominating the market and is that in ios if 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.760
 you lose your device or if it is stolen 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.770
 you have the possibility to block it 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.650
 from the computer and it's practically 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.300
 impossible to unlock it I know that some 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.790
 they are going to tell me that if you can but at 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.250
 less is not as easy as in android in 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.980
 Android will simply enter the mode 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.380
 recovery I restart it and ready then 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.880
 I would very much like to see some 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.100
 implementation of google I do not know maybe 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.660
 that when trying to enter the recovery you 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.600
 ask your password to your account 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.910
 google or when trying to enter the 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.460
 bootloader to unlock the bootloader 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.050
 that also asks for your password 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.300
 google account as this will be 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.310
 much more difficult for thieves 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.620
 and people who do things 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.840
 bad restart the devices and so 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.370
 they would be unusable all this must 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.500
 be with the google account because well 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.240
 have one the assurance that it is your 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.100
 own account but I would like to see 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.070
 something some attempt of 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.720
 with which to facilitate the blocking 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.580
 remote from our device but 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.890
 assuring us that it's going to stay so 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.260
 less almost totally totally 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.480
 unusable this would greatly reduce the 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.940
 index of thefts that occur from the 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.100
 smartphones and finally this I already said 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.720
 also in some past video and it's not 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.790
 merely from the new version of android 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.860
 but of all the google services in 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.350
 general and that is in google play it 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.200
 already allows to buy with card 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.450
 credit with gift cards but not 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.610
 it is allowed to give away an application or 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.140
 some content from the google store to 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.630
 another person I think this also 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.220
 would improve sales if for example I 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.500
 I want to give to some of my 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.630
 subscribers I do not know maybe the version 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.480
 full of fifa what can I do 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.430
 simply giving away the application and 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.650
 not having to give away a whole card 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.070
 of 200 pesos for example of the same 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.320
 way I could give away music movies 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.730
 books and everything sold in google 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.800
 plays thor I think it would be a good 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.080
 alternative also enable this 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.120
 option to give content to others 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.440
 users with your google account and good 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.420
 those are my p 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.450
 the proposals you also leave yours 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.250
 in the comments so that all 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.960
 we are sharing ideas that we 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.670
 like to see in the new version of 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.380
 Android I hope you liked this 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.380
 video and see you next
