the templates were beautiful the only

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.560 
the templates were beautiful the only
reason<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.130> changed<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:29.970> because<00:02:30.330> with

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
reason that I changed it is because with

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.780 
reason that I changed it is because with
most<00:02:30.780> drag<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.350> drops<00:02:31.590> you're<00:02:32.070> not<00:02:32.280> able<00:02:32.640> to

most drag and drops you're not able to

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.760 
most drag and drops you're not able to
customize<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.450> as<00:02:33.780> much<00:02:33.990> as<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.230> are<00:02:34.410> with<00:02:34.620> a
