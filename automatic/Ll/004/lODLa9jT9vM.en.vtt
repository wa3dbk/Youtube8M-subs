versus<00:00:43.260> other<00:00:43.500> row<00:00:43.829> exercises<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
versus other row exercises and the

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.319 
versus other row exercises and the
benefits<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.710> provides<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.850> her<00:00:47.969> not

only<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:48.690> building<00:00:48.989> muscle<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.890> her

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
only for building muscle but her

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.060 
only for building muscle but her
performance<00:00:50.839> that<00:00:51.839> she<00:00:52.440> does<00:00:52.589> in<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.769> regular

performance that she does in a regular
basis<00:00:53.460> she<00:00:53.789> maybe<00:00:53.940> she<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.359> go<00:00:54.570> into<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.839> little

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
basis she maybe she can go into a little

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.489 
basis she maybe she can go into a little
bit<00:00:55.079> more<00:00:55.230> detail<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.879> that<00:00:56.879> sir<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.199> course

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499

well I love doing the t-bar row and I
love<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.519> number<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:02.999> because<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.510> move<00:01:03.569> a

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
love it number one because I can move a

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.899 
love it number one because I can move a
lot<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.929> weight<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> second<00:01:05.430> reason<00:01:05.550> is

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
lot of weight and the second reason is

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.810 
lot of weight and the second reason is
that<00:01:05.970> I'm<00:01:06.870> able<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.440> stand<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.280> little<00:01:08.520> bit<00:01:08.640> more

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
that I'm able to stand a little bit more

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.210 
that I'm able to stand a little bit more
upright<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.870> my<00:01:09.990> body<00:01:10.170> my<00:01:10.740> upper<00:01:11.040> body

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
upright so I have my body my upper body

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.070 
upright so I have my body my upper body
at<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> 45<00:01:12.000> degree<00:01:12.030> angle<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.780> I'm<00:01:12.930> hitting

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
at a 45 degree angle and I'm hitting

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.040 
at a 45 degree angle and I'm hitting
more<00:01:13.350> upper<00:01:13.740> back<00:01:13.980> which<00:01:14.700> creates<00:01:15.270> width<00:01:15.720> and

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
more upper back which creates width and

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.140 
more upper back which creates width and
a<00:01:16.650> little<00:01:16.920> bit<00:01:17.010> more<00:01:17.160> of<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.280> lat<00:01:17.460> spread<00:01:17.850> which

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
a little bit more of a lat spread which

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.270 
a little bit more of a lat spread which
makes<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.510> waist<00:01:18.690> look<00:01:18.930> smaller<00:01:19.280> obviously

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
makes the waist look smaller obviously

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.980 
makes the waist look smaller obviously
you're<00:01:20.640> stronger<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.270> look<00:01:21.450> aesthetically

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
you're stronger you look aesthetically

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.070 
you're stronger you look aesthetically
better<00:01:22.790> it's<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.850> win-win<00:01:24.450> situation

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
better it's a win-win situation

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.050 
better it's a win-win situation
yeah<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.710> lot<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:26.340> are<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.580> lot<00:01:26.730> of<00:01:26.760> gyms

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
that maybe don't have the anchoring

very simple closed grip attachment
that's<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.880> pretty<00:01:51.120> easy<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:51.900> to

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.530 
pulling evenly with both sides it's
really<00:02:31.180> important<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.660> do<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:33.330> do<00:02:34.330> these

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
really important to do this do these

properly you'll notice Aaron has
obviously<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.970> very<00:02:37.390> strong<00:02:37.870> foundation<00:02:38.290> she's

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
obviously a very strong foundation she's

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.360 
obviously a very strong foundation she's
rooting<00:02:39.430> her<00:02:39.790> legs<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.630> floor<00:02:41.370> she's

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
rooting her legs to the floor she's

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.490 
rooting her legs to the floor she's
firing<00:02:42.790> all<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.120> muscles<00:02:43.600> in<00:02:43.930> her<00:02:44.050> posterior

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
firing all the muscles in her posterior

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.460 
firing all the muscles in her posterior
chain<00:02:45.040> or<00:02:45.400> hamstrings<00:02:46.000> or<00:02:46.240> quads<00:02:46.660> even<00:02:47.170> Andrew

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
chain or hamstrings or quads even Andrew

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.699 
chain or hamstrings or quads even Andrew
ludes<00:02:47.910> erectors<00:02:48.940> all<00:02:49.660> those<00:02:50.080> muscles<00:02:50.590> are

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
ludes erectors all those muscles are

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.980 
ludes erectors all those muscles are
stabilizing<00:02:51.280> her<00:02:51.640> in<00:02:51.790> that<00:02:51.910> position<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:52.660> she

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
stabilizing her in that position so she

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.870 
stabilizing her in that position so she
can<00:02:53.290> really<00:02:53.740> focus<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.190> concentrate<00:02:54.730> on

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
can really focus and concentrate on

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.990 
can really focus and concentrate on
hitting<00:02:55.450> those<00:02:55.720> lats<00:02:56.050> and<00:02:56.380> working<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.610> mid

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
hitting those lats and working the mid

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.190 
hitting those lats and working the mid
upper<00:02:58.360> back<00:02:58.720> area

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
upper back area

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.010 
upper back area
yeah<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.860> stabilization<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.970> just<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:01.990> think

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
yeah the stabilization is just I think

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.680 
yeah the stabilization is just I think
an<00:03:02.320> added<00:03:02.680> bonus<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.070> this<00:03:03.310> exercise<00:03:03.670> but<00:03:04.360> it

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
an added bonus to this exercise but it

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.220 
an added bonus to this exercise but it
should<00:03:05.080> come<00:03:05.110> as<00:03:05.410> second<00:03:05.830> nature<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:07.230> really

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
should come as second nature and really

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.440 
should come as second nature and really
I<00:03:08.380> just<00:03:08.530> think<00:03:08.890> about<00:03:09.070> pulling<00:03:09.459> all<00:03:09.940> of<00:03:10.000> the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
I just think about pulling all of the

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.650 
I just think about pulling all of the
weight<00:03:10.630> with<00:03:11.140> my<00:03:11.380> lap<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:12.010> focusing<00:03:12.850> on<00:03:13.120> the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
weight with my lap and focusing on the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.750 
weight with my lap and focusing on the
exact<00:03:13.959> point<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:14.500> my<00:03:14.860> back<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.400> want<00:03:15.670> to

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
exact point in my back that I want to

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.020 
exact point in my back that I want to
work<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:17.140> find<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.680> has<00:03:18.040> helped<00:03:18.370> shape<00:03:18.580> my
