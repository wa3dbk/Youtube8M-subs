00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
clumping bamboos then you have the mana

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.430 
clumping bamboos then you have the mana
podía<00:00:55.309> or<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.609> running<00:00:56.089> bamboos<00:00:56.570> let's<00:00:57.289> have

better yeah come over here no not there
down<00:01:02.239> here<00:01:02.629> it's<00:01:03.140> only<00:01:03.320> when<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:03.620> get<00:01:03.739> down

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
down here it's only when you get down

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.530 
down here it's only when you get down
and<00:01:04.070> have<00:01:04.160> a<00:01:04.220> close<00:01:04.520> look<00:01:04.850> at<00:01:05.090> the<00:01:05.239> actual

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
and have a close look at the actual

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.870 
and have a close look at the actual
crown<00:01:06.140> of<00:01:06.410> a<00:01:06.470> clumping<00:01:06.860> bamboos<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:07.730> get

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
crown of a clumping bamboos that you get

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.880 
crown of a clumping bamboos that you get
a<00:01:07.910> really<00:01:08.180> good<00:01:08.390> idea<00:01:08.570> of<00:01:08.930> its<00:01:09.110> structure<00:01:09.560> it's

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
a really good idea of its structure it's

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.040 
a really good idea of its structure it's
distinctly<00:01:10.370> radial<00:01:11.000> in<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:11.270> way<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:11.450> see<00:01:11.810> all

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
distinctly radial in the way you see all

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.750 
distinctly radial in the way you see all
of<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.350> shoots<00:01:12.590> coming<00:01:12.890> out<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:13.370> here<00:01:13.520> is<00:01:13.640> all

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
of the shoots coming out so here is all

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.790 
of the shoots coming out so here is all
our<00:01:13.910> old<00:01:14.120> shoots<00:01:14.510> and<00:01:14.780> then<00:01:15.140> here's<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:15.590> new

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
our old shoots and then here's the new

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.110 
our old shoots and then here's the new
ones<00:01:16.040> starting<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.550> come<00:01:16.700> up<00:01:16.850> nice<00:01:17.060> and

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
ones starting to come up nice and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.090 
ones starting to come up nice and
vigorous<00:01:17.720> but<00:01:18.110> look<00:01:18.260> how<00:01:18.410> close<00:01:18.650> they<00:01:18.920> are<00:01:18.950> to

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
vigorous but look how close they are to

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.710 
vigorous but look how close they are to
the<00:01:19.280> original<00:01:19.760> clump<00:01:20.150> some<00:01:20.420> of<00:01:20.510> them<00:01:20.600> are
