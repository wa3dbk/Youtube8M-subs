00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.620 
as time went on we just sort of started
figuring<00:02:25.160> things<00:02:25.490> up<00:02:25.730> for<00:02:25.910> ourselves<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.569> we

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
figuring things up for ourselves and we

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.880 
figuring things up for ourselves and we
had<00:02:26.810> these<00:02:26.959> little<00:02:27.140> things<00:02:27.380> we<00:02:27.500> called<00:02:27.680> Huck

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
had these little things we called Huck

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.260 
had these little things we called Huck
dolls<00:02:28.130> like<00:02:28.459> Jake<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.819> others<00:02:29.060> little

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
dolls like Jake the others little

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.120 
dolls like Jake the others little
spider-man<00:02:29.720> dude<00:02:30.140> needs<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.650> spin<00:02:30.980> them

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
spider-man dude needs to spin them

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.820 
spider-man dude needs to spin them
around<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:31.970> try<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.840> figure<00:02:33.110> out<00:02:33.230> if<00:02:33.590> if

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
around and and try to figure out if if

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.190 
around and and try to figure out if if
the<00:02:34.100> physics<00:02:34.610> of<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:34.850> rotation<00:02:35.600> worked<00:02:35.900> if<00:02:36.110> you

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
the physics of a rotation worked if you

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.660 
the physics of a rotation worked if you
could<00:02:36.350> actually<00:02:36.470> get<00:02:36.800> back<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.190> your<00:02:37.310> feet<00:02:37.520> and

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
could actually get back to your feet and

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.949 
could actually get back to your feet and
that's<00:02:37.760> how<00:02:37.940> we<00:02:38.000> that's<00:02:38.420> how<00:02:38.540> we<00:02:38.720> really

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
that's how we that's how we really

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.240 
that's how we that's how we really
figured<00:02:39.140> out<00:02:39.319> a<00:02:39.380> lot<00:02:39.590> of<00:02:39.709> this<00:02:39.800> stuff<00:02:39.980> along

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
figured out a lot of this stuff along

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.690 
figured out a lot of this stuff along
the<00:02:40.400> way

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.509 

it<00:02:45.700> was<00:02:45.819> an<00:02:45.939> exciting<00:02:46.420> time<00:02:46.450> because<00:02:47.519> nobody

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
it was an exciting time because nobody

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.970 
it was an exciting time because nobody
at<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:48.879> point<00:02:49.209> had<00:02:49.420> really<00:02:49.989> dabbled<00:02:50.709> in<00:02:50.860> the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
at that point had really dabbled in the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.280 
at that point had really dabbled in the
whole<00:02:51.159> switchback<00:02:51.879> word<00:02:52.150> skiing<00:02:52.659> thing<00:02:52.870> and

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
whole switchback word skiing thing and

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.589 
whole switchback word skiing thing and
Vinnie<00:02:53.950> Dorian<00:02:54.400> was<00:02:54.549> really<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.150> guy<00:02:55.269> pushing

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
Vinnie Dorian was really the guy pushing

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.509 
Vinnie Dorian was really the guy pushing
that<00:02:55.840> end<00:02:56.049> of<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:56.260> for<00:02:56.470> us<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.920> hadn't<00:02:57.430> seen

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
that end of it for us and hadn't seen

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:28.220 
that end of it for us and hadn't seen
anybody<00:02:57.760> take<00:02:58.269> Hoffman<00:02:58.840> backwards<00:02:59.319> like<00:02:59.500> that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.220 

once<00:03:28.830> we<00:03:29.099> got<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.580> ball<00:03:29.760> rolling<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.540> it

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
once we got the ball rolling it it

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.050 
once we got the ball rolling it it
really<00:03:31.620> started<00:03:31.920> taking<00:03:32.069> off<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.640> mean<00:03:32.970> I

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
really started taking off I mean I

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.850 
really started taking off I mean I
remember<00:03:33.420> seeing<00:03:33.780> guys<00:03:34.080> you<00:03:34.739> know<00:03:34.830> like

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
remember seeing guys you know like

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.770 
remember seeing guys you know like
Tanner<00:03:35.280> Hall<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.730> CR<00:03:35.970> Johnson<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.720> they'd

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
Tanner Hall and CR Johnson and they'd

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.150 
Tanner Hall and CR Johnson and they'd
come<00:03:37.050> out<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:37.230> do<00:03:37.410> things<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:37.830> didn't

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
come out and do things that I didn't

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.850 
come out and do things that I didn't
think<00:03:38.310> possible<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:39.209> actually<00:03:39.989> stopped<00:03:40.470> saying

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
think possible I actually stopped saying

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.500 
think possible I actually stopped saying
that<00:03:41.129> things<00:03:41.310> were<00:03:41.550> impossible<00:03:41.819> a<00:03:42.150> few<00:03:42.330> years

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
that things were impossible a few years

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.670 
that things were impossible a few years
ago<00:03:42.690> because<00:03:42.870> I've<00:03:43.080> seen<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.410> impossible

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
ago because I've seen the impossible

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.650 
ago because I've seen the impossible
done<00:03:44.420> repeatedly<00:03:45.420> in<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.080> last<00:03:46.260> decade
