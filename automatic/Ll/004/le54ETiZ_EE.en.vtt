guest on the event coming into the top
with<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.790> heat<00:00:59.970> same<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> vents<00:01:01.470> going

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
with the heat same with the vents going

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.200 
with the heat same with the vents going
out<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:02.160> bottom<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:02.700> about<00:01:02.910> three

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
out on the bottom there about three

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.149 
out on the bottom there about three
inches<00:01:03.510> wide<00:01:03.570> we've<00:01:04.500> got<00:01:04.650> about<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.890> two<00:01:05.129> inch

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
inches wide we've got about a two inch

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
or three inch square exhaust hole in the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.010 
or three inch square exhaust hole in the
bottom<00:01:11.210> we<00:01:12.210> found<00:01:12.509> that<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:12.780> were<00:01:12.810> getting

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
bottom we found that we were getting

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.959 
bottom we found that we were getting
more<00:01:13.320> heat<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.679> at<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> top<00:01:14.100> than<00:01:14.429> we<00:01:14.549> wanted

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969 
more heat up at the top than we wanted

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.789 
more heat up at the top than we wanted
and<00:01:16.759> about<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.840> thirty<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.140> fifty<00:01:19.320> degree

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
and about a thirty to fifty degree

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.200 
and about a thirty to fifty degree
difference<00:01:20.159> between<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.700> top<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.149> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
difference between the top and the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.359 
difference between the top and the
bottom<00:01:21.359> on<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.810> heat<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.859> went<00:01:23.039> in<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.310> we

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
bottom on the heat so we went in and we

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.190 
bottom on the heat so we went in and we
cut<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.579> few<00:01:23.850> extra<00:01:24.210> holes<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.780> come<00:01:24.990> in

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
cut a few extra holes if you come in

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.779 
cut a few extra holes if you come in
we'll<00:01:25.679> take<00:01:25.829> a<00:01:25.859> look<00:01:26.130> at<00:01:26.249> what<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.490> did<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
we'll take a look at what we did at the

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:27.649 
we'll take a look at what we did at the
top<00:01:27.119> here

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
top here

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.459 
top here
I<00:01:27.979> got<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> drop<00:01:29.280> light<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.819> we<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.030> see<00:01:30.469> we

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
I got a drop light so we can see we

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.109 
I got a drop light so we can see we
narrowed<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> gap<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.429> here<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.789> had<00:01:32.969> it

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
narrowed the gap up here we had it

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.080 
narrowed the gap up here we had it
bigger<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.960> actually<00:01:34.469> put<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> plate<00:01:35.789> there

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
bigger and we actually put a plate there

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.469 
bigger and we actually put a plate there
to<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.979> sort<00:01:38.219> of<00:01:38.280> narrow<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.819> gap<00:01:38.999> up<00:01:39.270> at<00:01:39.389> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
to to sort of narrow the gap up at the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.510 
to to sort of narrow the gap up at the
top<00:01:39.719> but<00:01:39.960> that's<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.439> hole<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.069> can<00:01:41.219> see

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
top if we go down to the bottom here

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.889 
top if we go down to the bottom here
we'll<00:01:55.649> see<00:01:55.859> that<00:01:56.039> on<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.369> side<00:01:56.630> we've<00:01:57.630> got

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
we'll see that on this side we've got

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.099 
we'll see that on this side we've got
the<00:01:58.590> exhaust<00:01:58.979> hole<00:01:59.340> on<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.240> one<00:02:00.450> side<00:02:00.780> there

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
the exhaust hole on the one side there

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.620 
the exhaust hole on the one side there
that<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.789> we've<00:02:02.969> got<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.389> that's

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
that and that we've got one that's

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.209 
that and that we've got one that's
matching<00:02:03.929> on<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> other<00:02:04.499> side<00:02:04.770> what<00:02:05.039> we've

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
matching on the other side what we've

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.260 
matching on the other side what we've
done<00:02:05.429> to<00:02:06.209> add<00:02:06.359> a<00:02:06.389> little<00:02:06.749> more<00:02:07.039> heat<00:02:08.270> coming

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
done to add a little more heat coming

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.300 
done to add a little more heat coming
into<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.690> bottom<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.410> we've<00:02:10.740> added<00:02:11.009> these

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
into the bottom is we've added these

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.039 
into the bottom is we've added these
three<00:02:12.739> gaps<00:02:13.739> in<00:02:14.099> here<00:02:14.400> coming<00:02:14.819> up<00:02:14.879> our<00:02:15.090> flue<00:02:15.390> to

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
three gaps in here coming up our flue to

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.270 
three gaps in here coming up our flue to
draw<00:02:16.290> heat<00:02:16.620> into<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:16.980> main<00:02:17.220> chamber

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
draw heat into the main chamber

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.550 
draw heat into the main chamber
can<00:02:18.400> see<00:02:18.550> we've<00:02:18.700> got<00:02:18.880> our<00:02:19.030> other<00:02:19.270> vent<00:02:20.230> hole

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
can see we've got our other vent hole

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.010 
can see we've got our other vent hole
over<00:02:20.920> here<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.520> right<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.540> it's<00:02:22.750> about

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
over here to the right and it's about

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.140 
over here to the right and it's about
three<00:02:23.590> inches<00:02:23.890> wide<00:02:23.950> by<00:02:24.490> about<00:02:24.550> two<00:02:24.940> or<00:02:25.090> three

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
three inches wide by about two or three

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.140 
three inches wide by about two or three
inches<00:02:25.390> tall<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.430> what<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.459> would<00:02:27.700> change<00:02:27.970> about

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
inches tall so what I would change about

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.809 
inches tall so what I would change about
that<00:02:28.569> next<00:02:28.900> time<00:02:29.050> is<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:31.270> would<00:02:31.620> actually

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
that next time is that I would actually

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.340 
that next time is that I would actually
next<00:02:33.819> time<00:02:34.000> we<00:02:34.240> would<00:02:34.360> probably<00:02:34.600> engineer

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
next time we would probably engineer

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.650 
next time we would probably engineer
that<00:02:35.500> better<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.069> we<00:02:36.580> would<00:02:36.730> take<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.209> make

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
that better and we would take and make

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.110 
that better and we would take and make
bigger<00:02:37.989> holes<00:02:38.350> in<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.739> bottom<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.610> draw<00:02:39.819> more

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
bigger holes in the bottom to draw more

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.390 
bigger holes in the bottom to draw more
heat<00:02:40.420> off<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.870> top<00:02:41.110> coming<00:02:41.860> down<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.310> the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
heat off the top coming down to the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.699 
heat off the top coming down to the
bottom<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.850> unit<00:02:43.080> we've<00:02:44.080> cooked<00:02:44.290> on<00:02:44.500> this

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
bottom of the unit we've cooked on this

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.490 
bottom of the unit we've cooked on this
several<00:02:44.980> times<00:02:45.400> it's<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.510> great<00:02:46.720> cooker<00:02:47.170> but<00:02:47.380> we

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
several times it's a great cooker but we

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.840 
several times it's a great cooker but we
do<00:02:47.680> have<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:48.069> temperature<00:02:48.550> degree

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
do have that temperature degree

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.100 
do have that temperature degree
difference<00:02:49.270> one<00:02:49.510> of<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.660> things<00:02:49.900> that's

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
difference one of the things that's

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.900 
difference one of the things that's

different about this cooker and a
backwoods<00:02:52.390> smoker<00:02:52.840> is<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.709> we've<00:02:54.130> brought

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
backwoods smoker is that we've brought

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.580 
backwoods smoker is that we've brought
all<00:02:54.459> our<00:02:54.790> heat<00:02:55.030> up<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.330> top<00:02:55.570> and<00:02:55.959> dumped<00:02:56.500> it

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
all our heat up the top and dumped it

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.979 
all our heat up the top and dumped it
out<00:02:56.680> on<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:56.950> top<00:02:57.190> nothing<00:02:58.060> coming<00:02:58.570> from<00:02:58.690> the

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
out on the top nothing coming from the

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.860 
out on the top nothing coming from the
smoke<00:02:59.260> box<00:02:59.530> up<00:03:00.310> through<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.790> bottom<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.690> way

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
smoke box up through the bottom the way

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.440 
smoke box up through the bottom the way
that<00:03:02.050> a<00:03:02.080> backwoods<00:03:02.530> works<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.850> that<00:03:04.269> they've

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
that a backwoods works is that they've

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.080 
that a backwoods works is that they've
got<00:03:04.769> above<00:03:05.769> their<00:03:05.980> smoke<00:03:06.280> box<00:03:06.550> on<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.910> bottom

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
got above their smoke box on the bottom

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.199 
got above their smoke box on the bottom
they've<00:03:07.930> actually<00:03:08.230> got<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.950> gap<00:03:09.640> there<00:03:10.000> and

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
they've actually got a gap there and

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.930 
they've actually got a gap there and
they've<00:03:10.870> got<00:03:11.050> a<00:03:11.080> water<00:03:11.410> pan<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.610> direct

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
they've got a water pan so the direct

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.229 
they've got a water pan so the direct
heat<00:03:13.209> is<00:03:13.360> coming<00:03:13.720> up<00:03:13.930> hitting<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.470> water<00:03:14.739> pan

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
heat is coming up hitting the water pan

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.059 
heat is coming up hitting the water pan
steam<00:03:16.239> in<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:16.600> water<00:03:16.870> filling<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.769> smoker

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
steam in that water filling the smoker

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.220 
steam in that water filling the smoker
it's<00:03:18.580> also<00:03:18.790> coming<00:03:19.239> up<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.510> back<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:19.959> dump<00:03:20.080> it

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
it's also coming up the back and dump it

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.900 
it's also coming up the back and dump it
in<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.410> top<00:03:20.620> so<00:03:21.130> they're<00:03:21.280> getting<00:03:21.400> heat<00:03:21.700> from

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
in the top so they're getting heat from

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.630 
in the top so they're getting heat from
the<00:03:22.060> bottom<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:22.690> from<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.350> top<00:03:23.590> we're<00:03:24.400> just

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
the bottom and from the top we're just

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.449 
the bottom and from the top we're just
dumping<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:25.180> in<00:03:25.390> at<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.079> top<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.560> unit<00:03:26.890> so

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
dumping it in at the top of the unit so

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.890 
dumping it in at the top of the unit so
that's<00:03:27.640> something<00:03:27.880> that<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.209> might<00:03:28.390> change<00:03:28.630> or

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
that's something that I might change or

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.050 
that's something that I might change or
might<00:03:29.049> do<00:03:29.230> different<00:03:29.709> next<00:03:29.890> time<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.880> other

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
might do different next time the other

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.490 
might do different next time the other
biggest<00:03:31.450> problem<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.959> have<00:03:32.170> with<00:03:32.380> this

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
biggest problem that I have with this

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.920 
biggest problem that I have with this
smoker<00:03:32.829> is<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.730> drain<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.299> in<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.540> back<00:03:34.720> of

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
smoker is the drain is in the back of

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.680 
smoker is the drain is in the back of
the<00:03:34.989> smoker<00:03:35.350> and<00:03:36.190> it's<00:03:36.640> right<00:03:37.000> above<00:03:37.390> the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
the smoker and it's right above the

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.289 
the smoker and it's right above the
firebox<00:03:38.230> in<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.560> heat<00:03:38.739> source<00:03:38.980> so<00:03:39.910> although

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
firebox in the heat source so although

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:46.470 
firebox in the heat source so although
it<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:40.959> a<00:03:41.320> two-inch<00:03:44.640> gallon<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.760> contents

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
it is a two-inch gallon the contents

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
right now because I just cleaned it out

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.630

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
the bottom we're not getting good

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.720 
the bottom we're not getting good
drainage<00:03:56.350> we're<00:03:57.070> probably<00:03:57.220> gonna<00:03:57.430> have<00:03:57.519> to

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
drainage we're probably gonna have to

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.460 
drainage we're probably gonna have to
change<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.180> drain<00:03:58.450> put<00:03:58.750> one<00:03:58.900> on<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.170> side<00:03:59.440> of

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
change the drain put one on the side of

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.470 
change the drain put one on the side of
the<00:03:59.739> unit<00:04:00.100> and<00:04:00.340> have<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.230> directly<00:04:03.120> drain<00:04:04.120> out

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
the unit and have it directly drain out

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.410 
the unit and have it directly drain out
the<00:04:04.720> side<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.260> stead<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.590> down<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.420> dogleg

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
the side and stead of down and dogleg

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.539 
the side and stead of down and dogleg
and<00:04:07.630> over<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.200> then<00:04:08.350> down<00:04:08.650> because<00:04:09.430> that's

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
and over and then down because that's

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:10.949 
and over and then down because that's
just<00:04:09.820> clogging<00:04:10.120> up<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.540> it's<00:04:10.630> just<00:04:10.840> not

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
just clogging up and it's just not

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.060 
just clogging up and it's just not
