00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello how are you all and welcome 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.570
 again to another revision more and in this 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.640
 chance let's see the review of these 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.470
 new stand display tenth anniversary 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.280
 ok let's start then the 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:22.550
 review by the box we have the version 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.980
 jp gilded with black and presents us here 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.619
 well, more or less an example how 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.520
 they would see our figures mounted on 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.520
 these bases 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.370
 we see here the designs he has in both 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.239
 sides 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.540
 both Gemini and Pegasus 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.480
 both and ex 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.910
 on the back of the box we can also 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.470
 find the basis what would come to be 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:57.950
 the basis for mounting these figures and more 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.920
 or less gives us a fashion style 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.000
 how we want to put 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.000
 our figures 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.290
 and in here we can see the content and 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.450
 also shows us here what would come to 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.450
 be the manual make up these bases 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.540
 well here we have then the first 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.360
 part composed of numerous pieces 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.750
 small that we're going to put together 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.229
 guiding us from the manual this the first 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.229
 part 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.730
 then we can see large pieces 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.990
 where they will be attached to the pieces 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.159
 small that we just saw 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.159
 and on the reverse 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.320
 we have been 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.320
 part 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.530
 where we can see small columns and 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.869
 we can also see the parantes with the 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.300
 hooks that will help us give you 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.110
 better stability to our figures 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.110
 micro 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.900
 well here I already have the base mounted 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.870
 As it is in the manual, this is a 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.370
 basic way of doing it since 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.500
 depending on the imagination they have 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.010
 They can put them in different 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.080
 forms depending on the pose not that 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.080
 want to put the figure 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.560
 we see this main base that is shown 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.560
 in the box 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.489
 we can see here that it is not totally 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.489
 next to this part if not separate 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.489
 equally 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.660
 on both sides and also on this basis 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.660
 small that we see here below 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.480
 separated our together 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.370
 the same 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.020
 well and here I already have the base mounted 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:41.080
 as it is in the presentation of the box 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:45.010
 and it really looks good it looks 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:49.980
 pretty good the base the only bad thing is 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.980
 the reduced space that you have 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:58.260
 this does not allow the figures to give them a 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:01.740
 better poses because then all 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:04.650
 the figures of r of divine armor of 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.290
 the bronzes have wings and this of some 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:11.200
 way then prevents with this space 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:14.860
 reduced give it a greater this 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.280
 and a greater variety of poses to the 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.760
 figures 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:23.690
 but taking this out on looks good with your 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:26.360
 states and well I hope then that you 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.400
 have liked the review and good since 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.220
 We will be commenting more with respect to 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:35.000
 the following figures that will come out 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:39.080
 if I 'm not mistaken, they are from their tenth 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.160
 anniversary and essence and omega and den 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.160
 Orion 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.039
 thank you very much
