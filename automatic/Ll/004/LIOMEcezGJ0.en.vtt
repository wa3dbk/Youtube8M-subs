with<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.390> possum<00:02:29.750> tool<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.410> once<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.960> okay

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
with the possum tool so once that okay

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.720 
with the possum tool so once that okay
I'm<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.320> interim<00:02:33.650> general<00:02:33.770> remembering<00:02:34.580> if

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
I'm the interim general remembering if

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.360 
I'm the interim general remembering if
they<00:02:34.850> were<00:02:34.910> polishing<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.900> on<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.410> anything

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
they were polishing and on it anything

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.810 
they were polishing and on it anything
also<00:02:37.730> just<00:02:38.000> for<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.570> scratches<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.820> possibly

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
also just for the scratches and possibly

00:02:40.820 --> 00:03:01.540 
also just for the scratches and possibly
beyond<00:02:41.180> repair<00:02:41.570> so<00:02:41.630> they

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.070 

so<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.880> hit<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.060> with<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.330> dremel<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:03.930> see

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
so I hit it with the dremel you can see

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.500 
so I hit it with the dremel you can see
the<00:03:04.200> part<00:03:04.440> where<00:03:04.650> there's<00:03:04.920> no<00:03:05.210> hard<00:03:06.210> getting

the part where there's no hard getting

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.500 
the part where there's no hard getting
wax<00:03:06.720> left<00:03:06.990> on<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.290> look<00:03:07.500> right<00:03:08.220> here<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:09.330> is
