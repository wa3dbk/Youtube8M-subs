00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the stairs go down so that's that's the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.480 
the stairs go down so that's that's the
way<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.170> farm<00:01:10.409> that's<00:01:10.650> another<00:01:10.979> farm<00:01:11.340> in

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490

way to the farm that's another farm in
here<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:11.760> well<00:01:11.970> I've<00:01:12.600> been<00:01:12.780> little<00:01:12.990> bit<00:01:13.170> in

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
here as well I've been little bit in

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.320 
here as well I've been little bit in
there<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.710> wasn't<00:01:13.950> too<00:01:14.220> far<00:01:14.250> away<00:01:14.820> from<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
there it wasn't too far away from the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:25.070 
there it wasn't too far away from the
farm<00:01:21.890> so<00:01:22.890> basically<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:24.390> easiest<00:01:24.750> way<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
farm so basically the easiest way to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.649 
farm so basically the easiest way to
find<00:01:25.470> another<00:01:25.860> work<00:01:26.159> form<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.670> by<00:01:27.119> finding<00:01:27.600> a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
find another work form is by finding a

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.770 
find another work form is by finding a
massive<00:01:28.310> fortress<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.549> that's<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.390> that

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
massive fortress and that's that that

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.810 
massive fortress and that's that that
should<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:34.380> was<00:01:34.560> very<00:01:34.619> very<00:01:35.040> very<00:01:35.460> hard

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
should be it it was very very very hard
