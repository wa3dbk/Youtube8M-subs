00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
the back of the screen color fall away

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.470 
the back of the screen color fall away
so<00:02:46.930> it's<00:02:47.140> nice<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.650> lay<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.400> laptop<00:02:48.790> flat<00:02:49.240> like

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
so it's nice to lay the laptop flat like

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
see there's four screws down this side

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.960 
see there's four screws down this side
and<00:03:05.530> four<00:03:06.310> screws

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
and four screws

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.360 
and four screws
similar<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.660> other<00:03:07.780> side<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:08.370> they

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
similar to the other side and they

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.630 
similar to the other side and they
connector<00:03:10.980> they<00:03:11.980> actually<00:03:12.220> touch<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.550> the

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
connector they actually touch it to the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.280 
connector they actually touch it to the
laptop<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:13.060> at<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.390> back<00:03:13.600> there's<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.260> little

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
piece of tape so you can just carefully

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:33.160 
piece of tape so you can just carefully
remove<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.220> tape<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:19.650> here<00:03:24.450> now<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.510> top

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.990 

a<00:03:34.599> little<00:03:35.599> bit<00:03:35.690> tight<00:03:36.340> that<00:03:37.340> slowly<00:03:37.700> comes

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
a little bit tight that slowly comes

and you'll see that as you do that the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.870 
and you'll see that as you do that the
connector<00:03:53.360> kind<00:03:53.570> of<00:03:53.630> just<00:03:54.280> comes<00:03:55.280> away<00:03:55.460> as

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
connector kind of just comes away as

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.790 
connector kind of just comes away as
well

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
screen is free to go as soon as we move

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.590 
screen is free to go as soon as we move
these<00:04:05.840> screws<00:04:06.140> on<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.500> side<00:04:07.330> I'll<00:04:08.330> just<00:04:08.480> do

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
these screws on the side I'll just do

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.700 
these screws on the side I'll just do
that<00:04:08.720> now<00:04:10.810> okay<00:04:11.810> I'm<00:04:11.870> just<00:04:12.050> gonna<00:04:12.140> remove<00:04:12.440> the

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.949 
that now okay I'm just gonna remove the
last<00:04:13.340> screw<00:04:16.239> you'll<00:04:17.239> notice<00:04:17.480> this<00:04:17.600> was<00:04:17.930> a

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
last screw you'll notice this was a

last screw you'll notice this was a
slightly<00:04:18.500> smaller<00:04:18.920> than<00:04:19.540> the<00:04:20.540> other<00:04:20.750> one<00:04:20.959> so

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
slightly smaller than the other one so

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.910 
slightly smaller than the other one so
keep<00:04:21.410> that<00:04:21.560> as<00:04:21.680> separate<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:24.020> now<00:04:24.230> this<00:04:24.350> Groot

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
keep that as separate and now this Groot

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.090 
keep that as separate and now this Groot
the<00:04:25.340> screen<00:04:25.610> is<00:04:25.760> frita<00:04:26.380> for<00:04:27.380> your<00:04:27.530> route<00:04:27.680> and

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
the screen is frita for your route and

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.060 
the screen is frita for your route and
so<00:04:28.970> put<00:04:29.150> that<00:04:29.180> one<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.450> one<00:04:29.480> side<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.290> now

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
so put that one to one side and now

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.860 
so put that one to one side and now
we'll<00:04:31.340> get<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:32.170> replacement<00:04:33.170> screen

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
we'll get the replacement screen

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.800 
we'll get the replacement screen
basically<00:04:35.870> reverse<00:04:36.170> the<00:04:36.320> procedure<00:04:36.680> and<00:04:37.810> make

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
basically reverse the procedure and make

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.970 
basically reverse the procedure and make
sure<00:04:38.960> you've<00:04:39.080> got<00:04:39.200> the<00:04:39.290> connector<00:04:39.710> in<00:04:39.890> the

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
sure you've got the connector in the

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.690 
sure you've got the connector in the
right<00:04:40.100> place<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:41.150> now<00:04:42.100> screw<00:04:43.100> that<00:04:43.280> back<00:04:43.490> in
