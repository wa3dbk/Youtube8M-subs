00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.700 

anyway<00:00:33.600> I've<00:00:33.809> known<00:00:33.960> about<00:00:34.109> this<00:00:34.260> one<00:00:34.469> for<00:00:34.680> a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
anyway I've known about this one for a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.189 
anyway I've known about this one for a
while<00:00:34.920> now<00:00:34.949> actually<00:00:35.699> I<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:36.199> clearly

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
while now actually I just clearly

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:38.540 
while now actually I just clearly
haven't<00:00:37.559> had<00:00:37.680> time<00:00:37.949> to<00:00:38.129> really<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.519> anything

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
haven't had time to really do anything

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.729 
haven't had time to really do anything
about<00:00:39.089> it<00:00:39.980> I<00:00:41.989> probably<00:00:42.989> won't<00:00:43.199> get<00:00:43.409> a<00:00:43.469> very

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
about it I probably won't get a very

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.200 
about it I probably won't get a very
good<00:00:44.039> time<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.909> it<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.089> it's<00:00:45.210> definitely<00:00:45.539> a

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
good time on it but it's definitely a

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.950 
good time on it but it's definitely a
very<00:00:48.210> credible<00:00:48.780> strategy<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> use<00:00:53.629> whoops<00:00:54.629> I

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
very credible strategy to use whoops I

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:14.350 
very credible strategy to use whoops I
wasn't<00:00:55.500> supposed<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.920> do<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.489> try<00:00:56.729> again

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.520 

there<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.509> go<00:01:15.690> that's<00:01:16.020> what<00:01:16.170> you're<00:01:16.350> supposed

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
to do don't worry so anyway that was

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.740 
to do don't worry so anyway that was
really<00:01:40.530> slow<00:01:41.450> one-year<00:01:42.450> lease<00:01:42.750> their<00:01:43.369> three

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750
