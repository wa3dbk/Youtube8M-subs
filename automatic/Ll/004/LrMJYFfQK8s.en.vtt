00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.950
 I'm going to show you 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.479
 with your exercise to see the home this 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.800
 it is an exercise for the staff 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:12.160
 pretty advanced 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.010
 so suppose you saw the other videos 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.950
 of how to use loose peripheral vision 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.529
 I recommend that you come back and watch my videos 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.470
 that are will be on the list of 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.599
 reproduction and preaching this 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.640
 exercise because if one knows how 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.640
 focus tourists peripherally 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.399
 in white 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.170
 in the second finger 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.649
 in the test on the second good finger 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.649
 Well together 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.680
 yes 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.760
 and good what are you going to do 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.479
 it will be 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.860
 focus your gaze on the point but on the 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.830
 point 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.240
 Do not do an exercise like the others 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:17.120
 because you're going to put it down like this in 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.760
 the table and you will do them I will continue 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.800
 point 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.080
 but basically that the person 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.560
 national people who look at a thing 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.530
 it is fixedly 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.930
 and at 15 seconds or 20 30 days 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.030
 seconds and the sight is tired 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.950
 you can not have to leave it open 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.690
 relaxed you have to look at the point in the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.590
 view 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.590
 and then 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.050
 as a heat as an energy that comes out 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.470
 A) Yes 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.850
 so to the side of the glasses things 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.159
 clear energy that I'll do that's going to 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.110
 know the money 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.710
 then when you have more practices 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.700
 you're going to start seeing colors to start 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.700
 distinguish the milestones colors 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.650
 but what many people when they 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.140
 begin to see begin the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.819
 verifiers and that seems warm to 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.099
 that start as 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:24.299
 either when betania 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:26.969
 but once people enjoy 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.129
 what you do not have to keep doing 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.880
 because it's a process until the 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.590
 they inhabit 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.780
 so what he's going to do is put your 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.780
 hand is going to be a point 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:48.110
 in the second finger 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.110
 so and focus on this point 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.980
 What I would recommend also be if 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.680
 they discharge the energies 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.720
 rubbing the hands are transmitting 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.720
 all your energy program well 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:18.340
 to the bottom and start exercising what 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.340
 that you have to do much more exercise
