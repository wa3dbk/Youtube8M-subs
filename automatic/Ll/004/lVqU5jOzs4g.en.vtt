hard drive enclosure with a hard drive
inside<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.590> which<00:00:26.099> can<00:00:26.730> take<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.060> bit<00:00:27.240> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
inside it and which can take a bit of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.210 
inside it and which can take a bit of
knocking<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.840> bit<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.260> bashing<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.800> still

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
knocking a bit of bashing and still

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.730 
knocking a bit of bashing and still
carry<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.640> ticking<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.330> like<00:00:30.480> Timex<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.410> we

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
carry on ticking just like Timex so we

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.990 
carry on ticking just like Timex so we
learned<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.980> little<00:00:32.099> bit<00:00:32.189> further<00:00:32.460> into<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.820> one

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
learned a little bit further into it one

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.270

engineering considerations and
laboratory<00:00:49.500> tests<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.430> military

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
laboratory tests and this is military

so we're gonna have a quick look through
see<00:01:20.040> what<00:01:20.159> military<00:01:20.369> standard<00:01:20.939> 8<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.509> 10<00:01:21.659> if

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
see what military standard 8 to 10 if

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390 
see what military standard 8 to 10 if
actually<00:01:22.080> means<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> then<00:01:22.950> we'll<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.250> on

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
lost the page now it was in here

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.570 
lost the page now it was in here
somewhere<00:04:53.670> there<00:04:54.670> is<00:04:54.790> face<00:04:55.600> right<00:04:56.050> okay<00:04:56.320> yeah

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
somewhere there is face right okay yeah

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.620 
somewhere there is face right okay yeah
so<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.670> first<00:04:57.850> test<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.300> we're<00:04:58.390> going<00:04:58.510> to<00:04:58.570> be

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
so the first test that we're going to be

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.430 
so the first test that we're going to be
doing<00:04:58.810> with<00:04:59.470> the<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.950> data<00:05:00.310> SH<00:05:00.730> 93<00:05:01.300> is<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:02.110> drop

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
doing with the a data SH 93 is the drop

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.500 
doing with the a data SH 93 is the drop
test<00:05:02.680> where<00:05:03.190> according<00:05:03.460> to<00:05:03.640> this<00:05:03.850> means<00:05:04.420> that

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
test where according to this means that

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.230 
test where according to this means that
we<00:05:04.660> drop<00:05:04.930> it<00:05:05.050> from<00:05:05.200> a<00:05:05.470> height<00:05:05.680> of<00:05:05.920> between<00:05:06.250> 24

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
we drop it from a height of between 24

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.659 
we drop it from a height of between 24
and<00:05:07.270> 48<00:05:08.050> inches<00:05:08.910> as<00:05:09.910> shown<00:05:10.270> on<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:14.080> see

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
and 48 inches as shown on you see

basically<00:05:32.980> what<00:05:33.310> we're<00:05:33.430> going<00:05:33.520> to<00:05:33.640> do<00:05:33.760> is

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
basically what we're going to do is

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.909 
basically what we're going to do is
we're<00:05:34.120> going<00:05:34.270> to<00:05:34.450> simulate<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:35.169> vibration

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
we're going to simulate the vibration

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.460 
we're going to simulate the vibration
excited<00:05:36.430> a<00:05:36.460> drive<00:05:36.669> signal<00:05:36.940> to<00:05:37.900> get<00:05:38.050> a<00:05:38.080> typical

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
excited a drive signal to get a typical

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.110 
excited a drive signal to get a typical
test<00:05:38.650> item<00:05:38.979> response<00:05:39.160> as<00:05:39.490> you<00:05:39.580> can<00:05:39.729> see<00:05:39.880> here

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
test item response as you can see here

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.969 
test item response as you can see here
and<00:05:40.930> this<00:05:41.110> is<00:05:41.260> going<00:05:41.350> to<00:05:41.440> be<00:05:41.530> from<00:05:41.680> a<00:05:41.800> range

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
and this is going to be from a range

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.370 
and this is going to be from a range
between<00:05:42.100> 24<00:05:42.970> and<00:05:43.000> 48<00:05:43.600> inches<00:05:44.020> so<00:05:44.140> that's<00:05:44.260> going

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
between 24 and 48 inches so that's going

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.280 
between 24 and 48 inches so that's going
to<00:05:44.440> be<00:05:44.500> prevent<00:05:44.860> their<00:05:45.010> to<00:05:45.460> up<00:05:45.610> there<00:05:45.820> and<00:05:46.600> then

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
to be prevent their to up there and then

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.440 
to be prevent their to up there and then
we're<00:05:47.380> going<00:05:47.470> to<00:05:47.530> move<00:05:47.680> on<00:05:47.830> to<00:05:48.120> salt<00:05:49.120> morphine

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
we're going to move on to salt morphine

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:56.159 
we're going to move on to salt morphine
