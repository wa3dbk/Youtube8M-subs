00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
nothing to do with the lead right now I

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.580 
nothing to do with the lead right now I
think<00:03:39.479> you<00:03:39.540> should<00:03:39.690> play<00:03:39.810> very<00:03:40.049> patient<00:03:40.440> game

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
think you should play very patient game

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.229 
think you should play very patient game
because<00:03:41.220> projectiles<00:03:41.699> are<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.940> one<00:03:42.060> thing

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
because projectiles are the one thing

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.710 
because projectiles are the one thing
that<00:03:42.269> law<00:03:42.510> has<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.870> work<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.379> fight<00:03:43.530> against<00:03:43.769> oh

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
that law has to work to fight against oh

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.960 
that law has to work to fight against oh
you<00:03:45.720> just<00:03:45.979> yeah<00:03:46.979> that's<00:03:47.190> what<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.340> just<00:03:47.849> don't

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
you just yeah that's what I just don't

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.339 
you just yeah that's what I just don't
think<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.150> snuggle<00:03:48.479> do<00:03:48.569> style<00:03:48.900> for<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.169> most

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
think I snuggle do style for the most

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.559 
think I snuggle do style for the most
part<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:50.220> keep<00:03:50.340> away<00:03:50.549> like<00:03:50.729> that<00:03:50.760> yeah<00:03:51.209> it's

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
part to keep away like that yeah it's

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.020 
part to keep away like that yeah it's
definitely<00:03:51.750> not<00:03:52.019> this<00:03:52.859> is<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.129> oh<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.849> got<00:03:53.970> to

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
definitely not this is so oh it's got to

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.420 
definitely not this is so oh it's got to
be<00:03:54.090> all<00:03:54.239> wah<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:55.290> was<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.470> good<00:03:55.739> jump<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.220> this

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.539 
be all wah that was a good jump and this
is<00:03:56.549> surprising<00:03:57.030> because<00:03:57.620> law<00:03:58.620> has<00:03:58.889> one<00:03:59.280> of<00:03:59.430> the

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
is surprising because law has one of the

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.069 
is surprising because law has one of the
best<00:03:59.819> anti<00:04:00.180> airs<00:04:00.329> in<00:04:00.419> this<00:04:00.510> whole<00:04:00.690> game<00:04:00.810> you
