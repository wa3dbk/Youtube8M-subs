00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
solid core and this is going to be a

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.519 
solid core and this is going to be a
little<00:00:03.240> bit<00:00:03.360> of<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.570> chilled-out<00:00:03.870> commentary

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
little bit of a chilled-out commentary

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.079 
little bit of a chilled-out commentary
as<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:05.009> recording<00:00:05.430> this<00:00:05.549> I<00:00:05.640> don't<00:00:05.700> actually

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
as a recording this I don't actually

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.059 
as a recording this I don't actually
even<00:00:06.210> have<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.720> background<00:00:07.049> video<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.770> put<00:00:07.950> on

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
even have a background video to put on

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.680 
even have a background video to put on
it<00:00:08.099> so<00:00:08.550> hopefully<00:00:08.760> i<00:00:08.940> will<00:00:09.030> find<00:00:09.300> something

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
it so hopefully i will find something

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.419 
it so hopefully i will find something
suitable<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.230> maybe<00:00:10.710> runescape<00:00:11.190> maybe

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
suitable and maybe runescape maybe

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.310 
suitable and maybe runescape maybe
ecology<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.300> guess<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.870> doesn't<00:00:13.049> really<00:00:13.080> matter

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
ecology I guess it doesn't really matter

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.570 
ecology I guess it doesn't really matter
because<00:00:13.559> it's<00:00:13.920> going<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.190> be<00:00:14.250> about<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
because it's going to be about the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.609 
because it's going to be about the
commentary<00:00:15.000> not<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.330> gameplay<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.929> was

going to be about social gaming and I've

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.630 
going to be about social gaming and I've
always<00:00:33.780> been<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.350> kind<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.649> player<00:00:34.920> that's

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
always been the kind of player that's

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.220 
always been the kind of player that's
gonna<00:00:35.820> kept<00:00:36.120> himself<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.780> I've<00:00:36.899> always<00:00:37.020> been

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
gonna kept himself like I've always been

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.319 
gonna kept himself like I've always been
a<00:00:37.290> bit<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.620> solo<00:00:37.920> player<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.460> I'm<00:00:39.180> not

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
a bit of a solo player and I'm not

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.660 
a bit of a solo player and I'm not
really<00:00:39.450> sure<00:00:39.540> why<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.260> think<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.250> mostly

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
really sure why I think it's mostly

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.479 
really sure why I think it's mostly
runescape<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.570> runescape<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.340> seems<00:00:44.340> to

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
runescape like runescape is a seems to

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.630 
runescape like runescape is a seems to
be<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> very<00:00:44.820> solo<00:00:45.480> game<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:47.309> most

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
be a very solo game and you can do most

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.160 
be a very solo game and you can do most
things<00:00:47.789> about<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.360> do<00:00:48.480> really<00:00:48.750> well<00:00:48.899> Andrew

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
things about you do really well Andrew

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.689 
things about you do really well Andrew
scape<00:00:49.469> by<00:00:49.680> yourself<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:51.270> most<00:00:51.780> cases<00:00:51.960> and

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
scape by yourself and in most cases and

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.610 
scape by yourself and in most cases and
having<00:00:53.699> friends<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.390> being<00:00:54.570> social<00:00:55.050> it's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
having friends are being social it's

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.049 
having friends are being social it's
actually<00:00:55.739> disadvantage<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.670> know<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:56.940> you

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
actually disadvantage you know if you

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.670 
actually disadvantage you know if you
would<00:00:57.270> cut<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.570> friends<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.109> trees<00:00:58.379> are

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
would cut with friends the trees are

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.049 
would cut with friends the trees are
going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> get<00:00:59.070> chopped<00:00:59.340> n<00:00:59.520> quicker<00:00:59.760> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
going to get chopped n quicker and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.959 
going to get chopped n quicker and
you're<00:01:00.359> gonna<00:01:00.449> lose<00:01:00.600> experience<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:02.280> think

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
you're gonna lose experience and I think

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.579 
you're gonna lose experience and I think
as<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.329> gone<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:04.049> more<00:01:04.229> recently

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
as it's gone on like more recently

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.410 
as it's gone on like more recently
there's<00:01:05.040> been<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.220> lot<00:01:05.400> more<00:01:05.430> mini<00:01:05.790> games<00:01:06.030> that

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
there's been a lot more mini games that

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.780 
there's been a lot more mini games that
have<00:01:06.570> been<00:01:06.720> faster<00:01:06.990> XP<00:01:07.380> doing<00:01:07.799> solo<00:01:08.010> skills<00:01:08.310> so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
have been faster XP doing solo skills so

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.670 
have been faster XP doing solo skills so
it's<00:01:08.909> actually<00:01:09.000> beneficial<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:10.260> social

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
it's actually beneficial to do social

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.679 
it's actually beneficial to do social
gaming<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.700> think<00:01:11.909> previously<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.600> an

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
gaming but I think previously in an

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.780 
gaming but I think previously in an
runescape<00:01:13.080> history<00:01:13.470> has<00:01:13.890> been<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.130> very<00:01:14.369> solo

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
runescape history has been a very solo

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.060 
runescape history has been a very solo
game<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.840> sort<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.080> confined<00:01:16.590> me<00:01:16.830> into

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
game and it sort of confined me into

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.539 
game and it sort of confined me into
keeping<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.610> very<00:01:18.150> solid<00:01:18.630> person<00:01:19.130> I'm<00:01:20.130> sure<00:01:20.400> if

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
keeping a very solid person I'm sure if

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.590 
keeping a very solid person I'm sure if
