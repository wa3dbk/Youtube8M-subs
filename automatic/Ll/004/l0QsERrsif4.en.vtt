00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 and with friends how are you greeted 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.940
 double to this time I bring you another 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.490
 video more now completely different 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.860
 they will ask themselves and what is it then? 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.349
 not in las vegas and I wanted to teach them 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.260
 a bit of the landscape to do it a little 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.250
 different the video I hope you like it 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.439
 there 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.180
 They collide as people and I think 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.490
 people look at each other is annoyed because 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.769
 We were recording but with my good way 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.019
 what I wanted to tell them and take advantage of 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.119
 this video was that an article has come out 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.000
 that caught my attention where 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.510
 says that buyers prefer 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.360
 more an ipad than a wink then to me 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.129
 opinion is that and well I would prefer more 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.329
 an ipad but I want to know what they think 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.320
 you so in the box 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.620
 comments 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.800
 tell me what would buy a willy or an ipad 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.079
 Of course I know that both are different 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.390
 one is a console the other is a 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.550
 tablet but I think the epa is 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.469
 surprised if you can see here 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.079
 in the image in the back it only has 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.120
 four buttons and the windows has 11 and 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.870
 it is already understandable what can be 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.080
 windows serves up as a control 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.230
 and they have more functions like console in 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.140
 change the epa is not the simplest but 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.880
 I think it's pretty good for me I do not 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.760
 would like nothing since it is much simpler 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.490
 to use and I really think that the games 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.340
 the games that we can get in the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.100
 that are the app store sorry I think it's 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.900
 quite pretty good since they are 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.270
 cheap but that the most expensive game 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.630
 It can cost up to 10 dollars and a game 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.910
 from wii I think he walks in 49 dollars 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.850
 so the truth to me is therefore 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.590
 they try more economically in this aspect and 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.720
 I've actually seen several 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.840
 videogames that are coming for ipad and 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.340
 the graphics are impressive to acquire 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.800
 As you can see he is showing you what 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.280
 what are the prices the bulli of 32 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.940
 measure the 350 cost the fourth act 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.490
 generation of 32 also costs 600 almost 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.130
 the double but if we start doing 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.440
 they planted in games I think that there 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.619
 can be saving the photo of 16 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.090
 400 so leave me your opinion 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.830
 then you liked this video if 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.980
 they want to see more of las vegas 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.020
 leave the likes and let's say like I follow 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.780
 uploading videos so see you in the 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.980
 next and you can already talk from the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.870
 vegas is the hotel is born of which the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.220
 that nothing to fall but less stress so 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.220
