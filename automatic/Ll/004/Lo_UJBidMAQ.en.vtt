there's<00:00:25.160> like<00:00:25.250> a<00:00:25.369> few<00:00:26.050> expanded<00:00:27.050> universe

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
there's like a few expanded universe

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.929 
there's like a few expanded universe
stuff<00:00:27.830> there<00:00:28.070> might<00:00:28.189> be<00:00:28.220> a<00:00:28.369> few<00:00:28.609> that's<00:00:28.759> a

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
stuff there might be a few that's a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.550 
stuff there might be a few that's a
little<00:00:29.330> newer<00:00:29.570> than<00:00:29.599> power<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.140> first<00:00:30.320> two

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
little newer than power the first two

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.950

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
should be all the old power the force to

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.270 
should be all the old power the force to
stuff<00:00:35.600> is<00:00:35.809> good<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:36.260> crack<00:00:36.500> these<00:00:36.649> open<00:00:36.860> and

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
every figure but just kind of go through

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.680 
every figure but just kind of go through
them<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:43.520> give<00:00:43.699> you<00:00:43.820> an<00:00:43.879> idea<00:00:44.030> all<00:00:44.390> right<00:00:44.510> so

said<00:00:46.940> some<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.239> these<00:00:47.480> might<00:00:48.050> be<00:00:48.289> newer<00:00:48.559> then

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
said some of these might be newer then

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.400 
said some of these might be newer then
power<00:00:49.609> the<00:00:49.879> forest<00:00:50.210> -<00:00:50.390> I<00:00:50.719> don't<00:00:50.960> remember<00:00:51.079> if

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
power the forest - I don't remember if

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.080 
power the forest - I don't remember if
this<00:00:51.530> was<00:00:51.770> still<00:00:51.920> power<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.340> force<00:00:52.579> to<00:00:52.789> take<00:00:53.030> a

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
this was still power the force to take a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.360 
this was still power the force to take a
look<00:00:53.359> at<00:00:53.510> her<00:00:53.600> compared<00:00:54.109> to<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:55.100> first

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
look at her compared to the the first

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.509 
look at her compared to the the first
version<00:00:56.000> me<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:57.079> that<00:00:57.379> was<00:00:57.590> one<00:00:57.859> ugly<00:00:58.280> layer

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
version me and that was one ugly layer

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.369 
version me and that was one ugly layer
right<00:00:58.879> here<00:00:58.940> again<00:00:59.390> there's<00:00:59.600> another<00:00:59.840> example

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
right here again there's another example

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.290 
right here again there's another example
of<00:01:00.500> an<00:01:00.679> improvement<00:01:01.070> I<00:01:01.489> don't<00:01:01.879> think<00:01:02.090> these

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
of an improvement I don't think these

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.509 
of an improvement I don't think these
two<00:01:02.359> were<00:01:02.780> that<00:01:03.320> far<00:01:03.620> apart<00:01:04.010> but<00:01:04.160> as<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:04.460> can

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
two were that far apart but as you can

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.280 
two were that far apart but as you can
see<00:01:04.580> there<00:01:04.940> still<00:01:05.180> is<00:01:05.360> some<00:01:05.390> improvements

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
see there still is some improvements

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.510 
see there still is some improvements
there<00:01:06.470> let's<00:01:06.710> try<00:01:06.799> to<00:01:06.890> find<00:01:07.100> some<00:01:07.220> of<00:01:07.369> the

many r2d2 is on my having her I don't
know<00:01:22.670> if<00:01:22.729> this<00:01:23.000> was<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.210> first<00:01:23.600> one<00:01:23.840> there's

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
know if this was the first one there's

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.620 
know if this was the first one there's
another<00:01:24.110> older<00:01:24.950> Leia<00:01:25.220> but<00:01:25.549> even<00:01:25.850> this<00:01:26.060> let's

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
another older Leia but even this let's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.200 
another older Leia but even this let's
let's<00:01:26.930> put<00:01:27.140> these<00:01:27.320> three<00:01:28.210> side-by-side

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
let's put these three side-by-side

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.539 
let's put these three side-by-side
definitely<00:01:30.049> an<00:01:30.140> evolution<00:01:30.920> right<00:01:31.189> there

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
definitely an evolution right there

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.219 
definitely an evolution right there
there's<00:01:31.970> even<00:01:32.210> two<00:01:32.420> different<00:01:32.750> versions<00:01:32.899> of

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
there's even two different versions of

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.410 
there's even two different versions of
the<00:01:33.350> ceremony<00:01:33.950> lay<00:01:34.220> right<00:01:34.490> there<00:01:34.520> just<00:01:34.820> droid

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
the ceremony lay right there just droid

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.230 
the ceremony lay right there just droid
I<00:01:35.630> forgot<00:01:35.990> what<00:01:36.200> was<00:01:36.320> this<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.710> ASP<00:01:37.670> seven<00:01:38.119> or

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
I forgot what was this the ASP seven or

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.340 
I forgot what was this the ASP seven or
something<00:01:38.479> like<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.750> this<00:01:38.869> was<00:01:39.049> a<00:01:39.079> cool

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
something like that this was a cool

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.960 
something like that this was a cool
droid<00:01:39.649> it's<00:01:39.979> a<00:01:40.159> shame<00:01:40.399> that<00:01:40.430> they<00:01:40.700> haven't

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970
