 conditions that range between 7 and 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.740
 the 9 degrees centigrade in the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.960
 different sectors of the area 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.849
 metropolitan a cold program in addition to 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.619
 we have saturated humidity and in 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.210
 other points of the metropolis 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.000
 find the precipitation of form 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.649
 light so this combined well go 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.149
 that a thermal sensation is maintained a 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.160
 little bit smaller than what is 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.170
 reporting in the temperature in addition 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.090
 So we have the wet pavement and that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.460
 because he still keeps a little more 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.770
 danger you have to leave home with a lot 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.600
 caution the cold front the number 17 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.460
 of the season extends from the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.829
 east coast of the American union until 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.600
 the northeast portion of the nation this 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.879
 semi-stationary in the northeast 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.039

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.809
 cold condition in addition to humidity and 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.970
 precipitations that are dormant in

 this Tuesday morning largely 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.630
 the northeast of the Mexican republic 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.910
 we wait after the passage of this system 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.470
 frontal because he thinks that another one is coming 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.030
 that's why he came in recommended we 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.590
 always keep abreast of 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.750
 weather forecast updates 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.220
 because although we had announced the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.260
 yesterday that for the weekend 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.540
 We expected warm conditions or 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.970
 less a little more temperate this is left 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.650
 discarded as it will reach another front 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.480
 cool to the region and will keep new 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.550
 account for a colder environment for 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.560
 us from the day of the 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.510
 Saturday right now on the 7th of 7 we talked 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.890
 of that for the time being we can see that in 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.170
 this Tuesday's occasion the conditions 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.240

 matter of temperatures the values ​​are 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.860
 they will keep in a range so if something

 cold you have to prevent this to get out 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.520
 of house sheltered values ​​between 2 and 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.229

 preferably after noon 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.390

 reach to reach for you take advantage 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.000
 this condition in Reynosa in the city

 that you want in it we have in the values 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.540
 for the territory of texas too

 quite low -4 the minimum for my 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.320
 friends in dallas however the good 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.480
 news for you is that it already prevails 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.310
 a slightly drier environment and the sky 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.709
 it will stay sunny the same for 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.239
 Austin has the minimum is -3 the maximum

 reaches 7 minus 1 for san antonio 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.800
 reaching 9 if you in the next 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.750
 days 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.430
 week wants to go to there good take in 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.170
 account that the environment will be very cold without 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.180
 However, it will be dry and the rain will not 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.250
 will be present where it still rains is 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.680
 for my friends in mcallen 4 with 12 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.840
 just at least 1 by 8 a medium cloudy 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.700
 in the sky at the moment we have 9 degrees 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.740
 in the southern area of ​​the metropolitan area a 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.570
 cold environment still dominates it's time 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.550
 day we have precipitation conditions 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.610
 of cloudy variables a bit of 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.830
 drizzle humidity reaches 87% and the 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.960
 wind runs at 26 kilometers per hour 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.550
 so this combined because it makes the 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.900
 thermal sensation be a little more 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.420
 low of what the thermometer is 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.220

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.080
 the day of this Tuesday prevail a 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.240
 humidity environment rainfall 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.680
 after the new day could say goodbye 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.840
 this condition of precipitation 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.090
 stay only in late afternoon 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.310

 kind that we will have in the week 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.840
 because on Saturday we received another front 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.040
 cold and this will cause conditions of 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.140
 new low account 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.910
