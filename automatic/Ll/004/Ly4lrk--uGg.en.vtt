00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.870 
bought two young very good young players
I<00:02:48.760> think<00:02:48.819> we'll<00:02:49.329> try<00:02:49.959> harder<00:02:50.139> for<00:02:50.739> us<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:51.220> you

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
I think we'll try harder for us and you

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.270 
I think we'll try harder for us and you
come<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.959> can't<00:02:53.260> keep<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.680> player<00:02:53.920> that

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
come you can't keep a player that

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.759 
come you can't keep a player that
doesn't<00:02:54.489> want<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.880> play<00:02:55.030> for<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:55.769> basically

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
doesn't want to play for you basically

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.330 
doesn't want to play for you basically
you<00:02:57.280> know<00:02:57.489> sir

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.589 

think<00:03:02.000> I<00:03:02.150> mean<00:03:02.420> if<00:03:03.019> he's<00:03:03.080> gonna<00:03:03.500> leave<00:03:03.860> I

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
think I mean if he's gonna leave I

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.089 
think I mean if he's gonna leave I
obviously<00:03:05.599> i'd<00:03:05.840> prefer<00:03:06.080> he<00:03:06.530> went<00:03:06.739> to<00:03:06.860> Real

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
obviously i'd prefer he went to Real

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.670 
obviously i'd prefer he went to Real
Madrid<00:03:07.459> or<00:03:07.580> Barcelona<00:03:07.750> but<00:03:08.750> he's<00:03:09.140> gonna<00:03:09.379> stay

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
Madrid or Barcelona but he's gonna stay

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.800 
Madrid or Barcelona but he's gonna stay
in<00:03:09.739> England<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.340> he's<00:03:10.519> going<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.910> go<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.300> any<00:03:11.629> of

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
in England so he's going to go to any of

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.990 
in England so he's going to go to any of
the<00:03:11.989> top<00:03:12.230> teams<00:03:12.500> just<00:03:13.160> as<00:03:13.340> long<00:03:13.370> as<00:03:13.580> he<00:03:13.819> doesn't

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
the top teams just as long as he doesn't

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.470 
the top teams just as long as he doesn't
gave<00:03:14.239> too<00:03:14.390> much<00:03:14.540> to<00:03:14.720> see<00:03:14.959> night

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.809 

if<00:03:17.959> he<00:03:18.170> went<00:03:18.349> to<00:03:18.530> Majesty<00:03:18.980> knighted<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:19.489> would

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
if he went to Majesty knighted I would

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.240 
if he went to Majesty knighted I would
call<00:03:20.060> in<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.239> traitor<00:03:20.590> I'd<00:03:21.590> probably<00:03:21.890> call<00:03:22.220> it

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
call in a traitor I'd probably call it

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.530 
call in a traitor I'd probably call it
worse<00:03:22.580> than<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:23.030> dream<00:03:24.220> but<00:03:25.220> going<00:03:25.849> to<00:03:26.030> Chelsea

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
worse than a dream but going to Chelsea

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.809 
worse than a dream but going to Chelsea
I<00:03:26.569> would<00:03:26.840> say<00:03:27.019> he's<00:03:27.140> not<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.319> traitor<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:28.280> he's

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
I would say he's not a traitor but he's

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.250 
I would say he's not a traitor but he's
turned<00:03:29.810> his<00:03:30.110> back<00:03:30.379> on<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:31.099> fans<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:32.959> fans

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
turned his back on the fans and the fans

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.500 
turned his back on the fans and the fans
will<00:03:33.440> never<00:03:33.650> forgive<00:03:34.040> him<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.700> isn't<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.209> fact

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
will never forgive him it isn't the fact

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.750 
will never forgive him it isn't the fact
that<00:03:35.629> he's<00:03:35.840> left<00:03:36.170> Chelsea<00:03:36.709> who<00:03:36.830> it's<00:03:36.950> not<00:03:37.220> left

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
that he's left Chelsea who it's not left

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.470 
that he's left Chelsea who it's not left
Liverpool<00:03:38.420> it's<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.470> way<00:03:39.739> he<00:03:40.120> went<00:03:41.120> about

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
Liverpool it's the way he went about

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.289 
Liverpool it's the way he went about
trying<00:03:42.410> to<00:03:42.860> leave<00:03:43.040> Liverpool<00:03:43.579> like<00:03:43.849> he<00:03:44.000> put<00:03:44.180> in

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
trying to leave Liverpool like he put in

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.300 
trying to leave Liverpool like he put in
a<00:03:44.390> transfer<00:03:44.599> request<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:45.500> think<00:03:45.709> through<00:03:45.950> two

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
a transfer request I think through two

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.430 
a transfer request I think through two
or<00:03:46.640> three<00:03:46.849> days<00:03:47.030> before<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.659> window<00:03:48.079> closed

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
or three days before the window closed

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.619 
or three days before the window closed
so<00:03:48.829> that<00:03:48.860> gave<00:03:49.220> us<00:03:49.370> no<00:03:49.579> time<00:03:49.849> too<00:03:50.150> many<00:03:50.209> fine

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
so that gave us no time too many fine

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.160 
so that gave us no time too many fine
players<00:03:52.269> again<00:03:53.269> he<00:03:53.510> could<00:03:53.660> have<00:03:53.750> stayed<00:03:53.989> till

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
players again he could have stayed till

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.660 
players again he could have stayed till
the<00:03:54.200> end<00:03:54.379> of<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.590> season<00:03:54.799> and<00:03:55.220> gone<00:03:55.430> in<00:03:55.549> the

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
the end of the season and gone in the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.479 
the end of the season and gone in the
summer<00:03:56.290> but<00:03:57.290> it's<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.530> way<00:03:57.650> he<00:03:57.680> was<00:03:57.980> doing<00:03:58.340> it

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
summer but it's the way he was doing it

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.940 
summer but it's the way he was doing it
that<00:03:58.760> people<00:03:59.000> disappointed<00:03:59.870> I<00:04:00.140> think
