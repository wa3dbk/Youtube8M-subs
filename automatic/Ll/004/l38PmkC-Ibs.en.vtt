might<00:01:02.129> focus<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.609> where<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.850> put<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> weight

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
might focus on where to put a weight

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.820 
might focus on where to put a weight
hold<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.960> try<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.229> change<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> weighting

ball<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.939> create<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> little<00:01:06.479> there<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
ball this can create a little there the

ball this can create a little there the
difference<00:01:07.049> depending<00:01:07.320> away<00:01:07.500> put<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> weight

difference depending away put the weight

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.399 
difference depending away put the weight
on<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.340> ball<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:09.630> size<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.080> hole<00:01:10.229> at

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
on the ball the size of the hole at

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.660 
on the ball the size of the hole at
depth<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.770> hole<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.220> increase<00:01:11.549> or

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
depth of the hole can increase or

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.730 
depth of the hole can increase or
decrease<00:01:11.840> flair<00:01:12.840> potential<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.439> ball

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
decrease flair potential in that ball

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.020 
decrease flair potential in that ball
right<00:01:14.400> there<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:15.150> still<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.740> USBC<00:01:16.790> limits<00:01:17.790> of

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
right there is still the USBC limits of

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.300 
right there is still the USBC limits of
one<00:01:18.630> ounce<00:01:18.780> left<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:19.740> right<00:01:19.890> at<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> center

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
one ounce left or right at the center

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.670 
one ounce left or right at the center
line<00:01:20.460> right<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:21.060> ounce<00:01:21.439> up-and-down<00:01:22.439> from

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
line right one ounce up-and-down from

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.660 
line right one ounce up-and-down from
the<00:01:22.890> midline<00:01:23.250> right<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:25.170> still<00:01:25.470> are

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
the midline right so we still are

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.730 
the midline right so we still are
dealing<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.790> those<00:01:27.000> issues<00:01:27.390> whether<00:01:28.290> that

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
dealing with those issues whether that

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.580 
dealing with those issues whether that
rule<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:30.090> find<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.350> doesn't

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
rule you know we find that it doesn't

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.140 
rule you know we find that it doesn't
make<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> difference<00:01:31.799> right<00:01:32.400> there's<00:01:32.820> actually

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
make a difference right there's actually

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.060 
make a difference right there's actually
a<00:01:33.180> video<00:01:33.329> out<00:01:33.570> there<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.960> was<00:01:34.259> tell<00:01:34.799> me<00:01:34.829> tell<00:01:35.040> me

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
a video out there I was tell me tell me

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.420 
a video out there I was tell me tell me
five<00:01:35.729> runs<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.360> them<00:01:36.509> using<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> robot

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
five runs with them using that the robot

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.600 
five runs with them using that the robot
trying<00:01:38.430> different<00:01:39.409> side<00:01:40.409> side<00:01:41.100> weights<00:01:41.369> and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
trying different side side weights and

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.980 
trying different side side weights and
right<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:42.150> found<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.630> doesn't<00:01:42.869> really

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
right they found that it doesn't really

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.590 
right they found that it doesn't really
make<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.200> difference<00:01:43.409> at<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.579> until<00:01:45.060> us<00:01:45.329> BC

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
make a difference at all so until us BC

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.810 
make a difference at all so until us BC
changes<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.229> rule<00:01:46.680> you're<00:01:47.280> stuck<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.640> that

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
changes that rule you're stuck with that

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.800 
changes that rule you're stuck with that
if<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:49.680> find<00:01:49.860> anything<00:01:50.040> those<00:01:50.280> limits

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
if you can find anything those limits

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
if you can find anything those limits
but<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.200> said<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.649> kind<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.130> want

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
but like I said you kind of if you want

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.999 
but like I said you kind of if you want
to<00:01:53.759> put<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> hole<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.270> ball<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:55.200> may<00:01:55.649> try

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
to put a hole in the ball you may try

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.819 
to put a hole in the ball you may try
and<00:01:56.040> get<00:01:56.750> side<00:01:57.750> weight<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.649> put

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
and get side weight so that you can put

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.440 
and get side weight so that you can put
the<00:01:58.920> hole<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.100> there<00:01:59.430> right<00:01:59.729> but<00:02:00.090> outside<00:02:00.390> of

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
the hole in there right but outside of

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.760 
the hole in there right but outside of
that<00:02:00.570> no<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.960> doesn't<00:02:01.229> make<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> huge

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770
