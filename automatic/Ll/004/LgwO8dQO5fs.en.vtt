00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
let's get to it alright so number one is

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.240 
let's get to it alright so number one is
to<00:00:48.300> always<00:00:48.570> jump<00:00:49.200> when<00:00:49.710> you're<00:00:49.829> attacking

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
to always jump when you're attacking

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.420 
to always jump when you're attacking
somebody<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:51.210> those<00:00:52.110> little<00:00:52.440> tiny<00:00:53.070> stars

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
somebody because those little tiny stars

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.639 
somebody because those little tiny stars
around<00:00:53.699> those<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:55.020> means<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.350> land<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
around those that means you land a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.920 
around those that means you land a
critical<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.480> see<00:00:57.510> there's<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
critical and as you can see there's a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.670 
critical and as you can see there's a
huge<00:00:58.260> difference<00:01:00.020> tip<00:01:01.020> number<00:01:01.140> two<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.559> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
huge difference tip number two is to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.470 
huge difference tip number two is to
always<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.039> straight<00:01:02.579> phul<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> left<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
always a straight phul to the left and

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.840 
always a straight phul to the left and
the<00:01:03.570> right<00:01:03.739> because<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.250> lot<00:01:05.430> harder<00:01:05.610> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the right because it's a lot harder to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.539 
the right because it's a lot harder to
hit<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.390> les<00:01:06.900> hits<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.380> they<00:01:07.530> land<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
hit you and les hits that they land the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.510 
hit you and les hits that they land the
better<00:01:09.330> chance<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.930> will<00:01:10.049> survive

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.800 

when<00:01:15.520> somebody's<00:01:15.850> running<00:01:16.060> at<00:01:16.270> you<00:01:16.450> and<00:01:16.719> you

and fight when you need to run away and

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:41.219 
and fight when you need to run away and
the<00:01:39.310> best<00:01:39.490> thing<00:01:39.549> to<00:01:39.759> do<00:01:39.880> is<00:01:40.179> to<00:01:40.209> run<00:01:41.020> away

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
the best thing to do is to run away

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.690

while<00:01:41.380> jumping<00:01:41.740> at<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.039> same<00:01:42.310> time<00:01:42.520> because

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
while jumping at the same time because

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.520 
while jumping at the same time because
it<00:01:42.969> makes<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.359> a<00:01:43.390> lot<00:01:43.569> of<00:01:43.659> faster<00:01:44.020> if<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.380> turn

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
it makes you a lot of faster if you turn

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.219 
it makes you a lot of faster if you turn
around<00:01:44.709> while<00:01:45.369> walking<00:01:46.209> backwards<00:01:46.869> they'll

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
around while walking backwards they'll

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.559 
around while walking backwards they'll
kill<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.739> there<00:01:48.520> is<00:01:48.640> no<00:01:48.819> chance<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.360> surviving

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569

remember<00:01:52.569> that<00:01:52.899> defense<00:01:53.380> is<00:01:53.590> key<00:01:53.950> if<00:01:54.250> somebody

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
remember that defense is key if somebody

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.819 
remember that defense is key if somebody
attacks<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.149> and<00:01:55.329> you're<00:01:56.110> not<00:01:56.259> ready<00:01:56.500> it's

attacks you and you're not ready it's

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.130 
attacks you and you're not ready it's
better<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.549> have<00:01:57.640> defense<00:01:58.209> than<00:01:58.479> offense<00:01:58.899> you

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
better to have defense than offense you

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.779

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
around in different areas and as you

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:22.660

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.910 

alright<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.510> last<00:03:23.750> tip<00:03:23.959> is<00:03:24.110> if<00:03:24.530> your<00:03:24.709> main

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
alright so the last tip is if your main

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.280 
alright so the last tip is if your main
weapon<00:03:25.370> breaks<00:03:25.730> then<00:03:26.420> you<00:03:26.630> have<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.840> switch<00:03:27.050> to

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
weapon breaks then you have to switch to

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.220 
weapon breaks then you have to switch to
the<00:03:27.560> cleat<00:03:28.190> closest<00:03:28.940> thing<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.450> could<00:03:29.780> cause

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
the cleat closest thing that could cause

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.199 
the cleat closest thing that could cause
the<00:03:30.410> most<00:03:30.530> damage<00:03:30.650> like<00:03:31.190> if<00:03:31.640> you're<00:03:31.760> if<00:03:32.060> your

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
the most damage like if you're if your

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.150 
the most damage like if you're if your
sword<00:03:32.450> breaks<00:03:32.660> in<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.170> have<00:03:33.290> an<00:03:33.440> axe<00:03:33.650> use<00:03:34.040> the

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
sword breaks in you have an axe use the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.430 
sword breaks in you have an axe use the
ax<00:03:34.340> because<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:35.060> sword<00:03:35.510> does<00:03:35.690> three<00:03:35.900> hearts<00:03:36.230> and

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
ax because a sword does three hearts and

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.770 
ax because a sword does three hearts and
the<00:03:36.920> X<00:03:37.130> does<00:03:37.430> at<00:03:37.730> least<00:03:37.760> two<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.270> a<00:03:38.300> half<00:03:38.450> a

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
the X does at least two and a half a

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.690 
the X does at least two and a half a
little<00:03:39.680> bit<00:03:39.800> there's<00:03:40.280> like<00:03:40.459> a<00:03:40.489> little

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
little bit there's like a little

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.220 
little bit there's like a little
difference<00:03:41.209> but<00:03:41.450> it's<00:03:41.630> better<00:03:41.780> than<00:03:41.900> nothing

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230
