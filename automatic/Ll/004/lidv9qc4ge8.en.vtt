00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:37.940 
spring and this seat go back in so
that's<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.210> all<00:02:30.330> one<00:02:36.140> just<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.290> little<00:02:37.320> peek<00:02:37.830> at

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
that's the all one just a little peek at

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.990 
that's the all one just a little peek at
that<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:39.120> actually<00:02:39.450> looks<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.720> little<00:02:39.810> rough

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
that it actually looks a little rough

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.140 
that it actually looks a little rough
but<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.150> flattens<00:02:42.570> out<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:43.670> your<00:02:44.670> spring<00:02:44.940> does

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
but it flattens out and your spring does

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.450 
but it flattens out and your spring does
get<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.390> little<00:02:45.600> weak<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.560> some<00:02:46.980> people<00:02:47.310> take

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
get a little weak so some people take

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.040 
get a little weak so some people take
this<00:02:47.670> spring<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.240> just<00:02:48.480> stretch<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:49.020> little

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
this spring and just stretch it a little

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.210 
this spring and just stretch it a little
bit<00:02:50.240> that<00:02:51.240> will<00:02:51.420> work<00:02:51.630> not<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.230> fan<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:54.050> so

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
bit that will work not a fan of it so

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.800 
bit that will work not a fan of it so
what<00:02:56.220> I'm<00:02:56.490> going<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.730> do<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.210> I<00:02:57.450> take<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:57.660> little
