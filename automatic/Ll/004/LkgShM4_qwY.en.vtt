of<00:00:30.750> Norman<00:00:31.050> Foamposites<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.610> red<00:00:32.880> and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.209 
of Norman Foamposites but it is red and
black<00:00:33.239> because<00:00:33.540> LeBron<00:00:34.440> James<00:00:34.739> was<00:00:35.070> his

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
black because LeBron James was his

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
hence the red and black colorway I

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.389 
hence the red and black colorway I
talked<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.989> his<00:00:40.110> mom<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.290> little<00:00:40.440> bit<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.070> when

talked to his mom a little bit and when

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.280 
talked to his mom a little bit and when
they<00:00:41.520> we're<00:00:42.149> actually<00:00:42.450> designing<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.110> shoe

LeBrons<00:00:45.360> first<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:46.320> some<00:00:46.469> reason<00:00:46.739> I

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
LeBrons first but for some reason I

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.180 
LeBrons first but for some reason I
don't<00:00:46.860> know<00:00:47.160> why<00:00:47.370> they<00:00:47.969> ended<00:00:48.149> up<00:00:48.239> doing<00:00:48.390> a

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
don't know why they ended up doing a

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.189 
don't know why they ended up doing a
foam<00:00:50.190> posit<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.390> wasn't<00:00:51.719> too<00:00:51.780> far<00:00:51.960> off<00:00:51.989> by

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
foam posit so I wasn't too far off by

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.380 
foam posit so I wasn't too far off by
saying<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.949> possible<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> LeBron

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
saying it's possible to have a LeBron

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.790 
saying it's possible to have a LeBron
and<00:00:54.660> definitely<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.020> wasn't<00:00:55.289> hinting<00:00:55.530> it

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and definitely I wasn't hinting it

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.099 
and definitely I wasn't hinting it
