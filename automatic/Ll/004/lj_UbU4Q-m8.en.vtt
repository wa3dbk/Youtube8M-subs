works here and today I want to talk with
you<00:00:10.400> about<00:00:10.610> our<00:00:11.000> new<00:00:11.379> m35<00:00:12.379> bottom<00:00:12.830> bracket

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
you about our new m35 bottom bracket

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.060 
you about our new m35 bottom bracket
system<00:00:13.519> the<00:00:14.360> m35<00:00:15.080> system<00:00:15.559> I<00:00:15.650> wanted<00:00:15.889> to<00:00:15.950> get

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
system the m35 system I wanted to get

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.070 
system the m35 system I wanted to get
the<00:00:16.340> first<00:00:16.610> thing<00:00:16.789> out<00:00:16.970> it<00:00:17.150> is<00:00:17.270> not<00:00:17.599> a<00:00:17.840> new

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
the first thing out it is not a new

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.490 
the first thing out it is not a new
standard<00:00:18.619> the<00:00:19.400> m35<00:00:20.090> system<00:00:20.539> is<00:00:20.720> a<00:00:20.779> bottom

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
standard the m35 system is a bottom

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.290 
standard the m35 system is a bottom
bracket<00:00:21.619> that<00:00:22.310> works<00:00:22.609> in<00:00:22.849> the<00:00:23.119> already

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
bracket that works in the already

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.870 
bracket that works in the already
established<00:00:24.080> standards<00:00:24.890> which<00:00:25.070> are<00:00:25.220> BB<00:00:25.609> 30

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
established standards which are BB 30

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.800 
established standards which are BB 30
and<00:00:26.179> press<00:00:26.660> 430<00:00:27.080> so<00:00:27.920> that<00:00:28.160> was<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:28.810> design

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
and press 430 so that was the design

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.240 
and press 430 so that was the design
thought<00:00:30.109> behind<00:00:30.439> this<00:00:30.589> as<00:00:30.740> we<00:00:30.859> did<00:00:30.949> that<00:00:31.039> like

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
thought behind this as we did that like

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.620 
thought behind this as we did that like
create<00:00:31.519> a<00:00:31.550> new<00:00:31.669> standard<00:00:31.910> but<00:00:32.240> we<00:00:32.330> wanted<00:00:32.540> to

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
create a new standard but we wanted to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.330 
create a new standard but we wanted to
make<00:00:32.780> a<00:00:32.810> bottom<00:00:33.200> bracket<00:00:33.260> that<00:00:33.590> worked<00:00:33.890> in<00:00:34.160> the

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
make a bottom bracket that worked in the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.420 
make a bottom bracket that worked in the
current<00:00:34.700> standards<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:35.990> a<00:00:36.350> few<00:00:37.010> things<00:00:37.040> about

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
current standards so a few things about

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.460 
current standards so a few things about
the<00:00:37.670> m35<00:00:38.240> system<00:00:38.720> that<00:00:38.870> set<00:00:39.050> it<00:00:39.140> apart<00:00:39.410> from

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
the m35 system that set it apart from

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.960 
the m35 system that set it apart from
the<00:00:39.590> rest<00:00:39.650> is<00:00:39.980> right<00:00:40.280> out<00:00:40.430> of<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:40.550> gate<00:00:40.760> is

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
the rest is right out of the gate is

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.880 
the rest is right out of the gate is
you'll<00:00:41.600> notice<00:00:41.780> that<00:00:42.020> is<00:00:42.140> much<00:00:42.350> larger<00:00:42.770> and

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
you'll notice that is much larger and

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.010 
you'll notice that is much larger and
it's<00:00:43.040> in<00:00:43.130> a<00:00:43.190> cartridge<00:00:43.550> style<00:00:43.880> we<00:00:44.540> based<00:00:44.870> it

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
it's in a cartridge style we based it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.800 
it's in a cartridge style we based it
off<00:00:45.140> of<00:00:45.200> a<00:00:45.380> 35<00:00:45.860> millimeter<00:00:46.430> inner<00:00:46.700> bearing<00:00:47.660> as

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
off of a 35 millimeter inner bearing as

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.230 
off of a 35 millimeter inner bearing as
opposed<00:00:48.560> to<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.950> established<00:00:49.430> 30<00:00:49.730> millimeter

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
opposed to the established 30 millimeter

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.920 
opposed to the established 30 millimeter
bearings<00:00:50.660> for<00:00:51.230> a<00:00:51.260> couple<00:00:51.650> reasons<00:00:52.060> one<00:00:53.060> the<00:00:53.450> 35

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
bearings for a couple reasons one the 35

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.600 
bearings for a couple reasons one the 35
obviously<00:00:54.500> we<00:00:54.620> get<00:00:54.710> some<00:00:54.890> more<00:00:55.040> rigidity<00:00:55.310> out

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
obviously we get some more rigidity out

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.270 
obviously we get some more rigidity out
of<00:00:55.820> it<00:00:55.940> but<00:00:56.630> the<00:00:57.350> other<00:00:57.500> thing<00:00:57.770> is<00:00:57.890> when<00:00:58.250> it

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
of it but the other thing is when it

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.010 
of it but the other thing is when it
comes<00:00:58.520> time<00:00:58.730> for<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:59.090> actual<00:00:59.240> spindle<00:00:59.870> of<00:00:59.900> the

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
comes time for the actual spindle of the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.510 
comes time for the actual spindle of the
crank<00:01:00.290> and<00:01:00.410> you<00:01:00.530> can<00:01:00.650> see<00:01:00.800> it's<00:01:00.920> massive<00:01:01.370> by

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
crank and you can see it's massive by

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.420 
crank and you can see it's massive by
size<00:01:01.760> but<00:01:02.690> it<00:01:02.870> opens<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:03.440> door<00:01:03.650> for<00:01:03.680> us<00:01:03.920> for

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
size but it opens the door for us for

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.160 
size but it opens the door for us for
future<00:01:04.699> manufacturing<00:01:05.479> with<00:01:05.630> alternative

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
future manufacturing with alternative

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.560 
future manufacturing with alternative
materials<00:01:06.649> 35<00:01:07.399> millimeters<00:01:07.909> happens<00:01:08.299> to<00:01:08.420> be

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
materials 35 millimeters happens to be

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.410 
materials 35 millimeters happens to be
the<00:01:09.170> point<00:01:09.439> at<00:01:09.649> which<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.850> size<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.329> the

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
the point at which the size and the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.080 
the point at which the size and the
diameter<00:01:11.600> of<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.560> spindle<00:01:12.859> makes<00:01:13.640> it<00:01:13.759> easy<00:01:13.969> to

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
diameter of the spindle makes it easy to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.969 
diameter of the spindle makes it easy to
work<00:01:14.299> with<00:01:14.479> other<00:01:14.689> materials<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:15.500> that's<00:01:15.740> why

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
work with other materials so that's why

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.340 
work with other materials so that's why
35<00:01:16.729> happen<00:01:17.179> to<00:01:17.299> be<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.539> magical<00:01:17.899> number<00:01:18.049> for

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
35 happen to be the magical number for

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.580 
35 happen to be the magical number for
us<00:01:18.469> for<00:01:18.829> rigidity<00:01:20.020> greater<00:01:21.020> than<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.380> 30

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
us for rigidity greater than the 30

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.679 
us for rigidity greater than the 30
millimeters<00:01:22.070> out<00:01:22.249> there<00:01:22.460> but<00:01:22.909> also<00:01:23.119> for

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
millimeters out there but also for

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.929 
millimeters out there but also for
future<00:01:23.869> development<00:01:24.649> so<00:01:25.039> imagine<00:01:25.460> down<00:01:25.820> the

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
future development so imagine down the

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.060 
future development so imagine down the
line<00:01:26.119> carbon<00:01:26.600> fiber<00:01:26.840> titanium<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:27.859> maybe

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
line carbon fiber titanium and maybe

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.469 
line carbon fiber titanium and maybe
some<00:01:28.310> other<00:01:28.429> materials<00:01:28.939> used<00:01:29.210> for<00:01:29.420> the

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
some other materials used for the

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.410 
some other materials used for the
spindles<00:01:29.869> to<00:01:30.020> get<00:01:30.140> lower<00:01:30.350> lathes<00:01:30.649> so<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.759> m35

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
spindles to get lower lathes so the m35

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.300 
spindles to get lower lathes so the m35
system<00:01:32.840> simply<00:01:33.380> it's<00:01:33.560> very<00:01:33.829> simple<00:01:34.189> the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
system simply it's very simple the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.849 
system simply it's very simple the
simplicity<00:01:35.270> is<00:01:35.479> its<00:01:35.630> genius<00:01:36.049> is<00:01:36.319> you

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
simplicity is its genius is you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.730 
simplicity is its genius is you
basically<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:37.609> threads<00:01:37.880> apart<00:01:38.439> and<00:01:39.439> it<00:01:39.560> comes

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
basically it threads apart and it comes

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.789 
basically it threads apart and it comes
in<00:01:39.859> 68<00:01:40.340> or<00:01:40.460> 73<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.780> what<00:01:41.960> it<00:01:42.079> does<00:01:42.259> then<00:01:42.560> is<00:01:42.740> a

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
in 68 or 73 and what it does then is a

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.069 
in 68 or 73 and what it does then is a
couple<00:01:43.369> things<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.179> you<00:01:44.240> take<00:01:44.509> your<00:01:44.659> press<00:01:44.869> bit

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
couple things so you take your press bit

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.010 
couple things so you take your press bit

presses both sides of the frame and what
we've<00:01:56.270> done<00:01:56.479> are<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.840> couple<00:01:57.079> things<00:01:57.409> one<00:01:58.130> if

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
we've done are a couple things one if

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.279 
we've done are a couple things one if
you're<00:01:58.579> in<00:01:58.639> a<00:01:58.729> BB<00:01:59.060> 30<00:01:59.299> frame<00:01:59.600> you're<00:01:59.899> removing

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
you're in a BB 30 frame you're removing

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.260 
you're in a BB 30 frame you're removing
all<00:02:00.679> of<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.979> surra<00:02:01.189> clips<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.789> all<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.179> the

all of the surra clips and all of the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.849 
all of the surra clips and all of the
things<00:02:02.479> that<00:02:02.600> go<00:02:02.780> inside<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.319> frame<00:02:03.679> that

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
things that go inside the frame that

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.709 
things that go inside the frame that
held<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.219> bearings<00:02:04.520> in<00:02:04.609> place<00:02:04.639> because<00:02:05.389> the

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
held the bearings in place because the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.899 
held the bearings in place because the
bearings<00:02:06.109> ride<00:02:06.709> on<00:02:06.889> the<00:02:06.979> outboard<00:02:07.520> side<00:02:07.850> of

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
bearings ride on the outboard side of

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.309 
bearings ride on the outboard side of
the<00:02:08.030> frame<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.539> bearings<00:02:08.869> are<00:02:08.959> actually

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
the frame so the bearings are actually

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.710 
the frame so the bearings are actually
outside<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.920> frame<00:02:10.130> for<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.090> couple<00:02:11.390> reasons

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
outside the frame for a couple reasons

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.840 
outside the frame for a couple reasons
one<00:02:12.170> we<00:02:12.410> get<00:02:12.530> more<00:02:12.830> rigidity<00:02:13.070> that<00:02:13.430> way

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
one we get more rigidity that way

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.760 
one we get more rigidity that way
but<00:02:14.180> also<00:02:14.390> we're<00:02:14.780> able<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.140> keep<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.530> drive

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
but also we're able to keep the drive

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.160 
but also we're able to keep the drive

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.960 
works with and they launched with the M
35<00:02:51.230> system<00:02:51.710> and<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:52.310> slides<00:02:52.550> through<00:02:52.730> the

frame through the bearing puts together

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.830 
frame through the bearing puts together
and<00:02:54.830> it<00:02:54.950> goes<00:02:55.070> together<00:02:55.450> just<00:02:56.450> like<00:02:56.630> it's<00:02:56.750> an

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
and it goes together just like it's an

and it goes together just like it's an
isis<00:02:57.440> system<00:02:57.770> so<00:02:58.430> then<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:58.640> goes<00:02:58.790> through

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
isis system so then it goes through

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.510 
isis system so then it goes through
there<00:03:00.230> is<00:03:00.380> your<00:03:00.530> bottom<00:03:00.800> bracket<00:03:00.890> your<00:03:01.280> crank

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
there is your bottom bracket your crank

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.110 
there is your bottom bracket your crank
arm<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.910> then<00:03:02.480> this<00:03:02.600> bolts<00:03:02.930> together<00:03:04.120> Isis

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
arm and then this bolts together Isis

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.780 
arm and then this bolts together Isis
down<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.540> you're<00:03:06.020> off<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.410> races<00:03:06.580> okay

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
down and you're off to the races okay

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.810 
down and you're off to the races okay
