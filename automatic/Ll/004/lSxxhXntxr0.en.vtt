00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.340
 Joe let's deal with the main 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.920
 all the benefits i just by you 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.439
 not listed the main ones 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.669
 indicate profitability I will tell 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:28.150
 means the first because it is heated 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:32.800
 the floor itself and the temperature spreads 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:35.050
 evenly over the entire floor area she 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.170
 rises naturally the law of physics you 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.780
 you know everything and that's it evenly 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.960
 heated evenly heated 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.089
 the temperature it rises up 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.170
 mean in the floor area she can 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:52.120
 vary from 24 to 33 degrees in 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.790
 whichever is due 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.949
 bathrooms for example 33 degrees 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.140
 recommend doing in the bedroom and living room 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.530
 somewhere twenty four twenty five and 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.710
 here rising to a level of a head she already 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.820
 this temperature reaches 20 degrees and 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.150
 already under the ceiling falls in different ways 14 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.070
 15 16 18 here such here if you 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.380
 look at the picture to the right 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.920
 where radiator heating system goes 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.630
 convection then you understand yes what 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.390
 heated air from radiators 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.630
 rises up under the ceiling he will 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.560
 40 45 degrees then cools down 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.490
 down and again 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.090
 the cycle continues so here with warm 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.730
 floors 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.409
 that is, this part is under the ceiling 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.720
 it is already with a reduced temperature 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.460
 Naturally why do we need to heat 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.710
 then the area under the ceiling 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.770
 if there is no one there, there is order 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.950
 thirty percent of the height of the room 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.409
 we heat but with low 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.840
 the temperature is warm there too 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.060
 but reduced the same is not comfortable 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.760
 temperature for a person that is it here 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.420
 first advantage when you save 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.629
 clean at room height 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.330
 the second point is itself low 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:16.360
 coolant temperature in this case 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.790
 energy savings 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.850
 coolant temperature in the system as 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.330
 accepted it again varies from 50 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.510
 until 6 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.490
 10 degrees a lot here and so let's say 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.880
 goes disagreement naturally you 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.200
 do you understand the date or heat it up to 90 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.940
 degrees when we need so let's say 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.910
 radiator system so we then warm 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.730
 radiators whether we heat it to 50 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.730
 degrees of difference is here too 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.880
 saving the next moment here are two 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.680
 option who has a heating system 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.480
 Here in this embodiment, even those who have to 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.880
 house exists 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.630
 metal pipe heating 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.660
 Here on this option is yes excellent 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.880
 from my own experience I will say the first 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.730
 the heating system in my house was here 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.740
 it is almost out of it all over the house 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:17.350
 there were 76 pipes on all walls 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:22.330
 so I will say what's there when I flooded 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.610
 the volume of water was about 300 liters and the house 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.300
 only one hundred and twenty square and 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.209
 when I replaced the heating system 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.910
 polypropylene pipes where warm floor 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.790
 at the moment I only have 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.870
 the volume of coolant 60 letters yes that is 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.450
 understand 5 times and how much faster 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.850
 whether heated to 60 liters whether 300 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.910
 liters and in order to heat 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.330
 it is also sometimes necessary carrier at all 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.390
 my home as a testing ground I 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.600
 house redid the heating system 3 times 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.280
 and each time something added yes 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.800
 cleaned something and 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.220
 yet we say to my house not 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.590
 I try it so other people do not 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.890
 only one option turned out 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.180
 when I made the client then 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.180
 yourself at home this just 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.330
 warm floor on a wooden base with 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.650
 heating rate remarkably and 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.160
 no problems with warming up 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.250
 not even faster than pipelines 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.250
 reaches the end point so this is the third 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.320
 the reason is rather the third advantage and 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.080
 there is still such a principle of self-regulation 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.920
 anyone heard what principle 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.920
 self regulation 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.020
 circuit he is often voiced precisely when 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.390
 warm floors no matter what will be 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.900
 warm floors on concrete on wooden 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.530
 basis 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.070
 it means when the floor heats up to this one 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.740
 here's the floor surface heats up 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.260
 assume up to 25 degrees this air 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:01.060
 starts to climb up at the end 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:03.700
 ends here in the legs to the waist 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.660
 human naturally air temperature 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.900
 also somewhere reaches 25 degrees and 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.950
 then the sex is just posture according to theory 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.350
 heat transfer 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.020
 he will not give this already warm 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.510
 air because the air is already warm 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.140
 to this temperature and naturally 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.850
 Once the return from the floor there is no coolant 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.480
 comes back with the same 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.250
 temperatures naturally already 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.680
 heating equipment is not necessary 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.070
 heat it extra it is long 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:39.280
 will warm but not with such 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.670
 loss of energy who would say so 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.260
 catch him up to the optimum temperature 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:49.630
 this is also an important advantage 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.550
 warm floor that is rarely here in 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.800
 basically only the system has a warm floor and 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.120
 there is such a principle of black itself 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.470
 so these moments are clear, we now understand 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.590
 the advantage of the warmest floor 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.980
 This is a general concept for all systems. 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.540
 wooden concrete all that concerns 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.720
 warm floor so good 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.900
 go to the next point means 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:18.160
 question again to you guys what 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.560
 floor structure you that is on the 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.440
 moment here are two kinds 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.680
 depicted that is, who has the floor 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:30.520
 on a concrete slab or some kind of concrete 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.800
 the base as here in this case is one 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.590
 moment there are such people without a difference 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.290
 hollow she rests on 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:41.950
 solid base concrete slab anything 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:44.470
 there will be a second moment this is when 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.230
 so let's say the floor is on weight that is on the logs 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.249
 this here is the design and there are 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.279
 people who else 

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:55.969
 for now there is no concrete at all 

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:59.239
 wooden but who still has nothing 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:01.839
 you were more fortunate of all are going to 

00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:01.839
 to understand
