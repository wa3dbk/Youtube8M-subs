00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.410
 when you tube place now probably come to 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.670
 another video and this time 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.170
 actually I can say quite quite 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.210
 Great project that I am a subscriber 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.560
 has written in comments below 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:30.240
 my video is how to build cars 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.910
 the first part had been so and he wanted 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.640
 Know how to get a fire department or a fire department 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.059
 police car here is so see here in front 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.910
 her that i could do the police car 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.879
 not really doing well 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.640
 that means you look like one 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.460
 police car but there are unfortunately in 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.789
 minecraft no silver metallic 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.789
 hearsay 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:01.519
 and yes I have to go with it a bit 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.100
 gray make with gray wool 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.330
 I hope it is true nevertheless the 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.540
 Probability otherwise, that one must 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:17.520
 make black with white here as well 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.909
 the usa and they have time too 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.619
 different colors some are blue 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:27.180
 or white blue or or so money is 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.610
 actually always different yes we do 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.310
 Now two cars would have a rtw 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.180
 that the abbreviation i know one 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.899
 ambulance rtw her apart from so 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:44.869
 a police car actually packaged 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:49.710
 actually built like a normal car 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.369
 only that is a bit of a circuit 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.130
 there is that is here to do so on 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:02:00.960
 And yes, that 's the interior design 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.310
 would be too surprising for that is the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.380
 Interior is not that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.890
 intoxicating striker can can see you 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.160
 do not sit here or that's how it is 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.300
 Now that's right there but somewhere 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.980
 he also has to use the techniques 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.290
 which is essential to the interior 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.200
 great to say 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.970
 Back with wool once for it 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.400
 Identification maybe packs up there 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.020
 you also put the plaque in it like 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.920
 long car still valid or tÃ¼v has that 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.940
 Believe me for the police car want 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.760
 that is the carpet for packed yes 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.870
 in the back exactly the same or even for 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.110
 rtw or ambulance yes friends 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.740
 actually only one seat that is us 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.130
 front with the lack of space does not have it 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.130
 enough 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.070
 he thinks what exactly is why 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.780
 Here's how a glass would be like this technique 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.210
 it means the red sonja them that 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.890
 bulbs above it shine or shine 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.680
 could you look to the patients now 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.830
 sometimes a horse has to do it now 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.810
 one sitting behind you can see what he is 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.570
 patient makes whether that should proceed 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.180
 or whether the driver should drive faster 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.540
 or so will stay 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:34.400
 that's why it's an entry here 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:39.680
 does not come in quite because of the 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:43.350
 behind even the as large leann rimes 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.250
 and yes, up here is the switch 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.160
 meanwhile, it fits all the way around 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.550
 but he has to switch because of space 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.000
 be up there 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.000
 that's the way it is 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:07.190
 in the back exactly the same 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:12.170
 because of place Rhine-main switch here 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:16.570
 came in and I do not know 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.570
 what you did and there in front 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:27.080
 here are the expansion then but not 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.700
 whether the two sides one 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.120
 that is the badge of the red 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.120
 cross 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:44.230
 or drk German red cross that will 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.690
 actually been to both if that 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.780
 want is the download here is everything 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.620
 Everything is complete here 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.450
 the other things are already happening 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.890
 Germany than the two that is 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:05:02.800
 you would have to update the map number 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:07.240
 transported tactics there you are still standing 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.460
 what little bit of hoops a little something 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.740
 designs is still available 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:19.000
 that's what you build right here and 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:22.810
 you just have to cross the plateau or 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.800
 the design area is flying above and 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.290
 then once on the creuzburg and then 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.450
 fly over here and one 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.380
 Commission or you just click the 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.930
 road along 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:39.310
 then you can continue correctly 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.960
 you see some of them down here below 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.320
 other things that means here it was still 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:48.910
 the other tutorial on how to build cars 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:50.830
 2 I know that I believe this two here 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.770
 was would it actually are the 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.640
 Two things I try in the 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.240
 next days 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:02.590
 since the next days try with the 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:06.150
 construction or planning at the beginning of 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:12.820
 both things once the police station 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:16.720
 and then the hospital or that 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.460
 wish to build a hospital wishes good luck 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.620
 This has a bit difficult 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.780
 you know there are a few projects 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.610
 before me 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.340
 but all in one video 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.650
 and I'd say she has to go 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.010
 again and then thank you for 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.010
 watch
