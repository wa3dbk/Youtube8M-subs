00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
like that was to happen at LAN

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.150 
like that was to happen at LAN
tournament<00:03:32.519> on<00:03:32.640> main<00:03:32.850> stage<00:03:33.120> um<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:34.290> reaction

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
tournament on main stage um the reaction

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.920

would<00:03:35.280> be<00:03:35.340> nuts<00:03:35.640> it<00:03:35.880> would<00:03:35.970> be<00:03:36.060> hilarious<00:03:36.180> but

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
would be nuts it would be hilarious but

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.229 
would be nuts it would be hilarious but
at<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.800> same<00:03:37.980> time<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.430> don't<00:03:38.910> think<00:03:39.120> it's

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
at the same time I don't think it's

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.520 
at the same time I don't think it's
really<00:03:39.450> good<00:03:39.570> for<00:03:39.720> competitive<00:03:40.170> play<00:03:40.350> but<00:03:40.500> I

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
really good for competitive play but I

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.690 
really good for competitive play but I
could<00:03:40.739> just<00:03:40.860> be<00:03:40.920> an<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.400> could<00:03:41.970> just<00:03:42.780> be<00:03:43.700> being

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
ghosts were learning to to kind of be

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.770 
ghosts were learning to to kind of be
innovative<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.130> welcome<00:04:03.060> new<00:04:03.269> things<00:04:03.540> just

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
innovative and welcome new things just

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.120 
innovative and welcome new things just
as<00:04:03.840> we<00:04:03.959> did<00:04:04.019> what<00:04:04.170> black<00:04:04.320> ops<00:04:04.530> 2<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:04.950> know<00:04:05.010> we

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
as we did what black ops 2 you know we

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.259 
as we did what black ops 2 you know we
did<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:05.370> with<00:04:05.459> heart<00:04:05.700> point<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:06.000> everything

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
did that with heart point and everything

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.210 
did that with heart point and everything
and<00:04:06.360> everything<00:04:06.450> seemed<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:06.959> work<00:04:07.140> out<00:04:07.350> with

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
and everything seemed to work out with

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.710 
and everything seemed to work out with
black<00:04:08.459> ops<00:04:08.670> 2<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:08.910> maybe<00:04:09.090> it's<00:04:09.239> just<00:04:09.330> something

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
black ops 2 so maybe it's just something

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.360 
black ops 2 so maybe it's just something
that<00:04:09.810> we<00:04:09.900> need<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.049> give<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.530> bit<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.100> chance
