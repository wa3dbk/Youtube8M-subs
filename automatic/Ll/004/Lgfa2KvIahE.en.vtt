00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.890
 Good beauty guys, we're here for more. 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.680
 a video and today a video about dota 2 and 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.100
 Today I'm going to teach a lot to save 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:17.540
 easy on raiders dac map all 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.490
 that then take to get is first 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.690
 keep that which I think is fundamental 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:27.320
 In the game you're going to triple is the attack. 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:31.880
 What kind do you see the bank that the guy is? 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.220
 doing here and you can see your 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.079
 enemies come out of the green lenny here 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.690
 sun chest type 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.890
 to do something like this is an area 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.000
 fundamental and above all I saw the water 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.600
 wired view 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.930
 another is also good if you do not have 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:59.540
 in Tripoli but is also aid in 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:04.759
 doha is this media help and helps you 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:08.889
 because if the guy is looking around here 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:17.299
 here and why it helps a lot 

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:29.770
 because the vision of the staff then this 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:38.959
 It helps a lot, it's good, but the game 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:46.509
 When you have to put another put 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:46.509
 here now the best thing that the game 

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:56.200
 I think it's simple 

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:58.310
 here has the same function mainly 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:04.719
 From Rio 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.719
 Here I think not but see here 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.399
 so but that is very good 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.500
 another agent that also helps you a lot. 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.530
 see in the ninth game a game too 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.470
 what a lot helps is the hit you put 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.870
 here it gives you a very big view 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.940
 as you can see it is a vision 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.230
 very broad pulling that helps a lot in the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.520
 also at the end of the game also helps 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.550
 because if the guy is taking a 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:37.310
 Bunch of how you see they came 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.310
 here and here as well 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.540
 this place at first the best 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.920
 places to save because it gives you a 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.720
 really big 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:53.220
 now formulating another urn is a good place 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:56.160
 to store here and also on top of the 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.989
 View from up here you can see him 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.820
 can go to the street and post very good 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.310
 another also having almost less function 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.850
 it's the attack 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.660
 then yes you will be able to type in and could t1 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.390
 if you have a great fundamental think it will 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.280
 give for you I could if it has to 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.989
 a light clothing high 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.890
 You can see here it has been prepared. 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.890
 provoke those edson and for whom 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.310
 has gyo type of the type and province 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.670
 That pride I do not think is more 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:36.090
 beauty is always to keep in places that 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.080
 have this make eye down one with the 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.310
 Eye I do not know 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.560
 underneath because it's very good for me option 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.230
 the places the 2 council 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.829
 this one is white and see who's coming 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.560
 on both sides here let me make a command 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:57.350
 on here 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.350
 another agent is also very good 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.489
 that what you can go with it you see 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.950
 All this here is that if someone is killed 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.480
 you can rune and can see who is 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.920
 down to corn is disappearing from the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.069
 month to give a bank 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.600
 so surge is very good is another agent 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.920
 also you can put in the team of 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.820
 rings 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:23.510
 is an honor that is also a place that 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.610
 one of the two marked his ardi is almost the 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.120
 same as the one that we put 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.340
 there it actually looks like it might 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.200
 give you a broad overview and if you 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.479
 have a puzzle something of the type c 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.810
 No time to see where he is. 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.490
 forming in the bush and picking up from the bench 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.750
 kill him there 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:47.660
 these were then galley is the one means is 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:53.150
 without staff and does not have a 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:55.190
 bit of guard know and all that said 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.960
 that everyone will go by now 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.010

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.310
