00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
snapshot is 14 w 10 a and this one comes

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.830 
snapshot is 14 w 10 a and this one comes
with<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.160> very<00:00:08.460> cool<00:00:08.700> change<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.269> survival<00:00:09.809> mode

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
with a very cool change to survival mode

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.110 
with a very cool change to survival mode
there<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.590> only<00:00:10.830> one<00:00:11.070> change<00:00:11.340> however<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.880> think

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
there is only one change however I think

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.789 
there is only one change however I think
this<00:00:12.240> one<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.599> really<00:00:12.840> cool<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.380> let's<00:00:13.559> place

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
this one is really cool so let's place

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.369 
this one is really cool so let's place
down<00:00:14.070> some<00:00:14.340> skeletons<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.109> then<00:00:16.109> we're<00:00:16.260> gonna

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
down some skeletons and then we're gonna

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.230 
down some skeletons and then we're gonna
place<00:00:16.619> down<00:00:17.010> some<00:00:17.250> wolves<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.789> let's<00:00:18.029> see

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
place down some wolves and let's see

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.750 
place down some wolves and let's see
what<00:00:18.359> happens<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.680> wolves<00:00:20.070> are<00:00:20.250> gonna<00:00:20.400> chase

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
what happens the wolves are gonna chase

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.359 
what happens the wolves are gonna chase
the<00:00:21.000> skeletons<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.439> skeletons<00:00:22.980> are

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
the skeletons and the skeletons are

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.970 
the skeletons and the skeletons are
fleeing<00:00:23.880> now<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.689> idea<00:00:25.140> here<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.439> think<00:00:25.830> is

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
fleeing now the idea here I think is

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.650 
fleeing now the idea here I think is
that<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.279> wolves<00:00:26.580> they<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:26.939> bones<00:00:27.210> and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
that the wolves they like bones and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.359 
that the wolves they like bones and
skeletons<00:00:27.900> are<00:00:28.380> obviously<00:00:28.680> made<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.160> bones

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
skeletons are obviously made of bones

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.120 
skeletons are obviously made of bones
and<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.359> now<00:00:30.570> they<00:00:30.779> are<00:00:30.810> enemies<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.009> would

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
and so now they are enemies and it would

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.040 
and so now they are enemies and it would
seem<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.090> skeletons<00:00:33.570> don't<00:00:33.840> actually

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
seem that the skeletons don't actually

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.860 
seem that the skeletons don't actually
fight<00:00:34.590> back<00:00:35.000> which<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.239> an<00:00:36.450> interesting

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
fight back which is an interesting

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.630 
fight back which is an interesting
behavior<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.649> saw<00:00:37.860> there<00:00:38.070> sometimes<00:00:38.489> they

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
behavior you saw there sometimes they

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.490 
behavior you saw there sometimes they
turn<00:00:38.700> around<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:39.300> I've<00:00:39.390> yet<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.629> see<00:00:39.809> one<00:00:40.170> fire

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
turn around but I've yet to see one fire

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.250 
turn around but I've yet to see one fire
a<00:00:40.829> bow<00:00:41.399> or<00:00:41.670> an<00:00:41.879> arrow<00:00:42.090> at<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.780> these<00:00:42.870> wolves

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
a bow or an arrow at one of these wolves

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.619 
a bow or an arrow at one of these wolves
and<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.040> also<00:00:44.340> very<00:00:44.610> cool<00:00:44.879> change<00:00:45.239> for

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
and this is also very cool change for

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.779 
and this is also very cool change for
mob<00:00:45.870> sorting<00:00:46.350> as<00:00:46.559> well<00:00:46.770> because<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
mob sorting as well because you have a

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.150 
mob sorting as well because you have a
creepers<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.020> sorted<00:00:49.440> with<00:00:49.620> ocelots

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
creepers can be sorted with ocelots

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.430 
creepers can be sorted with ocelots
zombies<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.239> sorted<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.809> villages<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
zombies can be sorted with villages and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.560 
zombies can be sorted with villages and
now<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.039> can<00:00:53.309> sort<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> skeletons<00:00:54.149> using

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
now we can sort the skeletons using

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.369 
now we can sort the skeletons using
wolves<00:00:54.930> which<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.890> great<00:00:56.190> addition<00:00:57.379> so

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
wolves which is a great addition so

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.049 
wolves which is a great addition so
there<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.649> another<00:00:58.890> change<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.340> survival

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
there is another change to survival

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.849 
there is another change to survival
minecraft<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.719> actually<00:01:01.170> considered<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
minecraft this is actually considered a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.950 
minecraft this is actually considered a
bug<00:01:02.100> fix<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.609> effects<00:01:02.940> item<00:01:03.359> frames<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
bug fix and effects item frames and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.380 
bug fix and effects item frames and
paintings<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:05.220> place<00:01:05.489> down<00:01:05.729> an<00:01:05.880> item<00:01:06.150> frame

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
paintings if we place down an item frame

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.179 
paintings if we place down an item frame
on<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> block<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.140> then<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.350> go<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.770> corner

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
on a block and then we go to the corner

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.789 
on a block and then we go to the corner
and<00:01:08.340> right-click<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:10.200> I'm<00:01:10.320> placing

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
and right-click you can see I'm placing

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.320 
and right-click you can see I'm placing
more<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> same<00:01:11.549> block<00:01:11.820> now<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.180> this

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
more on the same block now what this

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.149 
more on the same block now what this
would<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.689> previously<00:01:13.170> done<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.830> place

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
would have previously done is place

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
would have previously done is place
multiple<00:01:14.790> item<00:01:15.119> frames<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.840> same<00:01:16.080> place

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
multiple item frames in the same place

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.530 
multiple item frames in the same place
which<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.100> no<00:01:17.220> longer<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.670> by<00:01:18.119> left<00:01:18.360> click

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
which you can no longer do by left click

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.969 
which you can no longer do by left click
on<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:19.650> was<00:01:19.740> only

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
on this you can see that there was only

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.100 
on this you can see that there was only
one<00:01:20.130> item<00:01:20.670> frame<00:01:20.909> there<00:01:21.240> now<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.869> also

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
one item frame there now this also

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.050 
one item frame there now this also
affects<00:01:22.560> paintings<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.460> well<00:01:23.670> because<00:01:23.939> it

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
affects paintings as well because it

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.760 
affects paintings as well because it
means<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.360> they<00:01:24.570> can't<00:01:24.869> overlap<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.619> one

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
means that they can't overlap with one

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.789 
means that they can't overlap with one
another<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> paintings<00:01:27.330> they<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:28.049> big

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
another so the paintings they can be big

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.410 
another so the paintings they can be big
ones<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.700> take<00:01:29.850> up<00:01:30.000> multiple

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
ones like that that take up multiple

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.819 
ones like that that take up multiple
blocks<00:01:30.630> or<00:01:30.810> they<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.170> small<00:01:31.439> ones<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
blocks or they can be small ones and

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.649 
blocks or they can be small ones and
previously<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.939> put<00:01:33.090> them<00:01:33.240> next<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.600> each

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
previously if you put them next to each

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.749 
previously if you put them next to each
other<00:01:33.840> sometimes<00:01:34.409> they<00:01:34.619> would<00:01:34.740> overlap<00:01:35.220> but

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
other sometimes they would overlap but

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.950 
other sometimes they would overlap but
now<00:01:35.939> when<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.210> place<00:01:36.420> them<00:01:36.689> they're<00:01:36.810> only

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
now when you place them they're only

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.350 
now when you place them they're only
going<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.490> size<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.030> will<00:01:39.119> not

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
going to be the size that will not

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.690 
going to be the size that will not
overlap<00:01:39.750> with<00:01:39.810> another<00:01:40.439> painting<00:01:40.890> nearby<00:01:41.340> so

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
overlap with another painting nearby so

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.249 
overlap with another painting nearby so
it's<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.150> fill<00:01:42.299> up<00:01:42.390> whatever<00:01:42.630> space<00:01:42.960> is

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
it's going to fill up whatever space is

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.450 
it's going to fill up whatever space is
available<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:46.619> before<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.070> get<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
command block stuff there is some

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.179 
command block stuff there is some
important<00:01:49.290> information<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.860> should<00:01:50.009> know

about name changing which is coming to

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.170 
about name changing which is coming to
the<00:01:52.439> game<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> future<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.790> will<00:01:53.909> be<00:01:53.970> able

the game in the future you will be able

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.120 
the game in the future you will be able
to<00:01:54.420> change<00:01:54.659> your<00:01:54.990> user<00:01:55.259> name<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.009> is

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
will now have a unique ID and this is

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.649 
will now have a unique ID and this is
going<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.009> be<00:02:05.159> implemented<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.000> one<00:02:06.390> point

update so you

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.319

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
everyone some time to adapt and adjust

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.229 
everyone some time to adapt and adjust
to<00:02:16.689> this<00:02:17.319> new<00:02:17.379> unique<00:02:18.220> ID<00:02:18.489> system<00:02:19.060> but<00:02:19.180> it

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
to this new unique ID system but it

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.580 
to this new unique ID system but it
basically<00:02:19.329> means<00:02:19.659> when<00:02:20.019> you<00:02:20.140> whitelist

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
basically means when you whitelist

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.440 
basically means when you whitelist
someone<00:02:20.920> you're<00:02:21.400> going<00:02:21.579> to<00:02:21.730> whitelist<00:02:22.150> their

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
someone you're going to whitelist their

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.390 
someone you're going to whitelist their
unique<00:02:22.810> identifiers<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:23.829> if<00:02:23.980> they<00:02:24.099> change

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
unique identifiers so if they change

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.069 
unique identifiers so if they change
their<00:02:24.610> name<00:02:24.640> you'll<00:02:25.299> still<00:02:25.599> know<00:02:25.750> who<00:02:25.900> they

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
team as well we can now test for

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.680 
team as well we can now test for
scoreboard<00:03:23.560> values<00:03:23.980> on<00:03:24.250> entities<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.480> if<00:03:25.569> we

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
scoreboard values on entities so if we

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.909 
scoreboard values on entities so if we
have<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.840> look<00:03:26.019> at<00:03:26.109> this<00:03:26.169> command<00:03:26.560> block<00:03:26.650> here

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
have a look at this command block here

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.770 
have a look at this command block here
we're<00:03:27.040> going<00:03:27.129> to<00:03:27.220> be<00:03:27.340> testing<00:03:27.760> for<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.030> pig<00:03:28.389> that

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
we're going to be testing for a pig that

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.530 
we're going to be testing for a pig that
has<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.349> score<00:03:29.709> test<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.819> minimum<00:03:31.209> of<00:03:31.359> 1

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
has the score test and a minimum of 1

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.059 
has the score test and a minimum of 1
and<00:03:31.810> then<00:03:31.870> this<00:03:32.079> command<00:03:32.409> block<00:03:32.470> on<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:32.829> side

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
and then this command block on this side

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.759 
and then this command block on this side
will<00:03:33.250> give<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.579> pig<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:34.139> value<00:03:35.139> of<00:03:35.260> 1<00:03:35.440> for<00:03:35.470> that

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
will give the pig a value of 1 for that

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.949 
will give the pig a value of 1 for that
school<00:03:36.099> test<00:03:36.430> so<00:03:36.849> let's<00:03:37.060> place<00:03:37.269> down<00:03:37.510> this<00:03:37.690> pig

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
school test so let's place down this pig

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.559 
school test so let's place down this pig
let's<00:03:38.680> give<00:03:38.949> him<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.190> score<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:39.730> then<00:03:40.299> we<00:03:40.419> can

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
let's give him the score and then we can

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.610 
let's give him the score and then we can
check<00:03:40.780> for<00:03:40.930> it<00:03:41.019> with<00:03:41.169> this<00:03:41.260> one<00:03:41.470> here<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:44.470> there

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
check for it with this one here so there

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.930 
check for it with this one here so there
was<00:03:44.739> another<00:03:44.979> change<00:03:45.340> here<00:03:45.639> which<00:03:45.790> is

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
was another change here which is

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.789 
was another change here which is
actually<00:03:46.389> broken<00:03:46.690> in<00:03:47.019> this<00:03:47.169> snapshot<00:03:47.470> and

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
actually broken in this snapshot and

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.349 
actually broken in this snapshot and
it's<00:03:47.919> going<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.099> be<00:03:48.220> patched<00:03:48.519> in<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:48.970> next<00:03:49.209> one

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
it's going to be patched in the next one

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.869 
it's going to be patched in the next one
so<00:03:49.569> in<00:03:49.690> 10<00:03:49.959> B<00:03:50.229> this<00:03:51.040> will<00:03:51.280> work<00:03:51.489> but<00:03:51.729> you<00:03:51.849> can

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
so in 10 B this will work but you can

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.020 
so in 10 B this will work but you can
see<00:03:52.239> he<00:03:52.419> can<00:03:52.629> also<00:03:52.870> use<00:03:53.169> MBT<00:03:53.709> data<00:03:53.949> to<00:03:54.280> target<00:03:54.609> a

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
see he can also use MBT data to target a

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.420 
see he can also use MBT data to target a
specific<00:03:55.629> type<00:03:56.290> of<00:03:56.319> mob<00:03:56.620> so<00:03:56.799> not<00:03:56.919> just<00:03:57.069> a<00:03:57.250> pig

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
specific type of mob so not just a pig

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.580 
specific type of mob so not just a pig
but<00:03:57.609> one<00:03:57.819> that<00:03:57.970> is<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.120> baby<00:03:58.389> and<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:59.169> can<00:03:59.349> also

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
but one that is a baby and you can also

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.530 
but one that is a baby and you can also
use<00:03:59.919> that<00:04:00.099> with<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.280> test<00:04:00.639> for<00:04:00.909> command<00:04:01.329> as

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
use that with the test for command as

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.300 
use that with the test for command as
well<00:04:01.569> and<00:04:01.989> another<00:04:02.620> change<00:04:02.979> that<00:04:03.099> has<00:04:03.280> been

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
well and another change that has been

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.339 
well and another change that has been
made<00:04:03.519> is<00:04:04.000> within<00:04:04.359> vulnerable<00:04:05.049> mobs<00:04:05.229> that

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
made is within vulnerable mobs that

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.830 
made is within vulnerable mobs that
summon<00:04:05.799> in<00:04:05.889> a<00:04:06.069> pig<00:04:06.340> that<00:04:06.370> is<00:04:06.579> invulnerable<00:04:07.359> we

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
summon in a pig that is invulnerable we

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.479 
summon in a pig that is invulnerable we
can<00:04:07.989> actually<00:04:08.139> hit<00:04:08.500> this<00:04:08.620> guy<00:04:08.859> in<00:04:08.889> creative

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
can actually hit this guy in creative

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.819 
can actually hit this guy in creative
mode<00:04:09.519> and<00:04:09.849> this<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.090> change<00:04:10.510> that<00:04:10.629> I'm<00:04:10.900> not

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
mode and this is a change that I'm not

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.800 
mode and this is a change that I'm not
100%<00:04:11.949> sure<00:04:12.669> why<00:04:12.849> they<00:04:13.000> did<00:04:13.030> it<00:04:13.209> but<00:04:13.329> if<00:04:13.510> we<00:04:13.629> go

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
100% sure why they did it but if we go

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.780 
100% sure why they did it but if we go
into<00:04:14.079> game-mode<00:04:14.650> 0<00:04:14.680> before<00:04:15.190> this<00:04:15.400> guy<00:04:15.549> runs

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
into game-mode 0 before this guy runs

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.599 
into game-mode 0 before this guy runs
away<00:04:15.940> you<00:04:16.659> can<00:04:16.810> see<00:04:16.989> we<00:04:17.139> can't<00:04:17.380> hit<00:04:17.500> him<00:04:17.650> but<00:04:18.430> in

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
away you can see we can't hit him but in

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.580 
away you can see we can't hit him but in
creative<00:04:19.209> mode<00:04:19.449> and<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.780> now<00:04:19.900> I'm<00:04:20.049> typing<00:04:20.440> in

the<00:04:20.680> wrong<00:04:20.799> commands<00:04:21.599> we<00:04:22.599> can<00:04:22.630> hit<00:04:23.050> him

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
the wrong commands we can hit him

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.900
