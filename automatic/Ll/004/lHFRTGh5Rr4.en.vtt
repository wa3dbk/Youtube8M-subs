00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.650
 the pine code 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.039
 are three messages encrypted by 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.270
 thomasville that would mark the 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.990
 coordinates of your treasure 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.390
 the first one is the map the second day 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.790
 account of his fortune and in the third 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.900
 are the names of friends with 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.900
 right to treasure 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.020
 Atlantis 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.170
 the lost city of the atlantic 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:10.480
 It seemed to have been found several 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:13.660
 times in greece in bahamas in cuba or 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.400
 even in Japan and was described by 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:21.700
 first time by the Greek philosopher 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:25.000
 platón in the year 360 before Christ 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.899
 the atlantis was a great naval power 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.970
 that one day disappeared under the waters 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.250
 more than ten thousand years ago 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.440
 the funny thing is that it's still a point 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.840
 of debate among archaeologists though 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.840
 without definitive evidence about it 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.800
 the inscription of his guru 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.299
 strange is the message left a 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.100
 monument of the English town of that 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.920
 forsythe in the 18th century 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.990
 it has been speculated on with the legend that 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.869
 would be a clue left by the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.049
 Templars on the whereabouts of the saint 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.049
 grail 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.420
 the symbols of the grunt grunt 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.610
 these wood carvings discovered in 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.790
 Easter Island in the 19th century 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.470
 correspond to a writing system 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.470
 possibly the only structured one of 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.430
 oceania but that is still without 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.430
 decipher 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.909
 effects disk 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.200
 discovered in 1908 by luigi bernier in 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.320
 an excavation of the Minoan palace 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.650
 defects the disc is made of baked clay 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.990
 with inscriptions possibly forms 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.470
 unknown hieroglyphics in both 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.470
 faces 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.950
 stonehenge 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.900
 this prehistoric monument is still 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.540
 one of the greatest mysteries of the 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.569
 archeology 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.359
 It is a ring of megalithic rocks 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:16.120
 built approximately 4000 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:19.120
 years and whose purpose is unknown 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.459
 nobody explains how it was done in this 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.610
 moment and why it was used during 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.370
 almost 500 years 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.190
 many point to the idea of ​​a help 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.880
 extraterrestrial and even a poem from 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.920
 year 1150 names the merlin magician as 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.920
 possible creator of stonehenge 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.510
 the holy sheet ' 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.600
 it is said and assumed that it is the fabric with the 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.450
 that the body of Jesus was wrapped and that 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.970
 in his resurrection his image remained 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.160
 recorded 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.890
 but today the church has not 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.300
 officially stated its acceptance or 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.300
 rejection towards the shroud 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.030
 anticitera mechanism 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.620
 the discovery of the mechanism of 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:17.620
 anticitera was something similar to find 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.169
 a treasure for archaeologists is 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.910
 found in the remains of a ship of 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.620
 Greek charge of two thousand years of 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.750
 antiquity 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.030
 the anti-theft mechanism is a 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.340
 circular artifact of bronze with a 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.510
 maze of gears and engravings of 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.000
 mysterious characters 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.190
 it is believed that at first it was 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.160
 used as a nautical astrolabe 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.650
 although the uses are still being investigated 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.080
 multiple of one of the most sophisticated 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.650
 devices that have been found up 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.650
 the date 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.839
 the nazca lines 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.380
 may the lines born in Peru not 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.450
 be nothing spectacular from the ground 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.870
 but when they were first seen 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.180
 time from the sky in the 1920s 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.699
 they caused a great impact 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.850
 archaeologists say that these huge 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:20.550
 forms were made 2000 years ago by 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.550
 the pre- Inca culture the Nazca 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.729
 in these you can see from lines 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.750
 geometric up representations 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.720
 complex of animals 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.730
 these lines were made by removing the 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.610
 superficial red stones for 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.660
 allow land lines to be seen 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.080
 clearest 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.570
 many people think and support the theory of 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.900
 that those lines were made by the 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.940
 born to be seen by ships 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.160
 space and beings 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.550
 aliens flying to a 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.650
 altitude that even they could not 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.259
 reach with the sight 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.120
 other theories claim that it is very 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:06.460
 likely to have been part of 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.460
 rituals of communication with the gods 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:12.889
 the manuscript of voynich 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.870
 it is believed that the manuscript of voynich 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:21.360
 It is about 500 years old and 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.940
 since it was discovered the linguists 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.070
 they are trying to decipher its content 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.070
 written in code 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.670
 the truth is that you never got 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.660
 translate to any language 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:37.250
 it is believed that the code is unique and 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:40.030
 unintelligible with two languages 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.820
 intertwined seems to have Arab roots 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:46.780
 Latin and Polynesian images of 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:50.240
 book show plants that do not exist 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:53.330
 naked women bathing and structures 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:56.780
 microscopic cell phones and even a 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:59.560
 image is an almost exact mirror drawing 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.560
 of the Milky Way 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:04.460
 thank you very much for watching another video of 

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:07.330
 go through the unknown 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.330
 see you later
