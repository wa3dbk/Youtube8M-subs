but<00:04:07.269> I<00:04:07.299> don't<00:04:07.599> think<00:04:07.870> he<00:04:07.989> can<00:04:08.200> match<00:04:08.379> many<00:04:08.799> not

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
but I don't think he can match many not

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.360 
but I don't think he can match many not
when<00:04:09.730> many<00:04:09.999> is<00:04:10.209> in<00:04:10.359> this<00:04:10.510> kind<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:10.900> shape<00:04:11.370> any

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
when many is in this kind of shape any

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.069 
when many is in this kind of shape any
truth<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.849> what<00:04:12.879> they<00:04:13.180> have<00:04:13.389> been<00:04:13.540> saying<00:04:13.840> that

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
truth to what they have been saying that

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.640 
truth to what they have been saying that
he<00:04:15.069> will<00:04:15.340> go<00:04:15.519> for<00:04:15.700> a<00:04:15.730> knockout<00:04:16.120> early<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:17.620> I

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
he will go for a knockout early that I

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.039 
he will go for a knockout early that I
don't<00:04:17.949> know<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.400> don't<00:04:19.209> know<00:04:19.389> I<00:04:19.479> thought<00:04:19.720> I

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
don't know I don't know I thought I

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.800 
don't know I don't know I thought I
think<00:04:20.739> if<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:20.979> knockout<00:04:21.400> comes<00:04:21.759> early<00:04:22.240> it's

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
think if the knockout comes early it's

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.040 
think if the knockout comes early it's
that<00:04:23.199> but<00:04:23.860> it's<00:04:24.009> like<00:04:24.250> baseball<00:04:25.000> you<00:04:25.330> know<00:04:25.780> if

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
that but it's like baseball you know if

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.969 
that but it's like baseball you know if
you<00:04:26.169> go<00:04:26.380> up<00:04:26.590> trying<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.639> hit<00:04:27.820> a<00:04:27.849> home<00:04:28.150> run
