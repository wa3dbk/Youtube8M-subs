00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.289
 welcome guys in this new video 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.140
 i am xf and today have escaped to online 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.910
 today I am pleased to announce that I have 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.390
 bought more lacquer to get an idea 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.490
 that a cap happens 2 and it came to me like 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.760
 you can see the graphics has improved 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.660
 clearly you and if you commented and 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.110
 you eh but the tactic sucks xdxd 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.190
 because the graphics are just fine now 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.339
 then improved graphics 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.920
 so it means more videos i hope 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:52.629
 at least and with superior quality well now 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.510
 in addition to announcing you that you deserve treats 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.909
 of war with leo massacred small 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.729
 coloring for the car jester but for 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.830
 any other car though if I have to say 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.440
 mine on this car is really good 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.270
 you need this correlation well 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.720
 just go inside I feel it 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.850
 burglary then oh well but forget how 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.619
 you want the aesthetics of the car vi 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.159
 I advise you not to put things in 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.799
 carbon 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.350
 because otherwise it would be worse and then the 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:25.030
 tour complaint and metallics on that 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.679
 main and put the fire red well 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.170
 once you have set the fire red 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.600
 must keep pearlescent and you must 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.890
 put the yellow once you have me 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.409
 I recommend you go there 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.200
 secondary colors and put as a value 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.090
 secondary graphite a is also true 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.729
 just that graphite makes a shine in 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.859
 the more I don't say it well a car you have 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.259
 put the speed 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:48.759
 also put the error youness lello the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.179
 tunnel but you can also put any 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.609
 other wheel and then now accessories of the 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:58.659
 wheels and put both the colors yellow and 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:00.670
 then put as a skid color a 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.159
 yellow pencil 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.450
 and so it will be really good pica self 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.340
 you can see that the light will have one 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.950
 beautiful shine at least for mine 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.500
 cus is therefore dependent on various courses 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.080
 it depends blessed this video leaves a 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.420
 nice video you sit unraveling with 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.040
 the digital lines passed from the first 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.920
 facebook page the link description 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.600
 left to placate the video is a comment 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.460
 also to stay up to date and the work 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.920

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.530
 I liked and we look to the next 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.390
