as far as the different ultras available
from<00:00:21.720> EVGA<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> fastest<00:00:23.460> I've<00:00:23.609> seen

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
from EVGA this is the fastest I've seen

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.700 
from EVGA this is the fastest I've seen
aside<00:00:24.240> from<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> black<00:00:25.170> pearl

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
aside from the black pearl

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.519 
aside from the black pearl
this<00:00:25.980> one<00:00:26.130> will<00:00:26.250> push<00:00:26.490> 108<00:00:27.480> gigabytes<00:00:28.410> per

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
this one will push 108 gigabytes per

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.140 
this one will push 108 gigabytes per
second<00:00:28.949> now<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.070> black<00:00:29.279> pearl<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.910> little

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
second now the black pearl is a little

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.980 
second now the black pearl is a little
different<00:00:30.390> when<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.599> got<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> water

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
different when it's got the water

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.020 
different when it's got the water
cooling<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.949> one<00:00:32.099> pushes<00:00:32.399> about<00:00:32.550> 109

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
cooling that one pushes about 109

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.880 
cooling that one pushes about 109
gigabytes<00:00:33.480> per<00:00:33.540> second<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.739> like

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
gigabytes per second but it's like

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.799 
gigabytes per second but it's like
$1,000<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.850> something<00:00:36.420> some<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> guys

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
$1,000 it's something some of the guys

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.090 
$1,000 it's something some of the guys
are<00:00:36.989> doing<00:00:37.050> water<00:00:37.290> cooling<00:00:37.530> they<00:00:37.710> are<00:00:37.829> picking

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
are doing water cooling they are picking

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.010 
are doing water cooling they are picking
that<00:00:38.129> one<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.760> one<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> really

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
that one up but this one is a really

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.389 
that one up but this one is a really
good<00:00:40.230> option<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.040> fastest

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
good option as it's one of the fastest

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.600 
good option as it's one of the fastest
I've<00:00:41.520> ever<00:00:41.550> seen<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:43.160> barely<00:00:44.160> barely

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
I've ever seen and it's barely barely

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.010 
I've ever seen and it's barely barely
slower<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.210> almost<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> same<00:00:45.600> speed<00:00:45.870> as<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
slower it's almost the same speed as the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.830 
slower it's almost the same speed as the
black<00:00:46.260> pearl<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.649> thing<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.370> sane<00:00:48.059> let's

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
black pearl this thing is in sane let's

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.330 
black pearl this thing is in sane let's
talk<00:00:48.960> about<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.440> tech<00:00:49.590> specs<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.129> one

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
talk about the tech specs on this one

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.560 
talk about the tech specs on this one
now<00:00:50.430> you've<00:00:50.610> got<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> six<00:00:50.969> hundred<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.329> thirty

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
now you've got a six hundred and thirty

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.740 
now you've got a six hundred and thirty
six<00:00:51.780> megahertz<00:00:52.110> core<00:00:52.469> clock<00:00:52.739> its

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
six megahertz core clock its

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.799 
six megahertz core clock its
384<00:00:54.750> bit<00:00:55.199> memory<00:00:55.500> interface<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.430> got

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
384 bit memory interface and it's got

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.830

128<00:01:40.259> stream<00:01:40.799> processors<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.549> what<00:01:41.729> are<00:01:41.820> those

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
128 stream processors now what are those

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.639 
128 stream processors now what are those
I'm<00:01:42.750> sure<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> lot<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.350> guys<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.590> been

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
I'm sure a lot of you guys have been

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.660 
I'm sure a lot of you guys have been
looking<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:43.950> forms<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.280> know<00:01:44.369> what<00:01:44.490> they<00:01:44.549> are

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
looking on forms you know what they are

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.920 
looking on forms you know what they are
but<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.939> don't<00:01:45.119> know<00:01:45.270> here's<00:01:45.720> what<00:01:45.840> they

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
but if you don't know here's what they

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.480 
but if you don't know here's what they
do<00:01:46.049> with<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> older<00:01:46.680> architectures<00:01:47.369> in

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
do with the older architectures in

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.069 
do with the older architectures in
DirectX<00:01:47.880> 9<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.270> sort<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.509> thing<00:01:48.659> those

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
DirectX 9 and that sort of thing those

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.450 
DirectX 9 and that sort of thing those
different<00:01:49.470> processes<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:49.920> physics<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
different processes for physics a

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.770 
different processes for physics a
different<00:01:50.729> one<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:50.850> particle<00:01:51.570> effects

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
different one for particle effects

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.300 
different one for particle effects
different<00:01:52.049> one<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.380> lighting<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:53.189> the

different one for lighting of the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.160 
different one for lighting of the
different<00:01:53.579> processors<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.149> each<00:01:54.270> thing<00:01:54.540> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
different processors for each thing so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.810 
different processors for each thing so
on<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> screen<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:56.040> there<00:01:56.159> was<00:01:56.250> more<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.790> know

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
on the screen if there was more you know

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.090 
on the screen if there was more you know
physics<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:58.439> maybe<00:01:58.680> some<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.009> your

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
physics going on then maybe some of your

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.469 
physics going on then maybe some of your
lighting<00:01:59.310> processors<00:01:59.880> we're<00:02:00.030> not<00:02:00.180> getting

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
lighting processors we're not getting

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.120 
lighting processors we're not getting
used<00:02:00.719> or<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.320> there<00:02:01.469> were<00:02:01.560> more<00:02:01.710> particle

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
used or if there were more particle

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.590 
used or if there were more particle
effects<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.640> well<00:02:03.030> maybe<00:02:03.210> some<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.509> your

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
effects going on well maybe some of your

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.700 
effects going on well maybe some of your
other<00:02:03.719> processors<00:02:04.229> weren't<00:02:04.380> getting<00:02:04.590> use

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
other processors weren't getting use

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.499 
other processors weren't getting use
these<00:02:05.009> stream<00:02:05.310> processors<00:02:05.820> they<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.390> be

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
these stream processors they can be

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.570 
these stream processors they can be
allocated<00:02:06.719> for<00:02:07.290> any<00:02:07.500> task<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.220> if<00:02:08.280> there's<00:02:08.429> all

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
allocated for any task so if there's all

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.639 
allocated for any task so if there's all
kinds<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.119> physics<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.810> you're<00:02:10.560> going

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
kinds of physics going on you're going

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.020 
kinds of physics going on you're going
to<00:02:10.709> be<00:02:10.830> using<00:02:11.099> more<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> processes<00:02:11.879> for

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
to be using more of the processes for

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.610 
to be using more of the processes for
that<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.330> you're<00:02:12.450> not<00:02:12.480> going<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.780> be<00:02:12.900> waste

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
that and you're not going to be waste

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.320 
that and you're not going to be waste
processor<00:02:14.459> so<00:02:14.640> you're<00:02:14.730> going<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:14.909> get<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> jump

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
processor so you're going to get a jump

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.570 
processor so you're going to get a jump
in<00:02:15.420> performance<00:02:15.540> there<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.319> when<00:02:17.069> DirectX<00:02:17.459> 10

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
in performance there and when DirectX 10

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.979 
in performance there and when DirectX 10
comes<00:02:17.819> out<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.090> thing<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.299> going<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.599> even

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
comes out this thing is going to be even

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.740 
comes out this thing is going to be even
faster<00:02:19.200> because<00:02:19.620> DirectX<00:02:20.040> 10<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.750> optimized

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
faster because DirectX 10 is optimized

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.690 
faster because DirectX 10 is optimized
for<00:02:21.989> games<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.680> optimized<00:02:23.129> to<00:02:23.370> make<00:02:23.489> these

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
for games and optimized to make these

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.580 
for games and optimized to make these
things<00:02:23.970> run<00:02:24.209> more<00:02:24.599> efficiently<00:02:25.080> with<00:02:25.560> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
things run more efficiently with the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.619 
things run more efficiently with the
games<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.340> like<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.700> said<00:02:26.879> you<00:02:27.060> guys<00:02:27.269> know<00:02:27.480> this

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
games so like I said you guys know this

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.020 
games so like I said you guys know this
is<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> monster<00:02:28.170> it's<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.680> 1800<00:02:29.129> ultra<00:02:29.489> now<00:02:30.000> I

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
is a monster it's the 1800 ultra now I

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.670 
is a monster it's the 1800 ultra now I
get<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.480> lot<00:02:30.599> of<00:02:30.690> emails<00:02:30.989> about<00:02:31.170> guys<00:02:31.409> that<00:02:31.590> are

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
get a lot of emails about guys that are

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.140 
get a lot of emails about guys that are
asking<00:02:31.890> about<00:02:32.129> physics<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.879> sort<00:02:33.120> of

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
asking about physics and that sort of

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.470 
asking about physics and that sort of
thing

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
thing

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.449 
thing
this<00:02:33.840> has<00:02:34.049> quantum<00:02:34.500> physics<00:02:34.829> built<00:02:35.159> right

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
this has quantum physics built right

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.770 
this has quantum physics built right
into<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.819> card<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.299> you're<00:02:36.420> going<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.569> be<00:02:36.690> able

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
into the card so you're going to be able

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.539 
into the card so you're going to be able
to<00:02:36.930> do<00:02:37.019> complex<00:02:37.590> computations<00:02:37.739> is<00:02:38.370> going<00:02:38.489> to

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
to do complex computations is going to

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.339 
to do complex computations is going to
remove<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:39.000> stress<00:02:39.209> from<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.569> processor<00:02:40.110> and

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
remove the stress from the processor and

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.080 
remove the stress from the processor and
put<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.769> right<00:02:40.890> here<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.129> this<00:02:41.430> monster<00:02:41.700> so

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
put it right here on this monster so

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.490 
put it right here on this monster so
that<00:02:42.299> you<00:02:42.390> know<00:02:42.510> when<00:02:43.019> you're<00:02:43.140> running<00:02:43.230> games

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
that you know when you're running games

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.960 
that you know when you're running games
a<00:02:43.620> lot<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.829> physics<00:02:44.129> it's<00:02:44.459> not<00:02:44.610> going<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.790> slow

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
a lot of physics it's not going to slow

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.460 
a lot of physics it's not going to slow
down<00:02:45.120> let<00:02:45.569> me<00:02:45.629> show<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.930> ins<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.140> outs<00:02:46.319> on
