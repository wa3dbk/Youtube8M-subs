we<00:00:27.869> need<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> learn<00:00:28.260> how<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.590> do<00:00:28.890> more<00:00:29.189> with

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
we need to learn how to do more with

we need to learn how to do more with
less<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:30.470> started<00:00:31.470> working<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.219> energy

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
less I started working in the energy

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.310 
less I started working in the energy
sector<00:00:32.610> 2000<00:00:33.210> I'd<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.510> was<00:00:33.630> about<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> same

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
sector 2000 I'd it was about the same

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.260 
sector 2000 I'd it was about the same
time<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> province<00:00:35.640> started<00:00:35.969> making

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
time that the province started making

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.030 
time that the province started making
really<00:00:36.510> strong<00:00:36.840> commitment<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.410> introducing

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
really strong commitment to introducing

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.950 
really strong commitment to introducing
we're<00:00:38.160> gonna<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.610> together<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:39.180> was<00:00:39.690> working

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
we're gonna do together I was working

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.200 
we're gonna do together I was working
for<00:00:39.989> association<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.730> was<00:00:41.910> right<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
for association that was right in the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.000 
for association that was right in the
forefront<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> policy<00:00:43.020> development<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.620> I

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
forefront of the policy development so I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.889 
forefront of the policy development so I
got<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> front-row<00:00:45.180> seat<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:45.809> was

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
got a front-row seat to what was

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.360 
got a front-row seat to what was
happening<00:00:45.989> industry<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.620> fantastic<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.309> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
happening industry is fantastic and I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.950 
happening industry is fantastic and I
started<00:00:47.610> focusing<00:00:47.879> my<00:00:48.180> work<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.539> conservation

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
started focusing my work on conservation

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.110 
started focusing my work on conservation
because<00:00:49.160> I've<00:00:50.160> recognized<00:00:50.610> there<00:00:50.820> were<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> lot

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
because I've recognized there were a lot

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.369 
because I've recognized there were a lot
of<00:00:51.149> gas<00:00:51.420> at<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.690> market<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.079> were<00:00:52.199> fake

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
of gas at the market that were fake

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.799 
of gas at the market that were fake
service<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.489> now<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.879> energy<00:00:54.149> prices<00:00:54.510> are

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
service so now as energy prices are

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.200 
service so now as energy prices are
projected<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.350> continue<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:56.010> rise<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:57.030> are

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
projected to continue to rise we are

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.520 
projected to continue to rise we are
seeing<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.510> lot<00:00:57.750> more<00:00:57.780> attention<00:00:58.050> being<00:00:58.350> paid

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
seeing a lot more attention being paid

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.830 
seeing a lot more attention being paid
to<00:00:58.680> conserving<00:00:59.129> energy<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.850> people<00:01:00.719> are

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
to conserving energy and people are

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.240 
to conserving energy and people are
really<00:01:01.170> starting<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.739> feel<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> pain<00:01:02.190> on

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
really starting to feel the pain on

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.750 
really starting to feel the pain on
their<00:01:02.489> energy<00:01:02.609> bills<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.100> there's<00:01:05.369> there's<00:01:05.549> no

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
their energy bills so there's there's no

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.880 
their energy bills so there's there's no
other<00:01:05.970> way<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.840> price<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.110> electricity

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
other way for the price of electricity

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.390 
other way for the price of electricity
you're<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.270> go<00:01:09.420> other<00:01:09.720> than

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
the key net will be on the conservation

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.130 
the key net will be on the conservation

million households to getting

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.100 
million households to getting
conflicting<00:01:38.320> information<00:01:39.330> it's<00:01:40.330> really<00:01:40.720> hard

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
conflicting information it's really hard

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.260 
conflicting information it's really hard
to<00:01:41.380> reach<00:01:41.560> them<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:41.980> pan<00:01:42.160> so<00:01:42.460> that's<00:01:42.640> what<00:01:42.880> but

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
to reach them the pan so that's what but

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.300 
to reach them the pan so that's what but
but<00:01:43.480> ultimately<00:01:44.320> I<00:01:44.620> think<00:01:44.800> they're<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.220> most

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
but ultimately I think they're the most

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.820 
but ultimately I think they're the most
important<00:01:45.910> sector<00:01:46.270> getting<00:01:47.200> people<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.620> ask

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
important sector getting people to ask
