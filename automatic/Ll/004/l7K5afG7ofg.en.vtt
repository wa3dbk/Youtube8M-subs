00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:11.100
 let's make a strawberry, that is, make 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:15.020
 of company cannon and we're also going to see 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.020
 the list of materials does not 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.520
 paper mill we need cardboard 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.849
 color red cardboard green color two 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.119
 buttons x strawberry red green thread 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:34.100
 green hemp or red color thin ribbon 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.559
 green chocolate a scissors for 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.530
 cut cereal carton detail for 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.170
 trace the mold 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.480
 we are ready to start with the 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.789
 strawberry and this is basically all the 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.160
 secret the mold is the mold that goes to 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.589
 be the body of the strawberry and that the 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.329
 let's put on facebook and if they want 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.640
 inspire us an email we send them 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.519
 return is very simple to make are 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.339
 as if it were a flower they are petals 4 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.870
 you must carry 4 and here a little bit leave 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.350
 just the bending 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.570
 check nothing else this you can trace to 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.840
 same as the top that would be 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.360
 what is this military man that is that mold what 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.670
 we draw it in either cardboard 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.259
 some cereal box or the one that we have 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.060
 at home and we're going to double each 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.980
 it would also be exactly the shape of a 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.460
 half heart 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.530
 exact if we can see them but look is a 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.320
 heart and is bent in half 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.049
 if we do them together it would be what we 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.490
 would form a heart is very easy if yes 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.009
 You do not want to get into internet will 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.420
 you and apart the tip is because 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.580
 we did the design what we can do 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.330
 is to go to the stationery and not take out 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.700
 extensions 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.110
 then as they bleed behind the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.330
 company and nothing else we are cutting 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.090
 the important thing is to leave this little eyelash 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.930
 that will be what you give us at the time of 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.670
 paste the certain thing is that it forms that cavity 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.350
 that's where we're going to put the candy and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.810
 now we will show you that we can 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.850
 make different sizes and this is 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.740
 very simple with a little pencil 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.440
 adhesive with a little bit of pencils 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.030
 adhesive or cold silicone out there what 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.750
 you have a much better adhesive pencil 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.810
 because it's instantaneous here is 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.460
 practically 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.980
 fair 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.569
 Look, I'm going to introduce you to a t-shirt 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:30.799
 now it's just wing law is incredible the 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.799
 truth is that it is our 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.310
 I envy many is that Monday is my 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.049
 friend 8 creative if it's all yours I swim 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.250
 more I share with him this space 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.250
 exact creative 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.270
 or no longer but hey he 's doing 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:03:00.490
 It is important that we buy things done 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:01.780
 in Mexico and he is father then we are going to 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.690
 Bend 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.690
 and what we will be just this 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.250
 is the top we are going to make a 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.730
 small hole with either a 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.890
 I know that it is already and is 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.280
 marked or otherwise they will welcome you for a 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.170
 feather with a brace we take those 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.760
 edges and what we are going to do is 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.310
 close it and to close it this this 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.180
 Cord cited that we have let's put him 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.230
 a button that is what will hold the 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.720
 extremes 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.400
 I'm looking for the exact one that we're the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.260
 button and that's going to be inside 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.540
 then we paste and we are closing it 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.260
 basically this is to form as if it were 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.400
 a hammer 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.560
 we are going to give him what happened on the one hand 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.269
 in front 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.310
 and this is what it is for just that 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.920
 we have these two net of chocolate that 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.099
 let's put it here before and you passed it 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.739
 on two sides flag then it will come out and 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.400
 here are a little chocolate misfortunes 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.890
 and we're going to pass it twice and then it happened 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.610
 the eyes just one of the pretty ones do 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.610
 the 222 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.340
 we can pass it inside the third 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.860
 to end also spiritually 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.310
 inside 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.720
 today it is very easy the part I imagine 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.750
 that if the purchases should be used 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.260
 then better and check how it is what 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.860
 must be left we have a small fight 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.860
 over here 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:56.480
 baby did and put her in the part 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:59.060
 superior produced principal and at the end 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.890
 What we can do is leave each 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.850
 side to not pass me you have to bend 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.980
 before 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.930
 you know there's not much bending towards 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.930
 down so it does not cost work 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.120
 and here 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.350
 I put green first when coming back from 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:21.969
 first to green 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:26.399
 ok are you with me with the law 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:26.399
 this moment and it is just the one that is going 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.439
 if suddenly the gas thread started to 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.599
 be like more disheveled clipping not for 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:38.300
 that in what it costs work is the pencil 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:42.020
 adhesive is not grasping he gave 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:46.729
 resort to either paper or receipts is 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.849
 better for a purpose is one with one of 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.849
 they 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.979
 you have to be I'm going to be bigger 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:06:00.110
 hole since it does not enter then they carry 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.849
 here is this normal family drill 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.250
 and is I want to show you that too 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:08.000
 we can make macro strawberries and can 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.710
 be nothing else and it's like a 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.160
 kind of clear chastity is going to come out 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.160
 more expensive because stuffing of this one 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.970
 we must have the basket that 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.659
 We did on Friday for when it ends 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.819
 tape where is the lost can be 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.800
 put on the serious tv page and there you 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:31.310
 click on videos and there we put those 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.229
 strawberries with chocolate and then in the 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.740
 photo creative spaces and they leave all 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:39.139
 the projects from the first to the 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.389
 last and this one since last week like this 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.539
 look for what is made with pure 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.539
 paper 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.850
 Many greetings for certain hotel is the 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.460
 more Latin that tune us in and we 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:56.490
 they send real greetings after they see us 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:59.550
 in places where we would not believe anymore 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.260
 better also on youtube and we like it 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.600

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:31.190
 beautiful 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:32.990
 what else I missed is this already with that 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:36.400
 we go to step by step in case 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.400
 they lost details we returned 

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.330
 way of processing in the cardboard brand 

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.790
 the mold of professing the size that 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.830
 decide just like the leaves decal the 

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.080
 mold on the red paper the strawberry and on the 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.270
 green leaves cut mold and weapon 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.820
 the green ribbon passes it through a button 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:55.100
 Slim loves the button inside the 

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:58.120
 strawberry and closes the decora with stamps or 

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.120
 slats to finish 

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:04.120
 and they thought they check how pretty it looks 

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.910
 a detail is very beautiful to whom 

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.380
 they will be more than satisfied 

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.240
 moment to go to give a cut and now 

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.640
