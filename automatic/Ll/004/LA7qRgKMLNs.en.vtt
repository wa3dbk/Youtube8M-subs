very nice and I don't know was kind of
the<00:00:43.590> thought<00:00:43.739> process<00:00:44.129> behind<00:00:44.250> making<00:00:44.550> this

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the thought process behind making this

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.910 
the thought process behind making this

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
don't need was to be a great player so

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.289 
don't need was to be a great player so
now<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.390> what<00:01:25.110> seems<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:26.009> hooker

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
now we have what seems to be a hooker

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.940 
now we have what seems to be a hooker
they<00:01:27.299> went<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.689> such<00:01:27.900> great<00:01:27.930> detail<00:01:28.560> as<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
they went to such great detail as to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.550 
they went to such great detail as to
change<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.610> hair<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.810> kind<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
change the hair to be kind of like the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.039 
change the hair to be kind of like the
light<00:01:31.950> purple<00:01:32.460> walls<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.869> look<00:01:34.020> very

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
light purple walls and if you look very

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.520 
light purple walls and if you look very
closely<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.369> don't<00:01:36.329> quite<00:01:36.810> think<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
closely I don't quite think it's a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.590 
closely I don't quite think it's a
coincidence<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.460> where<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> nipple<00:01:39.479> is

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
coincidence that where the nipple is

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.590 
coincidence that where the nipple is
there's<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.740> hardest<00:01:41.400> wall<00:01:41.759> there<00:01:42.299> at<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
there's the hardest wall there at the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.770 
there's the hardest wall there at the
base<00:01:43.610> coincidence<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.880> think<00:01:45.720> not<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> next<00:01:48.509> we

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
base coincidence I think not so next we

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.929 
base coincidence I think not so next we
have

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
have

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.600 
have
the<00:01:51.009> definitive<00:01:52.149> coolest<00:01:53.149> bass<00:01:53.600> ever

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
the definitive coolest bass ever

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.529 
the definitive coolest bass ever
argument<00:01:56.170> over<00:01:57.640> so<00:01:58.640> here<00:01:58.850> we<00:01:58.939> have<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.090> Mario

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
argument over so here we have a Mario

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.029 
argument over so here we have a Mario
that's<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.930> punching<00:02:00.380> up<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.649> hitting<00:02:00.890> a

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
that's a punching up and hitting a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.340 
that's a punching up and hitting a
mystery<00:02:01.579> block<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:02.119> like<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:03.079> one<00:02:03.200> thing

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
down like little debris and they even

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.180
