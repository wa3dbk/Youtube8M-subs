while back where he was trying to figure
out<00:03:41.680> a<00:03:41.709> math<00:03:41.950> problem<00:03:42.220> some<00:03:43.830> algebra<00:03:44.830> or

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
out a math problem some algebra or

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.190 
out a math problem some algebra or
something<00:03:45.280> right<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:46.180> he's<00:03:46.660> trying<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.050> get<00:03:47.140> a

something right and he's trying to get a

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.170 
something right and he's trying to get a
number<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:47.860> explained<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.640> I'm<00:03:48.730> trying

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
number and I explained it and I'm trying

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.210 
number and I explained it and I'm trying
to<00:03:49.300> help<00:03:49.420> him<00:03:49.599> work<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.050> I<00:03:50.140> suck<00:03:50.410> at<00:03:50.560> math<00:03:50.709> and

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
to help him work and I suck at math and

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.920 
to help him work and I suck at math and
so<00:03:51.519> I'm<00:03:52.060> talking<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.360> you<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.540> I'm<00:03:52.599> like<00:03:52.750> he

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
said I said well how do you do this

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.800 
said I said well how do you do this
problem<00:03:54.519> he<00:03:54.670> goes<00:03:54.819> will<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.030> take<00:03:55.269> this<00:03:55.420> times

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
problem he goes will you take this times

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.229 
problem he goes will you take this times
this<00:03:56.050> this<00:03:56.349> number<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:57.400> then<00:03:57.610> this<00:03:57.790> divided

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
this this number and then this divided

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.340 
this this number and then this divided
by<00:03:58.269> this<00:03:58.390> number<00:03:58.510> or<00:03:58.870> something<00:03:59.140> something

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
by this number or something something

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.840 
by this number or something something
like<00:03:59.470> that<00:03:59.739> and<00:04:00.130> then<00:04:00.250> get<00:04:00.400> your<00:04:00.549> answer<00:04:00.790> I

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
like that and then get your answer I

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.400 
like that and then get your answer I
said<00:04:01.000> oh<00:04:01.090> well<00:04:01.360> how<00:04:01.450> does<00:04:01.510> that<00:04:01.600> work<00:04:01.750> because

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
said oh well how does that work because

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.530 
said oh well how does that work because
I'm<00:04:02.560> genuinely<00:04:02.860> curious<00:04:03.370> how<00:04:04.000> does<00:04:04.209> how<00:04:04.480> does

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
I'm genuinely curious how does how does

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.170 
I'm genuinely curious how does how does
doing<00:04:04.870> that<00:04:05.250> equates<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.459> answer

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
doing that equates it answer

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.789 
doing that equates it answer
and<00:04:07.780> he<00:04:07.870> goes<00:04:07.989> a<00:04:08.019> lot<00:04:08.170> of<00:04:08.319> notice<00:04:08.560> with<00:04:08.739> the

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
and he goes a lot of notice with the

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.770 
and he goes a lot of notice with the
teacher<00:04:09.010> tools<00:04:09.220> to<00:04:09.430> do<00:04:09.549> at<00:04:10.269> least<00:04:10.330> you<00:04:10.600> don't

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
teacher tools to do at least you don't

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.440 
teacher tools to do at least you don't
understand<00:04:11.319> your<00:04:11.980> equation<00:04:12.580> you<00:04:13.030> just<00:04:13.269> know

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
understand your equation you just know

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.390 
understand your equation you just know
that<00:04:13.480> if<00:04:13.959> you're<00:04:14.110> faced<00:04:14.349> with<00:04:14.380> this<00:04:15.069> kind<00:04:15.370> of

that if you're faced with this kind of

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.210 
that if you're faced with this kind of
problem

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.090 

I<00:04:18.250> think<00:04:19.200> you<00:04:20.200> need<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.440> understand<00:04:20.950> what

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
I think you need to understand what

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.200 
I think you need to understand what
you're<00:04:21.280> doing<00:04:21.310> is<00:04:21.670> that<00:04:21.760> you<00:04:21.880> need<00:04:22.000> to<00:04:22.090> learn

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
you're doing is that you need to learn

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.760 
you're doing is that you need to learn
how<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.450> problem-solve<00:04:23.080> on<00:04:23.290> your<00:04:23.410> own<00:04:23.560> not

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
how to problem-solve on your own not

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.380 
how to problem-solve on your own not
just<00:04:23.800> follow<00:04:24.130> directions<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.760> this<00:04:25.150> is<00:04:25.270> my
