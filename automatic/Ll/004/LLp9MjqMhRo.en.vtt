00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.469 

turning<00:01:23.770> so<00:01:23.950> you<00:01:24.069> can<00:01:24.250> see<00:01:24.460> him<00:01:27.299> hurt<00:01:28.299> these

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
turning so you can see him hurt these

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.080 
turning so you can see him hurt these
angles<00:01:28.929> a<00:01:29.020> little<00:01:29.259> bit<00:01:29.380> better<00:01:29.819> let<00:01:30.819> me<00:01:30.850> know

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
angles a little bit better let me know

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.620 
angles a little bit better let me know
what<00:01:31.209> you<00:01:31.330> think<00:01:33.060> there<00:01:34.060> is<00:01:34.149> a<00:01:34.179> slight<00:01:34.450> risk

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
what you think there is a slight risk

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.969 
what you think there is a slight risk
that<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:34.990> camera<00:01:35.259> might<00:01:35.440> fall<00:01:35.619> in<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.799> bath

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
that the camera might fall in the bath

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.100 
that the camera might fall in the bath
but<00:01:36.009> let's<00:01:36.459> just<00:01:36.640> hope<00:01:36.819> that<00:01:37.000> doesn't<00:01:37.270> happen

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.249 

that<00:01:41.110> little<00:01:41.410> boy<00:01:41.619> ba<00:01:41.890> ba<00:01:42.099> yeah<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:44.020> we'll<00:01:44.140> do
