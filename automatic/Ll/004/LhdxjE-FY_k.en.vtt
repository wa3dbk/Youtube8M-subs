 eduardo calviÃ±o the same school the 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.369
 microphone

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.450
 I'm going to do all the flaws 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.490

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.380
 everyone 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.380
 how will I be all the flaws 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:02:05.840
 by the way the students you have to 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:05.840
 be the worst that now 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.680
 anabella machine and eduardo that the wine 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.680
 from the same school the big tree in a 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.019
 forest there was a great tree a magnificent 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.959
 tree that was the admiration of all 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.480
 who saw him in his shadow sat 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.420
 rest the walkers and their branches 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.150
 the birds built their nests but a 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.730
 day the branches said they tell you what 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.739
 important that we are we cause admiration 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.599
 of all those who see us and the birds 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.000
 They are very happy to live between 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.549
 we also what color so 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.799
 wonderful have our leaves that 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.040
 we have to do with this 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.200
 grotesque dirty so ugly and horrible trunk 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.450
 and the less so with those borrowers 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.250
 roots that his only ambition is to grow 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.670
 to the oblivion of the grave that the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.180
 land and decided from that day to live 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.840
 alone without anyone's need 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.200
 the trunk said it would be from the tree without 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.109
 I am the one who supports the branches and I give 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.260
 vigor to the whole tree if I were not 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.709
 here the branches would not have foundation my 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.329
 sap that gave them color and life I am 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.939
 certainly the most important 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.370
 I am the strength and support of all this 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:34.700
 tree without me nothing would be harmonious and 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.130
 firm and decided from that day to live 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.440
 just for him without considering anyone 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.650
 the kucich roots were among themselves 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.140
 telling themselves self-important yes that 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.390
 we are important the tree could not 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.860
 subsist without us that we absorb from 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.020
 the earth the substance with which 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.290
 we produce the food that sustains the 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.780
 trunk and the leaves I am life by 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.240
 itself that's why we do not have to 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.550
 depend on that unfriendly trunk and 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.090
 fat that only consumes our work 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.150
 immense and with those cocky branches from 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.340
 today we will eat between us and 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.200
 we will not give our sap to anyone 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.320
 and so they did 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.810
 the big tree started drying 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.930
 leaves died of one and fell to the floor 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.180
 where the trunk was not remembered 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.760
 he ran out of a drop of sap and dried 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.820
 losing their vigor and strength the 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.830
 roots were sadder than ever the 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.260
 birds left the tree leaving 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.130
 only corpses from their nests and climbing 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.770
 to the tree in an almost sepulchral silence to 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.889
 his shadow no one sat down and the worst 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.470
 that the whole forest was sad because 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:51.100
 the big tree was dying full of 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.770
 resentment and selfishness but little by little 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.900
 roots the trunk and branches began 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.470
 to realize that they could not live 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.260
 separated that selfishness kills and does not leave 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.969
 grow by taking away the best we can 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.039
 provide the others ourselves 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:11.039
 you will run the importance of being a 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.929
 tree and that each one of us is worth 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.069
 little if it is not integrated into a set 

00:05:12.929 --> 00:05:16.559
 or community 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.329
 little by little they let the roots run 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:21.179
 freely the sap because the big 

00:05:18.329 --> 00:05:23.039
 things always start from below and it 

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:25.829
 They worried about getting to everything 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:28.919
 corner of the tree life and strength and 

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:30.629
 the trunk struggled to grow strong and 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.389
 affirm to do the support of 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:35.819
 huge branches that gave color and 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.610
 shadow the tired of walking in the 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:41.459
 scorching sun study the birds 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.909
 they returned to nest in their cup and everything was 

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:47.489
 better than before because now they knew 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:50.339
 as they were belonged by others and the 

00:05:47.489 --> 00:05:53.179
 forest was life and there was hustle and aroma 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:53.179
 of life growing 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.610
 as a teacher 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.550
 yes I am also tonight not 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:06.470
 I would like to work with this student not 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.740
 he wants that not the truth that is not good 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:14.370
 partner'm not going to look for point 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.680
 not have 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.930
 you have very nice nuances in April before 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.240
 but he stole the ones that I wanted but that 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.389
 speak from good to the ball anabella 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.699
 how to say that they steal you or matrix 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:29.870
 we are partners like my next 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.870
 bright but not boludo 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:39.349
 and that's how important we are not no 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:39.349
 do not 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.659
 our operator 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:07:01.530
 look at the reading of texts you know what 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:03.289
 happens to see is that you are not surprised 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.469
 words 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:10.110
 the words not exactly then 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:12.210
 but it's also a problem and ap is not 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.680
 all life in life is a problem 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:21.500
 babe tell you more about life when 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.500
 we asked 25 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.540
 clear our excessive existence the 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.790
 excessive demand the anxiety of 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.710
 clog sure to get better and because 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.020
 it did not work out better, it did not work out 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.220
 direct the next but well yes I know 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:41.220
 what to do I have no problem 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:42.720
 of number but it was good we will go where 

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:47.180
 we keep material because I do not want 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.180
 no no 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.410
