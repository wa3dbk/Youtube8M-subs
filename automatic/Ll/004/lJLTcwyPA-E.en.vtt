00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.680
 Easy tricks to delineate the eye 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.300
 for the few remaining outlined in 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.280
 dropped let's draw a line 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.800
 imaginary until the end of the eyebrow 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.900
 we can use a brush a pencil or what 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.970
 that you have at home to guide you 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.950
 we have to place it flush with the 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.170
 eyelashes until the end of the eyebrow to 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.490
 know where the eyeliner goes in the 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.039
 first option we will use a 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.500
 corrector a white pencil or pen 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.309
 light color we take a piece of paper 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.410
 or napkin the bend the 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.620
 place as I have explained before and 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.930
 we make the guide with the white pencil 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.710
 and think that you can do the same with 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.500
 a concealer or highlighter 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.719
 now let's delineate flush of tabs 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.829
 filling all the holes and giving him the 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.829
 thickness we want 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.100
 we lengthen the outline following the guide 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.100
 and we are joining it up 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.130
 we delineate the lower eyelid flush 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.900
 eyelashes to the middle of the eye or up 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.900
 the tear we unite 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.590
 we blur the guide 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.590
 and ready that easy 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.050
 Y 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.710
 in the second option we will begin 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:31.750
 drawing a line flush with eyelashes 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.750
 fill all the holes 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.140
 and now we can use adhesive tape 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.260
 paper or tape 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.880
 We place it as a flush eye guide 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.880
 until the end of the eyebrow 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.230
 we paste it well and now we lengthen the 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.420
 delineated 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.250
 we join it by the part of above and you 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.250
 let's give the thickness we want 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.730
 carefully remove the adhesive tape and 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.720
 we delineate the lower eyelid 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.720
 and ready 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.020
 in this option we start outlining to 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.020
 eyelashes 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.290
 and we are going to apply the mask that we 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.290
 will serve as a guide 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.870
 we take the outline we draw the line 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.250
 the unite 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.940
 and we give it the thickness that we want 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.180
 we delineate below and this is the result 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.769
 What option did we like the most? 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.290
