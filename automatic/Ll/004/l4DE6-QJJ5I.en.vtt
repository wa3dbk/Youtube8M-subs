shoes which he was willing to do took it

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.859 
shoes which he was willing to do took it
out<00:00:16.650> on<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.279> table<00:00:17.550> mountain<00:00:18.029> starting<00:00:18.750> over

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
out on the table mountain starting over

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.960 
out on the table mountain starting over
at<00:00:19.080> our<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.500> then<00:00:19.619> headed<00:00:19.859> up<00:00:20.010> platter<00:00:20.670> clip

Gorge<00:00:21.330> which<00:00:21.660> was<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> good<00:00:22.380> test<00:00:22.619> for<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.890> so

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
Gorge which was a good test for it so

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.880 
Gorge which was a good test for it so
I'm<00:00:23.580> very<00:00:23.850> terrain<00:00:24.390> very<00:00:24.630> rocky<00:00:24.960> very<00:00:25.560> steep

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
I'm very terrain very rocky very steep

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.070 
I'm very terrain very rocky very steep
and<00:00:26.130> even<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.820> little<00:00:26.939> Gorge<00:00:27.330> section<00:00:27.840> which

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
and even a little Gorge section which

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.730 
and even a little Gorge section which
was<00:00:28.789> potentially<00:00:29.789> pretty<00:00:29.970> slippery<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.750> so

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
was potentially pretty slippery and so

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.100 
was potentially pretty slippery and so
we<00:00:31.920> got<00:00:32.700> tested<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.360> all<00:00:33.540> these<00:00:33.750> different

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
we got tested on all these different

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.260 
we got tested on all these different
terrains<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.770> was<00:00:35.090> fantastic<00:00:36.090> really

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
terrains and it was fantastic really

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.690 
terrains and it was fantastic really
easy<00:00:36.570> liftoff<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.290> even<00:00:38.040> those<00:00:38.190> little<00:00:38.370> mossy

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
easy liftoff and even those little mossy

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.260 
easy liftoff and even those little mossy
sections<00:00:39.290> got<00:00:40.290> absolutely<00:00:41.280> no<00:00:41.520> slipping<00:00:42.090> and

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
sections got absolutely no slipping and

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.709 
sections got absolutely no slipping and
we<00:00:42.899> did<00:00:43.050> try<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.500> push<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.860> quite<00:00:44.040> hard<00:00:44.250> so

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
we did try and push it quite hard so

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.510 
we did try and push it quite hard so
certain<00:00:45.719> gave<00:00:45.870> her<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.050> opportunity<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.890> show

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
certain gave her the opportunity to show

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.869 
certain gave her the opportunity to show
up<00:00:47.640> any<00:00:47.820> weaknesses<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> trade<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
up any weaknesses on the trade but the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.350 
up any weaknesses on the trade but the
the<00:00:51.719> vive<00:00:52.680> trade<00:00:53.070> was<00:00:53.280> pretty<00:00:54.239> effective

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the vive trade was pretty effective

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.260 
the vive trade was pretty effective
really<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.550> took<00:00:56.550> us<00:00:56.670> all<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> way<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
really and took us all the way to the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.900 
really and took us all the way to the
top<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.600> Table<00:00:57.960> Mountain<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.879> what<00:00:59.879> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
top of Table Mountain and what a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.029 
top of Table Mountain and what a
beautiful<00:01:00.210> day<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.510> was<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.410> last

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
beautiful day it was for this last

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.030 
beautiful day it was for this last
opportunity<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.969> give<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> shoes<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:04.040> really

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
opportunity to give the shoes a really

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.090 
opportunity to give the shoes a really
good<00:01:05.220> workout<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.350> saves<00:01:07.350> about<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.799> for

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
good workout and that saves about up for

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.390 
good workout and that saves about up for
K<00:01:08.340> trip<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> tie<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.229> then<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.470> Buttercup

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
K trip with the tie and then I Buttercup

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.160 
K trip with the tie and then I Buttercup
gorge<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:14.340> once<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.729> got<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> top<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.390> was<00:01:15.780> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
gorge so once we got to the top it was a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.370 
gorge so once we got to the top it was a
nice<00:01:16.439> little<00:01:16.680> time<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.450> reflect<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.170> what

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
nice little time to to reflect on what

just so light it just feels almost
seamless<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.600> let's<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.720> little<00:01:36.840> closer

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
seamless and let's have a little closer

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.039 
seamless and let's have a little closer
look<00:01:37.380> at<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.520> can<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:39.030> here<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.509> got<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
look at as you can see here we got a

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.990 
look at as you can see here we got a
little<00:01:40.259> closer<00:01:40.500> look<00:01:40.619> at<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.890> tread<00:01:41.189> which<00:01:41.759> is

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
little closer look at the tread which is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.719 
little closer look at the tread which is
hexagonal<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:43.159> pretty<00:01:44.159> little<00:01:44.220> gradient

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
hexagonal and pretty little gradient

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.539 
hexagonal and pretty little gradient
