missing it was just that kick-ass was by
himself<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.520> think<00:01:15.090> what<00:01:15.390> makes<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.930> really

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380

the<00:01:42.750> cover<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.290> kind<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.500> funny<00:01:43.710> one

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.160 
the cover it was kind of funny one
dollar<00:01:44.159> less<00:01:44.549> than<00:01:44.729> many<00:01:44.880> other<00:01:45.119> comic<00:01:45.930> books

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
my guess it'll be the heroes but you

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.140 
my guess it'll be the heroes but you
never<00:03:18.090> know<00:03:18.300> so<00:03:18.780> there's<00:03:19.770> a<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.459> little<00:03:20.940> preview

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
of the cover and I'm excited the next

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.640 
of the cover and I'm excited the next
issue<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.300> kick<00:03:24.480> ass<00:03:24.630> 2<00:03:24.840> has<00:03:25.110> really<00:03:25.500> been

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
issue you kick ass 2 has really been

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.380 
issue you kick ass 2 has really been
getting<00:03:25.770> a<00:03:26.010> lot<00:03:26.160> better<00:03:26.220> towards<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.240> end

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
getting a lot better towards the end

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.120 
getting a lot better towards the end
I've<00:03:27.690> been<00:03:27.990> liking<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.500> series<00:03:28.800> throughout

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
I've been liking the series throughout

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.760 
I've been liking the series throughout
but<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.180> think<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.570> story<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:30.930> really<00:03:31.170> getting

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
but I think the story is really getting

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.350 
but I think the story is really getting
great<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.310> you're<00:03:32.459> like<00:03:32.670> what's<00:03:33.120> going<00:03:33.270> to

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
great and you're like what's going to
