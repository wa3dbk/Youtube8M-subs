00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.940
 with this third video we will deal with the 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.570
 rom memory 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.660
 ram memory and mass storage in 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.930
 previous video we saw as the 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:25.390
 brain needs organs and 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.369
 apparatuses and how the cpi needs 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.640
 peripherals but both to be able to 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:35.239
 need to work differently too 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.660
 types of memory the brain uses ad 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:42.110
 example visual memory memory 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.190
 recent remote memory related to 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:49.219
 facts very far in time and so on 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.090
 think of a brain without memory 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.980
 in the same way the cpi uses different 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.640
 types of memory 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:02.809
 the rom the ram and the mass memories 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.690
 the rom is a read-only memory 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.440
 that is, it cannot be written but it can be written 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.979
 only read normally contains 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.130
 we also find the bios in the form 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.610
 mother and it is the first memory that comes 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.640
 read soon as you start the computer 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.180
 Rome checks the presence and the good 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.340
 operation of peripherals and 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.680
 ram still controls the system 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.640
 operational if it is present and therefore can 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.640
 start it is kept active thanks 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.950
 to a small buffer battery which 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.850
 we find in the motherboard 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:51.500
 the ram is a memory both for reading and 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:54.979
 however, in writing it is volatile means 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.200
 that turning off the computer loses all the 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.590
 its content 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.360
 it is very fast both in reading and 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:09.049
 in writing and has random access 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.959
 that is, it can go and retrieve data a 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:14.720
 regardless of where you are 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.690
 find the old ones on the left 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.120
 but that originally had few 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.510
 megabytes of capacity 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:28.070
 on the right instead the last arrivals that is 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.380
 the ddr3 that can also have numerous 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.530
 gigabytes of capacity 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.400
 the ram memory blocks are inserted 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:41.420
 in special slots called slots 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.720
 that are in the motherboard we can 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.330
 insert more memory banks for 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.570
 increase the capacity of the ram 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.570
 computer processing speed 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:57.490
 depends on the type of ski used most and 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:00.620
 from its frequency however have a lot of ram 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:04.090
 it means increasing the overall speed 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.320
 the computer in fact the ram 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.070
 storing a large number of data 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.459
 does not need frequent access 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.670
 in reading and writing on the memories of 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.580
 mass which are normally much more 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.880
 lens of the same ram we finally have 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.890
 the most used mass memories 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:30.650
 are the hard disk or hard disk and ne 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.519
 we can also have more than one fitted 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.700
 in the computer then the pbd and le 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.510
 usb sticks or pen drives 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:45.830
 but there are also external hard drives 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:48.920
 ie portable and with USB connection from 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:53.470
 say that with the latest models having 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:58.580
 usb 3.0 technology available 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:01.670
 instead of the old usb 2.0 they made it 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.060
 these devices including the related ones 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.670
 a pendrive much faster than before 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.240
 always as mass memories 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.330
 I still mention the different types of cards 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.650
 history and here is the solid disc or 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:22.010
 ssd which is faster than hard 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.960
 traditional but more expensive disk 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.380
 it's a little more delicate 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.940
 I conclude here this quick overview 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.550
 on mass memories 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.830
 we will see later how the 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.830
 computer uses them
