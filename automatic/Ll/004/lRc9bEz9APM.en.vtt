00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.110
 or dealing with people from my youtube 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.940
 name is the xk lasso and good guys 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.920
 here we have your new video where we are going 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.470
 to show how to update what is the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.480
 xbox one or at this moment is in your 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.980
 version as of February 6 or better 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.380
 said then in February the version of 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.610
 February 2015 and very apart so let's go 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.880
 to see the little things that it brings 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.759
 new 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.410
 ok to start I'm going to emphasize here I'm going 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.329
 to start the system without internet 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.190
 to tell them to do this 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.770
 obviously you need internet 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.900
 your console needs to be connected to the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.390
 web or internet does not matter if it's for wifi 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.340
 or by the internet cable in this case 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.840
 and this already connect to the ts step of 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.789
 put my password and everything so that 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.379
 see it and once connected it says that 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.899
 everything is fine has been connected to the network 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.949
 by richard rsp ok now what's left 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.600
 do is start your session let's go to 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.129
 doll this and let's go to the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.080
 session in this case because who am I 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.060
 I'm richard russian and this mail that 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.440
 is there really I do not use it do not go to 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.970
 try to do anything or anything 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.710
 because good that mail has nothing 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.840
 to see if they do not believe me because of some 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.580
 way it has can not have taken away in 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.530
 necessary once we are here 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.880
 they can realize the color they have 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.460
 the windows realize 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.189
 a solid gray is not transparent or 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.180
 nothing we go to this little window and then 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.560
 you can see that here the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.750
 information that has the new the new 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.840
 Well update and we'll see 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.539
 a little later and well here it's going to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.130
 leave the information do not worry about such 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.659
 time you guys also this video about 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.429
 months later to all when it came out 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.500
 another explanation or simply no longer 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.569
 this window comes out we can update the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.130
 that does not make us good configuration of 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:45.630
 moment to give it here but if not 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.970
 we could go to configuration and 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.939
 Iraqi system once being here 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.319
 we have to go to update and then 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.630
 here it says it's time to update or 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.030
 be because there is dispensation weighs x 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.619
 megabytes 255 megabytes and how can 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.209
 see and says the download in this case that 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.399
 cut the video so it's 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:07.259
 snapshot there are not simply 6 left 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.060
 when the 64 32 mb bear is unloading 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.349
 very fast and once you download the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.510
 update it's going to say it's going to 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.310
 restart what to mention that to 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.200
 update because that update then 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.730
 some time and somehow there's 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.829
 another update to control the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.660
 xbox one to update the controls 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.940
 of the xbox one is something similar 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.200
 only that on devices but for 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.690
 update control 10 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.150
 your usb cable control the only 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.010
 advantage for the moment to do this is 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.930
 that corrects some errors but the most 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.360
 remarkable is that normally a control of 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.849
 xbox turns on 5 seconds now what 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.170
 does this is that it turns on 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.239
 approximately 2 seconds and obviously 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.560
 after updating it not good then 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.810
 here the console is restarting in 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.910
 real time let's see that it does not cost 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.890
 or anything and here once already there 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.200
 downloaded everything because it will apply the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.970
 update again I'm going to cut the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.970
 video so that it goes directly 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.160
 because it's all there is then it's very 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.630
 fast I really think that you restart 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.610
 I'm not very sure I think not the 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.410
 reboots simply is to apply the 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.030
 pressure and once finished we will 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.769
 send the interface with everything 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.329
 again do not worry now let's 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.459
 mention what you have again 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.769
 although there are already many web pages that 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.930
 they have the same xbox here 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.000
 interface the same web does not say it is going 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.739
 to send new realizations and everything or 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.970
 is going to leave us out obviously 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.310
 It depends on how you have it configured 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.870
 but usually it leaves you out 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.110
 simply because they are not 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.940
 so that anyone can start 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.769
 session but not good let's go back to 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.250
 do the same in this case then 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.840
 we would have 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.100
 organization lose track of what 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.510
 color are the squares they are 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.310
 solids are colors that are not 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.070
 transparent so good men to 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.170
 little doll we will quickly give in 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.550
 log in now it 's the same les 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.190
 I remember that this email has nothing 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.660
 important because they are people who 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.820
 they want to do things and remove any 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.410
 thing and do things with those emails but 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.000
 well this password I do not think that 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.190
 appear you I have configured 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.660
 because as they have my payment cards 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.190
 and all because I do not want someone to arrive 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.320
 and do any buying my card 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.820
 no then we are here as they can 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.560
 see the main thing or the most remarkable thing 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.080
 are the transparent windows ok 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.670
 so we can leave for the moment here and 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.530
 because we will give this information 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.720
 also serves to see the news not 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.760
 only then of accusations of xbox 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.290
 but rather important news 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.579
 not also new controls 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.400
 things that are not implemented by removing 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.470
 etcetera let's give it in that again 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.990
 in this month and obviously then we are in 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.610
 February 2015 and here it says what 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.200
 principal and doing ours in de 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.669
 flow with four best new control 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.930
 courses in semi-mosaic games 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.100
 Transparent control situation 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.750
 control will connect here says 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.130
 quickly with more stability for 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.510
 tell it about configuration devices 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.520
 of history are selected control and 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.460
 choose to update 'save in game 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.110
 I like games that is a way 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.000
 to take the markers to review and everything 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.039
 this transparent mosaics of what 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.599
 spoke and then this is what 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.370
 secondary if you want to see it like that there are your 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.379
 sessions for tv that really good I 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.020
 I do not use it because I do not have high TV 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:58.229
 definition I think if it says well or digital 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.580
 but good is the most essential thing of 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.340
 somehow it is very simple but 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.960
 Well, I think it's the most remarkable thing 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.000
 because I've seen that the console 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.400
 it's a little faster and it's not going 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.620
 this then slow but not really 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.569
 do not miss expressing it as you can 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.280
 see for now I think it's still not 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.080
 mandatory as they could see I do not 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.940
 had updated and be able to back 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.039
 There is no problem but good 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.509
 I think that's the most essential and no 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.340
 is the same did not see the same can 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.930
 do it already I say it without going in there they go 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.539
 configuration and system also does not 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.940
 forget to update your control now 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.680
 I said how I was there also because that 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.659
 is apart or at the moment already and third 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.080
 console but I have not updated then my 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.909
 control 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.110
 Now I'm entering a call of duty and I 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.449
 I just do not ask for an explanation 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.979
 I knew there was unfortunately either or 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.900
 bad is video game updates already 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.650
 they are not common that weighed 20 15 10 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.770
 megabytes now weigh 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.020
 200 300 500 and cats arrive update 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.419
 but the logical thing is for the moment 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.190
 it's been all for the video I'm going to upload 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.330
 soon many more videos and 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.680
 I'm going to do a blog type for 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.000
 mention them because I was a little 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.370
 absent in the channel but good guys 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.639
 see you in the next video we 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.639
 we see
