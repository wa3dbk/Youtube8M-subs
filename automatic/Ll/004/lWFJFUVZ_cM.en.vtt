side<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.780> if<00:03:23.500> they<00:03:23.739> are<00:03:23.980> free<00:03:24.700> like<00:03:25.330> moving

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
side and if they are free like moving

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.559 
side and if they are free like moving
this<00:03:26.590> is<00:03:26.799> stamina<00:03:27.190> stamina<00:03:27.549> mode<00:03:27.879> because

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
this is stamina stamina mode because

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.380 
this is stamina stamina mode because
when<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.959> spins<00:03:29.379> the<00:03:30.280> balls<00:03:30.519> will<00:03:30.819> move<00:03:31.000> out<00:03:31.180> to

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
when it spins the balls will move out to

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.710 
when it spins the balls will move out to
the<00:03:31.599> edges<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.950> wheel<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.430> help<00:03:33.790> it<00:03:33.970> gain

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
the edges of the wheel and help it gain

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.589 
the edges of the wheel and help it gain
more<00:03:34.870> stamina<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:36.190> if<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.579> lift<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.180> up<00:03:37.299> and

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
more stamina so if you lift it up and

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.400 
more stamina so if you lift it up and
then<00:03:37.870> turn<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.260> over<00:03:38.819> so<00:03:39.819> that's<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:41.140> balls

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
then turn it over so that's a the balls

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.020 
then turn it over so that's a the balls
oops<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:43.480> balls<00:03:43.690> lock<00:03:43.989> in<00:03:44.170> place<00:03:44.519> its<00:03:45.519> defense

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
oops the balls lock in place its defense

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.530 
oops the balls lock in place its defense
mode

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
mode

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.990 
mode
so<00:03:47.019> it'll<00:03:47.349> hold<00:03:47.709> all<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.040> weight<00:03:48.069> toward<00:03:48.910> the

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
so it'll hold all the weight toward the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.789 
so it'll hold all the weight toward the
center<00:03:49.299> giving<00:03:50.170> it<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.379> little<00:03:50.500> bit<00:03:50.650> more

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
center giving it a little bit more

00:03:50.799 --> 00:04:00.509

defense<00:03:52.620> this<00:03:53.620> is<00:03:53.680> s1<00:03:54.459> 30<00:03:55.120> or<00:03:55.359> shield<00:03:55.690> 130<00:03:59.519> it's

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
defense this is s1 30 or shield 130 it's

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.180 
defense this is s1 30 or shield 130 it's
kind<00:04:00.700> of<00:04:00.760> like<00:04:00.910> a<00:04:00.940> smaller<00:04:01.450> version<00:04:01.959> of<00:04:02.230> boost

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
kind of like a smaller version of boost

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:10.920 
kind of like a smaller version of boost
disk<00:04:03.690> oops<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:06.959> RB<00:04:07.959> rubber<00:04:08.530> ball<00:04:08.799> I<00:04:09.930> really

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
disk oops and RB rubber ball I really

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.800 
disk oops and RB rubber ball I really
like<00:04:11.139> the<00:04:11.669> tip<00:04:12.669> on<00:04:12.880> this<00:04:13.060> even<00:04:13.540> though<00:04:13.630> it's

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
like the tip on this even though it's

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.839 
like the tip on this even though it's
not<00:04:13.989> a<00:04:14.049> great<00:04:14.470> tip<00:04:14.769> just<00:04:15.430> because<00:04:15.579> it<00:04:15.700> just

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
not a great tip just because it just

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.170 
not a great tip just because it just
seems<00:04:16.030> like<00:04:16.150> it's<00:04:16.329> a<00:04:16.450> really<00:04:16.630> cool<00:04:16.870> concept

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.510 

it's<00:04:22.180> not<00:04:22.300> really<00:04:22.660> good<00:04:22.870> with<00:04:23.520> stamina

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
it's not really good with stamina

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.089 
it's not really good with stamina
because<00:04:25.180> it's<00:04:25.330> rubber<00:04:25.570> plus<00:04:26.440> its<00:04:26.620> hat<00:04:26.800> it<00:04:26.950> has

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
because it's rubber plus its hat it has

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.219 
because it's rubber plus its hat it has
a<00:04:27.130> wide<00:04:27.520> surface<00:04:28.060> area<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.840> it'll<00:04:29.110> move

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
a wide surface area and it'll move

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.469 
a wide surface area and it'll move
around<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.650> stadium<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.099> lot<00:04:30.280> so<00:04:30.849> it's<00:04:31.000> not<00:04:31.150> a

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
around the stadium a lot so it's not a

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.930 
around the stadium a lot so it's not a
really<00:04:31.930> good<00:04:32.050> stamina<00:04:32.440> or<00:04:33.039> anything<00:04:33.700> like

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
really good stamina or anything like

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.589 
really good stamina or anything like
that<00:04:34.139> and<00:04:35.139> just<00:04:35.229> have<00:04:35.380> a<00:04:35.500> bar<00:04:35.710> in<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.860> bottom

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
that and just have a bar in the bottom

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.879 
that and just have a bar in the bottom
all<00:04:37.599> right<00:04:37.750> so<00:04:37.930> before<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.320> put<00:04:38.560> this<00:04:38.680> baby

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
all right so before I put this baby

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.610 
all right so before I put this baby
together<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.700> am<00:04:40.150> going<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.599> compare<00:04:40.960> it<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:41.139> the

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
together I am going to compare it to the

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.790 
together I am going to compare it to the
original<00:04:41.800> 4d<00:04:42.550> beyblade<00:04:42.970> so<00:04:43.870> this<00:04:44.050> is<00:04:44.349> Sona

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
original 4d beyblade so this is Sona

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.060 
original 4d beyblade so this is Sona
Kong's<00:04:45.419> Jade<00:04:46.419> Jupiter<00:04:46.570> not<00:04:47.410> your<00:04:47.560> car<00:04:47.710> tell<00:04:47.950> me

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
Kong's Jade Jupiter not your car tell me

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.230 
Kong's Jade Jupiter not your car tell me
but<00:04:48.280> it's<00:04:48.400> still<00:04:48.580> pretty<00:04:48.729> much<00:04:48.849> the<00:04:48.970> same

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
but it's still pretty much the same

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.469 
but it's still pretty much the same
thing<00:04:52.530> do<00:04:53.530> you<00:04:53.620> a<00:04:54.000> comparison<00:04:55.000> from<00:04:55.210> real

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
thing do you a comparison from real

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:03.540 
thing do you a comparison from real
quick

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.480 

all<00:05:04.550> right<00:05:04.699> so<00:05:04.909> faithful<00:05:05.389> here<00:05:06.259> is<00:05:06.439> 40<00:05:07.159> on<00:05:07.340> the

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
all right so faithful here is 40 on the

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.559 
all right so faithful here is 40 on the
left<00:05:07.669> and<00:05:08.470> hyper<00:05:09.470> blade<00:05:09.770> on<00:05:10.039> the<00:05:10.250> right<00:05:10.569> it's

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569 
left and hyper blade on the right it's

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:13.689 
left and hyper blade on the right it's
pretty<00:05:11.840> much<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.199> same<00:05:12.409> just<00:05:12.770> a<00:05:13.400> different

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
pretty much the same just a different

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.790 
pretty much the same just a different
color<00:05:13.849> of<00:05:13.939> course<00:05:14.240> although<00:05:14.870> I<00:05:15.020> think<00:05:15.169> this

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
color of course although I think this

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.730 
color of course although I think this
paint<00:05:16.430> job<00:05:16.669> is<00:05:16.939> a<00:05:16.969> little<00:05:17.289> it<00:05:18.289> doesn't<00:05:18.530> seem

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
paint job is a little it doesn't seem

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.140 
paint job is a little it doesn't seem
full<00:05:19.039> as<00:05:19.219> you<00:05:19.340> can<00:05:19.490> see<00:05:19.639> there's<00:05:19.819> a<00:05:19.909> little<00:05:20.030> bit

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
full as you can see there's a little bit

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.779 
full as you can see there's a little bit
more<00:05:20.750> black<00:05:21.050> in<00:05:21.409> the<00:05:21.560> background<00:05:21.949> this<00:05:22.520> one

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
more black in the background this one

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:29.800 
more black in the background this one
seems<00:05:23.060> a<00:05:23.150> little<00:05:23.210> bit<00:05:23.389> more<00:05:23.419> filled<00:05:23.810> in<00:05:28.810> the

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
seems a little bit more filled in the

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.189 
seems a little bit more filled in the
clear<00:05:30.080> wheels<00:05:30.909> same<00:05:31.909> shape<00:05:32.180> same<00:05:32.509> design<00:05:32.900> just

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
clear wheels same shape same design just

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.029 
clear wheels same shape same design just
different<00:05:33.439> color<00:05:33.680> this<00:05:34.550> would<00:05:34.849> have<00:05:35.090> the<00:05:36.039> the

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
different color this would have the the

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.589 
different color this would have the the
forty<00:05:37.340> one<00:05:37.520> who<00:05:37.789> wouldn't<00:05:37.969> have<00:05:38.300> this

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
forty one who wouldn't have this

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.439 
forty one who wouldn't have this
supposed<00:05:39.400> metal<00:05:40.400> powder<00:05:40.669> on<00:05:40.909> the<00:05:41.030> inside

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
supposed metal powder on the inside

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.010 
supposed metal powder on the inside
which<00:05:42.020> is<00:05:42.469> pretty<00:05:43.039> much<00:05:43.129> the<00:05:43.370> only<00:05:43.430> difference

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
which is pretty much the only difference

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:51.490 
which is pretty much the only difference
and<00:05:45.789> the<00:05:46.789> metal<00:05:47.060> wheel<00:05:47.180> so<00:05:47.930> I<00:05:50.139> don't<00:05:51.139> see<00:05:51.319> much

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
and the metal wheel so I don't see much

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.119 
and the metal wheel so I don't see much
of<00:05:51.560> a<00:05:51.770> difference<00:05:53.710> still<00:05:54.710> looks<00:05:54.860> very<00:05:54.919> much

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:55.129 
of a difference still looks very much

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:04.439 
of a difference still looks very much
the<00:05:55.250> same<00:05:59.349> and<00:06:00.349> here's<00:06:00.620> the<00:06:00.740> bottom<00:06:01.039> piece
