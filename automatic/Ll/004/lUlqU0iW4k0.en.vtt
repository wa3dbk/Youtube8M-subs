compare I'm seeing a lot nicer a lot
less<00:00:42.100> of<00:00:42.130> a<00:00:42.310> harsh<00:00:42.610> difference<00:00:43.120> between<00:00:43.480> the

on the nikon LCD

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.460 
on the nikon LCD
I<00:00:47.800> like<00:00:48.309> the<00:00:48.489> continuous<00:00:49.270> shooting<00:00:49.570> but<00:00:50.440> I

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
I like the continuous shooting but I

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.450 
I like the continuous shooting but I
know<00:00:50.559> that<00:00:50.800> Canon<00:00:51.640> offers<00:00:52.000> you<00:00:52.150> more<00:00:52.390> shots

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
know that Canon offers you more shots

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.130 
know that Canon offers you more shots
per<00:00:54.460> second<00:00:54.940> but<00:00:55.300> let's<00:00:55.540> try<00:00:55.720> the<00:00:55.840> same<00:00:56.080> thing

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
per second but let's try the same thing

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.619 
per second but let's try the same thing
with<00:00:56.470> the<00:00:56.800> Canon<00:00:57.400> what<00:00:57.760> I'm<00:00:57.879> noticing<00:00:58.090> a<00:00:58.480> lot

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
with the Canon what I'm noticing a lot

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.280 
with the Canon what I'm noticing a lot
about<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.940> Nikon<00:01:00.940> is<00:01:01.210> that<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:01.990> image

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
about the Nikon is that the image

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.490 
about the Nikon is that the image
quality<00:01:02.470> is<00:01:02.950> kind<00:01:03.790> of<00:01:03.940> a<00:01:04.000> leap<00:01:04.330> up<00:01:04.600> it<00:01:04.990> sort<00:01:05.380> of

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
quality is kind of a leap up it sort of

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.670 
quality is kind of a leap up it sort of
seems<00:01:05.800> to<00:01:06.250> have<00:01:06.430> raised<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:07.150> bar<00:01:07.180> for<00:01:07.720> Canon

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
seems to have raised the bar for Canon

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.960 
seems to have raised the bar for Canon
from<00:01:08.950> what<00:01:09.100> I'm<00:01:09.250> seeing<00:01:09.280> from<00:01:09.790> the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
from what I'm seeing from the

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.370 
from what I'm seeing from the
differences<00:01:10.479> especially<00:01:10.780> with<00:01:11.259> the

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
differences especially with the

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.440 
differences especially with the
low-light<00:01:11.830> stuff<00:01:12.190> especially<00:01:12.520> bumping<00:01:13.240> it<00:01:13.360> up

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
low-light stuff especially bumping it up

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.120 
low-light stuff especially bumping it up
to<00:01:13.600> like<00:01:13.720> at<00:01:13.840> 3200<00:01:14.530> ISO<00:01:14.680> is<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.150> Nikon<00:01:16.660> is

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
to like at 3200 ISO is that the Nikon is

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.430 
to like at 3200 ISO is that the Nikon is
doing<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.220> lot<00:01:18.399> better<00:01:18.550> with<00:01:19.090> not<00:01:19.990> letting<00:01:20.290> the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
doing a lot better with not letting the

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.700 
doing a lot better with not letting the
image<00:01:20.770> depreciate<00:01:21.460> shutter<00:01:21.910> speed<00:01:22.210> of<00:01:22.330> 800

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
image depreciate shutter speed of 800

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.230 
image depreciate shutter speed of 800
f-stop<00:01:23.710> of<00:01:24.330> 16<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:25.660> ISO<00:01:26.550> 3200<00:01:27.550> this

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
f-stop of 16 and ISO 3200 this

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.880 
f-stop of 16 and ISO 3200 this
interested<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:28.840> see<00:01:29.080> like<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.530> grain<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
interested to see like the grain and the

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.340 
interested to see like the grain and the
image<00:01:33.250> quality

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
image quality

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.990 
image quality
yeah<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.530> Canon<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.250> looks<00:01:36.520> like<00:01:36.700> it's<00:01:36.880> a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
yeah the Canon it looks like it's a

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.059 
yeah the Canon it looks like it's a
little<00:01:37.390> bit<00:01:37.630> if<00:01:37.899> I'm<00:01:38.080> zooming<00:01:38.530> in<00:01:38.679> at<00:01:39.509> 3200

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
little bit if I'm zooming in at 3200

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.540 
little bit if I'm zooming in at 3200
it's<00:01:42.240> falling<00:01:43.240> apart<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:44.830> image<00:01:45.100> quality<00:01:45.220> of

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
it's falling apart the image quality of

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.719 
it's falling apart the image quality of
grain<00:01:45.819> especially<00:01:46.330> on<00:01:46.420> a<00:01:46.450> texture<00:01:46.990> like<00:01:47.170> this

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
grain especially on a texture like this

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.870 
grain especially on a texture like this
it's<00:01:48.729> a<00:01:48.819> lot<00:01:48.970> softer<00:01:49.270> than<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:51.100> Nikon<00:01:51.490> isn't

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
it's a lot softer than the Nikon isn't

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.419 
it's a lot softer than the Nikon isn't
that<00:01:52.060> exposure<00:01:52.720> you<00:01:53.470> could<00:01:53.649> definitely<00:01:53.920> see

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
that exposure you could definitely see

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:55.949 
that exposure you could definitely see
the<00:01:54.580> difference<00:01:54.610> I<00:01:55.030> meant<00:01:55.240> all<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.450> exact

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
the difference I meant all the exact

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:00.630 
the difference I meant all the exact
same<00:01:56.200> settings<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.619> Canon<00:02:00.190> it's<00:02:00.340> just<00:02:00.550> a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
same settings and the Canon it's just a

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.390 
same settings and the Canon it's just a
lot<00:02:00.819> darker

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.760 

where<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.090> guess<00:02:04.300> nikons<00:02:04.780> taking<00:02:05.170> opposite

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
where I guess nikons taking opposite

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.469 
where I guess nikons taking opposite
ends<00:02:06.160> of<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.510> visual<00:02:07.510> spectrum<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:09.390> sort<00:02:10.390> of

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
ends of the visual spectrum and sort of

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.680 
ends of the visual spectrum and sort of
fusing<00:02:10.930> them<00:02:11.080> together<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.710> get<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.980> lightest

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
fusing them together to get the lightest

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.410 
fusing them together to get the lightest
points<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.900> most<00:02:14.140> information<00:02:14.890> out<00:02:15.070> of

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
points and the most information out of

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.550 
points and the most information out of
each<00:02:16.420> light<00:02:16.900> point

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
each light point

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.430 
each light point
I<00:02:17.820> like<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:18.970> focusing<00:02:19.660> on<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.960> night<00:02:20.140> on<00:02:20.410> a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
I like the focusing on the night on a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.560 
I like the focusing on the night on a
little<00:02:20.800> better<00:02:21.010> it's<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.520> little<00:02:21.970> bit<00:02:22.090> easier

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
little better it's a little bit easier

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.560 
little better it's a little bit easier
to<00:02:22.960> adjust<00:02:23.650> while<00:02:24.340> you're<00:02:24.580> shooting<00:02:24.820> Canon

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
to adjust while you're shooting Canon

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:33.680 
to adjust while you're shooting Canon
has<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:26.350> few<00:02:27.280> more<00:02:28.050> focus<00:02:29.050> points<00:02:29.620> available

is<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.280> little<00:03:12.519> different<00:03:12.850> than<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.060> Canon

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
is a little different than the Canon

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.220 
is a little different than the Canon
where<00:03:14.050> I<00:03:14.580> can<00:03:15.580> kind<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.850> control<00:03:16.269> the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
where I can kind of control the

fingers for the various dials and it's a

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.449 
fingers for the various dials and it's a
lot<00:03:23.110> easier<00:03:23.140> because<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.890> show<00:03:24.130> everything

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
lot easier because it show everything

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
and I am filming I feel like the Nikon

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.270 
and I am filming I feel like the Nikon
is<00:03:43.030> gonna<00:03:43.330> be<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.510> clear<00:03:43.900> winner<00:03:44.110> here<00:03:44.530> on<00:03:44.770> the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
is gonna be a clear winner here on the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.880 
is gonna be a clear winner here on the
keeping<00:03:45.670> Jack<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.150> focus<00:03:46.600> situation<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.650> can

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
keeping Jack and focus situation I can

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:55.350 
keeping Jack and focus situation I can
just<00:03:48.250> see<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:48.460> from<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.850> LCD<00:03:51.060> which<00:03:54.360> which

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
just see it from the LCD which which

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.900 
just see it from the LCD which which
even<00:03:55.720> though<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.080> Canon<00:03:56.650> their<00:03:57.460> buttons

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
even though the Canon their buttons

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.450 
even though the Canon their buttons
might<00:03:58.150> be<00:03:58.330> more<00:03:58.510> user-friendly<00:03:58.990> it<00:03:59.740> looks

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
might be more user-friendly it looks

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.030 
might be more user-friendly it looks
like<00:04:00.670> even<00:04:00.880> for<00:04:01.180> live<00:04:01.450> shooting<00:04:02.110> if<00:04:02.830> you've

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
like even for live shooting if you've

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.580 
like even for live shooting if you've
got<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.430> know<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.760> Nikon<00:04:04.470> really<00:04:05.470> got

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
got to know the Nikon really got

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.050 
got to know the Nikon really got
comfortable<00:04:05.920> with<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.520> might<00:04:06.640> just<00:04:06.940> be

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
comfortable with it it might just be

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.420 
comfortable with it it might just be
better<00:04:07.209> all<00:04:07.450> around<00:04:07.750> I<00:04:08.050> know<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.220> they<00:04:09.310> go

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
better all around I know that they go

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.520 
better all around I know that they go
through<00:04:09.459> motion<00:04:10.360> which<00:04:10.600> is<00:04:10.630> a<00:04:10.780> huge<00:04:11.050> step<00:04:11.350> up

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
through motion which is a huge step up

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.620 
through motion which is a huge step up
from<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:12.870> d7000<00:04:15.299> but<00:04:16.299> if<00:04:16.390> you<00:04:16.510> got

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
from the d7000 but if you got

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.849 
from the d7000 but if you got
comfortable<00:04:17.049> enough<00:04:17.169> with<00:04:17.230> this<00:04:17.470> Nikon<00:04:17.799> I

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
comfortable enough with this Nikon I

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.180 
comfortable enough with this Nikon I
would<00:04:18.100> say<00:04:18.370> it's<00:04:18.609> a<00:04:18.760> clear<00:04:19.090> winner<00:04:19.919> for<00:04:20.919> over

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
would say it's a clear winner for over

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.550 
would say it's a clear winner for over
the<00:04:21.280> tannins<00:04:21.700> although<00:04:22.419> big<00:04:22.930> up<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.110> Canon

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
the tannins although big up to Canon

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.770 
the tannins although big up to Canon
that<00:04:23.590> it<00:04:23.770> took<00:04:23.950> Nikon<00:04:24.430> for<00:04:24.760> years<00:04:25.150> to<00:04:25.450> sort<00:04:25.690> of

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
that it took Nikon for years to sort of

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.810 
that it took Nikon for years to sort of
beat<00:04:26.169> well<00:04:26.470> I<00:04:26.740> was<00:04:26.950> really<00:04:27.160> impressed<00:04:27.550> with

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
beat well I was really impressed with

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.360 
beat well I was really impressed with
the<00:04:28.030> Nikon<00:04:28.590> primarily<00:04:29.590> because<00:04:29.800> of<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.130> image

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
the Nikon primarily because of the image

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.840 
the Nikon primarily because of the image
quality<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:31.380> because<00:04:32.380> of<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.800> I<00:04:33.220> didn't

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
quality and because of the I didn't

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.480 
quality and because of the I didn't
think<00:04:34.060> that<00:04:34.419> I<00:04:34.450> would<00:04:34.570> see<00:04:35.080> so<00:04:35.919> much<00:04:36.160> of<00:04:36.370> the

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
think that I would see so much of the

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.000 
think that I would see so much of the
difference<00:04:36.970> in<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.419> LCD<00:04:37.990> monitor<00:04:38.650> during

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
difference in the LCD monitor during

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.750 
difference in the LCD monitor during
live<00:04:39.280> shooting<00:04:40.050> but<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.080> did<00:04:41.350> it<00:04:42.190> wasn't<00:04:42.520> about

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
live shooting but I did it wasn't about

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.730 
live shooting but I did it wasn't about
the<00:04:42.910> size<00:04:43.180> of<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.510> because<00:04:43.780> it's<00:04:43.900> only<00:04:44.140> 0.2

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
the size of it because it's only 0.2

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.060 
the size of it because it's only 0.2
inches<00:04:45.040> bigger<00:04:45.910> but<00:04:46.570> it<00:04:46.810> was<00:04:46.990> more<00:04:47.260> about<00:04:47.650> how

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
inches bigger but it was more about how

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.030 
inches bigger but it was more about how
many<00:04:48.820> colors<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.390> being<00:04:49.960> able<00:04:50.080> to<00:04:50.229> see<00:04:50.650> the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
many colors and being able to see the

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.180 
many colors and being able to see the
range<00:04:51.880> in<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.390> contrasting<00:04:53.200> shadows<00:04:53.860> and

light<00:04:54.720> I<00:04:56.460> was<00:04:57.460> impressed<00:04:58.060> with<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.550> dynamic

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
light I was impressed with the dynamic

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.480

range<00:05:00.729> although<00:05:01.470> on<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.770> Nikon<00:05:03.160> they<00:05:03.310> only

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
range although on the Nikon they only

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.640 
range although on the Nikon they only
offer<00:05:03.820> it<00:05:04.000> for<00:05:04.419> shooting<00:05:04.780> in<00:05:04.840> JPEG<00:05:05.229> they<00:05:05.410> don't

offer it for shooting in JPEG they don't

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.310 
offer it for shooting in JPEG they don't

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
offer it shooting RAW files the Canon I

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.570 
offer it shooting RAW files the Canon I
still<00:05:08.680> feel<00:05:08.860> is<00:05:09.040> a<00:05:09.070> little<00:05:09.430> more

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
still feel is a little more

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.130 
still feel is a little more
user-friendly<00:05:09.970> when<00:05:10.390> you're<00:05:10.510> holding<00:05:10.900> it<00:05:11.020> and

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
user-friendly when you're holding it and

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.690 
user-friendly when you're holding it and
you're<00:05:11.260> on<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.560> go<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:12.070> weights<00:05:12.280> are<00:05:12.460> close

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
you're on the go the weights are close

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.969 
you're on the go the weights are close
enough<00:05:12.729> that<00:05:13.390> it<00:05:13.720> more<00:05:14.140> depends<00:05:14.530> on<00:05:14.620> what<00:05:14.770> lens

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
enough that it more depends on what lens

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:15.750 
enough that it more depends on what lens
you're<00:05:15.220> using

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
you're using

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.690 
you're using
I<00:05:15.790> think<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.300> Nikon<00:05:16.720> is<00:05:17.050> leaps<00:05:18.040> and<00:05:18.250> bounds

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
I think the Nikon is leaps and bounds

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.700 
I think the Nikon is leaps and bounds
above<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:20.020> 7d

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
above the 7d

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.350 
above the 7d
although<00:05:20.950> the<00:05:21.100> Canon<00:05:21.400> 7d<00:05:21.729> is<00:05:21.910> still<00:05:22.180> pretty

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
although the Canon 7d is still pretty

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.540 
although the Canon 7d is still pretty
wonderful<00:05:22.990> I'm<00:05:23.050> usually<00:05:23.320> a<00:05:23.560> Canon<00:05:23.979> shooter<00:05:24.220> I

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
wonderful I'm usually a Canon shooter I

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.270 
wonderful I'm usually a Canon shooter I
do<00:05:25.060> feel<00:05:25.570> that<00:05:25.600> if<00:05:26.050> I<00:05:26.229> had<00:05:26.470> a<00:05:26.500> couple<00:05:26.860> days<00:05:27.100> with

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
do feel that if I had a couple days with

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.030 
do feel that if I had a couple days with
this<00:05:27.430> Nikon<00:05:27.850> though

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
this Nikon though

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.880 
this Nikon though
more<00:05:29.910> I<00:05:30.150> think<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:30.720> have<00:05:30.900> to<00:05:31.050> think<00:05:31.650> that

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
more I think you have to think that

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.120 
more I think you have to think that
nikon<00:05:32.550> is<00:05:32.730> slightly<00:05:33.270> less<00:05:33.570> user-friendly<00:05:34.130> but

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
nikon is slightly less user-friendly but

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.300 
nikon is slightly less user-friendly but
if<00:05:35.460> you<00:05:35.730> get<00:05:36.690> used<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:37.050> it<00:05:37.170> I<00:05:37.530> think<00:05:38.010> it<00:05:38.130> would

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
if you get used to it I think it would

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.040 
if you get used to it I think it would
improve<00:05:38.580> the<00:05:38.760> overall<00:05:38.790> quality<00:05:39.120> to<00:05:39.690> be<00:05:39.840> in<00:05:39.960> the

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
improve the overall quality to be in the

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.160 
improve the overall quality to be in the
juice<00:05:40.200> my<00:05:40.920> 5d<00:05:41.820> I<00:05:42.060> love<00:05:42.360> it<00:05:42.540> very<00:05:42.570> much<00:05:42.810> I've

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
juice my 5d I love it very much I've

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.160 
juice my 5d I love it very much I've
shot<00:05:43.380> a<00:05:43.590> lot<00:05:43.800> on<00:05:44.070> it<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.460> 5d<00:05:45.150> I<00:05:45.360> feel<00:05:45.750> is<00:05:45.900> even

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170 
shot a lot on it the 5d I feel is even

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.100 
shot a lot on it the 5d I feel is even
more<00:05:46.350> user-friendly<00:05:46.770> than<00:05:47.190> the<00:05:47.340> 70<00:05:47.790> however<00:05:48.690> I

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
more user-friendly than the 70 however I

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.650 
more user-friendly than the 70 however I
do<00:05:49.530> think<00:05:49.800> that<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:50.250> 60<00:05:50.610> frames<00:05:50.880> a<00:05:51.240> second

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
do think that the 60 frames a second

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.930 
do think that the 60 frames a second
would<00:05:52.020> sway<00:05:52.980> me<00:05:53.660> 9<00:05:54.660> 1<00:05:55.020> or<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:55.620> 70<00:05:56.040> over<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.490> 15

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
would sway me 9 1 or the 70 over the 15

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.990 
would sway me 9 1 or the 70 over the 15
I<00:05:57.290> would<00:05:58.290> go<00:05:58.650> with<00:05:58.980> the<00:05:59.130> Nikon<00:05:59.430> if<00:05:59.520> I<00:05:59.610> bought<00:05:59.820> a

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
I would go with the Nikon if I bought a

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.290 
I would go with the Nikon if I bought a
new<00:06:00.180> camera<00:06:00.420> price<00:06:01.020> range<00:06:01.320> difference<00:06:01.890> is

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
new camera price range difference is

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.510 
new camera price range difference is
negligible<00:06:03.300> it's<00:06:03.810> like<00:06:03.930> $200<00:06:04.800> so<00:06:05.190> at<00:06:05.310> this

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
negligible it's like $200 so at this

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.760 
negligible it's like $200 so at this
point<00:06:05.790> in<00:06:06.000> time<00:06:06.210> since<00:06:06.900> Nikon<00:06:07.380> is<00:06:07.410> sort<00:06:07.710> of

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
point in time since Nikon is sort of

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.470 
point in time since Nikon is sort of
raised<00:06:07.980> the<00:06:08.100> bar<00:06:08.280> and<00:06:08.460> the<00:06:08.550> image<00:06:08.820> quality<00:06:08.850> I

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
raised the bar and the image quality I

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.940 
raised the bar and the image quality I
would<00:06:09.780> definitely<00:06:10.200> go<00:06:10.320> with<00:06:10.440> the<00:06:10.500> Nikon

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
would definitely go with the Nikon

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.940 
would definitely go with the Nikon
however<00:06:11.670> the<00:06:11.850> 7d<00:06:12.360> is<00:06:12.840> going<00:06:13.320> to<00:06:13.410> come<00:06:13.590> out<00:06:13.620> with

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
however the 7d is going to come out with

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.600 
however the 7d is going to come out with
a<00:06:14.190> new<00:06:14.370> version<00:06:14.640> sometime<00:06:15.450> in<00:06:15.540> 2013<00:06:16.500> and<00:06:16.860> who

knows<00:06:17.820> what<00:06:18.000> they'll<00:06:18.150> come<00:06:18.360> up<00:06:18.390> with<00:06:18.660> maybe

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
knows what they'll come up with maybe

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.260 
knows what they'll come up with maybe
they'll<00:06:19.200> make<00:06:19.350> that<00:06:19.560> to<00:06:20.010> the<00:06:20.280> $300<00:06:20.910> worth<00:06:21.060> it

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
they'll make that to the $300 worth it

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.870 
they'll make that to the $300 worth it
