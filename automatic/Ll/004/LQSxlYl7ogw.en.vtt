 we are more accurate in the us 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.900
 said in nevada in nevada we play 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.580
 on the map de nuke sound 2025 and the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.039
 here is no online game for me 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.109
 show you the map a bit for me 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.930
 she has changed a bit 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.730
 I am also here we directly times a 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.989
 contrast to black ops individual for the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.610
 people do not know that maybe 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.190
 the end of three or even is up 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.899
 two started the black ops 1 has 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.610
 At that time there was also a map which has 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.879
 new dawn was called without the 2025 before 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.390
 you can already see the grass now 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.559
 different from here is a kettle 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.920
 or whatever that is here 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.809
 even a water doing something here 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.350
 was of course vegetable garden with a 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.240
 woman assets conclude on the head 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.070
 let's go on here is actually 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.680
 everything is the same as in black ops 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.130
 1 only other things put down 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.080
 Let's go into the first house 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.850
 what do we see here again ours 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.460
 beloved desk so eight people 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.900
 here you can fight running people if you are 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.330
 want to fight know each other as best 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.420
 fight back and forth behind the bed 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.720
 also like people behind this doll of 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.020
 up here over and over again 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.299
 whole map a cool car you can see it too 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.460
 this way to the car that can often 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.960
 explode and you can here it 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.579
 jump here is the b question 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.500
 domination I always like to play and 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.759
 then you can do everything here 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.470
 patrol but you have to be careful 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.649
 that nothing is taken away from the right 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.360
 then we will go on in here 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.590
 it has nothing to do with if 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.680
 that may be less 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.140
 I find it okay and in the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.820
 Garage is always only then too 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.570
 yet another texture processes the car 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.430
 I'm really cool 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.630
 look if that will explode easily 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.939
 can 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.340
 As I said at the beginning you have to take care 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.280
 that from the other side no grenade 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.230
 over here the car is too can 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.690
 You can also explode that means too 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.120
 be careful where the two cars in the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.380
 middle can not explode that is 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.630
 they can be quiet here 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.950
 hide or you can also very much here 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.140
 Look through everything here 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.880
 overview 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.709
 you can also catch the opponents here 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.530
 running when they ask for example to b 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:36.209
 there is also a car here 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.620
 but this time only with lars that he was there 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.420
 above you can not just shoot that 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.230
 means I can not do anything here 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.120
 explode 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.840
 There are also some with bodies here 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.340
 and there is also interesting here 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.410
 you can fight again if 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.970
 you just have to do something and it 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.160
 Nevertheless, you can hide in the game 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.590
 just here puts you back and that's it 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.730
 the future entertainment yes that is here 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.310
 is again the small playground 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:09.030
 for the children among you, yes, the head 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.220
 is sexy well does not do anything and I give 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.880
 me also run this newco 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.120
 There are also times here on the whole 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.440
 station is designed every desk is 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.819
 I think I've grown a little smaller 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.709
 nevertheless one can believe oneself very much 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.470
 well fight behind this button here 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.150
 so again, be careful 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.690
 Offered if you went up here 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.910
 comes up 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.859
 A little way is when we are here 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.600
 It's best to come in here 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.910
 look for you to cover up behind the couch 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.310
 look up here and then you can 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.970
 go up as I said here 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.829
 let's see 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.560
 and here on the bed you can again 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.889
 go up and take a nap 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.959
 Let me say goodbye here 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.180
 By the way, we also got some grenades 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.489
 just throw it over if you can 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.709
 I can not be in this sense 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.600
 chances until next time if one 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.430
 to have another map in the overview or 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.109
 in the overview then wants to write 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.139
 I say that in the comments 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.139
 chances to see you next time 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.139
 bud
