00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.179 
we all wish that we had on our phones
for<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> long<00:00:30.689> long<00:00:30.990> time<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:31.890> you've<00:00:32.040> ever

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
for a long long time so if you've ever

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.470 
for a long long time so if you've ever
had<00:00:32.369> something<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.940> needed<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.300> make<00:00:33.450> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
had something that you needed to make a

had something that you needed to make a
copy<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.960> but<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.290> don't<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.559> access<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.070> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
photocopier or a scanner what we've done

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.950 
photocopier or a scanner what we've done
is<00:00:38.250> probably<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.600> call<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
is probably what I like to call the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.780 
is probably what I like to call the
ghetto<00:00:40.320> version<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.950> scanning<00:00:41.309> basically

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
ghetto version of scanning basically

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.040 
ghetto version of scanning basically
where<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.090> your<00:00:42.120> paper<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.840> take<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
where you have your paper and you take a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.290 
where you have your paper and you take a
picture<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.340> boom<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.910> use<00:00:45.090> that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
picture of it and then boom you use that

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.060 
picture of it and then boom you use that
as<00:00:45.450> your<00:00:45.480> copy<00:00:45.840> but<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.469> don't<00:00:46.680> want<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.920> use<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
as your copy but we don't want to use a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.580 
as your copy but we don't want to use a
picture<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.850> took<00:00:47.879> as<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.350> photocopy<00:00:49.350> we

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
picture that we took as a photocopy we

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.950 
picture that we took as a photocopy we
want<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:49.950> actual<00:00:50.550> legitimate<00:00:51.000> photocopy<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
want at actual legitimate photocopy and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.410 
want at actual legitimate photocopy and
so<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.980> application<00:00:53.610> essentially<00:00:54.180> does

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
so this application essentially does

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.450

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
areas and then you can crop the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.569 
areas and then you can crop the
rectangle<00:02:04.140> areas<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.590> select<00:02:04.920> only<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.310> area

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
rectangle areas to select only the area

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.219 
rectangle areas to select only the area
that<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.850> want<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.060> scan<00:02:06.450> then<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.899> click<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
that you want to scan then you click the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.109 
that you want to scan then you click the
cleanup<00:02:07.680> button<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.580> will<00:02:08.610> clean<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.030> up

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
cleanup button and it will clean it up

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.330 
cleanup button and it will clean it up
and<00:02:09.239> essentially<00:02:09.720> work<00:02:09.899> its<00:02:10.110> magic<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.709> turn

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
and essentially work its magic and turn

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.690 
and essentially work its magic and turn
it<00:02:11.489> into<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.970> little

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
it into a little

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.220 
it into a little
we'll<00:02:12.790> scanner<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.540> actually<00:02:13.720> looks<00:02:14.080> like

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
we'll scanner and it actually looks like

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.720 
we'll scanner and it actually looks like
we<00:02:14.379> went<00:02:14.530> through<00:02:14.739> a<00:02:14.800> photocopier<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:15.550> that's

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
we went through a photocopier and that's

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.640 
we went through a photocopier and that's
actually<00:02:16.090> pretty<00:02:16.450> neat<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:17.230> can<00:02:17.379> do<00:02:17.500> this

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
actually pretty neat you can do this

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.530 
actually pretty neat you can do this
with<00:02:17.709> more<00:02:18.099> than<00:02:18.370> just<00:02:18.670> your<00:02:18.760> pictures<00:02:19.360> that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.000 
you've drawn as you can see here I have
my<00:02:21.340> trigonometry<00:02:22.030> book<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.379> can<00:02:23.590> copy<00:02:23.769> this

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
my trigonometry book and I can copy this

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.559 
my trigonometry book and I can copy this
random<00:02:24.430> page<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.819> I've<00:02:24.940> turned<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.330> out<00:02:25.480> of

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
random page that I've turned to out of

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.270 
random page that I've turned to out of
the<00:02:25.629> trigonometry<00:02:26.319> book<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.739> let's<00:02:27.010> show<00:02:27.250> you

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
the trigonometry book and let's show you

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.920 
the trigonometry book and let's show you
some<00:02:27.519> examples<00:02:27.640> here's<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.360> picture<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.750> took

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
some examples here's the picture I took

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.380 
some examples here's the picture I took
of<00:02:29.080> my<00:02:29.319> trig<00:02:29.620> book<00:02:29.650> without<00:02:30.370> any<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:31.269> the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
of my trig book without any of the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.610 
of my trig book without any of the
editing<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.870> as<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.019> can<00:02:32.140> see<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.380> looks<00:02:32.530> like

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
editing and as you can see it looks like

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.259 
editing and as you can see it looks like

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
a boring picture of my trig book and

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.750 
a boring picture of my trig book and
then<00:02:34.660> right<00:02:34.870> here<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.739> finished<00:02:36.099> product

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
then right here is the finished product

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.610 
then right here is the finished product
the<00:02:36.910> scanned<00:02:37.450> version<00:02:37.569> of<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.080> trig<00:02:38.290> book<00:02:38.319> and

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
the scanned version of the trig book and

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.710 
the scanned version of the trig book and
I<00:02:38.650> actually<00:02:38.799> printed<00:02:39.400> this<00:02:39.519> out<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:40.180> use<00:02:40.420> with

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
I actually printed this out to use with

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.210 
I actually printed this out to use with
my<00:02:40.870> class<00:02:41.140> so<00:02:41.349> I<00:02:41.410> didn't<00:02:41.620> have<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.799> lug<00:02:42.069> the

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
my class so I didn't have to lug the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.400 
my class so I didn't have to lug the
book<00:02:42.459> with<00:02:42.670> me<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:43.599> once<00:02:44.110> you're<00:02:44.260> done

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
your phone and so that is basically how

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.270 
your phone and so that is basically how
it<00:03:16.480> works<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:16.930> that's<00:03:17.109> basically<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.650> only

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
it works and that's basically the only

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.949 
it works and that's basically the only
thing<00:03:18.609> that<00:03:18.760> this<00:03:18.850> application<00:03:19.480> does<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:19.930> I

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
thing that this application does and I

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.479 
thing that this application does and I
think<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.319> does<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.620> pretty<00:03:20.859> well<00:03:21.100> as<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.400> can

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
think it does it pretty well as you can

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.629 
think it does it pretty well as you can
see<00:03:21.549> here<00:03:21.970> example<00:03:22.810> other<00:03:23.680> example<00:03:24.400> I<00:03:24.549> don't

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.789 
see here example other example I don't
know<00:03:24.940> why<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.120> just<00:03:25.269> did<00:03:25.600> that<00:03:25.660> but<00:03:26.319> now<00:03:26.470> looking

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
know why I just did that but now looking

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.620 
know why I just did that but now looking
at<00:03:26.889> the<00:03:27.010> application<00:03:27.130> I<00:03:27.790> really<00:03:28.209> like<00:03:28.329> some<00:03:28.540> of

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.300 
at the application I really like some of
the<00:03:28.690> things<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:28.989> they<00:03:29.200> did<00:03:29.260> with<00:03:29.560> it<00:03:29.590> such<00:03:30.130> as

the way that they organize everything

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.400 
the way that they organize everything
right<00:03:46.150> here<00:03:46.329> you<00:03:46.450> can<00:03:46.569> click<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.870> arrow<00:03:47.079> and

and I really like the way that it

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.620 
and I really like the way that it
organizes<00:03:51.100> it<00:03:51.280> via<00:03:51.670> state<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.269> so<00:03:52.450> pretty

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
organizes it via state and so pretty

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.360 
organizes it via state and so pretty
much<00:03:52.840> that's<00:03:53.079> it<00:03:53.290> for<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.500> application<00:03:53.920> very

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
much that's it for the application very

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.860 
much that's it for the application very
simple<00:03:54.819> but<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.030> does<00:03:55.209> something<00:03:55.569> that<00:03:55.599> we've

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
simple but it does something that we've

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.110 
simple but it does something that we've
always<00:03:56.139> wanted<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.709> do<00:03:56.859> with<00:03:57.069> our<00:03:57.220> phones<00:03:57.489> so
