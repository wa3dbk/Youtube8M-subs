00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
as well we took the same 25 trees and we

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.840 
as well we took the same 25 trees and we
looked<00:03:52.570> at<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.840> exact<00:03:53.350> same<00:03:53.740> block<00:03:54.280> of<00:03:54.550> code

in terms of length and war and peace and

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.700 
in terms of length and war and peace and
we<00:03:57.580> discovered<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.180> found<00:03:58.420> all<00:03:58.630> 25<00:03:59.080> trees<00:03:59.470> in

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
we discovered you found all 25 trees in

we discovered you found all 25 trees in

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
that same block of code that's just

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.840 
that same block of code that's just
because<00:04:02.140> letters<00:04:02.710> have<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.040> frequency<00:04:03.640> and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
because letters have a frequency and

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.970 
because letters have a frequency and
they<00:04:03.940> there's<00:04:04.270> a<00:04:04.330> probabilistic<00:04:05.320> chance<00:04:05.800> that

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
they there's a probabilistic chance that

that can be just the operation of
