00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.429
 Welcome to my first son Fixed to the o2 o heights today 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.789
 I show you as you do 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.789
 Girls are way reasonably well able to draw 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.829
 actually very unfavorable the program if you do not take a sign that 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.789
 but I'll show you like you 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.009
 actually can cope quite well without incident 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.160
 it's afraid of that 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.350
 where are tools 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.010
 important 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.010
 It is located in the Thul window 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.190
 Percent is you look like a like that 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.180
 if this man say 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.610
 the 11th 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.100
 therefore, a topic could be looking for that is the goal of getting tickets on it 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.370
 and with this tool you have the option to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.970
 to draw a box with as many points as you want 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.480
 So I think that one before 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.469
 So backgrounds calculator where you want and how you want 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.770
 and in the end you just connect them again 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.240
 with the starting point 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.880
 then you have such a box 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.880
 and so you can draw relatively well 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.280
 if you go to a new point so we just added a new corner train 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.060
 Left mouse button 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.130
 and to delete it again 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.620
 there it sounds on the object 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.130
 and then right mouse button 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.290
 and then just 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.290
 Percent Gellert 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.450
 so he could then draw for different forms Naumann and the program 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.450
 improved because I'm not there either 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.170
 Tandler pen again 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.870
 and prince so you can, for example, a purchase 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.820
 that also makes the skin color right away I have a fast deep well 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.790
 select 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.390
 and profit the smaller the gaps between the 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.329
 Points are 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.409
 and so 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.239
 and to be tethered in an angular way that's clear 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.539
 brinckmann 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:20.279
 So round if you can 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:24.540
 small distance Windhoek Nature Test round and it hurts if Niger really like that 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.129
 Mahnkopf helps out rightly 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.129
 that was taking samples now 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:33.649
 "I have nothing to get 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:35.760
 but I can improve on that later 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.909
 that also fixes the good on one like oh you can still improve 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:42.519
 inside and 2 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.389
 It's so easy because of this program 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.139
 Henze does not exist 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.139
 a kind of Maier works alongside 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.099
 I would have it again soon 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.999
 rather 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.569
 ZavescaÂ® no objective net principle 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.800
 Really the program easy 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.019
 for every object 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.919
 a new level 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.699
 and that's what makes it so easy for them 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:05.549
 his 18th 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.029
 edit such time frames 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:11.939
 a little devil 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.799
 the listeners 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.589
 also have each 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:16.959
 a new level 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.489
 Time I can now know consumers d'italia so said drawing 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:24.849
 good that she does not like it all 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.199
 for Jan Tauer us on 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.799
 but I think that's enough to illustrate you can do it then yes 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.799
 to make a little d'italia 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:38.689
 By the way, in the next step, I explain RÃ¶hm as here 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.870
 of course, I can use it correctly to animate with the program 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.479
 again the same thing 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.859
 so you can understand that better 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:48.949
 the program 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.129
 also a time to work that is 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.929
 Venier on 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:57.769
 now for example the eyes are I have seen 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.379
 m is time 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.379
 For example, first that an app watch salvation 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.890
 and who after some time 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.399
 Kansas then calculate 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:08.319
 but that is also the case 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.719
 Help 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.089
 calculator 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:15.329
 because he is a bit slower and dramas 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.289
 also 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.329
 AR Rahman that I still 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.599
 Do you know the EU so record the program with which you do 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.340
 open at the same time 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.719
 and that 5 8 to 6 memory 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:34.099
 Now you can see that the program actually has a very good one 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.490
 Color selection that is 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.990
 choose a lot of colors 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.990
 and Dirk pretty fast 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.559
 especially and right hand 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:50.559
 so 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.139
 Of course, everything is forced 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:02.120
 Do not scare us something looks weird 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.159
 I have to say honestly 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.529
 Hensel can get you a lot easier times than with this program 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:11.589
 because it is not on objective work 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:14.430
 but on sign language 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.430
 technical level 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.870
 because now two more eyes and then even better the horns and 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.199
 Subjects the top of the head 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.199
 because that does not look that great right now 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.080
 we look here at the side you can see all the objects you can 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.449
 also understand if you for example 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.370
 first made the eye out or something 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.270
 then it is from Stuhr ash layer 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.460
 behind the head 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.889
 then you can give her more postpone and put her over her head like that 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.129
 that you really are the eye 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.129
 last changeable took over again 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.270
 just as you can see it too shrill 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.650
 shows the progress of Sentix 2 Bio 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.979
 do not draw anymore 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:24.960
 especially no one more animation 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.819
 they can be very very very very fluid and kidneys 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:30.969
 a life the program 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:34.389
 because you do not have to do all the individual pictures yourself but that 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:36.550
 Program calculates the pictures 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.120
 you change that way Stone 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.409
 the picture 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:42.729
 and 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.309
 the program then calculates the time 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:48.309
 between the whole world already in the second picture 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:53.580
 the percent promoted that the second story 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.580
 this is shown by the youngest 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.319
 Arzfeld sent English 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.699
 im drawing 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:04.699
 only in the program is not quite ready 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.930
 I would probably not convince the name 

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:12.449
 but not to use this program 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.469
 Just look at the second goal for goal 

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:17.590
 Please find the animation 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.590
 the vehicle swing Norman Perschen tutorial 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:24.490
 and the college 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.490
 have fun and 2
