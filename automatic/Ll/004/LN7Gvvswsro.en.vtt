00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
right there but he's the exact same I do

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.810 
right there but he's the exact same I do

and oh I just say state in fact again
the<00:06:10.689> reason<00:06:10.990> why<00:06:11.080> there's<00:06:11.259> no<00:06:11.349> background

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800

sound<00:06:12.189> I<00:06:12.490> don't<00:06:12.789> know<00:06:12.909> why<00:06:13.240> but<00:06:13.599> I<00:06:13.749> have<00:06:14.379> a

sound I don't know why but I have a

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:16.469 
sound I don't know why but I have a
theory<00:06:15.039> is<00:06:15.399> probably<00:06:15.699> because<00:06:16.119> when<00:06:16.300> I<00:06:16.360> was

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
theory is probably because when I was

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.499 
theory is probably because when I was
recording<00:06:16.779> i<00:06:17.110> was<00:06:17.229> listening<00:06:17.499> to<00:06:17.589> music<00:06:18.509> again
