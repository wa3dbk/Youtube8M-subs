00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 but for now miller talked 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.240
 Deputy Chancellor Merkel herself in 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.700
 the Bundestag acted with wrathful 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.469
 statements to Russia but not 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.130
 all her words met with understanding 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.809
 reporting Michael Antonov in Germany 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.520
 the end of the heating season in the last 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.439
 two weeks of average temperature in Berlin 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.119
 12 and a half degrees inlet 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.100
 Bundestag line of tourists going 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.630
 peep down from the dome 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.789
 plenary meetings where at this moment 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.010
 there is a discussion about the Ukrainian crisis and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.779
 angel merkel gently catches cold 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.850
 in the Russian-German relations 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.500
 if Russia will not obey 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.170
 punish in 3 stages says chancellor 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.489
 listing everything from visa restrictions to 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.530
 curtailing economic 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.050
 cooperation that of course extreme measures 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.239
 but the Crimean referendum is not on the constitution 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.379
 about kosovo which tore off west from serbia 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.399
 upon the adoption of the declaration 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.530
 independence is completely different when 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.390
 the world community did not undertake 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.850
 any action to stop 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.649
 ethnic cleansing milosevic sanctions and 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.930
 negotiations proved ineffective 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.640
 so nato without a mandate he went on 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.530
 military intervention because 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.519
 Negotiations with near he blocked 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.799
 the Russian side 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.020
 Once again you can not compare today's 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.360
 the situation of Ukraine and the events of that time 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.860
 braids it turns out that to justify 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.670
 independence must necessarily 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.740
 shed blood 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.320
 they desire to wait for this violation 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.600
 international law of Russia to act 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.490
 from a position of strength so the 21st century is impossible 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.369
 says the chancellor to applause 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.290
 forgetting about iraq and about livia and thanks 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.810
 to Minister Steinmeier for mediating 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.270
 Kiev again claps everything except the faction 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.630
 left and thighs gregor giza favors 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.400
 The main opponent of the measurements surprises me 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.560
 what are you measuring say like 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.329
 referendum contradict the constitution you 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.670
 decide when she acts 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.890
 when there is no with the resignation of the president she is not 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.079
 valid and during the referendum it suddenly 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.090
 re-enters into force, decide 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.430
 do you support the constitution entirely 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.830
 or just some 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.570
 son of the rack but has no more insight in 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.880
 the left has sparked Merkelâ€™s claim 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.200
 that the German authorities support the fact that 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.680
 calls himself new ukrainian 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.680
 by the government 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.840
 mrs merkel ibiza prime minister 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.220
 defense minister of agriculture 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.450
 Minister of the Environment 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.709
 the attorney general is all fascists 7 by 6 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.900
 the head of the security council was 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.220
 the founder of the fascist party freedom 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.450
 there is freedom for the fascists 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.510
 occupied important posts in government 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.700
 power structures dominate not when 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.709
 the fascists voluntarily did not give up power 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.350
 slim managed to grab at least her 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.810
 part and germany should have pointed to 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.670
 this is based on your own story all 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.920
 this cussler listened with a tense face 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.750
 she doesn't like it that said giza 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.370
 and not smiling prospect of sanctions on 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.620
 which Germany is partly behind 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.209
 company risking thirty billion 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.459
 who annually bring the Germans 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.410
 trade with Russia and three hundred thousand 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.720
 jobs tied up also on 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.520
 Russian market and by chance the chancellor 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.380
 merkel sits in this room on two floors 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.000
 higher behind closed doors and and 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.920
 deputy vice chancellor gabriel 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.769
 discusses business with the head of Gazprom 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.510
 Alexey Miller with affairs order then 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.310
 what happened today in the Bundestag is 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.840
 such a political illusion if 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.730
 pay attention only to the main 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.900
 the scene is very easy to be deceived and 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.370
 it can deliver to someone 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.560
 pleasure but in order to 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.239
 to understand everything is necessary 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.070
 peeking behind closed doors 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.260
