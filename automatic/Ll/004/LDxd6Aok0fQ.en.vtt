00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.269
 Hi everyone, how are you? 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.609
 everything great with you this video of 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.380
 today is an ideal day to 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.539
 doing a coffee table with 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.119
 pallets a do it yourself 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.490
 coffee tables with pallets and before 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.310
 Let 200,000 fans come 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.550
 talk I copied datacell korea no 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.079
 I did not copy tasselli to my colleague and even 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.489
 if I had copied I do not think I would have 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.620
 had no problem whatsoever after 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.469
 she put the video on the air to 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.300
 just to be copied already said the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.539
 old get-together nothing is created everything if 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.850
 copy and can not be if it is not me 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.039
 I visited a website called the internet 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.690
 point with the team leave the link here 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.340
 underneath the site so that you have 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.230
 ideas that I know that I 'm talking about 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.989
 there sure who is crazy about 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.340
 decoration as I will find several 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.930
 cool ideas 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.550
 Something else I want to tell you. 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.840
 I do not know if the audio will be good 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.820
 because after all I'm 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.790
 recording with the cell phone 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.320
 It's another thing, too, that I'm going to talk. 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.000
 is that you can see that in the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.390
 coffee table has some little holes 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.159
 where are nails going and I did not want to close 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.770
 so I left this hole 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.630
 way is very rustic and one idea is that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.880
 you can put a video 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.250
 mirror on the small table that 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.970
 learn how you do well with me, let's go 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.790
 Learning how to now we are 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.470
 measuring because the pallet fmi and the people 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.979
 brought from the company he works is 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.320
 very big and we're measuring 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.909
 right to cut so you do not get a 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.170
 a dining table instead of a coffee table 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.960
 of center right 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.939
 and he gives me measuring there is scratching to 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.210
 to be able to cut 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.610
 we cut the table with the saw 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.939
 marble that everyone knows as in the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.369
 and we cut with it but we 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.120
 You do not have the marble saw at home. 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.030
 have pro 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.320
 neither can you do is the cut of this 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.910
 wood with a saw or even 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.390
 that sawmill knows those lines 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.770
 which is usually something like that in the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.410
 construction 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.850
 good, anyway, we can not 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.440
 need a marble saw is that the 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.810
 We had people at home, so I ended up staying 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.570
 easier but you can cut normal 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.400
 lincon saw or with a sawmill 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.460
 those hopscotch then watch the video 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.170
 Korean, this is how she stayed 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.590
 after we made the cut she did not 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.120
 it's finished, it's not even 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.090
 We had not done anything. 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.880
 Closed in nothing yet, and the next 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.610
 Now I'm going to pick up a sandpaper. 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.890
