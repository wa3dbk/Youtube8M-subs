 let us rejoice a little 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.759
 day in the company of a new one 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.590
 smartphone from will test today not 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.980

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.870
 simply a quick unboxing 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.660
 smartphone in question lg optimus and le 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.199

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.379

 company of 5 and 7 of second 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:53.210
 smartphone generation than compared to 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.239
 its predecessor optimus l3 presents one 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.379
 slightly more rounded shape 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.770
 narrow and light 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:12.350
 let's see it a bit closely 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:18.369
 we open the marcon pack of solos 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:23.390
 minus the colors white black and pink 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:27.590
 here it is we have to say we take away the 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.009
 very nice film ergonomics is 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.979
 certainly good thanks to the size 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:38.509
 reduced the knurled back cover 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.909
 allows a firm grip at 3.2 inches 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.950
 of screen allow you to reach it 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.509
 smartphone with the use of only one 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.509
 hand in every situation 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.860
 see you next to the smartphone 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.549
 now let's see the content 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:00.610
 of the packaging that it contains 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:04.579
 the classic instruction manuals 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.830
 we find the earphones with stimuli 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:14.180
 dedicated answer 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:17.660
 then we find a battery charger 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.020
 from 1540 milan per hour then slightly 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:26.620
 more enhanced than his 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:29.600
 predecessor who had it since 1500 e 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.230
 usb cable between charging and exchange 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.020
 we put everything with the computer 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.480
 in the package 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.330
 let 's say the battery and see a little more 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.860
 up close this smartphone smartphone 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:50.300
 which presents dimensions of 102.6 per 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.459
 61.1 x 11.9 mm thick and 107 grams 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.459
 of weight 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:58.330
 we find in the upper part button 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:02.810
 ignition jack for earphones 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:06.470
 volume rocker is in the part 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.280
 below we find microphone and door 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.280
 micro usb 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.120
 as you can see you're wondering where 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.820
 are the soft touches are present but yes 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.019
 only illuminate when it is 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:24.200
 smartphone the display case is on 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:28.400
 off they turn off too we will find 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.190
 two softouch back button and menu button 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.140
 very nice thing because this is second 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:40.600
 me does not have a more refined line 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:45.500
 smartphone line even more satisfying 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:50.030
 thanks to the home button which is equipped with LEDs 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.940
 notification of several multicolored and yes 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.140
 will illuminate of different colors depending on 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:01.820
 of the incoming notification in the part 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.220
 higher we find the speaker and 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.660
 proximity sensor 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.450
 the back we find one 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.350
 3 megapixel camera which unfortunately 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:16.280
 as often happens in the entry range 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:19.370
 level has no flash LED e 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.410
 autofocus in this case 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.720
 smart phones also equipped with a sensor 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.340
 of brightness in fact we will not find 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.960
 in the settings the brightness 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.690
 automatic but we should set it 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.870
 manually 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.860
 let's go then go on for 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.470
 the first time this smartphone 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.730
 We remember a little the characteristics is 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:49.500
 equipped with andrÃ© 412 jelly beans with 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:51.870
 interface optimus ui 3.0 processor 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.620
 qualcomm snapdragon put 1 single core 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.430
 from 1 gigahertz then the predecessor 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:03.600
 he always had a single core but from 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:06.240
 800 megahertz gpu adreno 200 512 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.510
 megabytes of RAM 4 GB of internal memory 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.340
 where 1.6 gigabytes are available 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.340
 user 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.600
 let's go and turn it on we see 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:21.870
 here you see soft touch appearing is 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.110
 the notification led lights up differently 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.110
 colors 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.940
 definitely this smartphone entry 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.530
 level value for money is 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.410
 really great 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:41.750
 then logical compared with smartphone by 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:45.330
 other bands we can hear the flaws we say 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:49.350
 however for his false band he does the 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:52.260
 his duty admirably single point a 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.040
 bit negative if on one hand the size 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:59.460
 of the display allows just an excellent 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.170
 ergonomics on the other hand is a bit limited to 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.020
 example in the display of pages 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:10.410
 web reading articles as one 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:15.480
 larger screen would be better nothing 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:17.280
 I would say that for today in the company of lg 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:22.610
 optimus and the second generation three 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.610
 it's all a greeting from ivan demand reward
