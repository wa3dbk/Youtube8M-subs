00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.970
 Leon Panetta lifted the ban that stopped women from being in combat 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.450
 Jobs in the army As you can imagine conservatives were not 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.349
 Happy about that now we have 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.739
 The Senate stopped talking about what people see and so this is the facility 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.259
 Senator James Inhoff 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.599
 He has some fantastic quotations about this 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.800
 Saying I want to know everyone knows that the Senate Armed Forces 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.830
 I am a senior member will have a period of supervision and review 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.340
 During that time if necessary we will be able to introduce legislation to stop 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.720
 Any changes that are believed to be harmful to our fighting forces 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.620
 Their capabilities I think they will be cases were the legislation becomes 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.500
 So this is necessary before any review of how they are actually going to 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.770
 The implementation of changes Leon Panetta spose 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.140
 And it's really mean that the conservatives do not worry about doing everything I do 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.500
 Can stop the guns of women I suppose wonder why women are the last 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.830
 Not sure Republicans represent them I think we are within your perfect but I'm a Wes 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.090
 You are postponed here 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.939
 I'm sure he had his wristband 

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:05.580
 Reasonable meal unit because I did not KAVERI people who is 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.820
 My right-wing love 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.170
 Normally any knowledge works 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.330
 No Kang toward his son 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.520
 Helicopters and fire 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.000
 We did not have the female she's like 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.170
 The earth was the happiest 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.850
 We did not have any female pilots even though we were in the flying earning class 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.010
 did that 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.670
 Because they were so much 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.040
 Because it is the unity of confrontation 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.000
 When I was a kid we trained 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.240
 With female like 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.920
 You call some dance camp or you 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.400
 You have a supreme year 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.110
 Perhaps we put six or seven females in 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.400
 It was great 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.520
 physically 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.450
 There was not one of them to complete a forced march 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.810
 There was not one of them that could 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.500
 Keeping up even among the weakest men they use cocaine 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.620
 This is the woman who 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.620
 Department of education and further destruction in the army to become 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.720
 The motivated officer of these people really 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.510
 For those special women uh ... maybe not but I think if they do 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.630
 Imposing a strict standard it is not gonna make a difference I think 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.229
 The number one problem with the army is now in women 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.639
 Rate of sexual abuse in 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.250
 Also it is about 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.099
 Female error 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.729
 Uh ... so that they want several times to say the bottom line is 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:22.799
 You pass the test president and if you can do it you can do it mean 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.489
 So what you think looks like 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.079
 It's a crazy situation let's say you're back in your online security if you notice 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.909
 There we must go back and it's like an enemy army in California 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.590
 Give up further withdrawal of these 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.599
 The project 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.669
 What you think is that it may not exceed 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:43.569
 Get my back 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.559
 And if they can not then physically do you do not care religion does not make 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:48.250
 Difference 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.560
 Right Netanyahu says that if I can say that I was not sailors I was not 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.650
 Find out if I know it like you do not need to know Sanders 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.379
 Enable the battle in the day on the same day there are a lot of fifteen years 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.619
 Years that are not the right thing to do 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:05.819
 Now even when it comes to the issue of sexual assault rate 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.359
 Look at that huge cultural case Kuz Yu 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.429
 It's not being taken seriously 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:12.419
 Then 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.519
 Now we have numbers of women who have sexual assault and rape in 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.709
 Army use 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.140
 unbelievable 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.140
 Yes power some conservatives say you know one reason we do not want 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.850
 Women in frontline combat sites because the opportunity for the enemy rape 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.739
 they 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.309
 I was raped and they already let's do something about the right side and look 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:33.289
 The answer is not so good this is one of the right to seek my woman from there 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:35.269
 Dancers let's do something about the rate 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.819
 Yes pregnancy because it is from the same organic mentality I mean 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.950
 People say the trip is the reason for the standard parental argument just 'it 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.280
 The same argument that Muslim extremists have against women is walking around with 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.659
 Hair exposed everything else is 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.849
 Man ritual we can not control ourselves in this breakfast 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.110
 Quick and put an end to it ... uh this point 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.059
 A woman on the Israeli army 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:59.989
 And needs to do just fine 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.589
 The IDF's wake to the army is 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:08.479
 Close it is not looking at the middle body body pictures were a group of 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:11.749
 But obviously does not destroy the Israeli army so I think we should 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:13.219
 There is much more serious to enforce
