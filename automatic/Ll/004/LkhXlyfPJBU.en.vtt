simple mobile work order system
essentially<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.210> does<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
essentially what it does is I on the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.650 
essentially what it does is I on the
Left<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.170> have<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.520> Windows<00:00:20.520> 32<00:00:20.939> bit<00:00:21.359> based

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
Left I have a Windows 32 bit based

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.340 
Left I have a Windows 32 bit based
application<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.699> feeds<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.420> mobile

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
application and it feeds the mobile

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.980 
application and it feeds the mobile
handset<00:00:26.029> would<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.119> all<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.420> information

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
handset would have all this information

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.419 
handset would have all this information
so<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.199> customer<00:00:28.560> name<00:00:28.619> address<00:00:28.920> city<00:00:29.310> state
