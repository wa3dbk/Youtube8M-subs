setting<00:00:20.990> up<00:00:21.080> on<00:00:21.260> the<00:00:21.380> stone<00:00:21.619> you<00:00:22.039> can<00:00:22.189> lay<00:00:22.279> the

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
setting up on the stone you can lay the

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.060 
setting up on the stone you can lay the
knife<00:00:22.580> flat<00:00:22.910> and<00:00:23.180> you<00:00:23.840> can<00:00:23.990> raise<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:24.800> spine

up<00:00:25.250> just<00:00:25.460> a<00:00:25.550> little<00:00:25.580> bit<00:00:25.929> people<00:00:26.929> talk<00:00:27.199> about

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
up just a little bit people talk about

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.960 
up just a little bit people talk about
degrees<00:00:27.800> usually<00:00:28.189> every<00:00:28.519> man<00:00:28.670> will<00:00:28.849> be<00:00:28.880> a

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
degrees usually every man will be a

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.730 
degrees usually every man will be a
little<00:00:29.119> bit<00:00:29.300> different<00:00:29.480> this<00:00:29.990> one<00:00:30.199> feels<00:00:30.500> to

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
little bit different this one feels to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.950 
little bit different this one feels to
be<00:00:30.859> about<00:00:31.039> a<00:00:31.099> 10<00:00:31.369> degree<00:00:31.519> angle<00:00:32.029> so<00:00:32.300> I'll<00:00:32.810> keep

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
be about a 10 degree angle so I'll keep

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.750 
be about a 10 degree angle so I'll keep
the<00:00:33.080> knife<00:00:33.260> like<00:00:33.470> that<00:00:33.740> so<00:00:34.250> when<00:00:34.460> sharpening

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760

the knife like that so when sharpening
I'll<00:00:35.210> start<00:00:35.510> on<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.690> bottom<00:00:35.960> of<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:36.110> stone

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
I'll start on the bottom of the stone

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.380 
I'll start on the bottom of the stone
and<00:00:36.820> apply<00:00:37.820> pressure<00:00:39.370> up<00:00:40.370> the<00:00:40.610> stone<00:00:40.850> like<00:00:41.180> so

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390

stone<00:01:49.070> dry<00:01:49.310> out<00:01:49.460> just<00:01:49.700> add<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:49.880> little<00:01:50.030> bit<00:01:50.180> more

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
stone dry out just add a little bit more

stone dry out just add a little bit more
water<00:01:50.600> per<00:01:50.810> stone

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.469 

and<00:01:56.720> again<00:01:57.080> just<00:01:57.260> working<00:01:57.680> down<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:59.270> length

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
and again just working down the length

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.560 
and again just working down the length
of<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.780> blade<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.940> can<00:02:01.940> you<00:02:02.060> check<00:02:02.240> for<00:02:02.299> that

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
of the blade so can you check for that

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.320 
of the blade so can you check for that
bevel<00:02:02.960> see<00:02:03.920> if<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.070> raise<00:02:04.250> an<00:02:04.460> edge<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.119> once

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
bevel see if you raise an edge and once

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.969 
bevel see if you raise an edge and once
you<00:02:05.479> achieve<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:06.050> you<00:02:06.380> can<00:02:06.530> turn<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.830> knife

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
you achieve that you can turn the knife

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.669 
you achieve that you can turn the knife
over<00:02:07.190> now<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:08.479> can<00:02:08.600> lift<00:02:08.750> up<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.020> spine<00:02:09.319> a

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
over now and you can lift up the spine a

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.650 
over now and you can lift up the spine a
little<00:02:10.399> bit<00:02:10.490> more<00:02:10.670> than<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.910> front<00:02:11.180> side<00:02:11.360> and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
little bit more than the front side and

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.360 
little bit more than the front side and
you'll<00:02:11.840> feel<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.170> sort<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.739> click<00:02:12.980> in<00:02:13.130> there

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
you'll feel that sort of click in there

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.820 
you'll feel that sort of click in there
and<00:02:13.450> once<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.569> get<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.750> angle<00:02:15.200> set<00:02:15.440> you're

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
and once you get that angle set you're

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.380 
and once you get that angle set you're
just<00:02:16.010> going<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.190> now<00:02:16.400> apply<00:02:16.760> pressure<00:02:16.970> on<00:02:17.270> your

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
just going to now apply pressure on your

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.190 
just going to now apply pressure on your
down<00:02:17.569> stroke

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
down stroke

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.160 
down stroke
let's<00:02:19.040> on<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.370> upstroke<00:02:20.620> like<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:24.020> guys

let's on the upstroke like so you guys

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.660 
let's on the upstroke like so you guys
keep<00:02:24.350> in<00:02:24.470> mind<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.770> need<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.190> turn<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.520> knife

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
keep in mind you need to turn the knife

keep in mind you need to turn the knife
a<00:02:25.819> little<00:02:26.030> bit<00:02:26.150> once<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.569> get<00:02:26.690> down<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:27.020> the

a little bit once you get down to the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.920 
a little bit once you get down to the
heel<00:02:27.940> this<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.180> handle<00:02:29.540> doesn't<00:02:29.660> hit<00:02:29.900> the

heel this so the handle doesn't hit the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.860 
heel this so the handle doesn't hit the
stone

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.229 

step<00:02:36.440> through<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.650> few<00:02:36.860> seconds<00:02:37.370> on<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.060> length

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
step through a few seconds on the length

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.470 
step through a few seconds on the length
of<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.450> blade<00:02:39.550> even<00:02:40.550> notice<00:02:40.879> that<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.209> bars

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
of the blade even notice that the bars

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.000 
of the blade even notice that the bars
gonna<00:02:41.780> start<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.170> come<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.530> front<00:02:42.650> side

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
gonna start to come to the front side

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.070
