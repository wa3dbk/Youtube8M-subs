like I said the give the appearance do

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.370 
like I said the give the appearance do
you<00:02:31.239> feel<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.540> calf<00:02:31.750> skin<00:02:32.019> you<00:02:32.140> get<00:02:32.200> that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
you feel the calf skin you get that

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.530 
you feel the calf skin you get that
warmth<00:02:32.769> and<00:02:32.980> they<00:02:33.400> just<00:02:33.549> they<00:02:33.940> crack<00:02:34.329> they're

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
warmth and they just they crack they're

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.479 
warmth and they just they crack they're
great<00:02:34.810> they're<00:02:35.140> just<00:02:35.350> not<00:02:35.530> as<00:02:35.650> bright<00:02:35.890> as<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.100> g1

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
great they're just not as bright as a g1

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.580 
great they're just not as bright as a g1
so<00:02:36.820> if<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.359> like<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.720> brightness<00:02:38.109> the<00:02:38.290> g1

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
so if you like that brightness the g1

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.750 
so if you like that brightness the g1
might<00:02:38.739> still<00:02:38.950> be<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.100> choice<00:02:39.280> for<00:02:39.340> use<00:02:39.579> but

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
might still be the choice for use but

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.240 
might still be the choice for use but
you<00:02:39.850> can<00:02:39.940> tell<00:02:40.299> this<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.600> not<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:41.250> ridiculously

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
you can tell this is not a ridiculously

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.340 
you can tell this is not a ridiculously
deep<00:02:42.519> sounding<00:02:43.390> head<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.019> hasn't<00:02:44.230> got<00:02:44.320> a

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
deep sounding head it hasn't got a

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.440 
deep sounding head it hasn't got a
really<00:02:44.590> deep<00:02:44.890> fundamental<00:02:45.100> which<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.180> still

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
really deep fundamental which is still

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.180 
really deep fundamental which is still
great<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.840> know<00:02:46.959> it's<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.590> same<00:02:47.799> weight<00:02:48.040> as

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
great you know it's the same weight as
