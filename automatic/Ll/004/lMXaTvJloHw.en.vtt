00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.350 
got this thing inside that there refer
to<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.430> what<00:02:14.550> English<00:02:14.700> got<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.000> hygiene

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
to this is what English got the hygiene

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.750 
to this is what English got the hygiene
layer<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.630> think<00:02:15.870> they<00:02:15.930> call<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.170> and

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
layer I think they call it and

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.190 
layer I think they call it and
essentially<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:18.270> like<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.510> another<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.080> I've

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
essentially it's like a another so I've

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.350 
essentially it's like a another so I've
mummified<00:02:19.620> part<00:02:19.920> inside<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.030> will<00:02:21.120> crawl

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
mummified part inside so you will crawl

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
is I'm going to try this in a couple of

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.950 
is I'm going to try this in a couple of
different<00:02:43.580> configurations<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.570> show<00:02:44.720> you

I'm going to put it inside my hammock
and<00:02:46.880> I'm<00:02:47.090> going<00:02:47.240> to<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.480> bit<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.810> an<00:02:47.900> idea<00:02:48.170> for

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
and I'm going to a bit of an idea for

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.870 
and I'm going to a bit of an idea for
outside<00:02:48.770> I'm<00:02:48.950> going<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.190> put<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.430> together<00:02:49.550> see

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
outside I'm going to put it together see

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.070 
outside I'm going to put it together see
if<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.060> works

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
if it works

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.260 
if it works
hope<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.650> enjoy<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:51.920> so<00:02:52.160> function<00:02:53.060> what<00:02:53.180> you

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
hope you enjoy it so function what you

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.910 
hope you enjoy it so function what you
did<00:02:53.450> what<00:02:53.750> do<00:02:53.900> know<00:02:54.050> is<00:02:54.110> I'll<00:02:54.470> fold<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.800> all<00:02:54.890> up

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
did what do know is I'll fold it all up

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.940 
did what do know is I'll fold it all up
so<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.730> can<00:02:55.820> see<00:02:55.910> how<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.150> all<00:02:56.240> goes<00:02:56.300> together

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
so you can see how it all goes together

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.220 
so you can see how it all goes together
as<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.190> weight-wise<00:02:58.850> it's<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.570> bit<00:02:59.720> cumbersome

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
as it weight-wise it's a bit cumbersome

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.650 
as it weight-wise it's a bit cumbersome
it's<00:03:00.740> sort<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.220> 2<00:03:01.370> kilos<00:03:01.790> just<00:03:02.060> over<00:03:02.300> something

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
it's sort of 2 kilos just over something

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.490 
it's sort of 2 kilos just over something
like<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:02.960> but<00:03:04.930> as<00:03:05.930> you'll<00:03:06.080> see<00:03:06.110> in<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.380> minute

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
like that but as you'll see in a minute

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.830 
like that but as you'll see in a minute
I<00:03:06.770> think<00:03:06.860> that<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.360> good<00:03:08.540> trade-off

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
I think that it is a good trade-off

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.660 
I think that it is a good trade-off
you've<00:03:09.290> got<00:03:09.500> it's<00:03:09.709> quite<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:09.950> bulky<00:03:10.340> little<00:03:10.580> bit

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
you've got it's quite a bulky little bit

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.340 
you've got it's quite a bulky little bit
heavy<00:03:10.970> not<00:03:11.600> really<00:03:11.750> designed<00:03:11.990> for<00:03:12.170> long

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
heavy not really designed for long

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.250 
heavy not really designed for long
distance<00:03:12.709> journeys<00:03:13.130> but<00:03:13.430> if<00:03:13.640> you're<00:03:14.170> having<00:03:15.170> a

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
distance journeys but if you're having a

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.870 
distance journeys but if you're having a
short<00:03:15.500> trip<00:03:15.650> into<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:15.980> woods<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.490> think<00:03:16.790> this

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
short trip into the woods I think this

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.940 
short trip into the woods I think this
is<00:03:17.000> ideal<00:03:17.360> so<00:03:17.450> I'll<00:03:18.050> put<00:03:18.320> it<00:03:18.380> all<00:03:18.440> together<00:03:18.590> now

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
is ideal so I'll put it all together now

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.740 
is ideal so I'll put it all together now
and<00:03:19.160> you<00:03:19.280> can<00:03:19.430> see<00:03:19.760> how<00:03:19.880> help<00:03:20.150> small<00:03:20.360> all<00:03:20.540> goes

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
and you can see how help small all goes

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.990 
and you can see how help small all goes
go<00:03:21.230> see<00:03:21.680> me<00:03:21.890> much<00:03:22.340> they<00:03:22.550> should<00:03:22.700> put<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:22.910> whole

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
go see me much they should put the whole

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.630 
go see me much they should put the whole
thing<00:03:23.209> away<00:03:23.300> now<00:03:23.570> and<00:03:23.630> see<00:03:23.959> how<00:03:24.050> it<00:03:24.170> goes

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
thing away now and see how it goes

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:38.589 
thing away now and see how it goes
simply<00:03:25.640> just<00:03:26.030> start<00:03:26.390> at<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.720> end<00:03:28.780> roll<00:03:29.780> up

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599

okay<00:04:51.860> so<00:04:51.920> here's<00:04:52.190> another<00:04:52.610> potential<00:04:53.180> use<00:04:53.390> for

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
okay so here's another potential use for

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.450 
okay so here's another potential use for
this<00:04:53.720> check<00:04:53.960> I'm<00:04:54.140> a<00:04:54.170> bedroll<00:04:54.560> what<00:04:55.250> I've<00:04:55.340> done

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
this check I'm a bedroll what I've done

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.940 
this check I'm a bedroll what I've done
here<00:04:55.730> is<00:04:56.000> as<00:04:56.900> you<00:04:57.110> saw<00:04:57.290> before<00:04:57.470> you<00:04:57.770> know<00:04:57.830> the

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
here is as you saw before you know the

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.740 
here is as you saw before you know the
buttons<00:04:58.160> that<00:04:58.310> are<00:04:58.430> inside<00:04:58.790> all<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.330> needed<00:04:59.660> to
