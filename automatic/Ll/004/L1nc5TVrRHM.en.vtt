00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.309 

because<00:01:48.000> I'm<00:01:48.209> an<00:01:48.300> architect<00:01:48.569> I<00:01:48.959> think<00:01:49.200> of

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
because I'm an architect I think of

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.219 
because I'm an architect I think of
physics<00:01:49.910> so<00:01:50.910> I'm<00:01:50.940> wondering<00:01:51.509> how<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.959> stands

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
physics so I'm wondering how it stands

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.710

up<00:01:52.440> so<00:01:53.009> I'm<00:01:53.130> looking<00:01:53.340> at<00:01:53.789> it<00:01:54.030> trying<00:01:54.660> to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
up so I'm looking at it trying to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.230 
up so I'm looking at it trying to
understand<00:01:55.319> it<00:01:55.560> as<00:01:55.739> a<00:01:55.770> building

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
understand it as a building

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.940 
understand it as a building
because<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.720> structural<00:01:58.350> there<00:01:58.829> are

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
because it is structural there are

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.670 
because it is structural there are
spaces<00:01:59.340> inside<00:01:59.909> their<00:02:00.450> windows<00:02:00.960> or<00:02:01.350> things

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
spaces inside their windows or things

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.470 
spaces inside their windows or things
that<00:02:01.890> remind<00:02:02.189> us

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
that remind us

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.250 
that remind us
roos<00:02:02.720> it<00:02:03.470> of<00:02:03.860> assets<00:02:04.430> of<00:02:04.610> trees<00:02:04.940> and<00:02:05.390> the

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
roos it of assets of trees and the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.160 
roos it of assets of trees and the
ground<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:07.100> that<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.540> the<00:02:09.250> thighs<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.520> it<00:02:10.700> is

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
ground and that the the thighs of it is

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.950 
ground and that the the thighs of it is
also<00:02:12.170> human<00:02:13.100> it's<00:02:13.550> human<00:02:13.910> size<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.600> it<00:02:14.750> feels

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
maybe it makes us all squirrels the arts

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.210 
maybe it makes us all squirrels the arts
are<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.569> all<00:02:42.780> about<00:02:43.140> turning<00:02:43.560> people<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:43.980> to
