 video blocks the sun at your home 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.910
 helium blocks solar system with natural circulation live is 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.230
 proposed in the version with a 150 solar collector or with 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.230
 two 250-liter storage manifolds 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.320
 elio block uses exclusivity for heating domestic hot water 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.460
 tank in tank technology 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.970
 which favors the optimal heat exchange between solar water fluid 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.000
 health 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.330
 the solar fluid in fact once heated by the sun inside the 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.240
 collector 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.910
 rises due to inertia in the outer cavity of the storage tank 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.940
 yielding heat with the hot water present in its inner part 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.210
 and ensuring a perfectly homogeneous heat exchange 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.880
 thanks to the live circulation 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.900
 the formation of limescale inside the pipes is also prevented 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.890
 thus avoiding costly cleaning and maintenance 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.460
 roll bond technology collectors 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.640
 they are characterized by an extremely favorable cost-efficiency ratio 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.939
 compared to the systems currently on the market based on the copper tube 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.150
 thanks to the particular treatment of their capturing surface they guarantee 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.850
 high efficiency even in conditions of low solar radiation 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.030
 the loading of a special fluid in the solar circuit 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.930
 composed of agricultural and water guarantees the system against frost on the circuit 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.450
 solar 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.760
 simple to install and extremely reliable 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.850
 helium block and is supplied complete with supports for installation on the roof 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.660
 flat on the sloping roof 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.470
 to choose 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.680
 based on your chest type 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.450
 solar energy is an inexhaustible source of clean energy over time. 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.090
 accessible to all for free 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.920
 for these reasons solar energy systems like I blog represent one 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.840
 valid and convenient integration 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.389
 oy in some cases an alternative to traditional systems 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.459
 guaranteeing up to 60 percent of the annual hot water requirement 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.959
 health 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.289
 to help simplify integration with your boilers as much as possible 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:29.010
 sogni e dio baal has studied a complete range of accessories 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.320
 which stands out for its ease of installation 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:39.279
