00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hi everyone is simon and we're 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.190
 found today for life two 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.590
 year presentation of the new drone 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.759
 parrot the bebop drones so the first 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.639
 difference that is striking with the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.890
 others we dance key generation 2.0 that's 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.510
 the volume that this one occupies so at 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.210
 know it's almost half as much 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.180
 bulky so it measures 33 cm at the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.890
 place of 52 and therefore much less 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.240
 bulky and easily transportable 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.189
 everywhere since the propellers are 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.019
 notable as well as the protection 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.120
 outdoor so big news 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.360
 it's first on the camera so it's a 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.670
 14 megapixel camera full hd equipped 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.649
 a pyside lens take a vision 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.690
 panoramic as it exists at the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.460
 pro except that here these words what they 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.420
 did they corrected the facts of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.510
 curvature to have a picture more than 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.469
 photo type we will say more professional 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.690
 so the camera you also a 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.699
 stability on three axes and maybe 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.199
 reclining at 180 degrees as well 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.250
 vertically that horizontally takes 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.780
 really a vision of the whole landscape 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.470
 the drone is controllable from a 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.159
 smartphone under ios android windows 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.670
 phone this will be thanks to the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.890
 enough wifi chip that it contains so that 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.530
 allows to have a range of 250 to 300 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.720
 meters as well as video mirroring so 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.759
 on our shelves with formations 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.770
 such as speed altitude the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.140
 position etc 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.439
 the drone can also be equipped with a 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.869
 remote control as a controller so 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.530
 improves driving thanks to its 2 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.450
 joystick 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.100
 it is also equipped with an antenna that will 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.290
 allow you to have a reach 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.670
 increase up to two kilometers while 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.710
 that in free field it is also provided 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.460
 a port hdmi to see the copying 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.079
 so video on tv or mats 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.299
 of oculus rift type and can be 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.000
 also used with a tablet 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.549
 smartphone etc 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.280
 the drone is also equipped with a gps chip 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.049
 so it will allow you to use 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.479
 pan fly app so who's at 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.030
 the purchase soon available its charge 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.310
 additional application for 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.140
 plan your flight so you can tell 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.590
 drones to go through this or that and 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.010
 such for 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.319
 1 all this will automatically be more 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.860
 when the right now will lose its 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.510
 signal 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.150
 it will come automatically anyway 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.150
 Titian who will come to you at his 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.209
 starting position and will save both 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.260
 meters from where you launched it so 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.660
 the question that everyone is asking this 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.860
 moment it's going to be autonomy so is 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.019
 about 10 minutes 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.450
 but what is good is that I parrot 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.290
 it offers two batteries with the purchase of the 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.900
 drone the prices so down that will be 500 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.329
 euros and with the sky control hours this 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.099
 will be 2 899 euros 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.630
 I hope you enjoyed the video
