00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
so I've been recently in my head kind of

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.110 
so I've been recently in my head kind of
drawing<00:02:38.290> up<00:02:38.530> ideas<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:39.640> how<00:02:39.790> I'm<00:02:39.940> going<00:02:40.060> to

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
drawing up ideas of how I'm going to

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.760 
drawing up ideas of how I'm going to
have<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.420> layout<00:02:40.750> some<00:02:41.080> of<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.320> will<00:02:41.470> change

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770

some<00:02:42.220> of<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.460> will<00:02:42.550> stay<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.880> same<00:02:43.710> more

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
some of it will stay the same more

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.340 
some of it will stay the same more
industries<00:02:45.190> will<00:02:45.310> be<00:02:45.430> added<00:02:45.820> as<00:02:45.970> time<00:02:46.960> goes

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
industries will be added as time goes

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.100 
industries will be added as time goes
this<00:02:47.740> industry<00:02:48.220> will<00:02:48.370> probably<00:02:48.700> stay<00:02:49.110> for

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
this industry will probably stay for

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.410 
this industry will probably stay for
sure<00:02:50.350> blanchfield<00:02:51.340> iron<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.820> metal<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.210> going

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
sure blanchfield iron the metal is going

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.480 
sure blanchfield iron the metal is going
to<00:02:52.540> stay<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:53.340> also<00:02:54.340> plan<00:02:54.790> on<00:02:54.850> adding<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:56.490> couple

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
half feet to three feet wide haven't

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.970 
half feet to three feet wide haven't
decided<00:04:01.630> really<00:04:01.900> yet<00:04:02.200> just<00:04:02.410> how<00:04:02.620> it's<00:04:02.800> going

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
decided really yet just how it's going

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.880 
decided really yet just how it's going
to<00:04:03.010> work<00:04:03.090> but<00:04:04.090> this<00:04:04.690> will<00:04:04.930> probably<00:04:05.200> stay<00:04:05.709> the

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
to work but this will probably stay the

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.400 
to work but this will probably stay the
same<00:04:06.100> here<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:06.940> it'll<00:04:07.510> come<00:04:07.840> through<00:04:07.870> here

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
same here and it'll come through here

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.660 
same here and it'll come through here
and<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.980> new<00:04:09.130> plan<00:04:09.430> is<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:10.540> go<00:04:10.750> across<00:04:11.110> here<00:04:11.670> to

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
and the new plan is to go across here to

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.900 
and the new plan is to go across here to
this<00:04:12.850> wall<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.920> put<00:04:14.920> in<00:04:15.040> a<00:04:15.130> section<00:04:15.459> here<00:04:15.519> and

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
this wall and put in a section here and

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.300 
this wall and put in a section here and
then<00:04:16.060> shoot<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.750> track<00:04:17.470> right<00:04:17.769> between<00:04:18.100> the

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
then shoot a track right between the

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.099 
then shoot a track right between the
furnace<00:04:18.640> and<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:18.820> hot<00:04:18.940> water<00:04:19.120> heater<00:04:19.239> over<00:04:19.989> to

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
furnace and a hot water heater over to

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.900 
furnace and a hot water heater over to
the<00:04:20.230> other<00:04:20.350> side<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:21.010> make<00:04:21.130> it<00:04:21.310> connect<00:04:21.640> into

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
the other side and make it connect into

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.659 
the other side and make it connect into
that<00:04:22.090> so<00:04:22.870> instead<00:04:23.140> of<00:04:23.200> having<00:04:23.289> a<00:04:23.560> loop<00:04:23.830> it's

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
that so instead of having a loop it's

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:25.620 
that so instead of having a loop it's
good<00:04:24.880> we'll<00:04:25.150> still<00:04:25.450> be

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
good we'll still be

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.660 
good we'll still be
loop<00:04:25.900> but<00:04:26.320> it's<00:04:26.620> going<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.800> be<00:04:26.920> a<00:04:26.950> wider<00:04:27.310> loop

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
loop but it's going to be a wider loop

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.970 
loop but it's going to be a wider loop
if<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.750> know<00:04:28.840> what<00:04:28.960> I<00:04:28.990> mean<00:04:29.140> it's<00:04:29.680> kind<00:04:29.950> of

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
if you know what I mean it's kind of

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.250 
if you know what I mean it's kind of
hard<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.160> explain<00:04:30.310> without<00:04:31.180> doing<00:04:31.600> it<00:04:31.690> but

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
hard to explain without doing it but

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.560 
hard to explain without doing it but
anyways<00:04:32.590> that's<00:04:33.250> what<00:04:33.460> I'm<00:04:33.580> at<00:04:33.760> right<00:04:33.790> now<00:04:34.030> on

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
anyways that's what I'm at right now on

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.540 
anyways that's what I'm at right now on
that<00:04:35.170> table<00:04:35.560> right<00:04:35.680> here<00:04:35.860> is<00:04:36.130> going<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.310> be<00:04:36.400> out

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
that table right here is going to be out

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.030 
that table right here is going to be out
of<00:04:36.580> here<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:37.200> bunch<00:04:38.200> of<00:04:38.290> other<00:04:38.470> stuff<00:04:38.560> is<00:04:38.890> going

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
of here a bunch of other stuff is going

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.920 
of here a bunch of other stuff is going
to<00:04:39.070> be<00:04:39.220> booted<00:04:39.970> out<00:04:40.090> of<00:04:40.120> here<00:04:40.360> too<00:04:40.540> so<00:04:40.720> I<00:04:40.750> have

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
to be booted out of here too so I have

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.020 
to be booted out of here too so I have
room<00:04:41.170> to<00:04:41.200> work<00:04:41.530> so<00:04:42.280> it's<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.580> winter<00:04:42.880> months

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
room to work so it's the winter months

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.780 
room to work so it's the winter months
and<00:04:43.480> I've<00:04:44.080> been<00:04:44.230> drawing<00:04:44.560> some<00:04:44.920> ideas<00:04:45.520> in<00:04:45.670> my

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
and I've been drawing some ideas in my

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.970 
and I've been drawing some ideas in my
head<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.300> hopefully<00:04:46.690> they'll<00:04:47.680> come<00:04:47.830> to

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
head and hopefully they'll come to

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.730 
head and hopefully they'll come to
fruition<00:04:48.160> here<00:04:48.730> in<00:04:48.940> a<00:04:49.030> couple<00:04:49.150> of<00:04:49.360> days

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
fruition here in a couple of days

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.840 
fruition here in a couple of days
actually<00:04:50.740> a<00:04:50.950> couple<00:04:51.190> of<00:04:51.280> months<00:04:51.550> because<00:04:51.700> I

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
actually a couple of months because I
