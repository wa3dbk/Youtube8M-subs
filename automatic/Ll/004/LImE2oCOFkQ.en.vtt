through<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.590> did<00:01:37.829> what<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.070> pros<00:01:38.340> told<00:01:38.640> us

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
through and we did what the pros told us

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.460 
through and we did what the pros told us
and<00:01:39.060> if<00:01:39.390> they're<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> best<00:01:40.200> league

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
and if they're really the best league

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.530 
and if they're really the best league
has<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.920> offer<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.700> there's<00:01:41.939> no<00:01:42.090> way<00:01:42.270> there's

tournaments

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.660 
tournaments
but<00:02:13.980> I've<00:02:14.100> already<00:02:14.370> talked<00:02:14.580> about

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
but I've already talked about

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.580 
but I've already talked about
responsibility<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.750> your<00:02:15.840> mistakes<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.470> all

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
responsibility and your mistakes and all

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.260 
responsibility and your mistakes and all
this<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.280> many<00:02:17.370> other<00:02:17.490> videos<00:02:17.940> already

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
this and so many other videos already

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.120 
this and so many other videos already
the<00:02:18.810> point<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.140> should<00:02:19.320> really<00:02:19.530> listen<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.950> is

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
the point you should really listen to is

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.830 
the point you should really listen to is
that<00:02:20.280> second<00:02:20.730> one<00:02:20.850> trial<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.690> error

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
that second one trial and error

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.500 
that second one trial and error
variation<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:22.860> selection<00:02:22.980> we<00:02:23.880> hate<00:02:24.180> it

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
variation and selection we hate it

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.960 
variation and selection we hate it
we<00:02:24.840> hate<00:02:25.230> trying<00:02:25.650> something<00:02:25.950> new<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.640> having

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
we hate trying something new and having

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.480 
we hate trying something new and having
it<00:02:27.060> fail<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.260> much<00:02:28.470> easier<00:02:28.710> to<00:02:29.070> just<00:02:29.100> look

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
it fail it's so much easier to just look

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.820 
it fail it's so much easier to just look
up<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.730> guide<00:02:29.760> on<00:02:29.970> solomid<00:02:30.720> right<00:02:31.050> why<00:02:31.560> bother

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
up a guide on solomid right why bother

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.190 
up a guide on solomid right why bother
with<00:02:32.040> trial<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.550> error<00:02:32.730> at<00:02:32.940> all<00:02:33.240> well<00:02:34.170> it

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
with trial and error at all well it

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.350 
with trial and error at all well it
turns<00:02:34.560> out<00:02:34.770> trial<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.310> error<00:02:35.490> can<00:02:35.970> actually

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
turns out trial and error can actually

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.390 
turns out trial and error can actually
work<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.660> lot<00:02:36.900> better<00:02:37.200> than<00:02:37.590> one<00:02:37.740> person<00:02:38.130> just

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
work a lot better than one person just

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.670 
work a lot better than one person just
thinking<00:02:38.820> something<00:02:39.000> through<00:02:39.590> especially<00:02:40.590> if

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
thinking something through especially if

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.220 
thinking something through especially if
the<00:02:40.770> problem<00:02:41.160> we<00:02:41.280> face<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.730> very<00:02:41.940> complex<00:02:42.510> let

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the problem we face is very complex let

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.960 
the problem we face is very complex let
me<00:02:43.350> give<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> quick<00:02:43.800> example<00:02:43.850> let's<00:02:44.850> say

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
me give you a quick example let's say

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.580 
me give you a quick example let's say
you<00:02:45.060> want<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.240> make<00:02:45.390> detergent<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:46.410> have<00:02:46.530> a

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
you want to make detergent you have a

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.290 
you want to make detergent you have a
big<00:02:46.770> tank<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.160> liquid<00:02:47.190> detergent<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.210> you

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
big tank of liquid detergent and you

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.060 
big tank of liquid detergent and you
pump<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.720> at<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.900> high<00:02:49.170> pressure<00:02:49.530> through<00:02:50.040> a

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
pump it at a high pressure through a

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.610 
pump it at a high pressure through a
nozzle<00:02:50.340> turning<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.060> into<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.300> spray<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.470> spray

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
nozzle turning it into a spray the spray

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.860 
nozzle turning it into a spray the spray
dries<00:02:53.070> into<00:02:53.280> powder<00:02:53.580> you<00:02:54.000> collect<00:02:54.360> tons<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.750> it

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
dries into powder you collect tons of it

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.080 
dries into powder you collect tons of it
sell<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.530> make<00:02:55.650> plenty<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:56.010> money<00:02:56.220> how<00:02:57.030> do

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
sell it and make plenty of money how do

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.570 
sell it and make plenty of money how do
you<00:02:57.180> design<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.780> nozzle<00:02:58.380> well<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.280> could

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
you design that nozzle well you could

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.580 
you design that nozzle well you could
find<00:02:59.940> someone<00:03:00.330> like<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.510> mathematician<00:03:01.410> or

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
find someone like a mathematician or

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.620 
find someone like a mathematician or
scientist<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.430> pay<00:03:02.550> them<00:03:02.730> lots<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.090> money<00:03:03.330> to

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
scientist and pay them lots of money to

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.990 
scientist and pay them lots of money to
have<00:03:04.140> them<00:03:04.350> design<00:03:04.560> one<00:03:04.980> for<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.460> but<00:03:05.880> it

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
have them design one for you but it

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.420 
have them design one for you but it
turns<00:03:06.270> out<00:03:06.540> even<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.200> little<00:03:07.620> nozzle<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:08.220> too

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
turns out even this little nozzle is too

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.190 
turns out even this little nozzle is too
complicated<00:03:08.820> for<00:03:09.150> them<00:03:09.450> it's<00:03:10.020> actually

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
complicated for them it's actually

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.620 
complicated for them it's actually
better<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.950> go<00:03:11.280> with<00:03:11.430> trial<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:11.940> error<00:03:12.150> make
