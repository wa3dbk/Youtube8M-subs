00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
the x-ray glitch only instead of doing

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.329 
the x-ray glitch only instead of doing
it<00:00:24.480> simply<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.230> only<00:00:25.500> being<00:00:25.679> able<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.980> see<00:00:26.160> in

complete 360 degree view and not only

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.869 
complete 360 degree view and not only
can<00:00:59.910> we<00:00:59.969> see<00:01:00.030> 360<00:01:00.780> degrees<00:01:01.280> underground<00:01:02.280> but

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
can we see 360 degrees underground but

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.210 
can we see 360 degrees underground but
you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.120> actually<00:01:03.329> also<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:04.190> under<00:01:05.190> your

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
you can actually also see under your

feet so you can tell there's tons and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.440 
feet so you can tell there's tons and
tons<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.740> tons<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.220> tunnels<00:01:08.610> here<00:01:08.820> whereas

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
tons and tons of tunnels here whereas

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.060 
tons and tons of tunnels here whereas
before<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.290> were<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> try<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.920> this

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
before if you were to try to do this

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.160 
before if you were to try to do this
glitch<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.580> would<00:01:11.909> kind<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.540> limited<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
glitch you would kind of be limited to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.950 
glitch you would kind of be limited to
what<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> could<00:01:13.590> actually<00:01:13.770> see<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.810> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
said imma show you guys how to get out

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.590 
said imma show you guys how to get out
of<00:01:17.579> here<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:17.970> I'm<00:01:18.030> gonna<00:01:18.119> show<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.420> guys

of here and then I'm gonna show you guys

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.730 
of here and then I'm gonna show you guys
how<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:19.020> actually<00:01:19.140> build<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.590> for

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
how you can actually build this for

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.050 
how you can actually build this for
yourself<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:20.520> you're<00:01:20.610> gonna<00:01:20.670> want<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.970> do

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
yourself so what you're gonna want to do

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.520 
yourself so what you're gonna want to do
if<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.210> want<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.390> get<00:01:21.509> out<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.810> very<00:01:22.079> simply

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
if you want to get out is very simply

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.590 
if you want to get out is very simply
just<00:01:22.560> jump<00:01:23.100> up<00:01:23.220> twice<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.180> will<00:01:24.299> get<00:01:24.479> you

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
just jump up twice and it will get you

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.850 
just jump up twice and it will get you
out<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.750> there<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.170> then<00:01:25.320> you're<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.650> go

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
out of there and then you're going to go

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.590 
out of there and then you're going to go
ahead<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.220> deactivate<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.970> by<00:01:27.000> pressing<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
ahead and deactivate it by pressing the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.630 
ahead and deactivate it by pressing the
button<00:01:27.689> again<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.470> that's<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.220> set<00:01:29.520> it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
button again and that's going to set it

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.160 
button again and that's going to set it
up<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:30.060> whenever<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.450> want<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.689> use<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.049> again

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
up for whenever you want to use it again

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.980 
up for whenever you want to use it again
later<00:01:31.649> so<00:01:32.090> basically<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.329> build<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.750> all

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
later so basically to build this all

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.630 
later so basically to build this all
you're<00:01:34.200> going<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.350> want<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.430> all

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
it just takes a few repeaters and then

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.639 
it just takes a few repeaters and then
basically<00:01:45.090> all<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.780> Pistons<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.439> see
