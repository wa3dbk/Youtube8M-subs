tip for you all in this video we are
going<00:00:17.710> to<00:00:17.770> look<00:00:17.890> at<00:00:18.070> creating<00:00:18.099> a<00:00:18.520> soft<00:00:19.119> glow<00:00:19.660> on

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
going to look at creating a soft glow on

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.880 
going to look at creating a soft glow on
armor<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:22.660> for<00:00:22.869> our<00:00:23.080> example<00:00:23.619> here<00:00:23.650> we're

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
armor so for our example here we're

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.950 
armor so for our example here we're
going<00:00:23.980> to<00:00:24.040> be<00:00:24.189> using<00:00:24.430> the<00:00:24.730> Wraith<00:00:25.390> Knight<00:00:25.689> from

the elder army and 40k and we're going
to<00:00:29.859> duplicate<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:31.359> glow<00:00:32.050> that<00:00:32.320> is<00:00:32.500> on<00:00:32.800> the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
to duplicate the glow that is on the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.689 
to duplicate the glow that is on the
helmet<00:00:33.489> visor<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.739> get<00:00:35.949> us<00:00:36.070> started<00:00:36.280> we're

helmet visor and get us started we're
going<00:00:36.790> to<00:00:36.879> use<00:00:36.970> some<00:00:37.150> Abaddon<00:00:37.629> black<00:00:38.080> this<00:00:38.769> was

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
going to use some Abaddon black this was

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.119 
going to use some Abaddon black this was
also<00:00:39.280> used<00:00:39.460> as<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.699> base<00:00:40.030> color<00:00:40.330> for<00:00:40.420> the<00:00:41.129> area

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
also used as the base color for the area

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.610 
also used as the base color for the area
as<00:00:42.309> well<00:00:42.750> we'll<00:00:43.750> also<00:00:43.870> be<00:00:44.080> using<00:00:44.110> some

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
as well we'll also be using some

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.030 
as well we'll also be using some
caldor's<00:00:45.100> sky<00:00:46.350> we're<00:00:47.350> going<00:00:47.470> to<00:00:47.530> do<00:00:47.650> a<00:00:47.680> quick

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
caldor's sky we're going to do a quick

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.520 
caldor's sky we're going to do a quick
to<00:00:48.489> brush<00:00:48.790> wet<00:00:49.330> blend<00:00:51.330> with<00:00:52.330> the<00:00:52.720> Kaldor<00:00:53.170> sky

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
to brush wet blend with the Kaldor sky

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.189 
to brush wet blend with the Kaldor sky
being<00:00:54.190> at<00:00:54.400> the<00:00:54.909> lower<00:00:55.180> portions<00:00:55.750> of<00:00:55.869> the<00:00:56.350> visor

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
being at the lower portions of the visor

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.750 
being at the lower portions of the visor
simulating<00:00:59.199> sort<00:00:59.619> of<00:00:59.769> like<00:00:59.949> a<00:01:00.190> gemstone

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
simulating sort of like a gemstone

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.200 
simulating sort of like a gemstone
effect<00:01:01.540> if<00:01:01.839> you're<00:01:02.199> familiar<00:01:02.379> with<00:01:03.210> creating

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
effect if you're familiar with creating

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.130 
effect if you're familiar with creating
gemstone<00:01:04.720> effects<00:01:05.049> on<00:01:05.199> a<00:01:05.260> model<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.900> we<00:01:07.990> just

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
gemstone effects on a model so we just

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.530 
gemstone effects on a model so we just
lay<00:01:08.260> down<00:01:08.290> our<00:01:08.470> Kaldor<00:01:09.010> blue<00:01:09.310> and<00:01:09.549> then<00:01:10.390> we

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
lay down our Kaldor blue and then we

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.500 
lay down our Kaldor blue and then we
begin<00:01:10.900> blending<00:01:11.770> in<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:12.040> black<00:01:12.360> now<00:01:13.360> there

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
begin blending in the black now there

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.390 
begin blending in the black now there
really<00:01:13.660> isn't<00:01:13.930> a<00:01:14.170> whole<00:01:14.380> lot<00:01:14.440> of<00:01:14.830> blue<00:01:15.070> being

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
really isn't a whole lot of blue being

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.250 
really isn't a whole lot of blue being
left<00:01:15.670> behind<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:16.210> is<00:01:16.330> really<00:01:16.630> quite<00:01:16.870> subtle

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
left behind it is really quite subtle

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.700 
left behind it is really quite subtle
the<00:01:17.950> camera<00:01:18.220> doesn't<00:01:18.400> quite<00:01:18.670> pick<00:01:18.940> up<00:01:19.120> up<00:01:19.710> all

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
the camera doesn't quite pick up up all

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.790 
the camera doesn't quite pick up up all
the<00:01:21.160> transitions<00:01:21.790> in<00:01:22.120> the<00:01:22.690> visor<00:01:22.900> but<00:01:23.260> are<00:01:23.470> a

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
the transitions in the visor but are a

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.570 
the transitions in the visor but are a
fair<00:01:24.550> amount<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:26.500> can<00:01:26.650> see<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.370> color

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
fair amount you can see the color

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.670 
fair amount you can see the color
transition<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.300> we<00:01:28.390> leave<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.660> little<00:01:29.290> thin

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
transition and we leave a little thin

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.560 
transition and we leave a little thin
line<00:01:30.160> of<00:01:30.340> that<00:01:30.430> cowl<00:01:30.700> or<00:01:30.910> blue<00:01:31.150> at<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.300> very

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
line of that cowl or blue at the very

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.990 
line of that cowl or blue at the very
base<00:01:31.870> of<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:33.220> visor<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.460> we're<00:01:36.610> just<00:01:36.760> really

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
base of the visor so we're just really

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.550 
base of the visor so we're just really
quickly<00:01:37.300> just<00:01:37.450> blending<00:01:38.080> and<00:01:38.200> trying<00:01:38.470> to

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
quickly just blending and trying to

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.649 
quickly just blending and trying to
match<00:01:38.830> them<00:01:39.130> up<00:01:39.280> in<00:01:39.550> through<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.030> front<00:01:40.360> there

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
match them up in through the front there

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.680 
match them up in through the front there
and<00:01:41.490> again<00:01:42.490> this<00:01:42.670> is<00:01:42.820> more<00:01:43.030> like<00:01:43.270> a<00:01:43.300> gemstone

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
and again this is more like a gemstone

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.600 
and again this is more like a gemstone
effect<00:01:44.140> so<00:01:44.320> we're<00:01:44.680> imagine<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.190> light<00:01:45.370> source

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
effect so we're imagine the light source

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.550 
effect so we're imagine the light source
is<00:01:45.670> coming<00:01:45.850> from<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.330> very<00:01:46.659> top<00:01:46.930> of<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.200> model

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
is coming from the very top of the model

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.399 
is coming from the very top of the model
coming<00:01:48.400> straight<00:01:48.850> down<00:01:48.909> and<00:01:49.409> illuminating

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
coming straight down and illuminating

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.700 
coming straight down and illuminating
the<00:01:50.530> bottom<00:01:50.980> portion<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.520> that<00:01:51.670> visor<00:01:52.710> is

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
the bottom portion of that visor is

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.440 
the bottom portion of that visor is
really<00:01:54.070> what<00:01:54.220> we're<00:01:54.370> simulating<00:01:54.850> here<00:01:55.240> so

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
really what we're simulating here so

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.540 
really what we're simulating here so
that<00:01:55.600> we're<00:01:55.780> we're<00:01:56.350> also<00:01:56.500> simulating<00:01:57.159> sort<00:01:57.460> of

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
that we're we're also simulating sort of

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.000 
that we're we're also simulating sort of
a<00:01:57.750> transparency<00:01:58.750> as<00:01:58.930> well<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:02.350> so<00:02:02.710> just<00:02:02.920> to

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
a transparency as well and so just to

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.740 
a transparency as well and so just to
help<00:02:03.159> build<00:02:03.700> up<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.030> colors<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.360> little<00:02:04.450> bit

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
help build up the colors a little bit

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.399 
help build up the colors a little bit
more<00:02:05.020> we're<00:02:05.680> going<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.830> go<00:02:05.950> through<00:02:06.190> again<00:02:07.409> and

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:08.409 
more we're going to go through again and

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.949 
more we're going to go through again and
this<00:02:08.799> time<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.190> cow<00:02:09.429> cow<00:02:10.000> bear<00:02:10.179> blue<00:02:10.390> was<00:02:10.659> also

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
this time the cow cow bear blue was also

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.570 
this time the cow cow bear blue was also
thinned<00:02:11.200> down<00:02:11.349> just<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.739> little<00:02:12.069> slightly<00:02:12.340> with

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
thinned down just a little slightly with

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.390 
thinned down just a little slightly with
just<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.120> bit<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.330> water<00:02:13.569> really<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:15.250> first

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
just a bit of water really the first

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.280 
just a bit of water really the first
time<00:02:15.640> we<00:02:15.730> had<00:02:15.849> blended<00:02:16.120> there<00:02:16.480> was<00:02:16.599> no<00:02:16.870> mediums

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
time we had blended there was no mediums

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.050 
time we had blended there was no mediums
or<00:02:17.560> no

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
or no

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.699 
or no
water<00:02:18.180> added<00:02:18.660> who's<00:02:19.140> really<00:02:19.410> just<00:02:19.500> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
water added who's really just the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.000 
water added who's really just the
dampness<00:02:20.010> on<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.310> brush<00:02:20.810> help<00:02:21.810> blend<00:02:22.110> this

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
dampness on the brush help blend this

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.250 
dampness on the brush help blend this
time<00:02:23.250> here<00:02:23.489> we're<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.959> building<00:02:24.959> up<00:02:25.050> the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
time here we're just building up the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.850 
time here we're just building up the
strength<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.190> transition<00:02:26.790> here<00:02:27.709> just<00:02:28.709> by

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
strength of the transition here just by

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.710 
strength of the transition here just by
really<00:02:29.459> kind<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.730> blending<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.390> really

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
really kind of blending the a really

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.670 
really kind of blending the a really
thin<00:02:31.020> layer<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.500> top<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.920> heavy<00:02:32.160> layer<00:02:33.680> so

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
thin layer on top of a heavy layer so

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.009 
thin layer on top of a heavy layer so
we're<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.160> very<00:02:35.430> careful<00:02:35.849> here<00:02:36.030> again<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.750> is

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
we're just very careful here again it is

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.680 
we're just very careful here again it is
a<00:02:37.140> very<00:02:37.440> subtle<00:02:37.739> effect<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:39.150> really<00:02:39.510> don't

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
a very subtle effect you really don't

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.420 
a very subtle effect you really don't
want<00:02:39.870> too<00:02:40.200> much<00:02:40.410> because<00:02:40.890> then<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.250> whole

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
want too much because then the whole

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.580 
want too much because then the whole
thing<00:02:41.700> just<00:02:41.730> starts<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.390> feel<00:02:42.569> really<00:02:43.050> blue<00:02:43.319> or

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
thing just starts to feel really blue or

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.650 
thing just starts to feel really blue or
just<00:02:44.400> starts<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.730> look<00:02:44.910> just<00:02:45.209> like<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.450> big

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
just starts to look just like a big

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.390 
just starts to look just like a big
gemstone<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.410> we're<00:02:46.530> really<00:02:46.709> not<00:02:46.860> looking

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
gemstone and we're really not looking

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.220 
gemstone and we're really not looking
for<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.610> we<00:02:47.819> want<00:02:48.000> one<00:02:48.120> we're<00:02:48.930> looking<00:02:49.200> just

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
for that we want one we're looking just

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.800 
for that we want one we're looking just
to<00:02:49.380> create<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.709> like<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.610> hint<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.630> there

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
to create that like the hint that there

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.289 
to create that like the hint that there
is<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:51.989> transparency<00:02:52.739> there<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
is a transparency there and so the

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.370 
is a transparency there and so the
effect<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:54.720> quite<00:02:54.870> subtle<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:57.290> here<00:02:58.290> again

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
effect is quite subtle and here again

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.259 
effect is quite subtle and here again
I'm<00:02:58.650> just<00:02:58.769> putting<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.310> blends<00:02:59.640> just<00:03:00.209> a

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
I'm just putting the blends just a

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.530 
I'm just putting the blends just a
little<00:03:00.510> further<00:03:00.780> up<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.410> home<00:03:01.590> but<00:03:01.739> as<00:03:01.860> well

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
little further up the home but as well

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.520 
little further up the home but as well
again<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.690> know<00:03:03.780> keeping<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.200> all<00:03:04.290> very

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
again you know keeping it all very

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.350 
again you know keeping it all very
subtle<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.400> camera<00:03:05.670> doesn't<00:03:05.819> quite<00:03:06.030> pick<00:03:06.239> it

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
subtle the camera doesn't quite pick it

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.990 
subtle the camera doesn't quite pick it
all<00:03:06.480> up<00:03:06.630> but<00:03:06.810> there<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.739> quite<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.010> bit<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.280> color

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
all up but there is quite a bit of color

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.910 
all up but there is quite a bit of color
transfer<00:03:09.599> in<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.830> edges<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.610> visor<00:03:12.920> and

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
transfer in the edges of that visor and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.009 
transfer in the edges of that visor and
now<00:03:14.069> for<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.400> stark<00:03:14.730> highlight<00:03:15.269> in<00:03:15.540> through

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
now for the stark highlight in through

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.160 
now for the stark highlight in through
the<00:03:16.140> top<00:03:16.380> center<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.190> helmet<00:03:18.060> again<00:03:18.989> we

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
the top center of the helmet again we

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.650 
the top center of the helmet again we
just<00:03:19.349> lay<00:03:19.470> some<00:03:19.530> Kaldor<00:03:20.099> blue<00:03:20.310> down<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:20.760> then

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
just lay some Kaldor blue down and then

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.210 
just lay some Kaldor blue down and then
really<00:03:21.989> quickly<00:03:22.320> here<00:03:22.530> we<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.829> take<00:03:23.010> some

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
really quickly here we just take some

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.789 
really quickly here we just take some
Abaddonn<00:03:23.910> black<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.510> then<00:03:25.109> begin<00:03:25.410> blending

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
Abaddonn black and then begin blending

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.880 
Abaddonn black and then begin blending
it<00:03:25.890> in<00:03:26.010> leaving<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:27.470> very<00:03:28.730> sharp<00:03:29.730> line<00:03:30.090> of

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
it in leaving a very sharp line of

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.650 
it in leaving a very sharp line of
Kaldor<00:03:31.890> blue<00:03:32.070> in<00:03:32.310> through<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.670> middle<00:03:33.030> that

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
Kaldor blue in through the middle that

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.729 
Kaldor blue in through the middle that
central<00:03:34.230> area<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.790> visor

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
central area of the of the visor

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.660 
central area of the of the visor
basically<00:03:37.739> it's<00:03:37.859> just<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.160> two<00:03:38.340> strongest

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
basically it's just this two strongest

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.160 
basically it's just this two strongest
amount<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.269> color<00:03:39.420> we<00:03:39.569> can<00:03:39.720> take<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.019> all<00:03:40.140> the

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
amount of color we can take it all the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.470 
amount of color we can take it all the
way<00:03:40.290> down<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.739> almost<00:03:40.859> that<00:03:41.250> black<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.150> have

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
way down to almost that black and have

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.750 
way down to almost that black and have
it<00:03:42.600> all<00:03:42.720> blended<00:03:43.140> through<00:03:43.290> but<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.829> left<00:03:44.609> there

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
it all blended through but I left there

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.610 
it all blended through but I left there
really<00:03:45.030> stark<00:03:45.390> just<00:03:45.840> so<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:46.109> is<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.470> little

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
really stark just so that is a little

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.370 
really stark just so that is a little
easy<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.220> see<00:03:47.660> you<00:03:48.660> can<00:03:48.750> see<00:03:48.840> again<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.200> color

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
easy to see you can see again the color

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.990 
easy to see you can see again the color
transition<00:03:49.889> is<00:03:50.010> quite<00:03:50.280> subtle<00:03:50.609> but<00:03:50.850> that's

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
transition is quite subtle but that's

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.490 
transition is quite subtle but that's
really<00:03:51.180> what<00:03:51.359> you<00:03:51.510> want<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:52.079> want<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.350> have

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
really what you want you want to have

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.920 
really what you want you want to have
that<00:03:52.709> that<00:03:53.459> glass<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:54.060> feel<00:03:54.239> like<00:03:54.450> it's<00:03:54.600> really

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
that that glass to feel like it's really

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.050 
that that glass to feel like it's really
still<00:03:55.170> quite<00:03:55.380> dark<00:03:55.620> but<00:03:55.889> there<00:03:56.519> is<00:03:56.639> the<00:03:56.790> hint

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
still quite dark but there is the hint

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.569 
still quite dark but there is the hint
that<00:03:57.600> there's<00:03:57.840> light<00:03:58.200> travelling<00:03:59.190> through<00:03:59.489> it

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
that there's light travelling through it

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.210 
that there's light travelling through it
and<00:03:59.760> that's<00:03:59.910> why<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.150> highlights<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:01.220> the

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
and that's why the highlights and the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.120 
and that's why the highlights and the
color<00:04:02.430> transitions<00:04:03.060> are<00:04:03.269> quite<00:04:03.540> subtle<00:04:04.130> it's

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
color transitions are quite subtle it's

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.890 
color transitions are quite subtle it's
really<00:04:05.489> actually<00:04:05.670> helps<00:04:06.209> with<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.540> effect

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
really actually helps with the effect

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.160 
really actually helps with the effect
leaving<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:07.739> quite<00:04:07.950> subtle<00:04:08.959> next<00:04:09.959> we're<00:04:10.079> going

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
leaving it quite subtle next we're going

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.340 
leaving it quite subtle next we're going
to<00:04:10.230> take<00:04:10.380> some<00:04:10.620> Kaldor<00:04:11.280> sky<00:04:11.819> with<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:13.019> little

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
to take some Kaldor sky with a little

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.890 
to take some Kaldor sky with a little
bit<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.620> white<00:04:13.980> scar<00:04:14.459> we're<00:04:15.420> going<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.600> mix

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
bit of white scar we're going to mix

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.259 
bit of white scar we're going to mix
these<00:04:16.139> together<00:04:16.859> in<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.609> one-to-one<00:04:18.150> fashion

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
these together in a one-to-one fashion

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.360 
these together in a one-to-one fashion
so<00:04:21.269> just<00:04:21.479> really<00:04:21.660> quickly<00:04:21.870> here<00:04:22.260> we<00:04:22.380> just<00:04:22.440> slap

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
so just really quickly here we just slap

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.390 
so just really quickly here we just slap
a<00:04:23.400> little<00:04:23.700> bit<00:04:23.820> onto<00:04:24.060> our<00:04:24.180> palate

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
a little bit onto our palate

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.000 
a little bit onto our palate
give<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.480> a<00:04:26.510> good<00:04:26.690> thorough<00:04:27.139> mixing<00:04:27.650> gonna

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
give it a good thorough mixing gonna

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.680 
give it a good thorough mixing gonna
take<00:04:28.160> a<00:04:28.190> little<00:04:28.340> bit<00:04:28.520> of<00:04:28.580> medium<00:04:28.970> here<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.360> our

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
take a little bit of medium here and our

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.950 
take a little bit of medium here and our
detail<00:04:30.169> brush<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:31.510> fairly<00:04:32.510> heavy<00:04:32.660> load<00:04:32.840> on

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
detail brush and fairly heavy load on

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.330 
detail brush and fairly heavy load on
the<00:04:33.050> brush<00:04:33.260> but<00:04:33.500> we're<00:04:33.650> mixing<00:04:33.830> it<00:04:34.010> in<00:04:34.130> co2

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
the brush but we're mixing it in co2

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.270 
the brush but we're mixing it in co2
quite<00:04:34.820> a<00:04:34.850> bit<00:04:35.030> of<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.240> mixture<00:04:36.010> just<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.100> help

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
quite a bit of the mixture just to help

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.920 
quite a bit of the mixture just to help
with<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.580> flow<00:04:37.820> get<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.240> thinned<00:04:38.450> down<00:04:38.600> nicely

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
with the flow get it thinned down nicely

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.990 
with the flow get it thinned down nicely
so<00:04:39.470> that's<00:04:39.590> much<00:04:39.889> more<00:04:39.919> manageable<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:40.700> flows

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
so that's much more manageable and flows

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.879 
so that's much more manageable and flows
out<00:04:41.240> of<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.419> brush<00:04:41.600> in<00:04:42.350> a<00:04:42.560> much<00:04:42.710> more

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
out of the brush in a much more

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.220 
out of the brush in a much more
controlled<00:04:43.250> fashion<00:04:43.970> rather<00:04:44.690> than<00:04:44.900> just<00:04:45.080> them

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
controlled fashion rather than just them

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.900 
controlled fashion rather than just them
sitting<00:04:45.590> with<00:04:45.710> water<00:04:46.040> and<00:04:46.310> you<00:04:46.550> can<00:04:46.669> end<00:04:46.820> up

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
sitting with water and you can end up

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.440 
sitting with water and you can end up
just<00:04:47.720> kind<00:04:48.139> of<00:04:48.230> puddling<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:48.800> up<00:04:48.889> and<00:04:49.270> being<00:04:50.270> a

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
just kind of puddling it up and being a

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.920 
just kind of puddling it up and being a
big<00:04:50.750> mess<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.970> then<00:04:53.090> very<00:04:53.330> quickly<00:04:53.570> here<00:04:53.810> I'm

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
big mess and then very quickly here I'm

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.070 
big mess and then very quickly here I'm
just<00:04:54.080> creating<00:04:54.260> a<00:04:54.500> very<00:04:54.770> stark<00:04:55.160> highlight<00:04:55.639> odd

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
just creating a very stark highlight odd

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.360 
just creating a very stark highlight odd
kind<00:04:57.080> of<00:04:57.230> um<00:04:57.350> where<00:04:57.500> I'm<00:04:57.590> imagining<00:04:57.919> though

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
kind of um where I'm imagining though

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.760 
kind of um where I'm imagining though
you<00:04:58.610> would<00:04:58.790> see<00:04:59.000> that<00:04:59.150> reflection<00:04:59.570> and<00:04:59.900> then

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
you would see that reflection and then

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:01.930 
you would see that reflection and then
really<00:05:01.040> quickly<00:05:01.250> here<00:05:01.460> I'm<00:05:01.520> just<00:05:01.610> throwing<00:05:01.820> in

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
really quickly here I'm just throwing in

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.120 
really quickly here I'm just throwing in
another<00:05:02.270> one<00:05:02.479> kind<00:05:02.690> of<00:05:02.840> like<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.889> really

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
another one kind of like the really

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.260 
another one kind of like the really
they're<00:05:04.280> almost<00:05:04.430> like<00:05:04.580> little<00:05:04.669> teardrop

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
they're almost like little teardrop

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.860 
they're almost like little teardrop
shapes<00:05:05.570> I've<00:05:05.750> put<00:05:06.380> down<00:05:06.590> there<00:05:07.570> one<00:05:08.570> kind<00:05:08.810> of

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
shapes I've put down there one kind of

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.180 
shapes I've put down there one kind of
pointing<00:05:09.229> upwards<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:09.889> other<00:05:09.979> one<00:05:10.100> kind

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
pointing upwards and the other one kind

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.590 
pointing upwards and the other one kind
of<00:05:10.310> pointing<00:05:10.610> downwards<00:05:11.030> for<00:05:11.180> that<00:05:11.270> one

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
of pointing downwards for that one

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.840 
of pointing downwards for that one
pointing<00:05:11.930> downwards<00:05:12.290> is<00:05:12.410> a<00:05:12.800> lot<00:05:13.100> smaller<00:05:13.550> and

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
pointing downwards is a lot smaller and

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.969 
pointing downwards is a lot smaller and
it's<00:05:14.000> just<00:05:14.750> representing<00:05:15.290> multiple<00:05:15.830> light

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
it's just representing multiple light

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.890 
it's just representing multiple light
sources<00:05:16.010> or<00:05:16.610> there's<00:05:16.850> multiple<00:05:17.360> reflections

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
sources or there's multiple reflections

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.100 
sources or there's multiple reflections
coming<00:05:18.169> off<00:05:18.290> different<00:05:18.530> sources<00:05:18.919> and<00:05:20.110> really

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
coming off different sources and really

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.860 
coming off different sources and really
that's<00:05:21.290> just<00:05:22.030> alts<00:05:23.030> there<00:05:23.240> it's<00:05:23.450> you<00:05:23.720> could

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
that's just alts there it's you could

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.430 
that's just alts there it's you could
leave<00:05:24.050> it<00:05:24.169> as<00:05:24.290> one<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:24.860> you<00:05:25.130> know<00:05:25.340> move<00:05:25.700> on<00:05:25.910> as

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
leave it as one and you know move on as

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.250 
leave it as one and you know move on as
we<00:05:27.440> are<00:05:27.590> here<00:05:27.950> with<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.310> white<00:05:28.520> scar<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.990> here

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
we are here with the white scar and here

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.900 
we are here with the white scar and here
we're<00:05:30.410> just<00:05:30.440> quickly<00:05:30.890> just<00:05:31.039> throwing<00:05:31.310> a<00:05:31.520> tiny

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
we're just quickly just throwing a tiny

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.460 
we're just quickly just throwing a tiny
little<00:05:32.180> dot<00:05:32.450> right<00:05:32.720> in<00:05:32.990> through<00:05:33.169> the<00:05:33.260> center

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
little dot right in through the center

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.590 
little dot right in through the center
of<00:05:33.650> that<00:05:33.800> just<00:05:34.520> to<00:05:34.669> make<00:05:35.090> it<00:05:35.150> a<00:05:35.300> little<00:05:35.450> bit

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
of that just to make it a little bit

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.969 
of that just to make it a little bit
brighter<00:05:35.840> you<00:05:36.110> could<00:05:36.260> also<00:05:36.410> do<00:05:36.650> the<00:05:36.740> little

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
brighter you could also do the little

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.400 
brighter you could also do the little
kind<00:05:37.250> of<00:05:37.340> star<00:05:37.789> effect<00:05:38.180> where<00:05:39.020> you<00:05:39.140> know<00:05:39.260> it

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
kind of star effect where you know it

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.230 
kind of star effect where you know it
looks<00:05:39.770> like<00:05:39.919> the<00:05:40.070> light<00:05:40.340> is<00:05:40.370> glinting<00:05:40.940> off<00:05:41.060> of

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
looks like the light is glinting off of

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.840 
looks like the light is glinting off of
it<00:05:41.360> you<00:05:41.390> could<00:05:41.600> also<00:05:41.720> do<00:05:41.960> that<00:05:42.140> as<00:05:42.260> well<00:05:42.410> but

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
it you could also do that as well but

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.260 
it you could also do that as well but
that's<00:05:43.850> it

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
that's it

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.390 
that's it
it's<00:05:44.840> as<00:05:45.020> easy<00:05:45.229> as<00:05:45.410> that<00:05:45.590> to<00:05:45.650> create<00:05:46.010> that<00:05:46.100> soft

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
it's as easy as that to create that soft

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.580 
it's as easy as that to create that soft
glow<00:05:46.669> kind<00:05:47.060> of<00:05:47.120> a<00:05:47.210> hint<00:05:47.450> of<00:05:47.539> a<00:05:47.630> transition<00:05:48.169> but

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
glow kind of a hint of a transition but

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.640 
glow kind of a hint of a transition but
don't<00:05:49.550> be<00:05:49.640> afraid<00:05:49.880> to<00:05:50.030> give<00:05:50.150> it<00:05:50.240> a<00:05:50.300> try<00:05:52.000> and

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
don't be afraid to give it a try and

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.540 
don't be afraid to give it a try and
thank<00:05:54.650> you<00:05:54.740> for<00:05:54.919> watching<00:05:55.100> the<00:05:55.460> video
