00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
people just do the five and seven zeros

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.880 
people just do the five and seven zeros
because<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.630> think<00:03:11.840> anymore<00:03:12.110> after<00:03:12.380> that<00:03:12.680> they

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
because I think anymore after that they

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.250 
because I think anymore after that they
start<00:03:13.130> having<00:03:13.220> problems<00:03:13.490> with<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.910> game<00:03:14.260> but

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
start having problems with the game but

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.979 
start having problems with the game but
50<00:03:15.920> million<00:03:16.250> it's<00:03:16.760> more<00:03:17.209> than<00:03:17.360> enough<00:03:17.510> anyway

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
50 million it's more than enough anyway

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.970 
50 million it's more than enough anyway
so<00:03:19.420> but<00:03:20.420> once<00:03:20.570> you<00:03:20.690> do<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:21.470> just<00:03:21.590> go<00:03:21.770> back

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
so but once you do that you just go back

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.199 
so but once you do that you just go back
and<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:24.320> hit<00:03:24.470> done<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:24.709> then<00:03:25.520> after<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:26.030> do

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
and you hit done and then after you do

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.840 
and you hit done and then after you do
that<00:03:26.239> there<00:03:26.660> will<00:03:26.750> be<00:03:26.780> another<00:03:27.709> bar<00:03:28.160> down<00:03:28.550> here

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
that there will be another bar down here

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.620 
that there will be another bar down here
right<00:03:29.060> under<00:03:30.489> another<00:03:31.489> selection<00:03:31.880> there'll

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
right under another selection there'll

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.960 
right under another selection there'll
be<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:32.750> fourth<00:03:33.050> selection<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.830> I'll<00:03:34.220> have<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.400> %

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
be a fourth selection and I'll have a %

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.060 
be a fourth selection and I'll have a %
at<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.780> end<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:36.020> it<00:03:36.110> you<00:03:36.590> can<00:03:36.739> just<00:03:36.770> go<00:03:36.980> ahead

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
at the end of it you can just go ahead

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.740 
at the end of it you can just go ahead
and<00:03:37.190> delete<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:37.700> because<00:03:38.060> it's<00:03:38.239> it's

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
and delete that because it's it's

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.460 
and delete that because it's it's
useless<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.790> then<00:03:40.790> once<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.120> do<00:03:41.270> that<00:03:41.470> you
