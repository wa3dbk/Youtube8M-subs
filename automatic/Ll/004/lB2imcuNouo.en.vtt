is<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.650> massive<00:02:21.069> risk<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.519> know<00:02:21.640> like<00:02:22.030> making<00:02:22.450> a

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
is a massive risk you know like making a

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.970 
is a massive risk you know like making a
game<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.930> then<00:02:23.049> hoping<00:02:23.410> two<00:02:23.590> years<00:02:23.799> later

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
game and then hoping two years later

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.259 
game and then hoping two years later
three<00:02:24.430> years<00:02:24.579> later<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.090> game<00:02:25.239> actually

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
three years later that the game actually

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.670 
three years later that the game actually
is<00:02:25.630> something<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:26.019> players<00:02:26.230> actually<00:02:26.380> want

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
is something that players actually want

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.530 
is something that players actually want
to<00:02:26.799> be<00:02:26.980> involved<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.430> every<00:02:27.970> time<00:02:28.120> i<00:02:28.150> came<00:02:28.329> back
