00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.130
 thus making this balm very much 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.430
 very delicate we also have the status of 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.320
 yarrow that anti if I want ico e 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.520
 softening the linden extract which 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.530
 we have already said contains the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.950
 mucilage is the chamomile extract 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.210
 which gives shine and softness i 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.009
 hair this balm instead of flowers 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.100
 almond shea and hair 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.799
 dry and damaged inside 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.520
 precisely where we find a good amount 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.689
 shea butter shea butter is 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:44.100
 a protective moisturizing butter 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:46.979
 reinforcement and is the basis for 90 per 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.979
 hundred of body cosmetics for the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.920
 face that we find on the market that anti 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.740
 for the hair because a very good excellent 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.200
 ingredient along with the clay butter in 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.500
 this balm we also find the extract 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.960
 of almond flowers is an extract 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.580
 moisturizing soothing emollient 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.690
 great for dry and damaged hair 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.530
 they are two very good semi balls 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.800
 with different characteristics certainly 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:22.670
 the balm dr one hundred to the coconut to an inci 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.940
 more quality than this appreciated 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.480
 therefore more herbal components is in 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.430
 absolute I consider this balm 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.620
 cannot yet be beaten by 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.460
 someone else especially for the quality 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.870
 and for the very low price 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.710
 these two we can just find them 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.730
 on the market even at 99 cents in the 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:50.450
 supermarkets in cosmetics stores 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.790
 but also simply to the market for 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.360
 as far as consistency is concerned 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.820
 I show here how you can see 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.720
 are two consistencies completely 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.290
 different 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.460
 then this is the coconut cakes and 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.770
 you will see that driving is very fluid 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:14.440
 while this one is almond blossoms 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:17.780
 shea very thick full-bodied indeed 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.110
 this is the coconut balm at 200 and 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.530
 so fluid because it tends to soften 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.560
 long hair to untangle the knots a 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.450
 penetrate this way while it is 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.420
 just nourish those flowers of 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.760
 almond and charity suitable for hair 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.910
 Damaged buckets are offered to 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.850
 penetrate and that 's precisely why this is so 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.430
 then these two balms full-bodied 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.820
 I absolutely recommend them especially 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:52.310
 for the quality and the minimum price 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.680
 who have to say that they do not have an inci 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.989
 completely green then from 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.690
 emphasize this above all the 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.239
 bassano to almond charity flowers but 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.790
 I'm really two just aims to try 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.200
 they have nothing to envy balsamic 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.600
 He was in the trade marquez 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.760
 well known especially because 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.640
 those brands also cost four 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.780
 more times then every advice there 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.580
 I ask if you used it what you think 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.109
 if you have any criticism to make if you 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.970
 you are fine if you have found yourself 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.830
 bad 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:29.810
 we also emphasize the amount of 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:32.540
 produced 300 ml and is not little and therefore 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.330
 I thank you for listening to me 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.070
 I ask you to give me yours 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.160
 opinion on these two products 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.710
 if you have any advice for me and the 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.520
 I greet you and thank you and wish you one 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.880
