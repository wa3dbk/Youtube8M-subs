00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
Oh while we're on batteries let's talk

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.270 
Oh while we're on batteries let's talk
about<00:04:32.870> recording<00:04:33.870> media<00:04:34.170> cards<00:04:34.980> and<00:04:35.160> stuff

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
about recording media cards and stuff

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.100 
about recording media cards and stuff
like<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.580> so<00:04:35.820> almost<00:04:36.210> all<00:04:36.390> my<00:04:36.570> equipment<00:04:37.020> now

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
like that so almost all my equipment now

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.070 
like that so almost all my equipment now
runs<00:04:37.440> on<00:04:37.740> SD<00:04:38.430> cards<00:04:38.880> so<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.300> grew<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:39.780> little

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
runs on SD cards so I grew a little

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.840 
runs on SD cards so I grew a little
device<00:04:40.320> like<00:04:40.350> this<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:41.100> pack<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.370> whole<00:04:41.580> bunch<00:04:41.760> of

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
device like this I pack a whole bunch of

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.060 
device like this I pack a whole bunch of
them<00:04:42.000> into<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.420> I<00:04:42.600> can<00:04:42.750> go<00:04:42.870> in<00:04:42.990> at<00:04:43.080> about<00:04:43.200> 70

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
them into it I can go in at about 70

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.520 
them into it I can go in at about 70
gigabytes<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.760> day<00:04:45.020> fortunately<00:04:46.020> I<00:04:46.170> was<00:04:46.380> at<00:04:46.500> a

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530
