00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
students are coming through the system

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.619 
students are coming through the system
and<00:00:41.800> teaching<00:00:41.949> me<00:00:42.309> something<00:00:42.730> new<00:00:42.879> every<00:00:43.600> day

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629

the<00:00:44.440> face<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.010> world<00:00:45.190> is<00:00:45.460> changing

everyone<00:00:47.109> dances<00:00:47.739> to<00:00:47.949> a<00:00:47.980> beat<00:00:48.519> of<00:00:48.699> a<00:00:48.789> different

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
everyone dances to a beat of a different

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.829 
everyone dances to a beat of a different
drum<00:00:49.480> but<00:00:50.469> I<00:00:50.499> think<00:00:51.010> SDSU<00:00:51.730> recognizes<00:00:52.600> that

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
drum but I think SDSU recognizes that

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.340 
drum but I think SDSU recognizes that
when<00:00:53.019> you<00:00:53.140> bring<00:00:53.469> those<00:00:54.309> people<00:00:54.699> together

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
the drums are beating differently when

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.819 
the drums are beating differently when
we<00:01:00.519> come<00:01:00.879> together<00:01:01.059> there's<00:01:01.539> harmony<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.350> the

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
we come together there's harmony and the

we come together there's harmony and the
music<00:01:03.219> sounds<00:01:03.640> good<00:01:03.879> but<00:01:04.360> in<00:01:04.510> our<00:01:04.750> communities

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590
