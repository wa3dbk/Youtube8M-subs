everywhere<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.280> can<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:31.410> more<00:02:31.709> physically

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
everywhere I can and the more physically

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.000 
everywhere I can and the more physically
fit<00:02:32.280> I'd<00:02:32.580> become<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.900> easier<00:02:34.320> it<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.560> one<00:02:34.920> of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
fit I'd become the easier it is one of

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.910 
fit I'd become the easier it is one of
the<00:02:35.130> key<00:02:35.310> things<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.910> think<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.709> feels

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
the key things I think is that it feels

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.970 
the key things I think is that it feels
so<00:02:38.190> overwhelming<00:02:39.000> when<00:02:39.690> you're<00:02:40.440> out<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.590> shape

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
so overwhelming when you're out of shape

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.590 
so overwhelming when you're out of shape
that<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.370> think<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.850> could<00:02:42.000> never<00:02:42.180> do

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
that you think that you could never do

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.290 
that you think that you could never do
these<00:02:43.470> things<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.770> could<00:02:43.980> never<00:02:44.010> run<00:02:44.520> could

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
these things you could never run could

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.470 
these things you could never run could
never<00:02:45.480> walk<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:46.200> marathon<00:02:46.730> but<00:02:47.730> all<00:02:48.420> of

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
never walk in a marathon but all of

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.890 
never walk in a marathon but all of
those<00:02:48.810> possibilities<00:02:49.440> are<00:02:50.130> open<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.970> once
