the bag and attach it again it's a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.620 
the bag and attach it again it's a
little<00:01:17.430> bit<00:01:17.520> more<00:01:17.640> secure<00:01:18.060> than<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.299> bungee

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
little bit more secure than a bungee

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.109 
little bit more secure than a bungee
system<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.140> some<00:01:19.290> other<00:01:19.409> tailbacks<00:01:20.100> use<00:01:20.340> but

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
system that some other tailbacks use but

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.760 
system that some other tailbacks use but
it<00:01:21.240> does<00:01:21.390> require<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.930> strap<00:01:22.229> these<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.590> so

it does require you to strap these on so

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.830 
it does require you to strap these on so
it's<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> little<00:01:23.100> bit<00:01:23.189> more<00:01:23.280> time-consuming

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
it's a little bit more time-consuming

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.260 
it's a little bit more time-consuming
kind<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.920> exchange<00:01:25.920> one<00:01:26.310> inconvenience<00:01:27.090> for

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
into a hotel room or anything like that

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.609 
into a hotel room or anything like that
in<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.570> top<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> lid<00:01:40.140> you'll<00:01:40.290> see<00:01:40.409> there's

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
in the top of the lid you'll see there's

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.319 
in the top of the lid you'll see there's
for<00:01:40.799> playing<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.040> storage<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
for playing a storage so you have a

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.200 
for playing a storage so you have a
twelve-year<00:01:43.170> pocket<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:43.740> well<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.939> little

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
twelve-year pocket as well as a little

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.800 
twelve-year pocket as well as a little
keyring<00:01:45.630> keeper<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:47.189> zippered<00:01:47.610> pocket

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
keyring keeper and a zippered pocket

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.420 
keyring keeper and a zippered pocket
so<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.350> little<00:01:49.440> bit<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.710> storage<00:01:49.920> options

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
so just a little bit of storage options

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.370 
so just a little bit of storage options
perhaps<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.030> top<00:01:51.240> fairly<00:01:51.870> thin<00:01:52.050> though<00:01:52.230> so

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
perhaps on the top fairly thin though so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.290 
perhaps on the top fairly thin though so
it's<00:01:52.500> going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.650> be<00:01:52.770> limited<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.160> thin<00:01:53.970> items

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
it's going to be limited to thin items

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.850 
it's going to be limited to thin items
maybe<00:01:54.510> your<00:01:54.690> registration<00:01:55.440> or<00:01:55.560> something

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
maybe your registration or something

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.070 
maybe your registration or something
like<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.160> and<00:01:56.970> then<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.330> inside<00:01:57.720> of<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.900> bag

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
like that and then the inside of the bag

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.050 
like that and then the inside of the bag
is<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> decent<00:01:58.979> size<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.550> said<00:01:59.760> and<00:01:59.940> one

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
is a decent size like I said and one

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.310 
is a decent size like I said and one
thing<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.510> like<00:02:00.690> about<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.050> way<00:02:01.170> they

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
thing I really like about the way they

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.620 
thing I really like about the way they
did<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.710> bag<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.430> they've<00:02:02.640> given<00:02:02.940> you<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> nice

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
did this bag is they've given you a nice

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.719 
did this bag is they've given you a nice
large<00:02:03.930> opening<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.680> lot<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:04.979> times<00:02:05.250> these<00:02:05.460> bags

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
large opening a lot of times these bags

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.090 
large opening a lot of times these bags
have<00:02:06.660> a<00:02:06.690> decent<00:02:07.050> capacity<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> openings

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
have a decent capacity but the openings

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.620 
have a decent capacity but the openings
so<00:02:08.220> small<00:02:08.520> you're<00:02:08.700> kind<00:02:08.880> of<00:02:08.910> limited<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.330> what

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
so small you're kind of limited on what

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.420 
so small you're kind of limited on what
you<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:10.050> actually<00:02:10.200> put<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.649> there<00:02:10.830> now<00:02:11.280> if<00:02:11.370> I

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
you can actually put in there now if I

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:21.560 
you can actually put in there now if I
expand<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.970> bags<00:02:19.550> you're<00:02:20.550> going<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.820> gain<00:02:21.090> six

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
expand the bags you're going to gain six

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.460 
expand the bags you're going to gain six
meters<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.230> storage<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.230> see<00:02:25.380> it

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
meters of storage so you can see it

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.590 
meters of storage so you can see it
opens<00:02:25.950> up<00:02:26.100> really<00:02:26.430> nicely<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.300> just<00:02:27.480> a

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
opens up really nicely and it's just a

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.690 
opens up really nicely and it's just a
zipper<00:02:27.900> you'll<00:02:28.350> see<00:02:28.500> with<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.890> saddlebags

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
zipper you'll see with the saddlebags

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.000 
zipper you'll see with the saddlebags
attached<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.239> kind<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.739> fish<00:02:31.739> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
attached I kind of have to fish the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.800 
attached I kind of have to fish the
zipper<00:02:32.310> around<00:02:32.430> underneath<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.180> straps<00:02:33.540> but

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
zipper around underneath the straps but

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.630 
zipper around underneath the straps but
it's<00:02:33.959> doable<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:37.140> just<00:02:37.440> get<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.160> unzipped

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
it's doable and just get that unzipped

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.550
