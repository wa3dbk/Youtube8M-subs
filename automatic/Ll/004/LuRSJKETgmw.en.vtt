does it by preventing crime by being
there<00:02:36.780> as<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.959> visible<00:02:37.260> presence<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.549> does

there as a visible presence and it does

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
very good quality of image that we can

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.949 
very good quality of image that we can
use<00:02:43.379> to<00:02:43.680> use<00:02:44.489> in<00:02:44.610> prosecutions<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.390> should

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
use to use in prosecutions and should

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.390 
use to use in prosecutions and should
have<00:02:46.049> come<00:02:46.170> about<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.650> prevention<00:02:47.069> and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
have come about so prevention and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.150 
have come about so prevention and
detection<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.540> that's<00:02:49.049> sort<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.680> catalyst

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
detection of that's sort of the catalyst

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.949 
detection of that's sort of the catalyst
were<00:02:50.280> using<00:02:50.579> it<00:02:50.670> really<00:02:50.940> I'm<00:02:51.239> in<00:02:51.540> areas<00:02:51.840> where

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
were using it really I'm in areas where

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.020 
were using it really I'm in areas where
we<00:02:52.349> haven't<00:02:52.500> got<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.709> decent<00:02:52.920> system<00:02:53.250> in<00:02:53.910> place

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
we haven't got a decent system in place

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.150 
we haven't got a decent system in place
when<00:02:54.900> we<00:02:54.930> propose<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.500> solutions<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.010> the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
when we propose the solutions to the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.830 
when we propose the solutions to the
police<00:02:56.370> their<00:02:56.670> first<00:02:56.700> reaction<00:02:57.060> was<00:02:57.480> one<00:02:57.720> of

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
police their first reaction was one of

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.569 
police their first reaction was one of
the<00:02:57.959> confidence<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.190> was<00:02:59.280> actually

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
the confidence that it was actually

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.860 
the confidence that it was actually
going<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.790> be<00:02:59.849> a<00:02:59.940> solution<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.450> was<00:03:00.690> going<00:03:00.840> to

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
going to be a solution that was going to

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.509 
going to be a solution that was going to
be<00:03:00.930> specifically<00:03:01.829> tailored<00:03:02.099> to<00:03:02.340> their

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
be specifically tailored to their

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.699 
be specifically tailored to their
individual<00:03:03.030> needs<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.569> was<00:03:04.049> going<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.260> do<00:03:04.470> what

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
individual needs I was going to do what

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.830 
individual needs I was going to do what
what<00:03:05.519> they<00:03:05.640> expected<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.239> do<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.569> that<00:03:06.660> was<00:03:06.780> to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
what they expected to do and that was to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.410 
what they expected to do and that was to
reduce<00:03:07.500> crime<00:03:07.950> wherever<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.790> van<00:03:08.970> was<00:03:09.150> placed

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
reduce crime wherever the van was placed

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.539 
reduce crime wherever the van was placed
so<00:03:10.019> any<00:03:10.109> profession<00:03:10.560> work<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.799> us<00:03:10.920> in<00:03:11.099> a<00:03:11.190> couple

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
so any profession work of us in a couple

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.460 
so any profession work of us in a couple
of<00:03:11.579> ways<00:03:11.700> with<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:11.940> van<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.359> own<00:03:13.079> approaches

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
of ways with the van and own approaches

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.349 
of ways with the van and own approaches
and<00:03:13.859> discussions<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:14.669> sort<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.180> needs

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
and discussions that sort of the needs

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.970 
and discussions that sort of the needs
that<00:03:15.419> we<00:03:15.599> needed<00:03:15.840> they<00:03:16.079> came<00:03:16.319> up<00:03:16.349> and<00:03:16.889> offered

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
that we needed they came up and offered

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.319 
that we needed they came up and offered
a<00:03:17.220> number<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.519> solutions<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.030> they<00:03:18.150> had

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
a number of solutions that they had

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.659 
a number of solutions that they had
available<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:19.349> us<00:03:19.500> Liam<00:03:19.769> they<00:03:20.190> showed<00:03:20.400> us<00:03:20.549> how

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
available to us Liam they showed us how

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:21.979 
available to us Liam they showed us how
they<00:03:20.700> could<00:03:20.910> integrate<00:03:21.150> some<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.569> those<00:03:21.660> and

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
they could integrate some of those and

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.569 
they could integrate some of those and
products<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.650> services<00:03:23.010> with<00:03:23.190> what<00:03:23.430> we

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
products and services with what we

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.819 
products and services with what we
wanted<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.060> they<00:03:25.049> came<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.440> good<00:03:25.590> training

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
wanted and they came of a good training

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.890 
wanted and they came of a good training
package<00:03:26.250> when<00:03:26.370> we<00:03:26.459> came<00:03:26.639> to<00:03:26.700> what<00:03:27.599> we<00:03:27.720> needed

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
package when we came to what we needed

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.360 
package when we came to what we needed
which<00:03:28.169> is<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.590> system<00:03:28.889> who<00:03:29.010> got<00:03:29.190> there

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
which is the system who got there

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.760 
which is the system who got there
basically
