00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
because the only reason it keeps

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.650 
because the only reason it keeps
happening<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.210> order

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
happening in that order

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.479 
happening in that order
that<00:01:01.199> same<00:01:01.440> pattern<00:01:01.649> would<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.129> if<00:01:02.309> they<00:01:02.460> knew

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that same pattern would be if they knew

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.329 
that same pattern would be if they knew
if<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> alarm<00:01:03.359> was<00:01:03.480> off<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:04.979> where<00:01:05.100> did<00:01:05.220> this

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
if the alarm was off so where did this

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.910 
if the alarm was off so where did this
doll<00:01:05.549> come<00:01:05.820> from<00:01:08.869> probably<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.500> guy<00:01:10.619> down<00:01:10.799> the
