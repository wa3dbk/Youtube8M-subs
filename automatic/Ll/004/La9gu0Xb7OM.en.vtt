OEM<00:04:43.210> rubber<00:04:43.570> hanger<00:04:48.270> all<00:04:49.270> right<00:04:49.389> we<00:04:49.510> had<00:04:49.630> a

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
OEM rubber hanger all right we had a

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.780 
OEM rubber hanger all right we had a
little<00:04:49.840> bit<00:04:49.990> of<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.200> delay<00:04:50.470> here<00:04:50.740> with<00:04:51.220> this

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
little bit of a delay here with this

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.510 
little bit of a delay here with this
particular<00:04:52.389> hanger<00:04:52.960> would<00:04:53.680> not<00:04:53.979> go<00:04:54.310> through

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
particular hanger would not go through

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.900 
particular hanger would not go through
so<00:04:54.820> we<00:04:54.940> had<00:04:55.090> detach<00:04:55.750> it<00:04:56.020> from<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:57.280> truck<00:04:57.580> and

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
so we had detach it from the truck and

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.080 
so we had detach it from the truck and
take<00:04:58.210> it<00:04:58.240> over<00:04:58.419> to<00:04:58.690> a<00:04:58.720> vise<00:04:59.139> and<00:04:59.850> get<00:05:00.850> it<00:05:00.970> on

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
take it over to a vise and get it on

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.170 
take it over to a vise and get it on
that<00:05:01.360> way<00:05:01.570> it<00:05:02.080> would<00:05:02.229> not<00:05:02.470> go<00:05:02.770> through<00:05:03.060> so<00:05:04.060> we

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
that way it would not go through so we

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.029 
that way it would not go through so we
got<00:05:04.330> one<00:05:04.479> more<00:05:04.630> to<00:05:04.690> go<00:05:04.780> hopefully<00:05:05.320> won't<00:05:05.650> have

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
got one more to go hopefully won't have

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:13.020 
got one more to go hopefully won't have
the<00:05:06.190> same<00:05:06.370> problem<00:05:06.840> later<00:05:08.729> all<00:05:09.729> right<00:05:12.030> all
