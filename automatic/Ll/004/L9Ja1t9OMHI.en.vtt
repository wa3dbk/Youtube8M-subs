00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the preseason 1 so I'm not too hopeful

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
as well so that's mostly probably gonna

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.290 
as well so that's mostly probably gonna
come<00:04:39.560> just<00:04:39.800> from<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.040> prestige<00:04:40.550> of<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:41.120> tech

he plays in Italy and he played in the
BPL<00:04:46.490> as<00:04:46.610> well<00:04:46.760> so<00:04:46.940> maybe<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.960> know<00:04:48.140> the<00:04:48.260> I've

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
BPL as well so maybe you know the I've

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.660 
BPL as well so maybe you know the I've
got<00:04:48.380> gala<00:04:48.680> Tasha<00:04:48.920> I<00:04:49.010> only<00:04:49.130> got<00:04:49.310> phenibut

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
got gala Tasha I only got phenibut

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.160 
got gala Tasha I only got phenibut
you've<00:04:49.940> got<00:04:50.060> some<00:04:50.180> incredible<00:04:50.690> players<00:04:50.930> but

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
you've got some incredible players but

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.750 
you've got some incredible players but
apart<00:04:51.620> from<00:04:51.680> that<00:04:51.800> it's<00:04:52.040> not<00:04:52.190> as<00:04:52.310> massive<00:04:52.640> as

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
apart from that it's not as massive as

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.340 
apart from that it's not as massive as
some<00:04:52.910> of<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.030> other<00:04:53.120> league<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:53.450> maybe<00:04:53.630> I<00:04:53.870> will

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
some of the other league so maybe I will

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.420 
some of the other league so maybe I will
take<00:04:54.560> it<00:04:54.650> down<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:54.890> maybe<00:04:54.980> that's<00:04:55.160> why<00:04:55.250> some

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
take it down and maybe that's why some

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.590 
take it down and maybe that's why some
people's<00:04:55.670> predictions<00:04:55.910> have<00:04:56.210> come<00:04:56.330> from<00:04:56.420> but
