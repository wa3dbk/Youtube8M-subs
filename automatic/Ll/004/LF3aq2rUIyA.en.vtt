most of you've got the basic principle
right<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.550> I'm<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:24.119> going<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.330> explain<00:00:24.480> how

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
right and I'm just going to explain how

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.109 
right and I'm just going to explain how
I<00:00:24.840> did<00:00:25.289> it

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
I did it

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.480 
I did it
firstly<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.330> will<00:00:27.510> see<00:00:27.750> 9<00:00:28.410> item<00:00:29.010> frames<00:00:29.250> way

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
firstly you will see 9 item frames way

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.490 
firstly you will see 9 item frames way
up<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.939> sky<00:00:29.970> they<00:00:30.810> all<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> same

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
up in the sky they all have the same

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.250 
up in the sky they all have the same
custom<00:00:32.309> name<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.700> every<00:00:33.660> time<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.050> stand

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
custom name and every time you stand

for block command will be run depending

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.880 
for block command will be run depending
on<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.210> command<00:00:42.480> inside<00:00:42.750> your<00:00:43.170> command<00:00:43.590> score

off<00:00:46.739> there<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> few<00:00:47.550> command<00:00:47.850> blocks<00:00:48.090> that

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
off there are a few command blocks that

they<00:00:54.449> find<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.110> simply<00:00:55.739> generate<00:00:56.160> an

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
they find one I simply generate an

they find one I simply generate an
output<00:00:56.579> over<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:57.620> for<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> saving<00:00:59.160> and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
and then clone it back if you type slash

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.990 
and then clone it back if you type slash
load<00:01:07.040> for<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> point<00:01:08.490> commands

I simply summon an armed stand at the
position<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> command<00:01:11.640> block<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.000> then

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
position of the command block and then

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.780 
position of the command block and then
teleport<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> player<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.040> if<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.400> correct

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
teleport the player to it if the correct

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.870 
teleport the player to it if the correct
command<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.390> entered<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:17.100> languages<00:01:17.729> are

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
command is entered the languages are

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.030 
command is entered the languages are
just<00:01:18.180> normal<00:01:18.450> which<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.869> writing<00:01:19.110> pads<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
just normal which is writing pads and I

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.130 
just normal which is writing pads and I
also<00:01:20.430> teleport<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.240> custom<00:01:21.600> block<00:01:21.780> model<00:01:22.080> I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
also teleport a custom block model I

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.249 
also teleport a custom block model I
made<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.560> them<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:24.090> custom<00:01:24.479> commands<00:01:24.869> are<00:01:25.049> not

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
made to them the custom commands are not

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.819 
made to them the custom commands are not
complicated<00:01:26.009> at<00:01:26.220> all<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.540> was<00:01:27.750> more<00:01:27.990> about

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
complicated at all but it was more about

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.010 
complicated at all but it was more about
the<00:01:29.070> creation<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.790> custom<00:01:29.970> commands<00:01:30.450> whereas

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
the creation of custom commands whereas

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.200 
the creation of custom commands whereas
the<00:01:31.560> only<00:01:31.799> tricky<00:01:32.070> part<00:01:32.340> was<00:01:32.549> changing<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the only tricky part was changing the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.460 
the only tricky part was changing the
last<00:01:33.420> output<00:01:33.810> line<00:01:36.170> unfortunately<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.200> don't

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
last output line unfortunately I don't

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.560 
last output line unfortunately I don't
think<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.340> write<00:01:38.579> anything<00:01:39.090> there

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
think that you can write anything there

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.319 
think that you can write anything there
but<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.770> used<00:01:41.100> some<00:01:41.250> other<00:01:41.640> commands<00:01:42.090> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
but I just used some other commands and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.440 
but I just used some other commands and
changed<00:01:42.780> some<00:01:42.840> entity<00:01:43.470> names<00:01:43.680> for<00:01:43.920> example<00:01:44.450> if

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
changed some entity names for example if

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.120 
changed some entity names for example if
you<00:01:45.600> want<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> take<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> closer<00:01:46.439> look<00:01:46.560> at<00:01:46.920> all

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
you want to take a closer look at all

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.740 
you want to take a closer look at all
the<00:01:47.250> commands<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:47.790> create<00:01:47.850> your<00:01:48.479> own<00:01:48.509> ones

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the commands or create your own ones

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.810 
the commands or create your own ones
