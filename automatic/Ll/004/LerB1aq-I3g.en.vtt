00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
nuke box hands pressure treated tops I

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.330 
nuke box hands pressure treated tops I
also<00:01:08.939> do<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.360> do<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.840> my<00:01:09.960> tops<00:01:10.229> also

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.090 

then<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.970> most<00:01:18.119> critical<00:01:18.600> thing<00:01:19.100> because

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
then the most critical thing because

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.700 
then the most critical thing because
we're<00:01:20.250> pressure<00:01:20.460> treating<00:01:21.500> well<00:01:22.500> actually

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
we're pressure treating well actually

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.780 
we're pressure treating well actually
not<00:01:22.890> pressure<00:01:23.159> treating<00:01:23.520> we're<00:01:23.640> we're<00:01:23.759> just

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
not pressure treating we're we're just

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.890 
not pressure treating we're we're just
treating<00:01:24.119> our<00:01:24.390> wood<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:25.580> what<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.670> do<00:01:26.850> at<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
treating our wood is what we do at the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.890 
treating our wood is what we do at the
end<00:01:28.790> we<00:01:29.790> do<00:01:29.909> nuke<00:01:30.119> boxes<00:01:32.540> I'm<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.750> show

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
end we do nuke boxes I'm going to show

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.590 
end we do nuke boxes I'm going to show
you<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> difference<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.979> perishing<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.600> when

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
you the difference of perishing is when

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.090 
you the difference of perishing is when
they're<00:01:36.750> done<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.200> also<00:01:37.350> date<00:01:37.650> everything<00:01:37.920> on

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
they're done we also date everything on

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.090 
they're done we also date everything on
the<00:01:38.189> inside<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.060> know<00:01:39.210> when<00:01:40.049> every<00:01:40.650> box<00:01:40.890> was

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the inside so we know when every box was

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.480 
the inside so we know when every box was
built<00:01:44.420> but<00:01:45.439> we<00:01:46.439> leave<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.310> long

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
built but we leave the up the long

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.310 
built but we leave the up the long
inside<00:01:48.030> size<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:49.170> our<00:01:49.740> boxes<00:01:50.390> unpainted<00:01:51.390> but

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
inside size of our boxes unpainted but

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.319 
inside size of our boxes unpainted but
the<00:01:52.409> critical<00:01:52.740> thing<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.240> painting<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the critical thing is painting the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
also paint on the inside the ends where

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.730 
also paint on the inside the ends where
we<00:02:01.409> have<00:02:01.530> more<00:02:01.680> be<00:02:01.890> travel<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.439> three<00:02:04.439> very
