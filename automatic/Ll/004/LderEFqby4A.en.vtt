section from an Echoplex EP 3 tape delay
unit<00:00:20.410> so<00:00:21.410> I<00:00:21.500> remember<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:21.920> first<00:00:21.950> time<00:00:22.340> that<00:00:22.820> I

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
unit so I remember the first time that I

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.140 
unit so I remember the first time that I
ever<00:00:22.910> plugged<00:00:23.360> into<00:00:23.570> a<00:00:23.690> tape<00:00:23.960> delay<00:00:24.290> and<00:00:24.700> I<00:00:25.700> was

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
ever plugged into a tape delay and I was

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.970 
ever plugged into a tape delay and I was
like<00:00:26.300> wow<00:00:26.480> this<00:00:26.690> thing<00:00:26.870> sounds<00:00:27.140> amazing<00:00:27.680> I

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
like wow this thing sounds amazing I

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.530 
like wow this thing sounds amazing I
love<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:28.280> delay<00:00:28.520> aspect<00:00:28.970> but<00:00:29.060> I<00:00:29.120> also<00:00:29.210> love

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
love the delay aspect but I also love

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.850 
love the delay aspect but I also love
what<00:00:29.690> it<00:00:29.780> did<00:00:29.900> for<00:00:29.930> my<00:00:30.140> guitar<00:00:30.290> sound<00:00:30.680> this<00:00:30.800> is

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
what it did for my guitar sound this is

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.409 
what it did for my guitar sound this is
when<00:00:31.100> I<00:00:31.130> was<00:00:31.280> like<00:00:31.370> a<00:00:31.400> kid<00:00:31.700> I<00:00:31.760> remember<00:00:32.149> being<00:00:32.300> a

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
when I was like a kid I remember being a

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.270 
when I was like a kid I remember being a
teenager<00:00:32.710> thinking<00:00:33.710> wow<00:00:33.829> this<00:00:33.950> thing<00:00:34.129> like

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
teenager thinking wow this thing like

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.819 
teenager thinking wow this thing like
fattens<00:00:34.670> up<00:00:34.790> my<00:00:34.969> tone<00:00:35.379> even<00:00:36.379> when<00:00:36.530> there's<00:00:36.739> no

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
fattens up my tone even when there's no

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:37.689 
fattens up my tone even when there's no
echo<00:00:37.100> going<00:00:37.280> on

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
echo going on

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.829 
echo going on
so<00:00:39.070> basically<00:00:40.070> well<00:00:40.429> I<00:00:40.999> guess<00:00:41.449> Peter<00:00:41.659> was

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
so basically well I guess Peter was

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:43.180 
so basically well I guess Peter was
curious<00:00:42.170> Peter<00:00:42.469> clinch<00:00:42.710> was<00:00:42.829> curious<00:00:43.129> about

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
curious Peter clinch was curious about

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.430 
curious Peter clinch was curious about
the<00:00:43.339> same<00:00:43.519> thing<00:00:43.760> designed<00:00:44.269> the<00:00:45.140> Echoplex

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
the same thing designed the Echoplex

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.139 
the same thing designed the Echoplex
preamp<00:00:45.920> into<00:00:46.129> this<00:00:46.219> little<00:00:46.399> pedal<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:46.879> lo<00:00:46.999> and

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
preamp into this little pedal and lo and

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.329 
preamp into this little pedal and lo and
behold<00:00:47.210> here<00:00:47.600> it<00:00:47.719> is<00:00:47.839> so<00:00:48.079> quoting<00:00:48.499> from<00:00:48.649> the

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
behold here it is so quoting from the

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.689 
behold here it is so quoting from the
clinch<00:00:50.179> effects<00:00:50.780> website<00:00:51.230> he<00:00:51.440> says<00:00:51.679> to<00:00:52.579> my

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
clinch effects website he says to my

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.579 
clinch effects website he says to my
surprise<00:00:53.089> it<00:00:53.120> fattened<00:00:53.780> my<00:00:53.839> tone<00:00:54.050> is<00:00:54.079> sounded

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
surprise it fattened my tone is sounded

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.590 
surprise it fattened my tone is sounded
great<00:00:54.769> at<00:00:55.069> this<00:00:55.280> point<00:00:55.550> he<00:00:55.699> began<00:00:56.120> seriously

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
great at this point he began seriously

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.209 
great at this point he began seriously
analyze<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.140> behavior<00:00:57.229> in<00:00:57.589> this<00:00:57.679> circuit<00:00:58.069> and

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
analyze the behavior in this circuit and

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.219 
analyze the behavior in this circuit and
found<00:00:58.819> that<00:00:58.999> apart<00:00:59.359> from<00:00:59.390> a<00:00:59.600> small<00:00:59.870> amount<00:01:00.109> of

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
found that apart from a small amount of

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.009 
found that apart from a small amount of
top<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:00.649> bottom<00:01:01.010> cut<00:01:01.479> the<00:01:02.479> circuit<00:01:02.809> had<00:01:02.989> a

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
top and bottom cut the circuit had a

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.380 
top and bottom cut the circuit had a
nonlinear<00:01:03.949> phase<00:01:04.159> response<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:05.000> he<00:01:05.089> believes

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
nonlinear phase response and he believes

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.420 
nonlinear phase response and he believes
that<00:01:05.510> this<00:01:05.960> phase<00:01:06.200> response<00:01:06.380> is<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.070> secret

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
that this phase response is the secret

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.120 
that this phase response is the secret
of<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:08.119> magic<00:01:08.270> tone<00:01:08.659> of<00:01:09.259> an<00:01:09.409> Echoplex<00:01:09.619> preamp

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
of the magic tone of an Echoplex preamp

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.690 
of the magic tone of an Echoplex preamp
so<00:01:10.880> there<00:01:11.299> you<00:01:11.360> go<00:01:11.509> I<00:01:12.409> don't<00:01:12.979> know<00:01:13.159> I<00:01:13.340> just<00:01:13.399> know

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
so there you go I don't know I just know

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.010 
so there you go I don't know I just know
it<00:01:13.790> makes<00:01:13.909> my<00:01:14.030> guitar<00:01:14.299> sound<00:01:14.540> better<00:01:14.719> so<00:01:14.990> I

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
it makes my guitar sound better so I

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.740 
it makes my guitar sound better so I
took<00:01:15.619> this<00:01:15.829> guy<00:01:16.189> out<00:01:16.340> on<00:01:16.490> tour<00:01:16.700> about<00:01:17.509> six

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
took this guy out on tour about six

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.420 
took this guy out on tour about six
months<00:01:17.960> ago<00:01:18.049> and<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.680> just<00:01:18.860> leave<00:01:19.009> it<00:01:19.100> on<00:01:19.189> all

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
the time it's like a magic box that I

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.660 
the time it's like a magic box that I
just<00:01:21.140> turn<00:01:21.469> on<00:01:21.649> and<00:01:21.860> leave<00:01:21.979> on<00:01:22.130> you'll<00:01:22.310> see<00:01:22.369> why

what<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.719> pedal<00:01:41.960> is<00:01:42.049> doing<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.500> then<00:01:43.159> I'll

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
what the pedal is doing and then I'll

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.370 
what the pedal is doing and then I'll
crank<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.240> snot<00:01:44.479> out<00:01:44.659> of<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.840> amp<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.170> hear

crank the snot out of the amp and hear

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.359 
crank the snot out of the amp and hear
what<00:01:45.469> that<00:01:45.530> sounds<00:01:45.890> like<00:01:45.920> too<00:01:46.159> with<00:01:46.340> a

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
what that sounds like too with a

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.919 
what that sounds like too with a
different<00:01:46.670> guitar<00:01:46.939> ok<00:01:47.359> so<00:01:47.420> here<00:01:47.600> we<00:01:47.689> go<00:01:47.780> this

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
different guitar ok so here we go this

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.039 
different guitar ok so here we go this

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
is the Clinch FX EP pre ok so once again

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.080 
is the Clinch FX EP pre ok so once again
I'm<00:01:51.229> playing<00:01:51.439> through<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.619> Sur<00:01:51.829> SL<00:01:52.159> 68<00:01:52.640> which<00:01:52.909> is

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
I'm playing through a Sur SL 68 which is

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.330 
I'm playing through a Sur SL 68 which is
like<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.600> 68<00:01:54.020> plexi<00:01:54.439> basically<00:01:54.740> it's<00:01:54.829> fantastic

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
like a 68 plexi basically it's fantastic

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.160 
like a 68 plexi basically it's fantastic
sounding<00:01:55.609> amp<00:01:55.759> I<00:01:55.939> got<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.149> volume<00:01:56.299> on<00:01:56.600> about<00:01:56.840> 2

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
sounding amp I got the volume on about 2

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.080 
sounding amp I got the volume on about 2
right<00:01:57.469> now<00:01:57.679> so<00:01:57.979> it's<00:01:58.340> at<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.579> level<00:01:58.729> where

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
right now so it's at the level where

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.630 
right now so it's at the level where
it's<00:01:59.600> pretty<00:01:59.810> much<00:01:59.929> clean<00:02:00.429> when<00:02:01.429> you<00:02:01.520> might

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
it's pretty much clean when you might

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.190 
it's pretty much clean when you might
call<00:02:01.789> edge<00:02:01.999> or<00:02:02.179> breakup<00:02:02.539> if<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:02.719> really<00:02:03.079> lay

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
call edge or breakup if I really lay

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.950 
call edge or breakup if I really lay
into<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.679> might<00:02:03.799> distort<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.249> little<00:02:04.490> bit

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
into it it might distort a little bit

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.050 
into it it might distort a little bit
okay<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.020> I'm<00:02:06.499> playing<00:02:06.799> with<00:02:07.729> a<00:02:07.789> tone<00:02:08.030> like

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
okay so I'm playing with a tone like

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.630 
okay so I'm playing with a tone like
this<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:08.539> that<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.780> can<00:02:08.810> hear<00:02:09.520> exactly<00:02:10.520> what

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
this so that you can hear exactly what

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.130 
this so that you can hear exactly what
the<00:02:10.759> pedal<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.090> doing<00:02:11.330> with<00:02:11.480> with<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.840> clean

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
the pedal is doing with with a clean

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.809 
the pedal is doing with with a clean
sound<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:12.800> here's<00:02:13.129> the<00:02:13.220> way<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.489> guitar

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
sound so here's the way the guitar

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:14.660 
sound so here's the way the guitar
sounds<00:02:14.209> with<00:02:14.330> nope

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
sounds with nope

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.350 
sounds with nope
at<00:02:14.700> all

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.220 

okay<00:02:20.360> now<00:02:20.540> I've<00:02:20.600> got<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.810> volume<00:02:20.960> on<00:02:21.200> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
okay now I've got the volume on the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.020 
okay now I've got the volume on the
pedal<00:02:21.530> set<00:02:21.650> about<00:02:21.860> nine<00:02:22.100> o'clock<00:02:22.280> listen<00:02:22.970> to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
pedal set about nine o'clock listen to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.399 
pedal set about nine o'clock listen to
the<00:02:23.150> tone<00:02:23.270> shift<00:02:23.570> when<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.780> turn<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.050> pedal<00:02:24.290> on

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.280 

okay<00:02:29.409> once<00:02:29.590> again<00:02:29.709> off

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.820 

and<00:02:34.290> on

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.100 

okay<00:02:38.760> it's<00:02:38.910> subtle<00:02:39.150> at<00:02:39.570> this<00:02:39.720> level<00:02:39.930> you're

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
okay it's subtle at this level you're

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.690 
okay it's subtle at this level you're
not<00:02:40.140> getting<00:02:40.440> much<00:02:40.560> boost<00:02:40.800> at<00:02:40.980> all<00:02:41.100> maybe<00:02:41.310> half

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
not getting much boost at all maybe half

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.700 
not getting much boost at all maybe half
a<00:02:41.730> DB<00:02:42.000> or<00:02:42.180> something<00:02:42.630> like<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.960> but<00:02:43.410> what<00:02:43.590> you

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
a DB or something like that but what you

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.710 
a DB or something like that but what you
are<00:02:43.740> getting<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.460> lower<00:02:44.940> mid<00:02:45.330> kind<00:02:45.630> of

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
are getting is this lower mid kind of

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.330 
are getting is this lower mid kind of
thick<00:02:45.930> fattening<00:02:46.530> effect<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.070> sounds

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
thick fattening effect that sounds

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.830 
thick fattening effect that sounds
really<00:02:47.550> cool<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.940> me<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.270> I'll<00:02:48.450> toggle<00:02:48.630> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
really cool to me so I'll toggle the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.030 
really cool to me so I'll toggle the
pedal<00:02:49.110> on<00:02:49.230> an<00:02:49.320> aweful<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.680> hold<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.920> chord

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
pedal on an aweful I hold a chord

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.110 
pedal on an aweful I hold a chord
so<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.489> with<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.640> off

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:09.150 

okay<00:02:58.120> so<00:03:03.210> I'll<00:03:04.210> turn<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.510> on<00:03:04.600> now<00:03:07.980> things<00:03:08.980> just

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160

get<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.310> little<00:03:09.460> bit<00:03:09.640> fatter<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.210> just

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
get a little bit fatter and it just

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.110 
get a little bit fatter and it just
becomes<00:03:10.540> more<00:03:10.780> fun<00:03:10.990> to<00:03:11.170> play<00:03:11.700> okay<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:12.760> now<00:03:12.970> as

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
becomes more fun to play okay so now as

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.790 
becomes more fun to play okay so now as
I<00:03:13.210> rotate<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.690> knob<00:03:13.840> up<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.320> about<00:03:14.470> noon

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
I rotate the knob up to about noon

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.350 
I rotate the knob up to about noon
you're<00:03:15.250> gonna<00:03:15.340> get<00:03:15.490> about<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:16.030> don't<00:03:16.240> know

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
three or four DB or something is the

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.350 
three or four DB or something is the
maximum<00:03:18.310> boost<00:03:18.460> this<00:03:18.700> pedal<00:03:18.970> will<00:03:19.060> give<00:03:19.210> you

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
maximum boost this pedal will give you

so here's uh here's like a riff with no
no<00:03:25.090> pedal<00:03:27.780> now<00:03:28.780> I'll<00:03:28.900> turn<00:03:29.020> on<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.290> pedal

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:51.400 

okay<00:03:41.390> once<00:03:41.570> again<00:03:41.690> no<00:03:41.930> cuddle<00:03:50.080> okay<00:03:51.080> so<00:03:51.140> if

okay once again no cuddle okay so if
anybody<00:03:51.710> ever<00:03:51.830> tells<00:03:51.920> you<00:03:52.160> an<00:03:52.250> Echoplex

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
anybody ever tells you an Echoplex

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.400 
anybody ever tells you an Echoplex
doesn't<00:03:53.000> change<00:03:53.150> your<00:03:53.360> sound<00:03:53.510> telling

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
doesn't change your sound telling

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.230 
doesn't change your sound telling
they're<00:03:54.530> lyin<00:03:54.740> because<00:03:55.100> it<00:03:55.370> does<00:03:55.580> you
