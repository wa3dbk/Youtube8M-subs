00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
speed just going to take if you just

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.719 
speed just going to take if you just
take<00:01:51.079> 20<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.140> will<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.500> very<00:01:52.860> fast<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.520> take

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
take 20 it will be very fast we take

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.300 
take 20 it will be very fast we take
about<00:01:53.909> four<00:01:54.840> thousand<00:01:55.350> five<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.680> twenty<00:01:56.070> well

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
about four thousand five and twenty well

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.060 
about four thousand five and twenty well
very<00:01:56.820> very<00:01:57.030> slow<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:59.719> then<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.350> now<00:02:01.710> I'm<00:02:01.920> going

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
very very slow so then and now I'm going

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.969 
very very slow so then and now I'm going
to<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.399> something<00:02:02.610> how<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.390> make<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.979> false

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
to do something how to make a false

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.450 
to do something how to make a false
attack<00:02:05.340> answer<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:06.060> very<00:02:06.479> simple<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
attack answer is very simple and

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.730 
attack answer is very simple and
the<00:02:08.790> end<00:02:08.880> of<00:02:09.150> fabrication<00:02:10.050> something<00:02:10.470> called

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
the end of fabrication something called

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.180 
the end of fabrication something called
attack<00:02:11.490> speed<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:13.350> normos<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.040> should

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
attack speed and the normos you should

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.550 
attack speed and the normos you should
be<00:02:14.930> 250<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.370> if<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:18.270> change<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:19.140> like

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
be 250 so if you just change that like

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.860 
be 250 so if you just change that like
50<00:02:20.220> their<00:02:20.780> attack<00:02:21.780> on<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:23.630> vocations<00:02:24.630> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
50 their attack on the vocations the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.820 
50 their attack on the vocations the
players<00:02:25.230> will<00:02:26.220> be<00:02:26.370> very<00:02:26.640> very<00:02:26.700> fast<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.830> you

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
players will be very very fast so you

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.150 
players will be very very fast so you
just<00:02:29.070> hit<00:02:29.550> like<00:02:30.240> ding<00:02:30.750> ding<00:02:31.050> ding<00:02:31.350> ding<00:02:31.650> inside

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160
