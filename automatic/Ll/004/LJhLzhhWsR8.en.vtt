heading<00:01:52.039> up<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.999> 41-megapixel<00:01:53.539> in<00:01:54.349> the<00:01:54.439> lumia

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
heading up the 41-megapixel in the lumia

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.800 
heading up the 41-megapixel in the lumia
1020<00:01:55.219> with<00:01:55.700> an<00:01:55.789> optical<00:01:55.939> image<00:01:56.419> stabilizer

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
1020 with an optical image stabilizer

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.169 
1020 with an optical image stabilizer
but<00:01:57.259> still<00:01:57.469> you<00:01:58.099> should<00:01:58.279> expect<00:01:58.609> some<00:01:58.700> really

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
but still you should expect some really

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.690 
but still you should expect some really
really<00:01:59.299> cool<00:01:59.539> pictures<00:02:00.020> with<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.829> device<00:02:01.159> let

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
really cool pictures with the device let

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.999 
really cool pictures with the device let
me<00:02:01.819> try<00:02:02.029> to<00:02:02.090> you<00:02:02.779> saw<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.229> and<00:02:03.409> just<00:02:03.649> doing<00:02:03.919> a

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
me try to you saw that and just doing a

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.830 
me try to you saw that and just doing a
double<00:02:04.310> tap<00:02:04.520> on<00:02:04.669> the<00:02:04.729> screen<00:02:04.969> its<00:02:05.419> immediate

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
double tap on the screen its immediate

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.389 
double tap on the screen its immediate
is<00:02:05.959> switching<00:02:06.349> on<00:02:06.499> so<00:02:06.919> it's<00:02:07.069> a<00:02:07.130> very<00:02:07.340> very

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
is switching on so it's a very very

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.309 
is switching on so it's a very very
unique<00:02:07.639> feature<00:02:08.060> but<00:02:08.720> it's<00:02:08.869> also<00:02:09.079> very

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
unique feature but it's also very

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.990 
unique feature but it's also very
interesting<00:02:10.009> is<00:02:10.129> let<00:02:10.280> me<00:02:10.369> just<00:02:10.549> switch<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:10.759> off

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
interesting is let me just switch it off

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.130 
interesting is let me just switch it off
again

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
again

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.110 
again
and<00:02:12.380> let's<00:02:12.740> switch<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:12.950> on<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:14.560> when<00:02:15.560> I'm<00:02:15.650> just

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
and let's switch it on and when I'm just

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.730 
and let's switch it on and when I'm just
drawing<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.510> G<00:02:17.870> in<00:02:18.730> here<00:02:19.730> oh<00:02:20.020> okay<00:02:21.020> it<00:02:21.319> seems

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
drawing a G in here oh okay it seems

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.010 
drawing a G in here oh okay it seems
like<00:02:22.010> I'm<00:02:22.160> not<00:02:22.310> really<00:02:22.550> getting<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:23.090> because

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
like I'm not really getting it because

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
like I'm not really getting it because
it<00:02:24.140> has<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.319> unique<00:02:25.310> guess<00:02:25.790> mode<00:02:26.180> that's

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
it has a unique guess mode that's

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.530 
it has a unique guess mode that's
unfortunately<00:02:28.040> not<00:02:28.640> really<00:02:29.000> working<00:02:29.240> right

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
unfortunately not really working right

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.660 
unfortunately not really working right
now<00:02:29.570> so<00:02:30.050> what's<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.350> gas<00:02:30.530> not<00:02:30.770> doing<00:02:31.130> its<00:02:31.490> kind

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
now so what's the gas not doing its kind

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.370 
now so what's the gas not doing its kind
of<00:02:31.760> protecting<00:02:32.180> your<00:02:32.300> privacy<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:33.110> people

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
guest mode but I think I have to train

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.680 
guest mode but I think I have to train
this<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:42.800> little<00:02:42.950> bit<00:02:43.190> what<00:02:44.120> else<00:02:44.300> is<00:02:44.450> here

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
this a little bit what else is here

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.820 
this a little bit what else is here
where<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.870> can<00:02:44.930> tell<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.350> about<00:02:45.500> its<00:02:45.680> eight

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
where I can tell you about its eight

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.640 
where I can tell you about its eight
point<00:02:46.100> nine<00:02:46.160> millimeters<00:02:46.790> thin<00:02:47.110> in<00:02:48.110> terms<00:02:48.500> of

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
point nine millimeters thin in terms of

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.820 
point nine millimeters thin in terms of
the<00:02:48.830> weight<00:02:49.040> i<00:02:49.430> would<00:02:49.940> guess<00:02:50.150> roughly<00:02:50.690> around

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
the weight i would guess roughly around

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.430 
the weight i would guess roughly around
140<00:02:51.830> grams<00:02:52.070> LG<00:02:52.760> wasn't<00:02:53.150> releasing<00:02:53.660> any<00:02:53.900> specs

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
140 grams LG wasn't releasing any specs

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.259 
140 grams LG wasn't releasing any specs
and<00:02:54.650> last<00:02:55.250> but<00:02:55.370> not<00:02:55.610> least<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:56.030> i<00:02:56.060> think

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
and last but not least and i think

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.850 
and last but not least and i think
that's<00:02:56.390> very<00:02:56.450> important<00:02:57.080> it<00:02:57.260> comes<00:02:57.650> with<00:02:57.739> the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
that's very important it comes with the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.180 
that's very important it comes with the
3000<00:02:58.580> milli<00:02:59.030> amp-ere<00:02:59.420> hour<00:02:59.660> battery<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:00.950> this

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
3000 milli amp-ere hour battery so this

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.130 
3000 milli amp-ere hour battery so this
definitely<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.970> combination<00:03:02.660> with<00:03:02.840> the

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
definitely in combination with the

definitely in combination with the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
day battery life at least well i would

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.670 
day battery life at least well i would
guess<00:03:08.300> it's<00:03:08.600> pretty<00:03:08.870> much<00:03:09.080> on<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.320> same<00:03:09.410> level

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
guess it's pretty much on the same level

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.820 
guess it's pretty much on the same level

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
back you can still see this very

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.350 
back you can still see this very
specific<00:03:18.049> pattern<00:03:18.829> here<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.400> that<00:03:19.880> LG<00:03:20.209> was

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
specific pattern here and that LG was

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.300 
specific pattern here and that LG was
already<00:03:20.690> using<00:03:21.019> on<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.260> optimus<00:03:21.620> g<00:03:21.799> pro<00:03:21.829> or

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
already using on the optimus g pro or

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.170 
already using on the optimus g pro or
for<00:03:22.790> example<00:03:23.150> on<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.420> nexus<00:03:23.870> 4<00:03:24.530> in<00:03:25.400> general<00:03:25.940> i

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
for example on the nexus 4 in general i

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.600 
for example on the nexus 4 in general i
think<00:03:26.780> it's<00:03:27.140> an<00:03:27.260> absolutely<00:03:27.799> gorgeous<00:03:28.070> foam

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
think it's an absolutely gorgeous foam

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.539 
think it's an absolutely gorgeous foam
and<00:03:28.910> let<00:03:29.690> me<00:03:29.810> just<00:03:29.840> give<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.860> one<00:03:30.890> last<00:03:31.220> idea

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
and let me just give you one last idea

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.240 
and let me just give you one last idea
if<00:03:32.120> you're<00:03:32.480> comparing<00:03:33.470> it<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.680> little<00:03:33.829> bit<00:03:34.100> to

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
if you're comparing it a little bit to

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.210 
if you're comparing it a little bit to
the<00:03:34.400> nexus<00:03:34.820> 4<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.750> see<00:03:36.110> they<00:03:36.739> are<00:03:36.769> very<00:03:37.040> very

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
the nexus 4 you see they are very very

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.120 
the nexus 4 you see they are very very
similar<00:03:37.519> in<00:03:37.940> terms<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.989> design<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:39.920> that's

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130
