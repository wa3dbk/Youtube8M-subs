00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
gloss for your money I like that it's a

gloss for your money I like that it's a
tacky<00:03:30.690> or<00:03:30.959> formulation<00:03:31.590> then<00:03:31.709> look<00:03:31.920> glass<00:03:32.609> so

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
tacky or formulation then look glass so

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.569 
tacky or formulation then look glass so
it<00:03:33.390> stays<00:03:33.720> on<00:03:33.870> your<00:03:33.930> lips<00:03:34.079> longer<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.340> will

it stays on your lips longer and it will

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.190 
it stays on your lips longer and it will
look<00:03:35.790> shiny<00:03:36.180> or<00:03:36.390> longer<00:03:36.720> because<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.079> the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
look shiny or longer because of the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.780 
look shiny or longer because of the
amount<00:03:37.350> of<00:03:37.500> glitter<00:03:37.709> so<00:03:38.310> it's<00:03:38.459> not<00:03:38.609> like<00:03:38.760> a

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
amount of glitter so it's not like a

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.099 
amount of glitter so it's not like a
normal<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:39.239> glass<00:03:39.480> where<00:03:39.720> you<00:03:39.780> put<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:39.959> on

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
normal that glass where you put it on

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.780 
normal that glass where you put it on
and<00:03:40.350> after<00:03:40.470> 45<00:03:41.010> minutes<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.310> have<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.519> reapply

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
and after 45 minutes you have to reapply

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.229 
and after 45 minutes you have to reapply
it<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:44.510> like<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:46.489> these<00:03:47.489> two<00:03:47.760> colors<00:03:47.970> in

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
it I like that these two colors in

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.680 
it I like that these two colors in
particular<00:03:48.480> are<00:03:48.840> pretty<00:03:49.109> unique<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:51.120> Mac<00:03:51.359> in

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
particular are pretty unique to Mac in

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.059 
particular are pretty unique to Mac in
that<00:03:51.900> they<00:03:52.019> don't<00:03:52.170> have<00:03:52.230> another<00:03:52.530> blue<00:03:52.799> gloss

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
that they don't have another blue gloss

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.180 
that they don't have another blue gloss
out<00:03:53.900> which<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.989> really<00:03:55.230> like<00:03:55.530> that's<00:03:55.950> just<00:03:56.100> why

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
out which I really like that's just why

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.940 
out which I really like that's just why
I<00:03:56.220> got<00:03:56.430> these<00:03:56.609> two<00:03:57.769> because<00:03:58.769> they're

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
I got these two because they're

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.319 
I got these two because they're
permanent<00:03:59.459> in<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.639> stores<00:03:59.850> I<00:03:59.940> didn't<00:04:00.209> feel

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
permanent in the stores I didn't feel

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.400 
permanent in the stores I didn't feel
the<00:04:00.420> need<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.630> go<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:00.810> buy<00:04:00.900> all<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.079> them<00:04:01.200> at

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
the need to go and buy all of them at

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.160 
the need to go and buy all of them at
once<00:04:01.440> I<00:04:01.650> think<00:04:01.799> there<00:04:01.920> are<00:04:02.010> 12<00:04:02.340> total<00:04:02.989> 12<00:04:03.989> and

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
once I think there are 12 total 12 and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.840 
once I think there are 12 total 12 and
15<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.530> want<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.739> save<00:04:04.859> it<00:04:04.950> call<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:08.069> applicator

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
15 I want to save it call the applicator

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:15.979 
15 I want to save it call the applicator
is<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:09.060> brush<00:04:12.350> not<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.380> sponge<00:04:14.359> and<00:04:15.359> I<00:04:15.660> think<00:04:15.870> they

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
is a brush not a sponge and I think they

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.569 
is a brush not a sponge and I think they
did<00:04:16.169> it<00:04:16.289> that<00:04:16.380> way<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:16.590> you'd<00:04:16.829> get<00:04:16.979> more<00:04:17.250> gloss

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
did it that way so you'd get more gloss

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
of them eventually I think it's a

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.899 
of them eventually I think it's a
fabulous<00:05:27.659> product<00:05:28.169> it's<00:05:28.499> something<00:05:28.919> that<00:05:29.189> Mac

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
fabulous product it's something that Mac

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.909 
fabulous product it's something that Mac
has<00:05:30.120> never<00:05:30.330> done<00:05:30.449> before<00:05:30.629> and<00:05:31.020> it's<00:05:31.710> something

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
has never done before and it's something

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.459 
has never done before and it's something
that<00:05:32.129> is<00:05:32.729> completely<00:05:33.419> new<00:05:33.930> to<00:05:34.080> their<00:05:34.199> gloss

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
that is completely new to their gloss

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:36.019 
that is completely new to their gloss
lineup<00:05:34.949> so<00:05:35.099> I<00:05:35.129> think<00:05:35.219> it's<00:05:35.460> really<00:05:35.729> going<00:05:35.969> to

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:36.029

lineup so I think it's really going to
do<00:05:36.870> good<00:05:36.990> things<00:05:37.050> for<00:05:37.289> rejuvenating<00:05:37.889> their

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
time because I tend to think that the

collections the temporary collections

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:52.159 
collections the temporary collections
are<00:05:50.250> kind<00:05:50.430> of<00:05:50.490> just<00:05:50.669> for<00:05:51.659> the<00:05:51.750> most<00:05:51.960> part

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
are kind of just for the most part

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.469 
are kind of just for the most part
rehashes<00:05:52.830> of<00:05:52.949> the<00:05:53.039> permanent<00:05:53.279> line<00:05:53.550> and<00:05:54.149> then

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
rehashes of the permanent line and then

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.579 
rehashes of the permanent line and then
in<00:05:54.599> part<00:05:54.810> it's<00:05:54.899> because<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:55.110> permanent<00:05:55.500> line

00:05:55.579 --> 00:05:55.589 
in part it's because the permanent line

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:58.610 
in part it's because the permanent line
is<00:05:55.710> so<00:05:55.830> big<00:05:56.629> but<00:05:57.629> this<00:05:57.779> is<00:05:57.899> really<00:05:58.110> new<00:05:58.379> and
