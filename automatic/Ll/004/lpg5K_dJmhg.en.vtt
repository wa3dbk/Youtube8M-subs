now I've been using a MacBook Pro for my
daily<00:00:30.900> driver<00:00:31.050> for<00:00:31.500> work<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.309> my<00:00:32.430> day<00:00:32.489> job<00:00:32.820> for

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
a couple of months now so I thought this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.400 
a couple of months now so I thought this
might<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.180> good<00:00:36.360> way<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.510> pair<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:36.989> with<00:00:37.140> that

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
might be a good way to pair up with that

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.590 
might be a good way to pair up with that
so<00:00:38.219> yeah<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.210> Bluetooth

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.090 
so yeah this is the the Bluetooth
keyboard<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.079> they<00:00:40.230> make<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.770> bluetooth

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.240 
takes a couple of triple A's and then
you<00:01:21.450> power<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.930> connect<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.830> it

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you power it on connect it with this it

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.679 
you power it on connect it with this it
definitely<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.759> nice<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.360> connect

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
definitely is nice to have that connect

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.320 
definitely is nice to have that connect
button<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.799> does<00:01:26.040> look<00:01:26.549> an<00:01:26.820> awful<00:01:27.030> lot

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
button but this does look an awful lot

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.450 
button but this does look an awful lot
like<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.990> Mac<00:01:28.290> keyboard<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.860> has<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.130> command

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
like a Mac keyboard it has the command

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.090 
like a Mac keyboard it has the command
key<00:01:29.670> right<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.600> buttons<00:01:31.079> are<00:01:31.290> they

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
key right here the buttons are they

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.260 
key right here the buttons are they
don't<00:01:32.220> have<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> whole<00:01:32.520> lot<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.729> travel<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.119> them

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
don't have a whole lot of travel to them

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.490 
don't have a whole lot of travel to them
because<00:01:33.509> they're<00:01:33.659> they're<00:01:33.960> supposed<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.409> be

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
because they're they're supposed to be

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.890 
because they're they're supposed to be
very<00:01:34.680> thin<00:01:34.950> very<00:01:35.130> light<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:36.090> at<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> very

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
very thin very light it at the very

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.499 
very thin very light it at the very
least<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.290> does<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.119> Apple<00:01:39.119> wireless

keyboard sort of look to it but yeah so
I'll<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:43.200> ahead<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.409> stick<00:01:43.560> some<00:01:43.590> batteries

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
I'll go ahead and stick some batteries

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.410 
I'll go ahead and stick some batteries
in<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.700> try<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.850> pair<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.060> up<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
in this and try to pair it up to a

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.760 
in this and try to pair it up to a
tablet<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:45.960> we'll<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.590> does

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
tablet and we'll just see what it does

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.560 
tablet and we'll just see what it does
and<00:01:47.100> actually<00:01:47.490> before<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.909> get<00:01:47.970> too<00:01:48.210> far<00:01:48.240> ahead

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and actually before I get too far ahead

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.480 
and actually before I get too far ahead
of<00:01:48.689> myself<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.590> I'll<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.130> go<00:01:50.280> ahead<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
of myself this I'll just go ahead and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.960 
of myself this I'll just go ahead and
open<00:01:50.670> up<00:01:50.759> right<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.780> PCI<00:01:52.530> Express<00:01:52.970> USB

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
open up right here is a PCI Express USB

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.480 
open up right here is a PCI Express USB
3<00:01:54.270> card<00:01:54.659> they<00:01:55.439> make<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> couple<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.130> models<00:01:56.369> of

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
3 card they make a couple of models of

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.850 
3 card they make a couple of models of
this<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.299> larger<00:01:58.200> version<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.560> actually

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
this one the larger version is actually

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.289 
this one the larger version is actually
something<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.219> was<00:01:59.340> kind<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.670> more<00:01:59.880> interested

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
something I was kind of more interested

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.630 
something I was kind of more interested
in<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.899> one<00:02:01.079> has<00:02:01.259> 4<00:02:01.469> ports<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.310> you

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
in this one has 4 ports on it and you

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.730 
in this one has 4 ports on it and you
just<00:02:02.670> plug<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.299> micro<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.899> PCI<00:02:04.439> Express

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
just plug it in micro in the PCI Express

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.910 
just plug it in micro in the PCI Express
slot<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.729> larger<00:02:06.149> one<00:02:06.329> had<00:02:06.659> 7<00:02:07.170> ports<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.890> it

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
slot the larger one had 7 ports on it

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.800 
slot the larger one had 7 ports on it
and<00:02:08.280> then<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.000> plug<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:09.720> to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
and then you plug it in you have to

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.210 
and then you plug it in you have to
actually<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.140> power<00:02:10.440> inside<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.039> your

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
actually have power inside of your

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.130 
actually have power inside of your
computer<00:02:11.400> for<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.030> as<00:02:12.180> well<00:02:12.420> as<00:02:12.569> using<00:02:12.750> PCI

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
computer for it as well as using PCI

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.589 
computer for it as well as using PCI
Express

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
Express

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.899 
Express
so<00:02:13.900> this<00:02:14.620> was<00:02:14.829> the<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.219> one<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.549> they<00:02:15.640> they

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
so this was the the one that they they

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.459 
so this was the the one that they they
opted<00:02:16.269> to<00:02:16.299> send<00:02:16.599> me<00:02:16.810> so<00:02:17.049> I'll<00:02:17.109> be<00:02:17.170> trying<00:02:17.349> that

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
opted to send me so I'll be trying that

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.589 
opted to send me so I'll be trying that
out<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:17.739> one<00:02:17.829> of<00:02:17.920> my<00:02:17.980> desktops<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.819> let<00:02:19.450> you

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
out in one of my desktops and let you

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.319 
out in one of my desktops and let you
guys<00:02:19.780> know<00:02:20.019> what<00:02:20.530> becomes<00:02:20.889> of<00:02:21.129> it<00:02:21.219> more<00:02:22.060> likely

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
guys know what becomes of it more likely

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:23.550 
guys know what becomes of it more likely
than<00:02:22.480> not<00:02:22.510> it'll<00:02:22.810> be<00:02:22.840> used<00:02:23.079> to<00:02:23.230> upgrade<00:02:23.530> a

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
than not it'll be used to upgrade a

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.259 
than not it'll be used to upgrade a
desktop<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.159> does<00:02:24.340> not<00:02:24.489> currently<00:02:24.730> support

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
desktop that does not currently support

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.209 
desktop that does not currently support
USB<00:02:25.480> 3<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.079> that'll<00:02:26.290> be<00:02:26.349> kind<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.590> nice<00:02:26.709> but<00:02:27.099> now

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
USB 3 so that'll be kind of nice but now

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.739 
USB 3 so that'll be kind of nice but now
on<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.430> pairing<00:02:27.819> this<00:02:27.909> up<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.180> tablet<00:02:28.540> and

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:28.749 
on to pairing this up to a tablet and

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:29.970 
on to pairing this up to a tablet and
the<00:02:28.989> more<00:02:29.139> I<00:02:29.170> thought<00:02:29.379> about<00:02:29.439> the<00:02:29.739> more<00:02:29.889> it

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
the more I thought about the more it

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.289 
the more I thought about the more it
actually<00:02:30.010> kind<00:02:30.519> of<00:02:30.609> makes<00:02:30.760> sense<00:02:30.939> to<00:02:31.180> go<00:02:31.269> ahead

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
actually kind of makes sense to go ahead

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.289 
actually kind of makes sense to go ahead
and<00:02:31.629> pair<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.109> up<00:02:32.170> with<00:02:32.349> a<00:02:32.950> Mac<00:02:33.189> so<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.700> thought

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
and pair this up with a Mac so I thought

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.640 
and pair this up with a Mac so I thought
I'd<00:02:34.389> go<00:02:34.480> ahead<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.689> break<00:02:34.810> out<00:02:34.959> just<00:02:35.170> my<00:02:35.290> my

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
I'd go ahead and break out just my my

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.979 
I'd go ahead and break out just my my
work<00:02:35.920> laptop<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.730> we'll<00:02:37.359> see<00:02:37.540> how<00:02:37.689> it<00:02:37.840> does

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
work laptop and we'll see how it does

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.899 
work laptop and we'll see how it does
when<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.319> actually<00:02:38.709> pair<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.040> up<00:02:39.129> to<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.489> well

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
when I actually pair it up to it well

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.940 
when I actually pair it up to it well
couldn't<00:02:40.120> power<00:02:40.299> this<00:02:40.599> thing<00:02:40.840> on<00:02:41.079> I've<00:02:41.739> gone

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
couldn't power this thing on I've gone

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.140 
couldn't power this thing on I've gone
ahead<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:42.159> put<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.340> couple<00:02:42.489> of<00:02:42.639> batteries<00:02:42.909> in

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
ahead and put a couple of batteries in
