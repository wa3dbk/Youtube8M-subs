 Termeer is fine now Juncker 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.769
 as a second round it is actually not that fast though 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.969
 Guest is Dr 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.969
 and even if we came up with the idea 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:18.929
 due to its quick gate to judgment on b it is which among other ways in 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.050
 they will allow this year 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.470
 Munich 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.599
 were beating once again 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.450
 the only way to move outside are sewers 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.270
 María more 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.500
 Jürgen Dormann really a right 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.460
 Yanar continues to us these channels we will then they will become 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.039
 next year 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.039
 but also WM 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.060
 Dr 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.780
 to call my life 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.030
 yes yes, I was just as bad at school back then 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.400
 Seeing that everything is going according to plan 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.050
 I never have a bad conscience because they tour the big time 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.050
 screwed up dawn 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.260
 but do not forget junior 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.540
 so Walz Metal Gear that lured everyone into the trap 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.270
 we close the gate 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.280
 like the answer 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.280
 but in the Bochum 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.200
 We do not want to be trapped 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200
 I am somehow disappointing 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.780
 World likes to believe 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.780

 Rosendahl 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.409
 By more unfortunately, that was apparently the price I already had 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.409
 strange if it has to be 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.019

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:31.769
 I still have a little extras to do sooner 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.769

 this is not too short 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:13.470
 that would not be a mistake 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.940
 I'll let you mine mine if I'm not so happy but me 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.420
