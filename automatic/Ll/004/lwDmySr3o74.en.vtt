00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.439 
let me click it there we go and yeah it
was<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.840> 84<00:03:21.319> overall<00:03:21.560> version<00:03:22.299> so<00:03:23.299> let's

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
was the 84 overall version so let's

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:28.180 
was the 84 overall version so let's
check<00:03:23.659> out<00:03:23.780> what<00:03:23.870> she's<00:03:24.019> going<00:03:24.169> for<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:27.190> its

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
check out what she's going for and its

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:36.969 
check out what she's going for and its
type<00:03:28.370> in<00:03:28.519> vic<00:03:30.669> okay<00:03:33.370> 84<00:03:35.229> okay<00:03:36.229> that<00:03:36.379> was<00:03:36.500> not<00:03:36.680> 84

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:36.979 
type in vic okay 84 okay that was not 84

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:41.649 
type in vic okay 84 okay that was not 84
I<00:03:37.129> guess<00:03:38.049> 284<00:03:39.819> and<00:03:40.819> let's<00:03:41.209> search<00:03:41.389> how<00:03:41.510> much

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
I guess 284 and let's search how much

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:49.629 
I guess 284 and let's search how much
he's<00:03:41.780> going<00:03:42.019> for<00:03:42.169> um<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.970> 40<00:03:44.419> million<00:03:47.199> 3735<00:03:48.639> 30

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
he's going for um so 40 million 3735 30
