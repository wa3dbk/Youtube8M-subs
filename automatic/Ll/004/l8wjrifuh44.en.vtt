all right let's take a look at the

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.380 
all right let's take a look at the
precise<00:00:04.230> failure<00:00:04.830> here<00:00:05.190> with<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.700> second

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
call the number of things we can see

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.920 
call the number of things we can see
that<00:00:21.150> there's<00:00:21.330> no<00:00:21.510> gap<00:00:21.779> here<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:24.689> job

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
that there's no gap here the the job

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.750 
that there's no gap here the the job
this<00:00:25.199> thing<00:00:25.439> does<00:00:25.650> when<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.099> when<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.490> gear

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
this thing does when this when this gear

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.320 
this thing does when this when this gear
goes<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.180> shift<00:00:27.420> forward<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.349> engages<00:00:29.330> this

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
goes to shift forward it engages this

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.510 
goes to shift forward it engages this
synchro<00:00:30.840> ring<00:00:31.080> onto<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.619> cone<00:00:31.980> onto<00:00:32.219> this

gap there so that as you start to shift
this<00:00:37.980> ring<00:00:38.460> does<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.030> job<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.480> synchronizing

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
this ring does the job of synchronizing

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.680 
this ring does the job of synchronizing
the<00:00:40.590> speed<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.100> these<00:00:41.309> two<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.450> that

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the speed of these two so that that

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.420 
the speed of these two so that that
collar<00:00:42.960> slides<00:00:43.440> right<00:00:43.649> over<00:00:43.710> these<00:00:44.129> little

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
collar slides right over these little

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.020 
collar slides right over these little
teeth<00:00:44.899> over<00:00:45.899> here<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.579> this<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.760> also

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
teeth over here we can see this is also

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.369 
teeth over here we can see this is also
in<00:00:48.149> fourth<00:00:48.450> gear<00:00:48.660> I've<00:00:48.840> actually<00:00:49.020> got<00:00:49.260> this

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
in fourth gear I've actually got this

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.380 
in fourth gear I've actually got this
gear<00:00:49.620> box<00:00:49.770> loft<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.430> two<00:00:50.579> gears<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
gear box loft in two gears for the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.330 
gear box loft in two gears for the
purposes<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.930> undoing<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.710> big<00:00:52.860> nut<00:00:53.070> here

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
purposes of undoing the big nut here

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.959 
purposes of undoing the big nut here
which<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.850> did<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:55.050> our<00:00:55.610> extension<00:00:56.610> jig

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
which we just did with our extension jig

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.540 
which we just did with our extension jig
or<00:00:57.149> metal<00:00:57.809> bar<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.350> then<00:00:59.250> we're<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.460> to

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
or metal bar and then we're going to

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.110 
or metal bar and then we're going to
take<00:00:59.730> off<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.329> front<00:01:01.039> nut<00:01:02.039> also<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.789> on

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
take off the front nut also on the on

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.910 
take off the front nut also on the on
the<00:01:03.210> input<00:01:03.449> gear<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.650> see<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the input gear but you can see the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.980 
the input gear but you can see the
difference<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.820> synchro<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.720> ring

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
difference here this synchro this ring

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.770 
difference here this synchro this ring
is<00:01:07.200> obviously<00:01:07.650> all<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.670> way<00:01:08.790> flat<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.630> this

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
is obviously all the way flat to this

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.260 
is obviously all the way flat to this
front<00:01:10.080> surface<00:01:10.700> whereas<00:01:11.700> there<00:01:11.909> supposed<00:01:12.180> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
front surface whereas there supposed to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.630 
front surface whereas there supposed to
be<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.600> gap<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.710> push<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.070> one<00:01:14.250> forward

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
be a gap here you push this one forward

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.969 
be a gap here you push this one forward
you<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.909> see<00:01:15.049> there's<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.140> small<00:01:16.409> gap<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
you can see there's a small gap here and

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.550 
you can see there's a small gap here and
a<00:01:17.280> spring<00:01:17.640> until<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.259> sitting<00:01:19.500> on

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
a spring until now it's just sitting on

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.990 
a spring until now it's just sitting on
a<00:01:19.619> cone<00:01:19.860> there's<00:01:20.250> no<00:01:20.369> spring<00:01:20.610> or<00:01:20.820> anything

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
a cone there's no spring or anything

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.090 
a cone there's no spring or anything
that<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.020> engaged<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.860> shaft

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
that this just is engaged on the shaft

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.280 
that this just is engaged on the shaft
here<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.729> always<00:01:23.880> turning<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:25.110> when<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
here so it's always turning and when you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.120 
here so it's always turning and when you
put<00:01:25.439> pressure<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.799> it

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
put pressure on it

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.850 
put pressure on it
it<00:01:26.280> puts<00:01:26.820> load<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.509> gear<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.710> bring

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
it puts load on the gear here to bring

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.499 
it puts load on the gear here to bring
the<00:01:29.070> two<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> same<00:01:29.970> speed<00:01:30.360> it

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
the two in to the same speed it

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.780 
the two in to the same speed it
synchronizes<00:01:31.049> their<00:01:31.470> speed<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.189> this

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
synchronizes their speed so that this

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.850 
synchronizes their speed so that this
collar<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.450> slide<00:01:33.720> right<00:01:34.079> over<00:01:34.409> these<00:01:34.530> little

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
collar can slide right over these little

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.960 
collar can slide right over these little
teeth<00:01:35.689> and<00:01:36.689> when<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.020> flat<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.970> I'm

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
teeth and when it's flat like this I'm

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.190 
teeth and when it's flat like this I'm
going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.299> show<00:01:39.390> what<00:01:39.659> happens<00:01:39.689> I've<00:01:40.170> got

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
going to show what happens I've got

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.230 
going to show what happens I've got
another<00:01:40.500> set<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.890> gears<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.340> will<00:01:42.030> show<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
another set of gears here will show a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.330 
another set of gears here will show a
sampler<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:42.899> I'm<00:01:43.020> going<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.229> turn<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.009> camera

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
sampler but I'm going to turn the camera

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.039 
sampler but I'm going to turn the camera
over<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:46.399> they<00:01:47.399> will<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.700> both<00:01:47.970> hands<00:01:48.240> over

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
over and they will be both hands over

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.940 
over and they will be both hands over
here

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.860 

all<00:01:55.950> right<00:01:56.190> so<00:01:56.910> we've<00:01:57.030> got<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.660> is<00:01:57.720> a

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
all right so we've got here this is a

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.770 
all right so we've got here this is a
first<00:01:58.170> gear<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:59.430> we<00:01:59.550> can<00:01:59.700> see<00:01:59.850> here's<00:02:00.060> how<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
first gear and we can see here's how the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.140 
first gear and we can see here's how the
syncro<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.350> supposed<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.670> comes<00:02:02.940> up

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
syncro is supposed to be it comes up

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.850 
syncro is supposed to be it comes up
you've<00:02:03.780> got<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> gap<00:02:04.320> here<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:04.800> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
you've got a gap here and the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.470 
you've got a gap here and the
specification<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.730> somewhere<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.390> know

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
specification is somewhere but you know

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.950 
specification is somewhere but you know
ten<00:02:06.930> twenty<00:02:07.440> thousand<00:02:07.980> something<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.400> that

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
ten twenty thousand something like that

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.270 
ten twenty thousand something like that
30<00:02:09.960> thousandths<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.560> about<00:02:10.770> where<00:02:10.920> they<00:02:11.010> start

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
30 thousandths is about where they start

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.110 
30 thousandths is about where they start
out<00:02:11.460> new<00:02:12.620> most<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.800> these<00:02:13.920> but<00:02:14.520> when<00:02:14.670> it's<00:02:14.820> when

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
out new most of these but when it's when

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.640 
out new most of these but when it's when
there's<00:02:15.330> room<00:02:15.960> here

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
there's room here

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.800 
there's room here
then<00:02:17.070> when<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.460> fold<00:02:17.760> goes<00:02:17.940> forward<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.660> can

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
then when this fold goes forward you can

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.200 
then when this fold goes forward you can
see<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.080> rides<00:02:19.350> up<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:19.920> cone<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.550> it

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
see it rides up on this cone and it

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.120 
see it rides up on this cone and it
brings<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.750> gear<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.470> speed<00:02:22.770> really

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
brings this gear in to speed really

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.280 
brings this gear in to speed really
quickly<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.390> these<00:02:24.780> teeth<00:02:27.290> squeeze

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
quickly so that these teeth squeeze

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.350 
quickly so that these teeth squeeze
positions<00:02:28.710> where<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:28.980> goes<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.910> these<00:02:30.120> teeth

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
positions where it goes that these teeth

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.110 
positions where it goes that these teeth
when<00:02:30.600> they're<00:02:30.720> going<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.020> same<00:02:31.200> speed<00:02:32.120> slide

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
when they're going the same speed slide

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.980 
when they're going the same speed slide
in<00:02:33.360> real<00:02:33.720> nice<00:02:33.990> that's<00:02:34.710> a<00:02:34.830> nice<00:02:34.980> quiet<00:02:35.310> shift

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
in real nice that's a nice quiet shift

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.450 
in real nice that's a nice quiet shift
now<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.320> worn<00:02:37.680> out<00:02:37.800> synchro<00:02:39.410> no<00:02:40.410> gap<00:02:40.620> no<00:02:41.100> gap<00:02:41.310> at

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
now a worn out synchro no gap no gap at

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.940 
now a worn out synchro no gap no gap at
all<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:41.880> thing<00:02:42.120> just<00:02:43.080> basically<00:02:43.620> free

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
all so this thing just basically free

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.310 
all so this thing just basically free
wheels<00:02:44.190> on<00:02:44.400> here<00:02:44.580> there<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.850> no<00:02:45.150> contact<00:02:45.690> along

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
wheels on here there is no contact along

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.440 
wheels on here there is no contact along
this<00:02:46.590> cone<00:02:46.890> or<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.490> inside<00:02:47.940> edge<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.360> can

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
this cone or this inside edge you can

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.820 
this cone or this inside edge you can
see<00:02:48.510> how<00:02:48.780> these<00:02:48.930> are<00:02:48.990> really<00:02:49.380> kind<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.620> one

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
see how these are really kind of one

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.080 
see how these are really kind of one
flat<00:02:50.870> but<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:51.900> causes<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.860> not<00:02:53.820> have

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
flat but that causes it to not have

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.090 
flat but that causes it to not have
enough<00:02:54.360> load<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:55.140> bring<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.500> gear<00:02:55.710> up<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.010> the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
enough load to bring the gear up to the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.490 
enough load to bring the gear up to the
right<00:02:56.250> speed<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:56.790> what<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.750> have<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.170> shift

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
right speed so what you have is a shift

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.900 
right speed so what you have is a shift
and<00:02:58.650> we'll<00:02:58.740> exaggerate<00:02:59.310> here<00:02:59.490> we<00:02:59.640> won't<00:02:59.760> be

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
and we'll exaggerate here we won't be

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.310 
and we'll exaggerate here we won't be
able<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.120> duplicate<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.720> course<00:03:00.870> because

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
able to duplicate it of course because

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.430 
able to duplicate it of course because
we're<00:03:01.830> not<00:03:01.890> spinning<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.490> with<00:03:03.360> an<00:03:03.480> engine<00:03:03.660> but

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
we're not spinning it with an engine but

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.820 
we're not spinning it with an engine but
you<00:03:04.560> get<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.830> kind<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.190> shift<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.490> does<00:03:05.790> a

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
you get to kind of a shift that does a

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.470 
you get to kind of a shift that does a
hard<00:03:07.830> sort<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.310> grind<00:03:08.610> because<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.270> gears

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
hard sort of a grind because the gears

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.180 
hard sort of a grind because the gears
are<00:03:09.630> not<00:03:09.780> going<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.170> same<00:03:10.380> speed<00:03:10.410> now<00:03:10.950> this

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
are not going the same speed now this

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.520 
are not going the same speed now this
gear<00:03:11.430> physically<00:03:11.970> has<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.300> grab<00:03:12.930> these<00:03:13.170> teeth

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
gear physically has to grab these teeth

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.760 
gear physically has to grab these teeth
as<00:03:13.709> they're<00:03:14.580> spinning<00:03:14.850> different<00:03:15.300> speeds<00:03:15.770> so

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
as they're spinning different speeds so

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.699 
as they're spinning different speeds so
if<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.010> can<00:03:17.160> duplicate<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:18.120> have<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.360> hard

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.979 

that's<00:03:22.709> what<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.010> get<00:03:23.160> when<00:03:23.310> it's<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.550> crunch

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
that's what you get when it's a crunch

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.840 
that's what you get when it's a crunch
crunch<00:03:24.989> shift<00:03:25.350> because<00:03:26.190> these<00:03:26.370> teeth<00:03:26.670> are

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
crunch shift because these teeth are

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.300 
crunch shift because these teeth are
just<00:03:27.030> having<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.450> physically<00:03:27.860> crash<00:03:28.860> together

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
just having to physically crash together

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.180 
just having to physically crash together
rather<00:03:30.120> than<00:03:30.330> this<00:03:31.020> guy<00:03:31.380> doing<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:31.920> job<00:03:32.160> of

rather than this guy doing the job of

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.300 
rather than this guy doing the job of
making<00:03:32.580> these<00:03:32.910> go<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.360> same<00:03:33.570> speed<00:03:34.310> before

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
making these go the same speed before

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.190 
making these go the same speed before
they<00:03:35.430> engage<00:03:35.610> if<00:03:36.510> they're<00:03:36.690> going<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.020> same

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
they engage if they're going the same

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.930 
they engage if they're going the same
speed<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.530> can<00:03:37.920> see<00:03:38.070> it's<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.280> very<00:03:38.610> nice

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
speed you can see it's a very nice

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.150 
speed you can see it's a very nice
smooth<00:03:39.390> click<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:41.310> if<00:03:41.489> they're<00:03:41.670> not<00:03:42.950> that's<00:03:43.950> a

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
smooth click and if they're not that's a

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.040 
smooth click and if they're not that's a
hard<00:03:44.370> crunch<00:03:44.700> into<00:03:45.000> gear<00:03:45.239> because<00:03:45.570> now<00:03:45.870> it's

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
hard crunch into gear because now it's

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.650 
hard crunch into gear because now it's
got<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.230> physically<00:03:46.739> skinny<00:03:47.480> we're<00:03:48.480> going<00:03:48.600> to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
got a physically skinny we're going to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.180 
got a physically skinny we're going to
make<00:03:48.780> this<00:03:48.900> work<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.260> right<00:03:49.410> way<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:49.800> that<00:03:50.100> it

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
make this work the right way so that it

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.520 
make this work the right way so that it
ships<00:03:50.400> nice<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:50.790> quiet<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.239> yet<00:03:52.110> with<00:03:52.500> our

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
ships nice and quiet and yet with our

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.710 
ships nice and quiet and yet with our
powerful<00:03:52.950> engine<00:03:53.400> we<00:03:53.550> can<00:03:53.700> still<00:03:53.970> kind<00:03:54.660> of

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
powerful engine we can still kind of

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.040 
powerful engine we can still kind of
bang<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.080> gears<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:56.420> do<00:03:57.420> what<00:03:57.540> we<00:03:57.660> like<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.840> do

and<00:03:58.200> we<00:03:58.260> have<00:03:58.350> a<00:03:58.380> powerful<00:03:58.650> car<00:03:59.510> so<00:04:00.510> we'll<00:04:00.930> make

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
and we have a powerful car so we'll make

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.590 
and we have a powerful car so we'll make
it<00:04:01.080> work<00:04:01.290> better<00:04:01.440> that's<00:04:02.130> our<00:04:02.250> plan

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600
