00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.600
 Vettel is the incident seeks you as comprehensive a look at the 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.150
 However, the mass of games to offer is so great that we are 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.390
 just do not come after that so we limit ourselves to the most important ones 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.439
 with Seppelt the Theos Game Developer DICE and Publisher Electronic Arts one 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.440
 Unusual way for Battlefield Heroes will be completely free 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.689
 Players only have to pay for beautifying their character 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.279
 and for XP Buster 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.560
 with which to collect especially impatient faster experience points and 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.770
 thus ascend for the changed 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.609
 In addition, the whole is still financed by advertising on the home page 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:45.219
 and otherwise Battlefield Heroes is different though the scenario is again 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.719
 to settle in the second world war but there is completely of the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.729
 Realistic graphic adopted and sends us just about supported 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:53.410
 comic look 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.489
 on the critical colorful battlefields 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:56.449
 also on foot 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:57.220
 pushes 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.010
 or in the tank or even in the air 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.470
 who the Team Fortress 2 quite well-known graphics in the market 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.460
 it will be here too 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.360
 his bright 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.610
 Have fun and that 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.280
 free 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.460
 At the beginning we have to go a little unusual way instead 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.070
 The game can be conveniently opened from the desktop states we first with 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.270
 our browser on the Battlefield Heroes website 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.740
 Here we create our first hero instead of class and faction 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.510
 as usual from previous parts 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.080
 only when entering a server select freely 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.860
 we have to set our vocation from the beginning 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.030
 Here, a decision for our desired page is due first 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.990
 For election, the EU wants l'armÃ©e of design and observation similar to the 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.200
 Allied and Dean the cord army 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.830
 comparable to the German troops 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.590
 after that we have to choose one of three classes yes 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.600
 heard correctly 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.799
 unlike Battlefield 2 is at her must 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.299
 both the paramedic 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.370
 As the head of the technicians fell victim to the scissors 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.370
 The only thing left to do is to supply and command 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.280
 while the soldier as a general purpose weapon standard with submachine gun and 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.600
 Straw surface at the front on the plaster skin 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.400
 The Korando steals internally Modos with the sniper rifle in the 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.040
 attack 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.700
 in a favorable position and takes the opponents 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.749
 from a safe distance on the grain 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.170
 who prefers battles with rocket launchers and machine gun battles 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:27.469
 crashed as we now but rather decide for the provider now 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.730
 we can still influence our looks and this is about the 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:34.840
 Basis for who later a few euros in Berthold dance the Battlefield own 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:37.340
 Currency can invest its creativity 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.740
 with case rich what is wars and equipment 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.979
 let free rein 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:45.709
 but this will not have much impact on the game mechanics 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.489
 but now finally into the fray and here reveals another 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.269
 New because we are looking for a classic server browser in vain 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.630
 the developers have joined Battlefield Heroes 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.310
 opted for a so-called matchmaking principle that means that 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.480
 Game is looking for us a server on the way against about equally strong 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.000
 This is made possible by a role play known to counterparty 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.159
 Laval concept 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.059
 So we start with our hero at the bottom and fight each other step by step 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.719
 Step by stepping up from experience points 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:22.019
 In this way, we switch orders and skills with each level 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.389
 Data free 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.879
 The tutorial makes it easier for us to get started by using the standard weapon 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.730
 just get to know and select our select class and vehicles 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:32.199
 firmly 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.639
 In addition to graphics, driving physics is anything but realistic 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.280
 However, this is absolutely no disadvantage because even newcomers can quickly 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.389
 deal with the big money 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.709
 This is used on so far three different maps 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.800
 Actors have to conquer flags and as many parts of the map as possible 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.420
 take and keep that one of the parties no priests and the kids 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.099
 has more 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.779
 Geneva the startup contract a short time immediately back to the battlefield so Wolf 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:01.299
 however, we can not get the entry point from others 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.439
 Battlefield Share Set bid free 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.930
 after only a short time we received the first complaints and the 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.439
 Advantages of a tank against met in Pont Ried units 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.069
 so we get to some points quickly and rise quickly 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.920
 get through each level the so-called euro-bonds 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.060
 Many also invest in the very first to set up skills each class has 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.810
 different Liche for the respective use 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.450
 For example, special forces of command can use his four o'clock bonds 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.130
 the skills buy a shot with more powerful punch as an option 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.099
 to have 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.590
 In addition, our warrior receives voters points after every use 

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:41.309
 which we either look at our weapons equipment or other 

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.940
 equipment 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.240
 can dedicate the bandages or similar 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.300
 the special thing about these items is the deck on some time only 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.340
 limited access allows 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.530
 For this sniper rifle we can either go for seven days 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.480
 or for a month to buy the rights of use are up to the beginning 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.490
 mentioned XP Buster affect all game and equipment for 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.909
 anyone without vettel fans available 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:09.429
 only for a large range of clothes and accessories you have to barer before 

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:12.159
 Exchange the coin in the game currency 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.759
 We can earn additional voter points by completing orders 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.669
 You first have to seize these before entering a spell in the menu 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:20.659
 activate 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.939
 Gradually, more and more possible orders are released 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:28.770
 Overall, the colorful multi-player is already chopped up 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.249
 a lot of fun in the beta phase because of the many different ones 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:35.960
 Combinations of class and the respective addition grab 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.610
 There will be plenty of room for experimentation as well 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.169
 most different types of players addressed if now more insidious 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.879
 Sniper or wall Breaking tank driver 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.470
 Thanks to the unlockable repair ability 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.550
 every other popular in rubble Wallat for everyone so it is 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.790
 Something about it also the critical colorful coated Gehrke textile stands out 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.660
 his way you just have to get involved in rock of photorealistic 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.910
 Textures and effects Alack white do not get their money's worth here 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.419
 These were a few highlights that we need to have tested
