00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.340
 let's consider the rules of discrepancy 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.510
 200 mechanical engines 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.750
 strictly speaking there are three situations 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.000
 which we should know to know 1 situation 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.000
 This is when two ships converge one but myself 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:50.160
 these two ships must each turn 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:54.930
 right and go 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.059
 left sides sometimes called by 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.120
 English happy with lip of red 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.690
 lights and these two ships are not allowed 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.949
 turn left or continue 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.949
 move in my direction 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.869
 the second rule is when two ships 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:19.670
 converges on intersecting courses in 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.020
 if two ships with mechanical 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.039
 movers intersect here in such 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.750
 combination when they intersect 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:31.159
 courses they enter rule number two well 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.490
 let's write out the roles 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:39.530
 it will be a ship and or in the air force 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.539
 getting a road or ship to or standin 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.989
 weights i.e. priority vessel 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:47.179
 the road a third of the way let's get to st 1 

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:50.390
 see what shall be done and the ship 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:57.500
 she gave should not pass just by 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:59.780
 The bow of the vessel that has the right to do 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.979
 ship and in order to miss the ship 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.880
 b it should change course or speed 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.950
 but you can do both if you change the course 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.959
 speed needs to be changed as much as possible 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.530
 noticeable to ship to video with test 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.780
 that the ship is changing course speed and so 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.120
 she has the right to slow down 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.450
 full stop and just skip 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.810
 court in front of you is a good option 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.139
 second option 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:32.709
 ship a or money u and weighed is entitled 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:32.709
 go to the right to save while the army ship 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.470
 ship b or dsl stand has the right and 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.260
 required to keep their course speed 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.650
 unchanged until complete passage of this 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:53.060
 situations that is not turning not 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.109
 changes the speed that has the right 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.549
 make ship b 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.980
 if she sees that there is a threat 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.620
 directly ship collision and not 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.130
 gives way to any reason in 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.880
 In such a case, the ship otrrh avoidance 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.500
 directly threatened by the steps here 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.549
 right here and right now has the right 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.549
 turn right 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.450
 the vessel has no right under any circumstances. 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:22.950
 conditions not in which case to turn 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:25.800
 left well and let me give a couple 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.770
 comments about this rule but 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.240
 first comment why ship b or 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.430
 stand he has no right to turn 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.170
 left 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.970
 if we look closely at the situation with 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.450
 other side then let's take you for example 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.610
 moved on ship b and see that ship 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.170
 and not giving way to one case 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.090
 ship captain b makes a decision 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:50.600
 return to the left and at this point in time 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.670
 for days is somewhere here here 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.620
 the ship's skipper and pays attention that he 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.239
 we have a bonus on the nose is another ship 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.890
 rule number 1 we diverge left 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:07.380
 the sides mean he will take a maneuver 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.570
 care right and you moved this 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.410
 the direction of the court we get here 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.940
 here in this place strike collision 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.650
 responsibly busy collision will 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.100
 wholly and fully squeeze ours now and 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.100
 ship b 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.470
 what the ship has the right to do 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.600
 if she can't turn right 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.490
 she can slow down to 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.380
 stops have the right to turn right 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.530
 but can not like here with us 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.840
 some kind of obstacle to potassium cause she 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.000
 ca n't turn go away like that 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.440
 the case of a ship and 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.360
 has the right to turn left and exit at 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.360
 parallel course with vessel b 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:05:01.220
 the third rule is the rules of overtaking with us 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:04.950
 there is a ship and which has 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:09.630
 running lights let's remember about them 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:15.630
 red green and stern white be 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:19.350
 it works in this sector i'm drawing 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:27.290
 sector and visibility of stern fire if 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:30.780
 remember then this is a sector of 135 degrees if 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.880
 the ship begins to catch up with him 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.890
 verge some other vessel vessel b and 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.100
 it appears inside this sector 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.580
 whom visibility of bloody fire for example 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.580
 here here 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.470
 conscious 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.190
 then here is the ship if it catches 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.110
 the ship has a higher speed than the ship 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.780
 Ships will be called b overtake conductive 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:06:00.590
 days this ship will be called 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:02.800
 overtaking if the ship is suitable let's 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:07.910
 let's call in b-bar 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.880
 from the sector when it is already visible 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:14.320
 the fire then this vessel will be counted on 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.669
 collision course they overtake present 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.260
 it is very important to understand where it comes from 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.750
 ship in which sector 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:26.090
 appears means literally sees him 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:28.430
 or sees it as running lights so if 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.740
 vessel b comes from the sector of visibility 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.600
 the bloody fire vessel and the trial for b will be 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.169
 be considered driving away these two ships 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:40.639
 will be in the overtaking zone as lead 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:42.889
 yourself court by the rules of overtaking but the first 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.780
 what has the right not to do they have 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:48.020
 right to move on in your 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.419
 direction keeping speed or changing 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:54.289
 the speed is not fundamentally right 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:56.000
 move in that direction and has 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.099
 the right to turn away from each other that is 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.740
 the vessel and in this case has the right 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:05.419
 turn left the ship in in this case 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.889
 have gone right they don't have 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:09.200
 rights that have done are not entitled 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:11.770
 shorten the distance between themselves here in 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.419
 this direction horizontally 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:17.510
 therefore the ship would not have the right 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:20.000
 turn left and the vessel and in this 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:23.720
 case has the right couples to the right to 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.680
 don't shorten this distance between 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.680
 ships horizontally 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:34.220
 it is important to note once again that the ship 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.610
 b if it comes from the thunderous sector 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.080
 of fire 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:41.690
 she will be considered driving away up to 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:44.930
 the moment will sure like it 

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:49.900
 until she is half asleep 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.900
 and the ship they will not hide from the sight of karma
