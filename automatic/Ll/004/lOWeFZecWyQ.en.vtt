seriously<00:04:58.640> I<00:04:58.669> made<00:04:59.150> a<00:04:59.180> thread<00:04:59.419> crashing<00:04:59.840> and

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
seriously I made a thread crashing and

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.110 
seriously I made a thread crashing and
down<00:05:00.350> that's<00:05:00.710> probably<00:05:02.890> probably<00:05:03.910> sound<00:05:04.910> like

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
down that's probably probably sound like

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.740
