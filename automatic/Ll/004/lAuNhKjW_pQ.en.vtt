00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.850
 hello for so it happened here I'm with 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.790
 a little tutorial on how to upload 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.830
 alchemy quickly in skyrim and how 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.349
 form the ingredients more or more 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.150
 less enjoyable so that it is not so 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.129
 boring because a lot of people are 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.760
 boring less to me that I am the only 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.350
 way of the mushrooms in short 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.840
 alchemy in case you do not know in skyrim it 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.930
 base 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.390
 create performances and the more expensive it is 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.860
 in these positions more we will raise the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.420
 skill so of course 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.420
 we will try to find those recipes 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.340
 that are resulting in positions what 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.410
 as clear as possible there are many recipes 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.230
 many recipes and that you have to see 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.850
 you how much effort it requires 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.400
 get the ingredients cost or 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.720
 the cost-benefit ratio go how much 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.250
 you are going to take time to get the 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.129
 ingredients and how much are you going to go up with 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.840
 they the one that I'm going to use today 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.989
 based on climbing root along with wheat 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.230
 together with giant finger and thanks to the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:05.050
 d lc the heart fire 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.310
 is formed a lot faster and by itself 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:12.310
 I'm doing this tutorial things that 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.000
 we are going to need the right of heart 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.880
 fire of course with 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.250
 the greenhouse and the garden constituted 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.600
 so that they have it in English in 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.600
 greenhouses the winehouse 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:35.420
 if you have level 70 alchemy it is possible 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:40.350
 that you may have bags in the tree 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.840
 skills the advantage of a horticulturist 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.409
 And if not, well, when you arrive in 70 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.780
 of sancti degrees to activate it because 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.330
 because not only would we already be a world to 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.740
 bonus that gives you the lcd catch more 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.869
 ingredients of your chosen garden 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.509
 greenhouse but we will be catching 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.729
 two more I think it was one more the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.670
 horticulturist allows to take two samples 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.130
 instead of a decade 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.509
 decade 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:12.170
 ingredients plus extra equipment stuff 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.170
 what 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.580
 that we have delighted for alchemy 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.099
 gauntlets rings necklaces Aros 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.659
 Falmer helmet helmets form farmers 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.319
 that the memory that they were blocked and 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:32.250
 allows you to put helmet and hoop on 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:35.340
 then then you will have more more bonuses 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.310
 and then set aside the thief's stone 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.000
 activated why because alchemy 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.180
 belongs to the possibilities of thief and 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.940
 the thief's stone allows you to climb these 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.260
 skills 20% faster so 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.390
 Well you are going to then if you remember us 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.920
 stones are here 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.240
 all three keep us in sobriety 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.420
 guardian are the first ones that we 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:06.610
 we find in the game with moscoso faith 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:10.600
 the children of spoken disgust and of active and 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.130
 and that's it, so we need the 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.230
 ingredients all the things that are 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.740
 they just mentioned and right now I'm going to 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.910
 to replant all my greenhouse that I 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.550
 It's a little bit of an issue because it has a 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:28.250
 bunch of plants by climbing roots 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.860
 outside in the garden we planted wheat 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.420
 from the giants I'm afraid there's 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.430
 kill them one by one so good 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.730
 inside that fit two of three is not so 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.680
 wrong 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.980
 now I show you where to get the water 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.750
 of extremadura and we start with the lyon 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.160
 see you later 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.640
 well here we are already found 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.860
 climbing network we are right in front of 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.900
 Ventania on the road I was wearing 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.900
 mentalities and trips to the stables 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.510
 and you go back on the way you go 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.159
 to find this stone 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.370
 that as you see we have here in the steppe 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.370
 dora 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.180
 champion is a bit difficult to see the 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.520
 truth yes no it is not I have mania that like 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.970
 I looking at the entity is through the ground 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.670
 but good here you have it and good as 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.079
 you see two samples have taken I have to 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.220
 throw things two samples of caught 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.009
 because I have the 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.360
 days 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:27.030
 unlocked expert horticulturists 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.980
 so let's go home we plant this and 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.810
 we continue with him with the tutor 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.720
 well we have returned from collecting the re 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.300
 climber to see her replanted and waited 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.250
 that grew and now that we are here 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.800
 outside in our port to pick up the 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.900
 wheat that we have also planted and 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.940
 you 're going to see that we're going to pick up a lot more 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.290
 of what is usually collected 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.670
 only with the ability to 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.670
 horticulturist so we started 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:04.369
 and when we are obtained 44 it 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.949
 means that they are 4 wheat per plant 

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:09.399
 when at the latest we could have 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.399
 two 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.110
 and apart now we go in to our 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.060
 greenhouse 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.220
 and we are going to take the whole record 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.150
 powerful that we have planted that as 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.660
 you see are all the pots so 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.660
 we start 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:33.189
 also plant them and be a father to be 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.189
 so short 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:42.140
 we activate it without wanting to give it this one 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:46.540
 to clean the plant and we do not want 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.540
 make action we want to collect it 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:04.490
 it even gives me that not grown is that 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:06.529
 you feel it had planted pick 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.589
 and pick up 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:11.719
 and with this we have 80 climbing roots 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:14.059
 you know that with the dlcn removes two plants 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:15.979
 with a lot of clients now we are going to 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:18.679
 an alchemy table I got off before 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:22.560
 I had alchemy 70 got me down home 

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:26.600
 I had 15m down 70 for you to see 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.600
 how fast can you upload 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.250
 I'm going to take all the 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.090
 where I think I do have it here is 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:46.800
 great for you to see 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:49.970
 we started so much so in 1124 and with 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.970
 the team put 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.940
 I 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.790
 with the equipment 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.889
 it will be worth a thousand 477 that means 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.889
 what 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:11.300
 As it is more expensive, we will go up more 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:11.300
 that we started to manufacture 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:18.610
 or that's quick to the recipient 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.610
 until the many times are over 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.830
 the truth is that it is a pass if you have 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.610
 ingredients climbing alchemy is 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.669
 very fast 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:32.270
 you have to know what recipe to make 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:32.270
 what do you see 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.390
 easy and simple for the whole family and 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.200
 I hope you liked this little one 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:43.970
 tutorial that is useful to you since there was 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.330
 out of what I thought was good 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.330
 idea 

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:55.229
 renew the theme a bit 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.229
 and then nothing until then
