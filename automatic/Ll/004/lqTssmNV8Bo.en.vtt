00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.680
 yes hi to all these colonials 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.600
 I hope you are well 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.300
 I'm fine because I'm going to comment with 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.640
 you the second video with so the 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.250
 Following them at all costs this time 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.660
 it will be with China as achi as 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.580
 you do not hide it's a weapon 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.529
 extremely difficult as much as to do 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.989
 of the time repartion we can get 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:40.540
 pick up some banks there in the head 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.570
 so to start I gave you my 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.690
 classes as usual I use 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.620
 ghost light weight dexterity and 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.930
 extreme conditions 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.540
 the game and I added looters what 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.100
 I remained two bloodthirsty food 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.979
 and so I preferred to take looters 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.309
 against me I take a stupidity in 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:02.290
 the head played well in accessories too 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.820
 you have not told him, but I 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.700
 selector to say is that rafa this is 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.720
 a galley not possible but hey 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.340
 do not contemplate doing kings no 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.810
 more because we have no choice 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.250
 that between past possible weapons of 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.220
 obliged to play without the selector 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.970
 of earth and I put hou 6-1 6-1 was 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.250
 of course to confide in the trump 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.140
 ghost 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.899
 and since I was going to look for 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.640
 friends as if his joy 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:33.930
 you 2 this one I have more balls 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.280
 I do not look at the neck small charger 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.240
 to let go as it is this moment 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.570
 difficult 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.820
 luck also aligned to a sky 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.479
 so I'm sure they'll come 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.970
 I watch out for ours I confirm 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.590
 bloodthirsty yes I have not managed to 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.130
 have seen more cartridges have made the 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.880
 turn nick anyway he still has to 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.420
 in there I go back there he 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.729
 was there they wait their turn to 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.360
 the other not miss 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.549
 I gave everything my guard I take to 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.869
 put it in there like that so ever night to 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.019
 and you're still killed by a 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.019
 sniper 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.319
 so here is the cantoning to good the 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.090
 first video is always attention he 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.920
 have to trust the map it's easy to 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.510
 find them on the map of points 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.019
 red you know they're here I have 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.350
 seen a good game of missing people he is 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:35.069
 behind you are searched 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.069
 he went inside 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.230
 since the can will have others the keyboard 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.400
 from blue dot jean charles and I 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.730
 go back to the other side since they're going 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.930
 to be from the east coast if you have any 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.319
 difficulties percent of shots in the 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.329
 head 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.409
 put a reflex viewfinder that's what 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:59.290
 I did it before the challenges 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:02.100
 for the challenges and let him have him 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.540
 terrifying more he 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.540
 we can easily puzzles 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.130
 people gone or climbed from who 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.870
 encamped 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.790
 he was en masse he was easy 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.670
 to go get them had always in 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.050
 the two strategic points on the map 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:25.310
 cellular to his interests I do not know 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:27.560
 how he answers drink so I have you 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.810
 not say either this jazz video too 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.030
 video mode the giant register help 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.880
 someone to capture you will want to have 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.730
 good quality 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.200
 until can do live 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.050
 good I'm going around the map one more time 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.430
 I know there are blue dots 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.720
 partners are on one side so the 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.280
 adversaries are in europe no 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.690
 easily that for the red on the 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.110
 map 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.570
 there are opponents around it 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.550
 and we see that fascinating that's it 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.830
 husbands who make that you can kill your 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.380
 opponents without exposing you too much 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:08.740
 made 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:08.740
 looking for it without horizons is more 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.080
 so we'll change corners 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.730
 will you go 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.860
 it will alleviate the extreme conditions 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.610
 it's interesting because we go from one 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.490
 point to another 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.620
 pretty quickly if we drag ourselves around but 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.000
 I could see version 6 stop the 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.160
 tarpaulin bit of the line easily 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.639
 it's easier to get around them 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.600
 have them in the back exam there but 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.550
 I prefer but especially the easiest 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.440
 who committed suicide but only not 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.810
 prevented from entering the wharf 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.979
 gold camouflage I saw points 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:05:01.530
 reds there is that they will 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:05:04.460
 arrive on time a little bit so we 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.930
 goes from the hypothesis then appears 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.810
 speaking car nordia on the mini map 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.699
 many who are really there it's more 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.430
 possible and chico ben it's like a 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:16.310
 weapon that powerful enough but difficult to 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:20.050
 handle with or without his readers 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:27.349
 quillan who will not understand that 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:29.360
 is not a way to have them in 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:31.490
 Keeping the thumb in the budget assets 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.120
 to do j like including that's surely 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.509
 the most complicated and kimi for me in 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.180
 the machine guns 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:44.419
 so if we approach the end I have 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.759
 searched one last time ciboure a 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.490
 spoken on that side there the spawn and this 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:51.099
 side a small drone jean-charles 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.660
 quietly I'm hiding for belmondo 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.490
 is run by and we have it most or 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:01.580
 Java is easy and it does 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:03.199
 look for the house and I know 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.520
 that there is more than 1 they want 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:09.560
 loud and I'm a somebody 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:12.409
 with here's the little tip that make 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.630
 that on this map the move from point to point 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:16.699
 the other and you arrive at that moment to 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.620
 find people who will hide in 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:21.469
 these four and you will easily 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.909
 circumvent them kill them for you 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:25.159
 bring ideas that he especially at 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:27.110
 level of the bloodthirsty to realize who 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.969
 is quite complicated for players 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.699
 who do not arrive who have a lot of trouble 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:33.020
 play like me so here are the 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.240
 next videos I will make you the 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.180
 detail of shotguns as you have 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.960
 says about sensitivity and then modes 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.960
 of course
