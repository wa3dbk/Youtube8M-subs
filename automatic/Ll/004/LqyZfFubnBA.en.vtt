00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
next thing that comes in with all

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.779 
next thing that comes in with all
sixteen<00:01:22.179> pages<00:01:22.509> of<00:01:22.840> hers<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:27.340> just<00:01:27.550> thought

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
sixteen pages of hers we just thought

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.070 
sixteen pages of hers we just thought
once<00:01:28.060> we<00:01:28.149> explored<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.539> character<00:01:28.810> slightly

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
once we explored the character slightly

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.380 
once we explored the character slightly
more<00:01:29.229> because<00:01:29.530> they're<00:01:29.950> growing<00:01:30.250> up<00:01:30.369> so<00:01:30.670> they

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
more because they're growing up so they

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.070 
more because they're growing up so they
spoke<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:31.929> the<00:01:32.020> character<00:01:33.360> what<00:01:34.360> is<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.539> first

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
spoke to the character what is the first

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.859 
spoke to the character what is the first
thing<00:01:35.380> that<00:01:35.409> typically<00:01:36.039> fans<00:01:36.850> do<00:01:37.299> when<00:01:37.720> they

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
thing that typically fans do when they

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.749 
thing that typically fans do when they
see<00:01:37.929> you<00:01:38.229> in<00:01:38.350> public<00:01:38.560> it<00:01:39.220> kind<00:01:39.459> of<00:01:39.490> cut<00:01:39.729> off

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
see you in public it kind of cut off

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.020 
see you in public it kind of cut off
kind<00:01:40.209> of<00:01:40.270> double<00:01:40.509> takes<00:01:40.750> first<00:01:41.470> of<00:01:41.649> all<00:01:41.740> I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
kind of double takes first of all I

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.059 
kind of double takes first of all I
think<00:01:43.030> this<00:01:43.659> theory<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.590> we<00:01:44.679> can't<00:01:44.920> actually

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
think this theory that we can't actually

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:46.950 
think this theory that we can't actually
go<00:01:45.399> out<00:01:45.610> in<00:01:45.789> public<00:01:45.939> so<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.390> must<00:01:46.719> just<00:01:46.869> be

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
go out in public so it must just be

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.609 
go out in public so it must just be
somebody<00:01:47.320> who<00:01:47.409> looks<00:01:47.680> like<00:01:47.829> us<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.409> mean

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
somebody who looks like us but I mean

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.289 
somebody who looks like us but I mean
that's<00:01:50.890> kind<00:01:51.159> of<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.340> myth<00:01:51.490> be<00:01:51.640> correctly<00:01:52.000> and

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
that's kind of a myth be correctly and

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.060 
that's kind of a myth be correctly and
go<00:01:52.479> out<00:01:52.630> I<00:01:52.899> was<00:01:53.229> talked<00:01:53.469> to<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.649> other<00:01:53.740> day<00:01:53.860> and
