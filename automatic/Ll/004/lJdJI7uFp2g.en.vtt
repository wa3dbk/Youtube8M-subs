00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:13.530
 today we are going to make a yogurt cake 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:18.080
 now we just tossed two yolks of 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.080
 egg here we are beating them true 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:28.780
 then we will add the clear ones not the other way around 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.529
 the buds and we will move a little 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:36.550
 after 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:41.180
 we will add yogurt and sugar 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:44.720
 oil life in yeast seemed 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.630
 thicker the egg that is the 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.920
 egg 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.920
 this shake is either 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.320
 a little more you have to do a little 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.320
 faster 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.960
 and 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.960
 Well, it's more, it's over 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.850
 beat the egg and we have pulled out here already 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.940
 all the ingredients we have yogurt 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.940
 cinnamon flour sugar 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.620
 the yeast the olive oil and now 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:22.150
 we are going to mix little by little everything 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:23.740
 there in the truth takes is there 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.280
 you have to move them also with what 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.960
 is already beaten from the whites 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.960
 although to beat is a little 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.570
 very well 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.570
 OK 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.799
 very good now in this little glass here 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.810
 which it is like a yogurt let 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.740
 do all the measurements 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.290
 ah 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.240
 let's use the glass as if it were a 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.390
 yogurt then you have to fill all the 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.390
 glass of yogurt first a little bit more 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.240
 there is good 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.270
 already a person gives and now it's yogurt 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.550
 there inside the volt in there already 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.800
 move 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.310
 you can also eat it 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.310
 today 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.209
 and move again 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.780
 Now we are going to add two cups of 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.709
 sugar 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.709
 one over here 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.350
 and the other one was here 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.290
 and now to mix again 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.940
 and now we also add half a glass of 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.650
 oil 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.650
 and again I truly love 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.160
 and it's almost finished now we have 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.540
 that to go throwing the most difficult because 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.880
 we have to be the little flour to 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.040
 little bit and without stopping to move now let's go 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.739
 to add the flour little by little 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.630
 and without stopping to move so you do not 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.630
 make lumps 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.750
 very well and little by little image 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.129
 we understand to quote three short of those 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.129
 all filled with flour little by little 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.400
 we have the last 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.970
 and after this what we have to 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.960
 do is give the yeast preheat the 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:54.710
 oven put it in the oven and wait 35 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:57.230
 minutes and we'll have our tortilla 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.520
 Well, we have here the yeast 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.280
 let's do there 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.780
 and now you can put it there and move it 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.340
 also from your patient as before 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.600
 and then here we are going to prepare 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.610
 this mold 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.860
 with butter so that it is not one 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.240
 full 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.240
 and now it is very hard 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.530
 It is very one hour 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.540
 or 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.590
 ah 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.809
 Now comes the funniest part 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.089
 is to prepare the mold with butter 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:50.979
 so that it does not stick with the 

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:54.119
 hand you have to catch butter like that 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.119
 with fingers 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:03.750
 very good and perfect 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.750
 here that's the funniest thing about the cake 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.950
 it is getting perfect sometimes what 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.810
 tell the walls 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.020
 and me while I 'm going to light the oven 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.020
 OK 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.990
 good as we already have the oven 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.930
 warm we're going to put all that in the 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.240
 mold 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.400
 now that I help with the spoon with 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.400
 this I help you care care in 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.670
 if the hole badly well 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.270
 we have already removed everything there in the mold 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.270
 from the heart 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.660
 so you stay 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.100
 and good 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.160
 Now we put it in the oven, it's good 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.160
 warm 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:23.180
 after two minutes we put it to 180 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.180
 and wait 35 minutes 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:29.080
 35 minutes here we have our 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:31.979
 yogurt cupcake with heart shape 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.979
 very rich 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.830
 in the end 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:39.639
 very well and then
