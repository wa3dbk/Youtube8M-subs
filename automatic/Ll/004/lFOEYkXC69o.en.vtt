them with this ipod about by adapter you
can<00:01:17.280> use<00:01:17.549> new<00:01:17.759> lightning<00:01:18.030> connector<00:01:18.450> right

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
can use new lightning connector right

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.910 
can use new lightning connector right
here<00:01:18.600> which<00:01:19.020> connects<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:20.240> like<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.990> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
here which connects just like so that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.670 
here which connects just like so that
can<00:01:23.159> also<00:01:23.479> insert<00:01:24.479> upside<00:01:24.840> down<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.320> commuters

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
can also insert upside down it commuters

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.319 
can also insert upside down it commuters
drive<00:01:25.920> away<00:01:26.840> that's<00:01:28.460> so<00:01:29.460> that's<00:01:29.670> an<00:01:30.180> overview

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
drive away that's so that's an overview

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.539 
drive away that's so that's an overview
of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> externals<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> ipod<00:01:31.950> touch<00:01:31.979> I'll

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
of the externals of the ipod touch I'll

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.760 
of the externals of the ipod touch I'll
just<00:01:32.670> worked<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.210> from<00:01:33.360> standby<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.079> when<00:01:34.710> you

the games and apps I have a my ipod

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.609 
the games and apps I have a my ipod
touch<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.409> slide<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.040> unlock<00:01:42.619> and

touch so we just slide to unlock and
here<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:46.759> so<00:01:47.759> your<00:01:48.270> interface

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
here we have it so your interface

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.139 
here we have it so your interface
similar<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.619> had<00:01:49.770> an<00:01:50.070> iphone<00:01:50.220> or<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
similar if you had an iphone or a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.210 
similar if you had an iphone or a
previous<00:01:51.720> ipod<00:01:51.990> touch<00:01:52.200> models<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.829> interface

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
previous ipod touch models the interface

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.050 
previous ipod touch models the interface
is<00:01:53.340> very<00:01:53.369> similar<00:01:54.649> so<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.520> tier<00:01:56.880> we've<00:01:56.969> got

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
is very similar so on the tier we've got

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.609 
is very similar so on the tier we've got
the<00:01:57.180> photos<00:01:57.570> up<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:57.990> we'll<00:01:58.170> refer<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.500> take

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the photos up so we'll refer to take
