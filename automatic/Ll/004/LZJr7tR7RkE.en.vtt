how to rock a short haircut yourself
first<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.870> foremost<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.200> think<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.500> really

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
first and foremost I think it's really

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.400 
first and foremost I think it's really
important<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.719> make<00:00:39.719> sure<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.079> actually

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
important to make sure that you actually

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.350 
important to make sure that you actually
style<00:00:40.980> your<00:00:41.219> hair<00:00:41.399> everyday<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.030> even<00:00:42.270> though

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
style your hair everyday and even though

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.940 
style your hair everyday and even though
it's<00:00:42.540> short<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.079> pretty<00:00:43.260> easy<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.710> style

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
it's short and it's pretty easy to style

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.799 
it's short and it's pretty easy to style
I<00:00:44.250> think<00:00:44.760> that's<00:00:44.910> an<00:00:45.030> important<00:00:45.480> first<00:00:45.660> step

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
I think that's an important first step

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.600 
I think that's an important first step
to<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.739> committed<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.250> making<00:00:47.430> sure

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
to it to be committed to making sure

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.340 
to it to be committed to making sure
that<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.180> everyday<00:00:48.390> when<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.140> have

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that you do it everyday when you have

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.080 
that you do it everyday when you have
longer<00:00:49.680> hair<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.610> couple<00:00:50.820> lazy

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
longer hair you can have a couple lazy

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.220 
longer hair you can have a couple lazy
days<00:00:51.329> where<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.629> pull<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.899> back<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.170> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
hair it's a lot more obvious when you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.579 
hair it's a lot more obvious when you
haven't<00:01:02.520> washed<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.390> taking<00:01:03.719> care<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.930> it

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
haven't washed it and taking care of it

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.230 
haven't washed it and taking care of it
or<00:01:05.040> when<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.220> haven't<00:01:05.400> styled<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.060> day

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
or when you haven't styled it that day

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.270 
or when you haven't styled it that day
and<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.380> first<00:01:07.560> look<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.010> you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and that can be the first look that you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.940 
and that can be the first look that you
know<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.700> not<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.570> well-kept<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.740> should

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
know it's not as well-kept as it should

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.590 
know it's not as well-kept as it should
be<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.640> think<00:01:11.729> first<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.150> foremost<00:01:12.240> it's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
be so I think first and foremost it's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.760 
be so I think first and foremost it's
important<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.229> make<00:01:13.350> sure<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.560> you're<00:01:13.680> gonna

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
important to make sure that you're gonna

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.950 
important to make sure that you're gonna
do<00:01:14.010> your<00:01:14.130> hair<00:01:14.250> every<00:01:14.490> day<00:01:14.659> or<00:01:15.659> every<00:01:15.810> other

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
do your hair every day or every other

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.390 
do your hair every day or every other
day<00:01:16.140> if<00:01:16.409> your<00:01:16.619> hair<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.950> lasts<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.340> long

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
day if your hair it lasts that long

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.700 
day if your hair it lasts that long
that's<00:01:17.670> great<00:01:17.939> secondly<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.930> think<00:01:19.110> important

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
that's great secondly I think important

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.460 
that's great secondly I think important
to<00:01:19.979> at<00:01:20.850> least<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.240> me<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.659> always<00:01:21.810> do<00:01:22.439> my
