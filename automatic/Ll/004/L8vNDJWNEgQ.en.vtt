00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
look like up close so as you see my

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.590 
look like up close so as you see my
bottom<00:00:55.770> lashes<00:00:56.059> benefited<00:00:57.059> more<00:00:57.239> from<00:00:57.449> this

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
bottom lashes benefited more from this

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.680 
bottom lashes benefited more from this
than<00:00:57.660> my<00:00:57.989> top<00:00:58.260> lashes<00:00:59.210> makes<00:01:00.210> my<00:01:00.420> bottom

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
than my top lashes makes my bottom

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.560 
than my top lashes makes my bottom
lashes<00:01:00.870> look<00:01:01.170> super<00:01:01.920> long<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.969> you're

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
lashes look super long so if you're

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.969 
lashes look super long so if you're
looking<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.049> mascara<00:01:04.439> that's<00:01:04.680> giving<00:01:04.920> you

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
looking for a mascara that's giving you

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.859 
looking for a mascara that's giving you
a<00:01:05.010> lot<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.460> lot<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.850> volume<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.479> isn't<00:01:06.810> exactly

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
a lot a lot of volume this isn't exactly

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.929 
a lot a lot of volume this isn't exactly
going<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.590> do<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.890> but<00:01:08.369> what<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.640> does<00:01:08.790> is

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
going to do that but what it does is

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.289 
going to do that but what it does is
give<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.240> curl<00:01:09.619> length<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.040> separation<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
give you curl length and separation the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.060 
give you curl length and separation the
reason<00:01:12.630> why<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.869> gives<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.680> much<00:01:13.799> length

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
reason why this gives you so much length

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.920 
reason why this gives you so much length
is<00:01:14.280> because<00:01:15.000> when<00:01:15.270> you're<00:01:15.390> combing<00:01:15.659> it

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
is because when you're combing it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.780 
is because when you're combing it
downward<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.710> your<00:01:16.830> bottom<00:01:17.130> lashes<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.670> like

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
downward on your bottom lashes it's like

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.030 
downward on your bottom lashes it's like
pulling<00:01:18.150> them<00:01:18.299> down<00:01:18.470> same<00:01:19.470> what's<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> top

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
pulling them down same what's on the top

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.469 
pulling them down same what's on the top
it's<00:01:20.220> pulling<00:01:20.520> them<00:01:20.670> up<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.060> don't<00:01:21.360> usually

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
it's pulling them up I don't usually

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.359 
it's pulling them up I don't usually
like<00:01:21.840> brushes<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.380> aren't<00:01:22.619> big<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.070> fluffy

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
like brushes that aren't big and fluffy

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.260 
like brushes that aren't big and fluffy
and<00:01:23.580> like<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.970> kind<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.360> mascara<00:01:24.750> wand<00:01:25.020> but

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
and like this kind of mascara wand but

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.460 
and like this kind of mascara wand but
considering<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.360> knew<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> liked<00:01:27.900> one<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.350> this

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
considering I knew I liked one like this

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.380 
considering I knew I liked one like this
in<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> past<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.490> thought<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.939> would<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.210> it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
in the past I thought it would like it

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.660 
in the past I thought it would like it
and<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.600> do<00:01:30.659> um<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:32.040> guys<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.340> probably<00:01:32.549> seen

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
and I do um you guys have probably seen

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.249 
and I do um you guys have probably seen
my<00:01:32.880> top<00:01:33.060> lashes<00:01:33.299> looking<00:01:33.720> better<00:01:33.840> than<00:01:34.110> this

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
my top lashes looking better than this

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.200 
my top lashes looking better than this
so<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:35.159> know<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.729> not<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
so I know that it's not like the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.670 
so I know that it's not like the
greatest<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.750> would<00:01:36.840> probably<00:01:36.960> layer<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.530> with

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
greatest I would probably layer it with

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.319 
greatest I would probably layer it with
another<00:01:37.950> one<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.400> top<00:01:38.579> lashes<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.150> for

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
another one for the top lashes but for

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.539 
another one for the top lashes but for
