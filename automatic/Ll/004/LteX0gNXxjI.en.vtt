00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 let's prepare a delicious sauce 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.559
 green this sauce is added to the 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.820
 potatoes when we are going to make a roast 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:17.850
 accompanied with meat taste delicious 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.750
 ingredients a cup of leaves 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.570
 coriander 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.330
 we have to be careful not to 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.490
 Let's go sticks because that would make 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.289
 the sauce we left bitter have to be 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.079
 only the leaves 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.120
 enough oil can be 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.510
 cup and a half rate we only use until 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.899
 the sauce does not thicken an egg two 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.160
 tablespoons of mustard two tablespoons 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.320
 vinegar a head of garlic and a pinch of 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.220
 Salt 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.030
 let's add to the blender 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.030
 the coriander 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.760
 ah 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.760
 the mustard 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.079
 the vinegar 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.760
 the garlic the pinch of salt 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.380
 and the egg 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.789
 we are going to liquefy it at low speed 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:42.130
 we just light the blender 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.130
 we leave it 12 seconds 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.770
 Now let's start adding the 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.039
 oil in little trickles you can see 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.509
 the recipe for mayonnaise is very similar 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.659
 let's turn on the blender at speed 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.590
 very low and we are adding oil until 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.590
 that the special sauce 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.069
 Hahaha 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.459
 when we are adding the oil we see 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:25.010
 a hole in the center when the 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.480
 little hole is disappearing means that 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.549
 the sauce is already thick 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.340
 we can stop the speed of the 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.470
 blender and look with the spoons if you already 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.569
 It is thick enough to turn off 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.599
 there is already ready 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.470
 this is the consistency with which you should 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.470
 get the sauce
