00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.870
 so tell me, keep communicating how 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.970

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.470
 one year the courtship a year already wow how 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.360
 Time passes and you know what 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.989
 means a year for us 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.780
 five year old girls 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:31.340
 the day after tomorrow we celebrated the year and 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.650
 I'm thinking of making a gift very 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.230
 special how good it stinks to give him 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.000
 I am determined to please him totally 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.400
 I'm going to give it to this end and to 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.610
 our anniversary to you but you 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.740
 they know each other and etb every day do not look 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.989
 I have an idea always in a tree 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.980
 together and so even though you would be so 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.050
 romantic if maybe you can do that 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.970
 I think that really is not what 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.860
 I'm looking for yes clear suddenly pulled out 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.080
 silly but I can think of something else 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.120
 we could go shopping and consider how 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.699
 useful for him but I already told you what he 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.740
 I want to give that I already told you 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.170
 I want to give to myself until the end 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.780
 all of you understand me that would be the gift 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.210
 perfect I know that this way he would be 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.370
 completely sure that I love you 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.190
 you mean ricardo and you 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.130
 without clothes as you want to put it like that 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.560
 Well, if it does not sound so unromantic 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.930
 the truth is that I'm emotional change 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.660
 And at the same time, she's nervous. 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.670
 will accompany me to buy a set 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.450
 that you know I think everything is perfect 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.900
 for the occasion 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.900
 hey tell me something like you think god is 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.580
 feel with that there but what is the drama 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.160
 because you do not have to put it so 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.830
 difficult the drama is that you know that 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.410

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.270

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.040

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.860
 waiting and the person with whom I'm leaving 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.330
