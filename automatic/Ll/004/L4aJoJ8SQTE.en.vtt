00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
for me as well so that's funny but

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.910 
for me as well so that's funny but
people<00:03:47.769> ask<00:03:48.250> me<00:03:48.810> what<00:03:49.810> do<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:49.959> think<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.410> hyper

time<00:04:40.970> in<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.750> Black<00:04:41.930> Forest<00:04:42.250> you<00:04:43.250> can't<00:04:43.460> hear

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
time in the Black Forest you can't hear

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.820 
time in the Black Forest you can't hear
exactly<00:04:44.150> what<00:04:44.360> it's<00:04:44.720> but<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.050> but<00:04:45.410> it<00:04:45.590> takes

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
exactly what it's but it but it takes

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.020 
exactly what it's but it but it takes
you<00:04:46.130> into<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:47.090> story<00:04:47.479> and<00:04:47.870> that's<00:04:48.020> for<00:04:48.440> me

you into the story and that's for me
what<00:04:50.030> what<00:04:50.750> a<00:04:50.780> portrait<00:04:51.680> must<00:04:51.919> address

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.880
