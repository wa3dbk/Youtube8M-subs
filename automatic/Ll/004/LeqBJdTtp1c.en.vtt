all<00:00:03.449> right<00:00:03.720> well<00:00:03.929> in<00:00:04.080> this<00:00:04.259> video<00:00:04.650> I'm<00:00:05.220> going

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
all right well in this video I'm going

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.089 
all right well in this video I'm going
to<00:00:05.730> be<00:00:06.120> assembling<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:07.200> very<00:00:07.440> simple<00:00:07.890> table

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
to be assembling a very simple table

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.280 
to be assembling a very simple table
base<00:00:08.490> it's<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:09.150> project<00:00:09.420> I'm<00:00:09.780> working<00:00:10.139> on

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
base it's a project I'm working on

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.080 
base it's a project I'm working on
making<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.370> table<00:00:11.519> for<00:00:11.759> no<00:00:11.910> particular

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
making the table for no particular

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.450 
making the table for no particular
reason<00:00:12.300> really<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.710> sort<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.040> part<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.340> a

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
reason really it is sort of part of a

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.950 
reason really it is sort of part of a
bigger<00:00:14.639> project<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.420> I'll<00:00:15.509> get<00:00:15.690> into<00:00:15.839> that

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
bigger project and I'll get into that

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.529 
bigger project and I'll get into that
more<00:00:16.310> later<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:17.699> for<00:00:17.850> now<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.029> just<00:00:18.119> wanted<00:00:18.449> to

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
more later but for now I just wanted to

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.790 
more later but for now I just wanted to
show<00:00:18.690> sort<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.050> sped<00:00:19.289> up<00:00:19.410> version<00:00:19.590> of

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
show sort of a sped up version of

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.730 
show sort of a sped up version of
assembling<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.460> it's<00:00:20.670> all<00:00:20.910> right<00:00:21.600> angles

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
assembling it it's all right angles

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.220 
assembling it it's all right angles
no<00:00:23.490> turnings<00:00:23.970> anything<00:00:24.420> all<00:00:24.689> mortise<00:00:25.109> and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
no turnings anything all mortise and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.109 
no turnings anything all mortise and
tenon<00:00:25.560> three-quarter<00:00:26.070> inch<00:00:26.220> mortise<00:00:26.939> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
tenon three-quarter inch mortise and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.419 
tenon three-quarter inch mortise and
Tenon's<00:00:27.570> all<00:00:27.840> around<00:00:28.170> just<00:00:28.429> different

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
Tenon's all around just different

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.370 
Tenon's all around just different
dimensions<00:00:30.029> other<00:00:30.269> than<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.720> width<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.170> mean

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
dimensions other than the width I mean

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.740 
dimensions other than the width I mean
the<00:00:31.470> thickness<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.040> tenon<00:00:32.340> some<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.600> glue

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the thickness of the tenon some the glue

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.889 
the thickness of the tenon some the glue
I'm<00:00:33.899> using<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.380> tight<00:00:34.680> bond<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.899> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
I'm using is tight bond it's the the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.479 
I'm using is tight bond it's the the
green<00:00:37.140> label<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.680> that's<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.010> waterproof

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
green label so that's the waterproof

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.150 
green label so that's the waterproof
glue<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.600> all<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> had<00:00:40.110> leftover<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:40.950> used

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
glue just all I had leftover I just used

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.670 
glue just all I had leftover I just used
up<00:00:41.550> ma<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.790> gallon<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> premium<00:00:42.960> one

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
up ma the gallon of the premium one

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.190 
up ma the gallon of the premium one
thing<00:00:43.829> it's<00:00:43.980> nice<00:00:44.129> about<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.030> tight<00:00:45.960> bond

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
thing it's nice about the tight bond

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.959 
thing it's nice about the tight bond
three<00:00:46.649> that's<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> waterproof<00:00:47.460> stuff<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.879> it

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
three that's the waterproof stuff is it

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.360 
three that's the waterproof stuff is it
has<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> longer<00:00:48.390> work<00:00:49.289> time<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.010> video<00:00:50.309> is

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
has a longer work time so this video is

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.939 
has a longer work time so this video is
condensed<00:00:50.940> down<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.350> minute<00:00:52.620> or<00:00:52.739> so

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
condensed down to just a minute or so

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.000 
condensed down to just a minute or so
but<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.730> reality<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.329> took<00:00:54.539> 20<00:00:54.870> minutes<00:00:55.140> for

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
but in reality this took 20 minutes for

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.160 
but in reality this took 20 minutes for
checking<00:00:56.430> angles<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.270> making<00:00:58.020> sure

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
checking angles and making sure

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.830 
checking angles and making sure
everything<00:00:58.530> was<00:00:58.739> square<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.399> all<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:00.390> but

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
everything was square and all that but

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.319 
everything was square and all that but
um<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.309> addition<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.789> talked<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
um and then in addition to that talked a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.939 
um and then in addition to that talked a
little<00:01:03.480> bit<00:01:03.660> about<00:01:03.750> clamps<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.379> lot<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.650> people

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
little bit about clamps a lot of people

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.039 
little bit about clamps a lot of people
worry<00:01:05.610> about<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:06.030> having<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> right<00:01:06.720> kind<00:01:06.960> of

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
worry about not having the right kind of

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.440 
worry about not having the right kind of
clamps<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.590> not<00:01:07.680> having<00:01:07.890> enough<00:01:08.360> but<00:01:09.360> all

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
clamps and not having enough but all

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.690 
clamps and not having enough but all
this<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.780> put<00:01:09.930> together<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.560> $15<00:01:11.490> of

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
this is put together with like $15 of

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.969 
this is put together with like $15 of
clamps<00:01:12.150> probably<00:01:12.689> less<00:01:13.350> than<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:13.950> I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
clamps probably less than that really I

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.170 
clamps probably less than that really I
didn't<00:01:14.220> even<00:01:14.340> pay<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:14.700> all<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.820> them<00:01:15.090> it's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
didn't even pay for all of them it's

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.179 
didn't even pay for all of them it's
just<00:01:15.210> stuff<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.570> end<00:01:15.900> up<00:01:16.020> getting<00:01:16.830> here<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
just stuff that end up getting here and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.249 
just stuff that end up getting here and
there<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.670> those<00:01:18.119> band<00:01:18.420> clamps<00:01:18.869> around<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
there but those band clamps around the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.380 
there but those band clamps around the
top<00:01:19.470> come<00:01:19.799> from<00:01:20.040> Harbor<00:01:20.310> Freight<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.000> does<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
top come from Harbor Freight so does the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
top come from Harbor Freight so does the
ratchet<00:01:21.869> strap<00:01:22.140> around<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.650> trestle<00:01:23.070> part<00:01:23.250> on

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
ratchet strap around the trestle part on

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.210 
ratchet strap around the trestle part on
the<00:01:23.400> bottom<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.869> clamp<00:01:25.229> parts<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the bottom and the clamp parts of the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.590 
the bottom and the clamp parts of the
pipe<00:01:26.430> clamps<00:01:26.850> came<00:01:27.000> from<00:01:27.119> Harbor<00:01:27.420> Freight

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
pipe clamps came from Harbor Freight

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.649 
pipe clamps came from Harbor Freight
also<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.229> very<00:01:28.350> inexpensive<00:01:28.650> stuff<00:01:29.659> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
also so it's very inexpensive stuff you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.789 
also so it's very inexpensive stuff you
could<00:01:30.780> actually<00:01:31.079> clamp<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.409> whole<00:01:31.619> thing

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
could actually clamp this whole thing

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.830 
could actually clamp this whole thing
together<00:01:32.070> with<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.549> band<00:01:33.090> clamps<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.659> you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
together with just band clamps if you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.950 
together with just band clamps if you
wanted<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.759> or<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.790> ratchet<00:01:36.420> straps<00:01:36.659> alone

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
wanted to or just ratchet straps alone

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.330 
wanted to or just ratchet straps alone
just<00:01:37.200> making<00:01:37.439> sure<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.740> don't<00:01:37.860> dent<00:01:38.159> your

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
just making sure you don't dent your

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.030 
just making sure you don't dent your
corners<00:01:38.759> up<00:01:38.970> too<00:01:39.180> much<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.710> once<00:01:40.710> again<00:01:40.829> I'll

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
corners up too much but once again I'll

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.649 
corners up too much but once again I'll
talk<00:01:41.250> more<00:01:41.280> about<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.880> project<00:01:42.150> probably<00:01:42.600> in

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
talk more about this project probably in
