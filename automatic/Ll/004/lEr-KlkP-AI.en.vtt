 today leaving me blowjobs I'm going 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.829
 to teach a few secrets that such 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.960
 Once you 've seen they're three but I have not gone up 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.030
 to the channel and the channel is secrets of 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.909
 several good games I have climbed almost alone 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.010
 of jeta 5 and it was maria medium rare not to go up 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.690
 these secrets that the personal I think that 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.760
 even if they are a little small they are 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.130
 pretty cool the first one that I'm going to 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.000
 teaching is located here and is related 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.000
 with terminator 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.170
 as the Germans say if I do not 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.500
 do you think I'll put you an audio in German 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.179
 for you to believe me or not to have times 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.770
 because you did not think you were a bastard 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.780
 did you believe the first time I told you that 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.939
 So it was said now that I put the audio 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.399
 I believe that already I'm glad now what 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.710
 they are looking for black or arnold schwarzenegger 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.960
 that guy who wants to go to the gym 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.909
 but in reality I peel it I am more 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.520
 sucked that game and you had those 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.799
 I saw you and our suckers have 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.590
 the stomach one the gong or mystery 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.080
 clean thousand seven hundred and nothing peak 1970 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.390
 and something to mamés like that 1,700 already the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.920
 chingo going straight with the secret what 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.259
 what we are seeing right now is a store 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.569
 of seedling plants called 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.340
 herminator I think no need to 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.500
 I explained the reference you make with the 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.659
 terminator movie ok I'm going to 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.700
 explain if you look terminator it 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.009
 it looks like terminator because it has a tie 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.370
 instead a gestation terminator has a 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.709
 scissor min editor has a then 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.110
 terminator terminator terminator 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.109
 they say there not, because you looked 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.060
 terminator if you look at it, see that yes 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.220
 already 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.020
 it's good and now it 's plant is 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.209
 saying a phrase that is very famous in 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.520
 the cinema that is as well as alive that what 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.480
 You have to say without feelings for 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.520
 that you come true and the phrase 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.040
 I will return in what it says I will not be 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.540
 back then I want you to say it 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.730
 before continuing with the video you have to 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.880
 say the phrase verdi the without feelings 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.590
 remember as if you were depressed 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.050
 you already said it very well if you did not say it 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.000
 what a bad person you are basically this 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.310
 it's the first secret now let's see 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.590
 one related to a few pieces 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.310
 you miss some pieces to somebody 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.470
 pieces monge some egg head pieces 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.209
 some small pieces of marzipan 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.190
 pretty strange pieces that 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.870
 find in this location to be 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.730
 honest when I went there what I most 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.489
 liked it was the mansion that is very very 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.319
 chida is logically very large 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.420
 house that's why it's a mansion if not no 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.450
 it would be a mansion there are no mansions 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.940
 You girls already said a lot of mansion already 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.440
 stop saying it and stop saying it 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.660
 pieces that make like a board 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.910
 chess and they are in some parts of the 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.540
 house of this mansion the truth I do not know that 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.670
 be 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.159
 we never see them in history or more 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.290
 well they never explain to us what they are or why 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.569
 what are there but more or less of that is 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.450
 try this secret if you listened well 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.190
 I said more or less 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.250
 and the last secret that I'm going to 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.709
 teaching is related to gta 4 is a 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.290
 reference to the ancestor of this game 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.709
 let's see a machine a machine the 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.130
 nintendo a video game machine a 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.530
 machine called 3 I do not know how to say 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.660
 forgive the ignorance but this machine 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.790
 appeared what is gta 4 as they 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.620
 commented and pretty boy who 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.810
 have put here the only difference that 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.910
 has with the one that comes out in 4 is that there 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.620
 yes you can use it there if you can 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.360
 play a few games of this 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.830
 game in fact I think there's a very achievement 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.930
 difficult to take out what you have to do 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.880
 certain point on this machine if I do not 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.250
 wrong correct down if I'm wrong 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.620
 I personally think that GTA 5 is missing 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.050
 a little bit of that to be able to play things 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.120
 on the street or being able to get into stores 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.490
 or being able to do a little more stuff 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.770
 as you could do in other gta me 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.479
 I would have liked to be able to go to the gym in 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.930
 the game so that people who saw me 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.150
 in online said today is good friend 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.190
 I would have liked that to happen but 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.020
 it did not happen unfortunately we hope that 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.000
 with some update can be done 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.960
 some of these things if you're very 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.580
 Huevón to comment 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.440
 Just leave your like if you want 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.600
