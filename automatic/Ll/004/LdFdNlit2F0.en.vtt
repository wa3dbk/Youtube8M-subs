00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
designed completely from scratch so we

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.150 
designed completely from scratch so we
have<00:00:45.390> things<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.950> custom<00:00:46.950> bass<00:00:47.820> drum<00:00:48.000> Spurs

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160

which you won't find anywhere else to a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.470 
which you won't find anywhere else to a
very<00:00:53.010> special<00:00:53.280> snare<00:00:53.699> mechanism<00:00:54.180> which<00:00:54.300> we'll

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
very special snare mechanism which we'll

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.310 
very special snare mechanism which we'll
talk<00:00:54.510> about<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.170> sec<00:00:56.180> so<00:00:57.180> new<00:00:57.360> stands<00:00:57.930> new

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
talk about in a sec so new stands new

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.770 
talk about in a sec so new stands new
clamps<00:00:59.090> we<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> look<00:01:00.690> at

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
clamps we just going to have a look at

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.270 
clamps we just going to have a look at
the<00:01:00.840> Tom<00:01:01.020> clamp<00:01:01.320> you'll<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.770> something<00:01:02.100> very

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the Tom clamp you'll see something very

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.880 
the Tom clamp you'll see something very
very<00:01:02.670> different<00:01:02.850> now<00:01:03.750> rather<00:01:04.259> than<00:01:04.379> using<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
very different now rather than using a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.480 
very different now rather than using a
plastic<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.820> glass<00:01:06.200> composite<00:01:07.200> ball<00:01:07.490> natal

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
plastic or glass composite ball natal

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.240 
plastic or glass composite ball natal
are<00:01:08.729> using<00:01:09.299> aluminium<00:01:09.540> balls<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.890> doesn't

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
are using aluminium balls so it doesn't

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.910 
are using aluminium balls so it doesn't
it<00:01:11.460> doesn't<00:01:11.490> collapse<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:13.080> doesn't<00:01:13.439> shred<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it doesn't collapse it doesn't shred and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920 
it doesn't collapse it doesn't shred and
it<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.729> take<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> white<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.510> can<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.900> can

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it can take the white and it can it can

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.870 
it can take the white and it can it can
be<00:01:16.170> lots<00:01:16.380> absolutely<00:01:17.040> totally<00:01:17.189> firmly<00:01:17.640> in

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
be lots absolutely totally firmly in

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.020 
be lots absolutely totally firmly in
place

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.790 

also<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> ash<00:01:24.450> even<00:01:24.990> some<00:01:25.410> of<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.560> wraps

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
also on the ash even some of the wraps

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.920 
also on the ash even some of the wraps
are<00:01:26.160> one-offs<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:26.970> well<00:01:27.120> for<00:01:27.360> natal<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.810> this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
are one-offs as well for natal so this

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.070 
are one-offs as well for natal so this
is<00:01:28.050> another<00:01:28.320> rap<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.820> natal<00:01:30.450> ash<00:01:30.720> service

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
is another rap on the natal ash service

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.770 
is another rap on the natal ash service
now<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.220> zoom<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.330> snare

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
now if we just zoom in on the snare

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.170 
now if we just zoom in on the snare
mechanism<00:01:34.320> you'll<00:01:34.800> see<00:01:35.010> is<00:01:35.250> one<00:01:35.610> very<00:01:35.880> very

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
mechanism you'll see is one very very

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.090 
mechanism you'll see is one very very
clever<00:01:36.420> thing<00:01:37.610> that's<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.730> snares<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:40.100> that's

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
clever thing that's the snares on that's

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.580 
clever thing that's the snares on that's
the<00:01:41.250> snares<00:01:41.490> off<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:42.510> if<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.720> put<00:01:42.930> them<00:01:43.080> into

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the snares off but if I put them into

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.700 
the snares off but if I put them into
the<00:01:43.800> on<00:01:43.920> position<00:01:43.950> again<00:01:44.550> and<00:01:44.790> push<00:01:45.300> it<00:01:45.420> one

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
the on position again and push it one

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.070 
the on position again and push it one
bit<00:01:46.710> further<00:01:46.980> on<00:01:47.070> I've<00:01:48.060> got<00:01:48.300> a<00:01:48.330> third<00:01:48.630> position

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
bit further on I've got a third position

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.380 
bit further on I've got a third position
so<00:01:49.230> these<00:01:49.380> are<00:01:49.560> three<00:01:49.740> position<00:01:50.390> snare

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
so these are three position snare

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.790 
so these are three position snare
releases<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.160> off<00:01:53.400> tights<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:54.800> just

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
releases so I have off tights and just

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.220 
releases so I have off tights and just
off<00:01:56.010> tight<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.520> slightly<00:01:56.820> looser

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.290 

you
