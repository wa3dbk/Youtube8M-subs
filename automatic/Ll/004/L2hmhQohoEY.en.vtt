00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.390 
to the gold leaf galaxy which is the
first<00:06:26.790> galaxies<00:06:27.300> of<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:28.040> engine<00:06:29.040> room<00:06:29.160> dome

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
first galaxies of the engine room dome

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.080 
first galaxies of the engine room dome
so<00:06:30.710> um<00:06:31.710> yeah<00:06:32.310> that<00:06:32.490> goes<00:06:32.610> with<00:06:32.700> this<00:06:32.730> part
