child seats in the forward-facing
position<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> keep<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.020> mind<00:01:22.229> that

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
position you have to keep in mind that

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.230

the<00:01:22.470> Sonata<00:01:22.740> has<00:01:22.920> relatively<00:01:23.490> bucket<00:01:23.970> shaped

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the Sonata has relatively bucket shaped

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
rear bench seats and that really plays a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.200 
rear bench seats and that really plays a
role<00:01:26.400> when<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.610> take<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> look<00:01:27.000> at<00:01:27.060> this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
role when you take a look at this

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.520 
role when you take a look at this
outboard<00:01:27.540> sitting<00:01:27.900> position<00:01:28.290> right<00:01:28.500> here

towards the center meaning that this

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.920 
towards the center meaning that this

and that'd be the distance from the

and that'd be the distance from the
anchor<00:02:03.719> point<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.229> top<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> anchor

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
to the end of the buckle it means that

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.240 
to the end of the buckle it means that
this<00:02:06.869> child<00:02:07.079> seat<00:02:07.380> cannot<00:02:07.649> sit<00:02:07.890> quite<00:02:08.099> as

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
this child seat cannot sit quite as

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.219 
this child seat cannot sit quite as
firmly<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.910> car<00:02:09.119> as<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.720> could<00:02:09.899> if<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.080> had

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
firmly in the car as it could if it had

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.839 
firmly in the car as it could if it had
a<00:02:10.259> shorter<00:02:10.649> buckle<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.099> actually<00:02:11.459> think<00:02:11.700> this

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
a shorter buckle I actually think this

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.339 
a shorter buckle I actually think this
is<00:02:11.910> more<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.330> design<00:02:12.599> flaw<00:02:12.810> on<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.110> child

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
is more of a design flaw on the child

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.850 
is more of a design flaw on the child
seat<00:02:13.590> it's

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
seat it's

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.170 
seat it's
because<00:02:14.340> there<00:02:14.490> are<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.610> number<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:15.000> vehicles

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
because there are a number of vehicles

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.970 
because there are a number of vehicles
out<00:02:15.480> there<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:16.170> have<00:02:16.320> their<00:02:16.500> top<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:16.860> their

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
out there that have their top to their

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.040 
out there that have their top to their
acres<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.640> close<00:02:18.000> but<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.600> lot<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.840> child

acres this close but a lot of child
seats<00:02:19.320> out<00:02:19.470> there<00:02:19.530> don't<00:02:20.010> have<00:02:20.160> anchors<00:02:20.490> this

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
seats out there don't have anchors this

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.760 
seats out there don't have anchors this
long<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.750> important<00:02:22.200> because<00:02:22.290> try<00:02:22.680> as

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
long that is important because try as

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.440 
long that is important because try as

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
roller bag I was able to put three of

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.670 
roller bag I was able to put three of
these<00:03:54.060> across<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.750> back<00:03:54.930> although<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.530> looks

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
these across the back although it looks

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.110 
these across the back although it looks
like<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:55.950> could<00:03:56.070> fit<00:03:56.250> for<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.700> truck<00:03:56.880> gets<00:03:57.060> a

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
like you could fit for the truck gets a

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.250 
like you could fit for the truck gets a
little<00:03:57.239> bit<00:03:57.420> narrower<00:03:57.630> right<00:03:57.930> here<00:03:58.080> on<00:03:58.170> the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
little bit narrower right here on the

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.320 
little bit narrower right here on the
edges<00:03:58.590> we<00:03:59.040> also<00:03:59.190> have<00:03:59.459> these<00:03:59.640> release<00:03:59.970> levers

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
edges we also have these release levers

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.449 
edges we also have these release levers
for<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.720> rear<00:04:00.840> seatbacks<00:04:01.320> I<00:04:01.650> suspect<00:04:02.310> this

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
for the rear seatbacks I suspect this

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.890 
for the rear seatbacks I suspect this
trunk<00:04:02.670> will<00:04:02.760> be<00:04:02.850> very<00:04:03.060> accommodating<00:04:03.330> so<00:04:03.780> I've

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
trunk will be very accommodating so I've

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.300 
trunk will be very accommodating so I've
just<00:04:04.049> gone<00:04:04.200> ahead<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:04.620> stacked<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.190> two

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
just gone ahead and stacked the two

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.190 
just gone ahead and stacked the two
roller<00:04:05.519> bags<00:04:05.730> over<00:04:06.000> there<00:04:06.209> on<00:04:06.330> that<00:04:06.360> side<00:04:06.780> and

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
roller bags over there on that side and

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.630 
roller bags over there on that side and
let's<00:04:07.380> see<00:04:07.500> how<00:04:07.590> well<00:04:07.769> these<00:04:07.860> child<00:04:08.130> seats<00:04:08.400> fit

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
let's see how well these child seats fit

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.280 
let's see how well these child seats fit
with<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.269> first<00:04:09.480> child<00:04:09.780> seat<00:04:09.959> you'll<00:04:10.079> notice

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
we also have a very large opening so we

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.850 
we also have a very large opening so we
can<00:04:12.329> put<00:04:12.480> these<00:04:12.600> child<00:04:12.870> seats<00:04:13.079> in<00:04:13.260> sideways
