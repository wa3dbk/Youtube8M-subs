and rear sprocket also in the original
video<00:00:19.560> I've<00:00:19.650> neglected<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.789> mention<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
video I've neglected to mention that the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.210 
video I've neglected to mention that the
tyres<00:00:22.170> are<00:00:22.640> dual<00:00:23.640> compound<00:00:24.800> Diablo<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.920> course

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
tyres are dual compound Diablo of course

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.000 
tyres are dual compound Diablo of course
of<00:00:26.430> three<00:00:26.699> tires<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.570> I'm<00:00:28.260> very<00:00:28.410> happy<00:00:28.830> with

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
of three tires and I'm very happy with

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.450 
of three tires and I'm very happy with
these

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
these

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.139 
these
since<00:00:30.330> installing<00:00:30.990> them<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.380> bike<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:35.149> r1

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
since installing them on the bike the r1

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.950 
since installing them on the bike the r1
comes<00:00:36.480> from<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> factory<00:00:37.590> with<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.960> 19050

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
comes from the factory with a 19050

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.340 
comes from the factory with a 19050
sized<00:00:40.410> tire<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.969> back<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.200> little

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
sized tire in the back and it's a little

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.540 
sized tire in the back and it's a little
bit<00:00:43.500> more<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> flat<00:00:44.160> profile<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> 190

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
bit more of a flat profile this is a 190

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.490 
bit more of a flat profile this is a 190
55<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.510> has<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.989> don't<00:00:49.170> know<00:00:49.230> if<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.379> can

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
55 so it has I don't know if you can

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.229 
55 so it has I don't know if you can
really<00:00:49.680> make<00:00:49.950> out<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> has<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:51.059> bit

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
really make out but it has a little bit

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.470 
really make out but it has a little bit
more<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.649> radius<00:00:53.129> around<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
more of a radius around it and it's a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.000 
more of a radius around it and it's a
slightly<00:00:54.870> taller<00:00:55.140> tire<00:00:55.879> so<00:00:57.079> it<00:00:58.079> allows<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
slightly taller tire so it allows the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.819 
slightly taller tire so it allows the
bike<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.399> corner<00:00:59.879> much<00:01:00.449> nicer<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.500> fact<00:01:01.649> when<00:01:01.800> I

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
bike to corner much nicer in fact when I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.329 
bike to corner much nicer in fact when I
put<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.820> tire<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.239> at<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> back<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.159> has<00:01:05.309> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
put the tire on at the back and it has a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.859 
put the tire on at the back and it has a
front<00:01:05.610> tire<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:05.909> well<00:01:05.939> but<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.330> course<00:01:06.510> it's

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
front tire as well but of course it's

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.940 
front tire as well but of course it's
not<00:01:07.710> dual<00:01:07.979> compound<00:01:09.140> but<00:01:10.140> when<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.320> when<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.710> put

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
not dual compound but when I when I put

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.640 
not dual compound but when I when I put
this<00:01:11.130> rear<00:01:11.310> tire<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:12.600> do<00:01:12.990> notice<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
this rear tire on you do notice that the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.200 
this rear tire on you do notice that the
bike<00:01:13.860> stands<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.490> little<00:01:14.670> higher<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
bike stands up a little higher in the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.050 
bike stands up a little higher in the
back<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:16.130> for<00:01:17.130> example<00:01:17.340> when<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.670> put<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
back and for example when you put the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.929 
back and for example when you put the
the<00:01:18.270> kickstand<00:01:18.960> down<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.340> notice<00:01:20.790> right

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the kickstand down it you notice right

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.999 
the kickstand down it you notice right
away<00:01:21.180> after<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:22.049> install<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> tire<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
away after you install the tire that the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.410 
away after you install the tire that the
bike<00:01:23.189> leans<00:01:23.400> over<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.820> little<00:01:23.970> bit<00:01:24.119> more<00:01:24.350> but

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
bike leans over a little bit more but

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.800 
bike leans over a little bit more but
anyways<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:29.210> profile<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.600> tire

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
anyways it the the profile on this tire

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.749 
anyways it the the profile on this tire
is<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.259> nice<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:32.070> stock<00:01:32.340> tire<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.700> a

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
is really nice the stock tire is a

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.280 
is really nice the stock tire is a
little<00:01:32.970> bit<00:01:33.060> more<00:01:33.240> flat<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.930> when<00:01:34.170> you

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
little bit more flat so when you

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.990 
little bit more flat so when you
transition<00:01:34.829> from<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.159> flat<00:01:35.369> part<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
transition from the flat part to the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.190 
transition from the flat part to the
corner<00:01:36.420> when<00:01:36.659> you're<00:01:36.780> going<00:01:36.930> through<00:01:37.110> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
corner when you're going through a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.100 
corner when you're going through a
corner<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.759> little<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.659> kind<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
corner it's a little you kind of get a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.039 
corner it's a little you kind of get a
weird<00:01:40.409> tilt<00:01:41.310> feeling<00:01:41.790> almost<00:01:42.509> like<00:01:42.780> it's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
weird tilt feeling almost like it's

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.950 
weird tilt feeling almost like it's
steering<00:01:43.530> into<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.950> corner<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.780> on<00:01:45.780> this

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
steering into the corner and on this

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.170 
steering into the corner and on this
tire<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.409> much<00:01:46.740> smoother<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.579> I'm<00:01:47.700> very<00:01:47.880> very

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
tire it's much smoother so I'm very very

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.359 
tire it's much smoother so I'm very very
happy<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.229> debated<00:01:49.409> for<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.890> while<00:01:50.100> as

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
happy with it I debated for a while as

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.870 
happy with it I debated for a while as
to<00:01:50.490> whether<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.729> should<00:01:50.850> go<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> 190<00:01:51.930> 55

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
to whether I should go with the 190 55

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.730 
to whether I should go with the 190 55
some<00:01:53.880> people<00:01:54.180> say<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> internet<00:01:55.500> that

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
some people say on the internet that

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.969 
some people say on the internet that
they<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.520> others<00:01:56.729> don't<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:58.020> ended<00:01:58.890> up

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
they like it and others don't I ended up

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.010 
they like it and others don't I ended up
going<00:01:59.159> ahead<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.549> do<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.880> I'm<00:01:59.969> very<00:02:00.750> happy

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
going ahead and do it and I'm very happy

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.289 
going ahead and do it and I'm very happy
that<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.380> did<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:02.909> makes<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
that I did because it it just makes the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.120 
that I did because it it just makes the

is Talde there are four SRS which I

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.710 
is Talde there are four SRS which I
believe<00:02:27.280> stands<00:02:27.550> for<00:02:27.780> self-regulating<00:02:28.780> seals

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
believe stands for self-regulating seals

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.000 
believe stands for self-regulating seals

provided and this is their 45 tooth rear
sprocket<00:02:46.390> they<00:02:47.110> really<00:02:47.380> only<00:02:47.530> have<00:02:47.740> one

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
sprocket they really only have one

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.710 
sprocket they really only have one
sprocket<00:02:48.520> available<00:02:48.940> for<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.209> road<00:02:49.420> bikes

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
sprocket available for the road bikes

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.030 
sprocket available for the road bikes
and<00:02:50.200> this<00:02:50.950> is<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.209> hard<00:02:52.450> anodized

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
and this is it it's a hard anodized

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.970 
and this is it it's a hard anodized
alloy<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.370> course<00:02:55.030> it's<00:02:55.209> five<00:02:55.420> thirty<00:02:55.450> as<00:02:56.230> is

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
alloy of course it's five thirty as is

the<00:02:57.190> chain<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.959> chain<00:02:59.020> was<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.530> little<00:02:59.950> tricky

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
the chain this chain was a little tricky

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.570 
the chain this chain was a little tricky
to<00:03:00.370> install<00:03:00.520> because<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.300> uses<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.750> solid<00:03:02.580> pin

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
to install because it uses a solid pin

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.030 
to install because it uses a solid pin
for<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.030> rivet<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:05.290> have<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.560> do<00:03:05.770> what's

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
for the rivet and you have to do what's

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.190 
for the rivet and you have to do what's
called<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.310> quad<00:03:06.580> stake<00:03:07.060> which<00:03:07.660> instead<00:03:08.140> of

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
called a quad stake which instead of

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.500 
called a quad stake which instead of
flaring<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.860> pin<00:03:09.130> out<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:10.570> have<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:11.170> actually

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
flaring the pin out you have to actually

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.250 
flaring the pin out you have to actually
drive<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:14.490> kind<00:03:15.490> of<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.670> open<00:03:16.030> end<00:03:16.240> of<00:03:16.450> the

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
drive the kind of the open end of the

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.180 
drive the kind of the open end of the
rivet<00:03:20.260> here<00:03:20.850> into<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:21.880> little<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.860> guess<00:03:23.860> you'd

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
rivet here into a little I guess you'd

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.130 
rivet here into a little I guess you'd
say<00:03:24.310> like<00:03:24.610> a<00:03:24.640> four-sided<00:03:25.330> pyramid<00:03:25.570> kind<00:03:26.050> of

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
say like a four-sided pyramid kind of

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.300 
say like a four-sided pyramid kind of
anvil<00:03:26.530> sort<00:03:26.769> of<00:03:26.920> thing

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
anvil sort of thing

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.330 
anvil sort of thing
anyways<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:27.910> used<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.560> motion<00:03:29.560> Pro<00:03:29.830> jumbo

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
anyways I used the motion Pro jumbo

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.880 
anyways I used the motion Pro jumbo
chain<00:03:30.640> tool<00:03:30.970> with<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.720> quad<00:03:31.930> stake<00:03:32.290> adapter

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
chain tool with the quad stake adapter

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.800 
chain tool with the quad stake adapter
and<00:03:33.220> was<00:03:33.580> able<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:33.940> accomplish<00:03:34.239> that<00:03:34.570> no

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
and was able to accomplish that no

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.220 
and was able to accomplish that no
problem<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:36.519> anyways<00:03:36.820> very<00:03:37.660> happy<00:03:37.959> with<00:03:38.080> the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
problem so anyways very happy with the

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.850 
problem so anyways very happy with the
chain<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:38.500> like<00:03:38.860> how<00:03:39.010> it<00:03:39.160> looks<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:41.410> goal

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
chain I like how it looks the the goal

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.759 
chain I like how it looks the the goal
matches<00:03:42.489> nicely<00:03:42.670> with<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.420> software<00:03:44.260> Racing

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
matches nicely with the software Racing

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.680 
matches nicely with the software Racing
implement<00:03:45.630> as<00:03:46.630> well<00:03:46.930> as<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:48.299> Scots<00:03:49.299> damper

you put an end wrench or a socket it
catches<00:04:25.000> all<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.270> little<00:04:25.479> points

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
catches all the little points

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.710 
catches all the little points
so<00:04:26.460> that's<00:04:26.670> pretty<00:04:26.880> nice<00:04:27.090> since<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.450> didn't

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
so that's pretty nice since I didn't

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.500 
so that's pretty nice since I didn't
switch<00:04:27.870> over<00:04:28.170> to<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:29.310> know<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.550> 520<00:04:30.270> size

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
switch over to the you know the 520 size

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.500 
switch over to the you know the 520 size
chain<00:04:30.930> I<00:04:31.290> wanted<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.190> do<00:04:32.700> something<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.270> try<00:04:33.420> to

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
chain I wanted to do something to try to

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.230 
chain I wanted to do something to try to
offset<00:04:33.690> a<00:04:33.930> little<00:04:34.260> bit<00:04:34.410> of<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.620> weight<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:35.240> and

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
offset a little bit of the weight so and

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.060 
offset a little bit of the weight so and
then<00:04:36.420> of<00:04:36.750> course<00:04:36.780> you<00:04:37.200> know<00:04:37.290> I<00:04:37.320> I<00:04:37.650> would<00:04:37.950> have

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
then of course you know I I would have

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.710 
then of course you know I I would have
to<00:04:38.190> say<00:04:38.610> that<00:04:38.640> I<00:04:38.850> did<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.150> as<00:04:39.240> much<00:04:39.480> for

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
to say that I did it as much for

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.360 
to say that I did it as much for
aesthetics<00:04:40.230> as<00:04:40.380> weight<00:04:40.560> savings<00:04:41.010> anything

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
aesthetics as weight savings anything

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.550 
aesthetics as weight savings anything
because<00:04:41.580> it<00:04:41.670> really<00:04:42.090> looks<00:04:42.300> looks<00:04:42.900> nice<00:04:43.140> and

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
because it really looks looks nice and

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.290 
because it really looks looks nice and
you<00:04:43.950> can<00:04:44.130> kind<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.430> see<00:04:44.640> I<00:04:44.670> did<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.060> same<00:04:45.240> thing

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
you can kind of see I did the same thing

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.450 
you can kind of see I did the same thing
back<00:04:45.750> here<00:04:46.080> if<00:04:46.500> you<00:04:46.620> can<00:04:46.770> catch<00:04:46.980> it<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:47.310> this

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
back here if you can catch it and this

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.990 
back here if you can catch it and this
like<00:04:47.700> but<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:48.600> can<00:04:48.750> see<00:04:48.960> on<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:49.950> boat<00:04:50.760> that

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
like but you can see on the boat that

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.750 
like but you can see on the boat that
hold<00:04:51.270> on<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.930> pegs<00:04:52.650> there<00:04:52.980> I've<00:04:53.490> got<00:04:53.550> a

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
hold on the pegs there I've got a

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.620 
hold on the pegs there I've got a
titanium<00:04:55.310> by<00:04:56.310> hex<00:04:56.840> nut<00:04:59.180> so<00:05:00.180> anyways<00:05:00.480> that's

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
titanium by hex nut so anyways that's

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.950 
titanium by hex nut so anyways that's
about<00:05:01.380> it<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:03.090> bike<00:05:03.240> rides<00:05:03.510> a<00:05:03.600> little<00:05:03.750> bit

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
about it the the bike rides a little bit

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.080 
about it the the bike rides a little bit
smoother<00:05:04.440> now<00:05:05.040> that<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.370> chain<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:05.940> new

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
smoother now that the chain the new

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.780 
smoother now that the chain the new
chain<00:05:06.360> is<00:05:06.570> on<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:07.140> factory<00:05:07.860> one<00:05:08.040> had<00:05:08.220> about<00:05:08.490> I

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
chain is on the factory one had about I

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.780 
chain is on the factory one had about I
think<00:05:09.480> it<00:05:09.540> was<00:05:09.660> about<00:05:09.980> 9,000<00:05:10.980> miles<00:05:11.250> on<00:05:11.520> it<00:05:11.550> or

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
think it was about 9,000 miles on it or

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.060 
think it was about 9,000 miles on it or
so<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:12.900> had<00:05:13.050> stretched<00:05:13.440> beyond<00:05:13.860> the

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
so and it had stretched beyond the

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.790 
so and it had stretched beyond the
limits<00:05:14.490> that<00:05:15.450> they<00:05:15.660> prescribed<00:05:16.140> in<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.320> shop

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
limits that they prescribed in the shop

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.800 
limits that they prescribed in the shop
manual<00:05:17.070> side<00:05:17.370> figure<00:05:17.640> go<00:05:17.850> ahead<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.120> change

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
manual side figure go ahead and change

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.070 
manual side figure go ahead and change
it<00:05:18.900> over<00:05:19.260> so<00:05:20.160> that's<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.180> latest<00:05:21.330> on<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.840> bike

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
it over so that's the latest on the bike

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.250 
it over so that's the latest on the bike
and<00:05:23.000> like<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.090> say<00:05:24.330> it's<00:05:26.180> it's<00:05:27.180> it<00:05:27.750> is<00:05:27.900> a<00:05:27.930> gold

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
and like I say it's it's it is a gold

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.380 
and like I say it's it's it is a gold
chain<00:05:28.560> a<00:05:28.800> reason<00:05:29.250> I<00:05:29.310> wanted<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:29.670> black<00:05:29.820> one<00:05:30.180> but

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
chain a reason I wanted a black one but

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.300 
chain a reason I wanted a black one but
but<00:05:30.870> after<00:05:31.320> having<00:05:31.620> it<00:05:31.680> on<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:31.890> bike<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.250> do

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
but after having it on the bike I do

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.090 
but after having it on the bike I do
like<00:05:32.640> how<00:05:33.060> it<00:05:33.240> looks<00:05:33.510> so<00:05:33.810> pretty<00:05:34.590> happy<00:05:34.980> with

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
like how it looks so pretty happy with

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.900 
like how it looks so pretty happy with
that<00:05:35.310> and<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:36.210> rear<00:05:36.420> sprocket<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.920> anodizing

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
that and the rear sprocket the anodizing

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.830 
that and the rear sprocket the anodizing
color<00:05:39.480> kind<00:05:39.750> of<00:05:39.840> complements<00:05:40.650> it<00:05:40.770> nicely<00:05:40.980> so

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
color kind of complements it nicely so

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.050 
color kind of complements it nicely so
okay<00:05:42.840> that's<00:05:43.080> that's<00:05:43.620> about<00:05:43.950> it<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.370> oh<00:05:44.760> the

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
okay that's that's about it the oh the

only other thing that's a new on the

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.480 
only other thing that's a new on the
bike<00:05:47.820> nothing<00:05:48.720> too<00:05:48.900> major<00:05:49.350> but<00:05:49.560> I<00:05:49.920> did<00:05:50.250> put<00:05:50.460> a

bike nothing too major but I did put a

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.120 
bike nothing too major but I did put a
little<00:05:50.640> titanium<00:05:51.150> I<00:05:51.900> guess<00:05:52.170> a<00:05:52.200> grub<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:52.830> Alan

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
little titanium I guess a grub and Alan

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.040 
little titanium I guess a grub and Alan
had<00:05:53.340> grub<00:05:53.670> screw<00:05:53.970> here<00:05:54.210> to<00:05:54.330> hold<00:05:54.510> on<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:54.810> cross

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
had grub screw here to hold on the cross

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.350 
had grub screw here to hold on the cross
pin<00:05:55.410> that<00:05:55.650> with<00:05:56.280> the<00:05:56.370> brake<00:05:56.580> shoes<00:05:56.850> right<00:05:57.090> on

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
pin that with the brake shoes right on

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.480 
pin that with the brake shoes right on
and<00:05:57.780> that<00:05:58.140> just<00:05:58.350> ties<00:05:58.560> in<00:05:58.830> a<00:05:58.920> little<00:05:59.040> bit<00:05:59.310> with

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
and that just ties in a little bit with

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.540 
and that just ties in a little bit with
the<00:05:59.900> titanium<00:06:00.900> axle<00:06:01.470> nut<00:06:01.680> and<00:06:01.800> the<00:06:01.860> titanium

the titanium axle nut and the titanium
spools<00:06:03.590> and<00:06:04.590> I<00:06:05.130> think<00:06:05.610> I<00:06:05.640> was<00:06:05.700> only<00:06:05.850> like<00:06:06.030> three

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
spools and I think I was only like three

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.750 
spools and I think I was only like three
bucks<00:06:06.510> I<00:06:06.750> I<00:06:06.930> tacked<00:06:07.320> it<00:06:07.470> onto<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:07.890> order<00:06:08.160> okay

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
bucks I I tacked it onto the order okay

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.450 
bucks I I tacked it onto the order okay
so<00:06:08.970> that's<00:06:09.300> the<00:06:09.420> latest<00:06:09.540> with<00:06:09.810> the<00:06:09.840> bike<00:06:10.020> and

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
so that's the latest with the bike and
