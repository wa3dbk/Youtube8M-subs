00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.520
 he has ball feel 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.660
 he dominates to see reason 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.590
 and shepherd sheep without nibbling 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.590
 this is of course 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.660
 despite their quasi-paramilitary 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.150
 so tender so loving it gives 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.160
 so much if you decide to be rich 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.840
 I have my head on mine twice a day 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.890
 chance and we are stroked 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.770
 the board and a bit 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.750
 Stress off and be fun if you like that 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.090
 really requires a dog and also 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.590
 the codes are satisfied and busy 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.320
 have no need the floor too 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.120
 point 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.790
 but especially the animals have it 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.170
 on it at the shepherd dog club in 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.320
 Lower Saxony melle you notice that 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.320
 immediately 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.170
 breeding and tradition are the secret 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.600
 just be father roland of grafrath anno 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.250
 those days 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.080
 I'm heavy on every dog that falls 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.780
 where you were bred from 1899 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.580
 retroactively follow historically and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.080
 determine 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.460
 and we have many judges in the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.420
 breeding and performance and we 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.770
 are already in the situation exactly the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.770
 also to determine differences 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.280
 after all , they are a German clock 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.380
 cultural property such as currywurst and 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.200
 gnomes slanting back tip 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.440
 ears remember his race all the 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.030
 competitions are strictly checked 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.270
 somehow funny names also belong 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.270
 to 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.750
 1061 conversion of the heer owe 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.409
 fearlessly they feel through avalanches 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.000
 to lead a materially rich and most 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.380
 what kind of people do they save then 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.450
 later quasi provided 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.430
 he is actually looking for his one but 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.549
 the ball is always in contact 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.560
 with the human 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.700
 then this is the pants practically without 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.860
 Of course, there is no human being either 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.000
 belchen 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.069
 Of course you can also order differently 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.580
 He knows that the noise and noise are on 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.520
 use and pure 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.079
 chamberl brother out 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.399
 Of course, something like that is not trained 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.399
 only on the living object 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.909
 good at 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.480
 We have a ritual where the dogs 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.340
 to get prepared 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.019
 in the moment without kentucky's ear 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.780
 is pulled further under his use 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.489
 is and has from now on the same 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.920
 because of such talents is worldwide 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.920
 whether in algeria or england 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.769
 Here dog handlers attacked German 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.140
 kommandos times the german shepherd 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.140
 apparently only German commands understands 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.370
 Six Englishmen to learn German 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.090
 maybe force his biggest 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.410
 cultural performance really can say 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.200
 this is a success made in 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.680
 germany applies in all continents 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.310
 German shepherd dogs are bred very much 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.660
 sure that in the year worldwide scarce 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.049
 950,000 dogs bred in the countries 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.519
 America and Asia are very popular and now 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.590
 just to compare this fusel 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:08.920
 is a french shepherd notes 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.020
 you're kind of idiosyncratic somehow 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.500
 may also be more sensitive to 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.500
 the Frenchman 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.030
 but otherwise he has no steps 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.130
 against a german account the to 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.310
 triple reason for really everybody 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.310
 opportunity
