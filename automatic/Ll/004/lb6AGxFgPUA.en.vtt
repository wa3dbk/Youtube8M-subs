00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
know what go to all that and then I

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.130 
know what go to all that and then I
found<00:05:38.930> this<00:05:39.050> at<00:05:39.260> kroger<00:05:39.710> it's<00:05:40.270> cat<00:05:41.270> toys<00:05:41.600> and

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
like on Zadaa because it's freezing so I

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.880 
like on Zadaa because it's freezing so I
was<00:06:05.510> just<00:06:05.630> so<00:06:05.840> excited<00:06:05.870> to<00:06:06.290> find<00:06:06.530> all<00:06:06.680> of<00:06:06.710> these

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
was just so excited to find all of these

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.300 
was just so excited to find all of these
all<00:06:07.250> these<00:06:07.820> are<00:06:07.970> so<00:06:08.150> cool<00:06:08.680> so<00:06:09.680> our<00:06:10.010> probably

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
all these are so cool so our probably

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.710 
all these are so cool so our probably
will<00:06:10.490> definitely<00:06:10.850> keep<00:06:10.970> a<00:06:11.030> white<00:06:11.330> one<00:06:11.510> because

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
will definitely keep a white one because

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.630 
will definitely keep a white one because
there's<00:06:12.650> some<00:06:12.770> things<00:06:12.950> that<00:06:13.010> the<00:06:13.190> brown<00:06:13.400> ones

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
there's some things that the brown ones

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.220 
there's some things that the brown ones
won't<00:06:13.850> match<00:06:14.000> at<00:06:14.210> the<00:06:14.330> white<00:06:14.450> ones<00:06:14.690> well<00:06:14.930> so

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
won't match at the white ones well so

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.010 
won't match at the white ones well so
then<00:06:15.380> I'll<00:06:15.500> have<00:06:15.710> to<00:06:16.210> boy<00:06:17.210> ones<00:06:17.419> and<00:06:17.720> a<00:06:17.780> girl
