it<00:01:04.320> salt<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.860> think<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> reason<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.519> because

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it salt I think the reason is because

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.130 
it salt I think the reason is because
there's<00:01:05.940> a<00:01:06.000> lot<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.240> salt<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> celery

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
there's a lot of salt in the celery

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.160 
there's a lot of salt in the celery
while<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.980> do<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> slice<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.640> celery<00:01:09.300> leave<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.110> on

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
while I do a slice of celery leave it on

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.840 
while I do a slice of celery leave it on
my<00:01:10.290> dehydrator<00:01:10.560> overnight<00:01:11.310> till<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:11.670> dry

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
my dehydrator overnight till it's dry

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.420 
my dehydrator overnight till it's dry
and<00:01:12.330> then<00:01:12.690> you<00:01:12.780> grind<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.260> finely<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.950> like<00:01:14.400> a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
and then you grind it finely in like a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.050 
and then you grind it finely in like a
coffee<00:01:14.730> grinder<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:17.040> top<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.550> that<00:01:17.730> I'm

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
coffee grinder so on top of that I'm

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.750 
coffee grinder so on top of that I'm
adding<00:01:18.720> fresh<00:01:19.320> celery<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.520> gives<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
adding fresh celery because it gives a
