just kind of shock

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.770 
just kind of shock
that<00:04:22.190> was<00:04:22.310> like<00:04:22.520> when<00:04:23.420> I<00:04:23.450> looked<00:04:23.630> in<00:04:23.720> the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
that was like when I looked in the

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.060 
that was like when I looked in the
mirror<00:04:23.840> I<00:04:24.050> was<00:04:24.140> like<00:04:24.320> what<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.560> heck<00:04:24.770> I<00:04:24.950> was

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
mirror I was like what the heck I was

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.160 
mirror I was like what the heck I was
just<00:04:25.280> not<00:04:25.700> used<00:04:25.880> to<00:04:25.970> it<00:04:26.060> so<00:04:26.450> overall<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:26.870> don't

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
just not used to it so overall I don't

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.510 
just not used to it so overall I don't
really<00:04:27.290> recommend<00:04:27.620> getting<00:04:27.860> it<00:04:28.130> just<00:04:28.160> because

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
really recommend getting it just because

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.340 
really recommend getting it just because
it's<00:04:28.670> really<00:04:28.790> sheer<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.600> it's<00:04:29.870> not<00:04:30.080> a<00:04:30.110> really

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
it's really sheer and it's not a really

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.460 
it's really sheer and it's not a really
good<00:04:30.500> color<00:04:30.680> payoff<00:04:30.980> and<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:32.230> guess<00:04:33.230> it's<00:04:33.410> not

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
good color payoff and I guess it's not

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.590 
good color payoff and I guess it's not
sticky<00:04:33.950> but<00:04:33.980> I<00:04:34.370> don't<00:04:34.550> know<00:04:34.610> it's<00:04:34.940> it's<00:04:35.210> not<00:04:35.420> as

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600

so it's not too bad and then at the top
it's<00:06:16.040> also<00:06:16.250> and<00:06:16.670> so<00:06:16.820> it<00:06:16.910> looks<00:06:17.090> like<00:06:17.240> it'd<00:06:17.360> be<00:06:17.450> a

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
it's also and so it looks like it'd be a

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.200 
it's also and so it looks like it'd be a
tube<00:06:17.720> top<00:06:17.930> tube<00:06:18.440> top<00:06:18.830> dress<00:06:18.860> but<00:06:19.760> then<00:06:19.940> it<00:06:20.060> has
