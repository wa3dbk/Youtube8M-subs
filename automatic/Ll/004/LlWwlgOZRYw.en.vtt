00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
and we know that that's not been

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.620 
and we know that that's not been
traditionally<00:01:21.520> Hawaii<00:01:21.880> strength<00:01:22.299> but<00:01:22.539> they

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
traditionally Hawaii strength but they

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.849 
traditionally Hawaii strength but they
made<00:01:22.810> him<00:01:22.929> today<00:01:23.079> just<00:01:23.380> like<00:01:23.499> they<00:01:23.590> made<00:01:23.740> him

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
made him today just like they made him

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:25.139 
made him today just like they made him
at<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.009> start<00:01:24.249> of<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.399> Davis<00:01:24.700> game<00:01:24.939> and<00:01:25.119> I

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
at the start of the Davis game and I

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.849 
at the start of the Davis game and I
think<00:01:25.359> at<00:01:25.450> one<00:01:25.479> of<00:01:25.659> the<00:01:25.719> timeouts<00:01:26.109> I<00:01:26.289> reminded

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
think at one of the timeouts I reminded

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:28.379 
think at one of the timeouts I reminded
our<00:01:27.009> guys<00:01:27.159> they<00:01:27.399> made<00:01:27.549> a<00:01:27.579> bunch<00:01:27.819> early<00:01:28.149> against

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:28.389 
our guys they made a bunch early against

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:30.929 
our guys they made a bunch early against
Davis<00:01:28.779> and<00:01:29.529> cooled<00:01:29.829> off<00:01:30.039> after<00:01:30.520> that<00:01:30.669> and<00:01:30.880> I

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
Davis and cooled off after that and I

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.469 
Davis and cooled off after that and I
was<00:01:31.090> confident<00:01:31.539> that<00:01:31.659> if<00:01:32.319> we<00:01:33.299> erased<00:01:34.299> our

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
was confident that if we erased our

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.120 
was confident that if we erased our
defensive<00:01:34.990> level<00:01:35.259> just<00:01:35.409> a<00:01:35.560> little<00:01:35.799> bit<00:01:35.950> we

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
defensive level just a little bit we

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.499 
defensive level just a little bit we
would<00:01:36.279> be<00:01:36.399> able<00:01:36.459> to<00:01:36.609> make<00:01:36.759> them<00:01:36.969> miss<00:01:37.209> some<00:01:37.419> of

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
would be able to make them miss some of

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.019 
would be able to make them miss some of
the<00:01:37.599> same<00:01:37.869> shots<00:01:38.169> they<00:01:38.349> had<00:01:38.469> made<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.880> I

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:40.029 
the same shots they had made and I

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:41.190 
the same shots they had made and I
thought<00:01:40.179> we<00:01:40.329> could<00:01:40.359> grind<00:01:40.630> them<00:01:40.840> down<00:01:41.020> with
