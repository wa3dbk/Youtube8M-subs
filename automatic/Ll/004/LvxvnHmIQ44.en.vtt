couple<00:01:36.740> chapters<00:01:37.070> back<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:38.630> right<00:01:38.930> there

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
couple chapters back that right there

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.050 
couple chapters back that right there
didn't<00:01:39.920> make<00:01:40.009> any<00:01:40.219> sense<00:01:40.250> at<00:01:40.609> all<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:40.969> we

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
didn't make any sense at all and we

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.609 
didn't make any sense at all and we
really<00:01:41.299> set<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.509> new<00:01:41.750> world<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.049> how<00:01:42.409> could

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
really set a new world that how could

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.349 
really set a new world that how could
you<00:01:42.710> have<00:01:42.859> an<00:01:43.130> island<00:01:43.520> basically<00:01:43.969> half<00:01:44.149> of<00:01:44.299> the

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
you have an island basically half of the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.330 
you have an island basically half of the
being<00:01:44.570> on<00:01:44.719> fire<00:01:44.960> haven't<00:01:45.859> been<00:01:46.070> completely

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
being on fire haven't been completely

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.639 
being on fire haven't been completely
covered<00:01:46.909> in<00:01:46.969> ice<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.810> it's<00:01:48.079> like<00:01:48.259> neither<00:01:48.500> one

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
covered in ice and it's like neither one

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.950 
covered in ice and it's like neither one
is<00:01:48.859> really<00:01:49.189> affecting<00:01:49.670> each<00:01:49.789> other<00:01:49.969> so<00:01:50.299> that's

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
is really affecting each other so that's

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.480 
is really affecting each other so that's

think<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.510> may<00:02:29.690> be<00:02:29.720> buggy<00:02:30.050> a<00:02:30.170> combined<00:02:31.100> uh

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
think that may be buggy a combined uh

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.320

something<00:02:31.580> because<00:02:31.819> we<00:02:31.910> heard<00:02:32.060> some<00:02:32.239> talk

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
something because we heard some talk

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.100

about of Shikibu con I don't think that

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.050 
about of Shikibu con I don't think that
buggy<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.319> involved<00:02:36.920> in<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.400> reason<00:02:37.819> for

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
buggy is involved in this and reason for

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.840 
buggy is involved in this and reason for
that<00:02:38.209> is<00:02:38.420> because<00:02:38.450> if<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:40.069> I'm<00:02:40.250> like<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.400> buggy

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
that is because if but I'm like a buggy

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.760 
that is because if but I'm like a buggy
would<00:02:41.000> have<00:02:41.090> had<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.510> have<00:02:41.540> had<00:02:42.020> this<00:02:42.500> ability

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
would have had to have had this ability

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.250 
would have had to have had this ability
to<00:02:43.010> be<00:02:43.190> able<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.550> separate<00:02:43.970> others<00:02:44.360> like<00:02:44.989> four

hanging<00:03:10.280> around<00:03:10.489> buggy<00:03:10.940> with<00:03:11.269> those<00:03:11.690> types<00:03:12.050> of

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
hanging around buggy with those types of

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.530 
hanging around buggy with those types of
suits<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.489> know<00:03:13.610> anything<00:03:14.030> like<00:03:14.239> dressed

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540

up in that kind of those kind of clothes

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.920

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
or anything like that so I don't really

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.039 
or anything like that so I don't really
think<00:03:18.049> buggy<00:03:18.920> is<00:03:19.130> involved<00:03:19.820> with<00:03:20.060> punk<00:03:20.840> hazard

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
think buggy is involved with punk hazard

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.080 
think buggy is involved with punk hazard
and<00:03:21.380> any<00:03:21.530> sort<00:03:21.799> of<00:03:21.890> what<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:22.280> think<00:03:22.790> what<00:03:22.970> was

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
and any sort of what I think what was

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.910 
and any sort of what I think what was
doing<00:03:23.360> this<00:03:23.510> may<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:24.019> similar<00:03:24.440> abilities

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
doing this may have similar abilities

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.090 
doing this may have similar abilities
and<00:03:25.130> obviously<00:03:26.000> it's<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.780> person<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:27.620> those

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
and obviously it's the person that those

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.870 
and obviously it's the person that those
guys<00:03:28.579> in<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.140> mass<00:03:30.140> like<00:03:30.410> another<00:03:30.880> little

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
guys in the mass like another little

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.210 
guys in the mass like another little
getup<00:03:32.440> obviously<00:03:33.440> it's<00:03:33.650> their<00:03:33.829> master

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
getup obviously it's their master

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.560 
getup obviously it's their master
because<00:03:34.430> they<00:03:34.579> didn't<00:03:34.850> refer<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.239> let's<00:03:35.390> take

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
because they didn't refer to let's take

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.300 
because they didn't refer to let's take
them<00:03:35.690> back<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.870> master<00:03:36.230> after<00:03:36.590> they<00:03:36.709> kidnapped

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.520 
we heard the trouble of having a master
so<00:03:43.489> I<00:03:43.700> think<00:03:44.000> it's<00:03:44.329> whoever<00:03:44.720> is<00:03:45.019> in<00:03:45.200> charge<00:03:45.230> of

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
so I think it's whoever is in charge of

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.110 
so I think it's whoever is in charge of
that<00:03:45.680> whole<00:03:45.739> island<00:03:46.280> obviously<00:03:46.820> they're<00:03:46.970> the

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
that whole island obviously they're the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.569 
that whole island obviously they're the
ones<00:03:47.269> we<00:03:47.450> doing<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.950> seeing<00:03:48.950> I'm<00:03:49.130> i<00:03:49.250> don't<00:03:49.519> know

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
ones we doing it seeing I'm i don't know

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.550 
ones we doing it seeing I'm i don't know
maybe<00:03:49.760> some<00:03:50.000> kind<00:03:50.180> of<00:03:50.239> weird<00:03:50.560> experimentation

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
maybe some kind of weird experimentation

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.710 
maybe some kind of weird experimentation
going<00:03:51.590> on<00:03:51.890> in<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.130> island<00:03:52.579> since<00:03:52.820> everybody

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
going on in that island since everybody

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.050 
going on in that island since everybody
seems<00:03:54.079> to<00:03:54.200> be<00:03:54.320> looking<00:03:55.070> really<00:03:55.459> crazy<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:55.970> we

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
seems to be looking really crazy that we

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.550 
seems to be looking really crazy that we
see<00:03:56.269> Justin<00:03:56.870> at<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.079> end<00:03:57.200> of<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.350> chapter

see Justin at the end of the chapter
some<00:03:58.310> giant<00:03:58.760> kids<00:03:59.060> so<00:03:59.930> I<00:03:59.959> don't<00:04:00.200> nobody<00:04:00.380> else

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
some giant kids so I don't nobody else

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.300 
some giant kids so I don't nobody else
with<00:04:00.769> just<00:04:00.920> baby<00:04:01.160> Giants<00:04:01.880> or<00:04:02.859> they're<00:04:03.859> like

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
with just baby Giants or they're like

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.750 
with just baby Giants or they're like
that<00:04:04.549> for<00:04:04.790> some<00:04:05.060> sort<00:04:05.329> of<00:04:05.450> special<00:04:05.720> reason

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
that for some sort of special reason

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.650 
that for some sort of special reason
honestly<00:04:07.760> for<00:04:08.030> what<00:04:08.150> I<00:04:08.180> think<00:04:08.239> is<00:04:08.450> going<00:04:08.510> to

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
honestly for what I think is going to

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.110 
honestly for what I think is going to
happen<00:04:08.690> next<00:04:09.019> chapter<00:04:09.500> though<00:04:09.650> I<00:04:10.250> basically

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
happen next chapter though I basically

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.819 
happen next chapter though I basically
think<00:04:11.540> that<00:04:11.840> we're<00:04:12.140> probably<00:04:12.410> just<00:04:12.560> going<00:04:12.680> to

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
think that we're probably just going to

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.180 
think that we're probably just going to
see<00:04:13.280> more<00:04:13.579> man

the<00:04:14.340> island<00:04:14.670> for<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.850> most<00:04:15.030> I<00:04:15.240> don't<00:04:15.420> really

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
the island for the most I don't really

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.940 
the island for the most I don't really
think<00:04:15.660> there's<00:04:16.290> going<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.620> be<00:04:16.650> anything

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
think there's going to be anything

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.039 
think there's going to be anything
really<00:04:17.250> groundbreaking<00:04:18.120> as<00:04:18.540> far<00:04:18.750> as<00:04:18.870> we're

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
really groundbreaking as far as we're

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.690 
really groundbreaking as far as we're
finding<00:04:19.380> out<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.560> bunch<00:04:19.890> of<00:04:20.040> new<00:04:20.160> stuff<00:04:20.190> i<00:04:20.519> don't

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
finding out a bunch of new stuff i don't

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.720 
finding out a bunch of new stuff i don't
think<00:04:20.940> that<00:04:21.000> luffy<00:04:21.540> of<00:04:22.049> Zorro<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:22.890> Robin<00:04:23.490> and

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
think that luffy of Zorro and Robin and

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.880 
think that luffy of Zorro and Robin and
usopp<00:04:24.600> will<00:04:24.810> reconnect<00:04:25.470> with<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.770> other

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
usopp will reconnect with the other

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.710 
usopp will reconnect with the other
straw<00:04:26.190> hats<00:04:26.430> yet<00:04:26.700> I<00:04:26.970> think<00:04:27.420> they're<00:04:27.540> probably

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
straw hats yet I think they're probably

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.090 
straw hats yet I think they're probably
going<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.020> look<00:04:28.140> around<00:04:28.380> look<00:04:28.710> was<00:04:28.860> more

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
going to look around look was more

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.760 
going to look around look was more
privacy<00:04:29.640> again<00:04:30.150> more<00:04:30.540> about<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.900> island<00:04:31.350> get

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
privacy again more about the island get

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.380 
privacy again more about the island get
some<00:04:31.980> more<00:04:32.130> development<00:04:32.760> for<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:32.970> samurai

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
some more development for the samurai

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.200 
some more development for the samurai
probably<00:04:33.930> hear<00:04:34.140> a<00:04:34.170> few<00:04:34.440> things<00:04:34.710> or<00:04:34.890> why<00:04:35.210> let'em

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
probably hear a few things or why let'em

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.790 
probably hear a few things or why let'em
of<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.360> samurai<00:04:36.570> with<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.870> legs<00:04:37.050> like<00:04:37.230> find<00:04:37.650> a

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
of the samurai with the legs like find a

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.230 
of the samurai with the legs like find a
few<00:04:37.950> things<00:04:38.100> while<00:04:38.370> he's<00:04:38.400> there<00:04:38.670> probably<00:04:39.180> the

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
few things while he's there probably the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.670 
few things while he's there probably the
same<00:04:39.300> thing<00:04:39.570> with<00:04:39.690> other<00:04:39.870> samurai<00:04:40.170> as<00:04:40.470> well

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
same thing with other samurai as well

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.980 
same thing with other samurai as well
there<00:04:41.400> are<00:04:41.550> nothing<00:04:42.060> really<00:04:42.450> extraordinary

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
there are nothing really extraordinary

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.130 
there are nothing really extraordinary
but<00:04:43.890> then<00:04:44.010> again<00:04:44.040> it<00:04:44.430> is<00:04:44.580> Otis<00:04:45.030> 002<00:04:45.480> man<00:04:45.750> go

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
but then again it is Otis 002 man go

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.720 
but then again it is Otis 002 man go
ahead<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.440> surprise<00:04:46.860> or<00:04:47.160> something<00:04:47.460> that<00:04:47.610> we

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
ahead and surprise or something that we

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.750 
ahead and surprise or something that we
really<00:04:47.760> really<00:04:48.510> really<00:04:48.660> don't<00:04:48.930> expect<00:04:49.320> to<00:04:49.440> see

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
really really really don't expect to see

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.220 
really really really don't expect to see
and<00:04:50.760> if<00:04:51.120> that<00:04:51.300> does<00:04:51.480> happen<00:04:51.510> it'll<00:04:52.020> most

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
and if that does happen it'll most

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.320 
and if that does happen it'll most
likely<00:04:52.320> be<00:04:52.590> at<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:52.860> end<00:04:53.010> of<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.220> chapter<00:04:53.460> well

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
likely be at the end of the chapter well

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.620 
likely be at the end of the chapter well
