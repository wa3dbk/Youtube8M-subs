00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.930
 pressure 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.460
 hello followers quarreling with you 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.870
 a little building is such an important occupation 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.210
 like a game in payday 2 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.770
 and since I didn't get this game and 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.560
 play did not go out not external I decided 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.630
 make for you a video about what mods in 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.359
 harris mod you want to install and 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.710
 which we use ourselves I am not 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.779
 I am going to talk absolutely about 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.250
 all mods which time stand because 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.680
 some I don't even know why 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.570
 installed but also tell you about the mods that 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.160
 it is desirable to have each user 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.570
 harris fashion especially for those who love 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.149
 something to build and 1 can our list from 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.920
 and relocate from estus this mod but me 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.940
 need new users who started 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.910
 with garry's mod 13 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.070
 but if you played previous versions and 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.690
 accustomed to the location of the body you rather 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.190
 just want to put this module 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.320
 because he changes the new location 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.570
 more common as in harris 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.219
 fashion 12 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.750
 next mod of this p mod you can't 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.369
 you all know not to tell me 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.350
 really nothing this mod which adds 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.910
 a bunch of different logical elements in 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.759
 the game and allows you to build a new much 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.020
 more complicated cool buildings 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.820
 unity why they mention but because 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.830
 now you can download it without any 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.520
 Yesenov directly from the garry's mod workshop and 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.810
 so a link to it here below 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.310
 The next mod is also likely to have 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.680
 most of us have it all the same 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.330
 A mod called smart snap it adds 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.369
 all trials and the game is very convenient 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.840
 mesh which is much simpler and 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.840
 clarifies your construction 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.560
 the next mod is called prestige later 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.600
 used to be called easy humiliated this 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.130
 mod adds much more comfortable wild 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.759
 axis and other tula 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.740
 she is different from them much more 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.810
 customizability u and the fact that he 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.130
 It doesnâ€™t fit each other 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.710
 allows you to turn them on 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.229
 specific angles the next tour is called 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.079
 stacker it allows you to copy 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.130
 various samples and in certain 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.750
 sequences applying to them 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.909
 different settings types complete 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.909
 freezing or welding them together 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.340
 the next tour we have is called leopard one 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.170
 outrageously simple 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.730
 unity its function is to add things 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.730
 floating so they can swim in the water 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.129
 the next mod is called piu pi he 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.420
 used to be called jack under he adds 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.189
 you have a huge amount to develop 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.890
 custom weapons that can 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.379
 destroy samples and all these weapons can 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.120
 adjust in all directions and all this 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.250
 weapons can be connected to in the era for 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.250
 more accurate and steep buildings and 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.950
 Last but not least, it is in this 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:55.159
 this is a simple tool that allows you to 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:56.569
 change the weight of dill and I just remind 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.879
 but to eliminate any of these mods 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.620

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.180
 will take you to the right page and 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.079

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.060
 subscribe 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.180

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.439

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.439
