hi<00:00:00.450> everyone<00:00:00.719> just<00:00:01.050> a<00:00:01.110> short<00:00:01.350> video<00:00:01.469> on

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
hi everyone just a short video on

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.570 
hi everyone just a short video on
setting<00:00:02.159> up<00:00:02.429> your<00:00:02.490> poll<00:00:04.130> at<00:00:05.130> least<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.430> video

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
setting up your poll at least a video

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.580 
setting up your poll at least a video
before<00:00:06.109> about<00:00:07.109> this<00:00:07.319> setup<00:00:09.380> it's<00:00:10.380> worth

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
before about this setup it's worth

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.919 
before about this setup it's worth
having<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:11.010> tap<00:00:11.370> actually<00:00:12.150> on<00:00:12.240> your<00:00:12.450> poll<00:00:12.719> this

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
having it tap actually on your poll this

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.400 
having it tap actually on your poll this
is<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.170> Harris<00:00:13.500> Poll<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.830> use<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.130> lot<00:00:15.410> instead

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
is the Harris Poll I use a lot instead

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.620 
is the Harris Poll I use a lot instead
of<00:00:16.619> putting<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.070> hose<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.150> inside<00:00:18.600> of

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
of putting the hose but the inside of

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.200 
of putting the hose but the inside of
your<00:00:18.930> poll<00:00:19.199> will<00:00:19.830> often<00:00:20.160> drag<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> lot<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.970> grit

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
your poll will often drag a lot of grit

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.630 
your poll will often drag a lot of grit
inside<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.500> makes<00:00:22.680> your<00:00:22.859> cones<00:00:23.130> wear<00:00:23.460> out

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
inside and it makes your cones wear out

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.970 
inside and it makes your cones wear out
much<00:00:23.880> quicker<00:00:24.199> you<00:00:25.199> can<00:00:25.350> put<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> pipe

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
much quicker you can put the pipe

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.210 
much quicker you can put the pipe
actually<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.000> outside<00:00:27.800> so<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.070> you've

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
actually on the outside so that you've

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.370 
actually on the outside so that you've
got<00:00:29.369> no<00:00:29.550> trailing<00:00:30.269> loop<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.750> you've<00:00:30.900> got<00:00:31.080> no

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
got no trailing loop and you've got no

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.530 
got no trailing loop and you've got no

windings just this particular hose is

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.020 
windings just this particular hose is
like<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> silicon<00:00:46.140> type<00:00:46.410> OS<00:00:47.129> which<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.700> got<00:00:47.879> my

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
like a silicon type OS which I got my

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.450 
like a silicon type OS which I got my
pet<00:00:48.329> shop<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.840> get<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.050> there<00:00:49.230> about<00:00:50.160> 20

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
pet shop you can get it there about 20

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.670 
pet shop you can get it there about 20
meters<00:00:51.050> make<00:00:52.050> sure<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:57.600> idea<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.260> was<00:00:58.469> going<00:00:58.590> to

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
meters make sure the idea I was going to

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.990 
meters make sure the idea I was going to
mention<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.190> instead<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.609> having<00:00:59.820> this

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
mention is instead of having this

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.870 
mention is instead of having this
training<00:01:00.750> loop<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:04.519> grab<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.729> middle

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
training loop so grab it in the middle

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.700 
training loop so grab it in the middle
bring<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> first<00:01:07.350> cone<00:01:08.630> 3<00:01:09.710> sorry

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
bring it up to the first cone 3 sorry

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.490 
bring it up to the first cone 3 sorry
the<00:01:10.890> second<00:01:11.250> cone<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> three<00:01:13.170> section

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the second cone this is a three section

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.260 
the second cone this is a three section
Pole

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.770 

you've<00:01:18.049> got<00:01:18.229> two<00:01:18.470> loops<00:01:18.710> there<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:19.430> if<00:01:20.270> you

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
you've got two loops there so if you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.350 
you've got two loops there so if you
come<00:01:20.960> in<00:01:21.049> a<00:01:21.110> bit<00:01:21.259> closer<00:01:23.170> put<00:01:24.170> on<00:01:24.290> a<00:01:24.320> tie<00:01:25.360> close

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
come in a bit closer put on a tie close

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.609 
come in a bit closer put on a tie close
to<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.689> second<00:01:27.670> cone<00:01:28.670> there<00:01:29.229> and<00:01:30.229> get<00:01:30.409> another

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
to the second cone there and get another

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:37.169 
to the second cone there and get another
tie<00:01:32.380> push<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.530> underneath<00:01:33.860> it<00:01:34.159> like<00:01:34.189> that

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:45.580 

get<00:01:38.179> your<00:01:38.299> hose<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:41.630> trap<00:01:42.409> that<00:01:42.590> in<00:01:44.439> and<00:01:45.439> the

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
get your hose and trap that in and the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.060 
get your hose and trap that in and the
small<00:01:45.920> tie<00:01:46.189> like<00:01:46.429> that<00:01:47.560> don't<00:01:48.560> get<00:01:48.740> it<00:01:48.799> too

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
small tie like that don't get it too

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.980 
small tie like that don't get it too
tight<00:01:49.399> because<00:01:49.429> what<00:01:50.179> you'll<00:01:50.330> do<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:50.630> crush

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
tight because what you'll do is crush

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.999 
tight because what you'll do is crush
the<00:01:51.259> pipe<00:01:51.890> itself<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:52.970> restrict<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.569> flow

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
the pipe itself and restrict the flow

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.699 
the pipe itself and restrict the flow
then<00:01:55.009> after<00:01:55.310> that<00:01:55.459> we'll<00:01:55.700> just<00:01:56.259> snip<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.289> ends

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
then after that we'll just snip the ends

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.070 
then after that we'll just snip the ends
off<00:01:58.030> without<00:01:59.030> actually<00:01:59.479> snipping<00:01:59.840> the<00:01:59.929> hose

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
off without actually snipping the hose

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.680 
off without actually snipping the hose
itself<00:02:00.940> like<00:02:01.940> that<00:02:02.709> and<00:02:03.709> there<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:03.950> have<00:02:04.690> two

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
itself like that and there you have two

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.680 
itself like that and there you have two
loops<00:02:05.929> like<00:02:06.229> this<00:02:07.420> actually<00:02:08.420> working

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
loops like this actually working

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.140 
loops like this actually working
downstairs<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.100> can<00:02:13.340> get<00:02:13.459> in<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.670> way

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
downstairs so you can get in the way

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.110 
downstairs so you can get in the way
drag<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.690> ground<00:02:14.720> anymore<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:16.790> still

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
drag on the ground anymore it still

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:34.310 
drag on the ground anymore it still
works<00:02:18.549> when<00:02:19.549> you<00:02:19.670> extend<00:02:20.150> your

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:43.710 

now<00:02:41.370> four<00:02:42.370> sections<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:43.120> thought<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:43.360> wonder<00:02:43.540> if

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
now four sections I thought I wonder if

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.620 
now four sections I thought I wonder if
he<00:02:43.780> can<00:02:43.930> still<00:02:44.080> do<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:45.550> course<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:46.060> can

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
he can still do it and of course you can

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.340 
he can still do it and of course you can
I've<00:02:47.140> done<00:02:47.350> one<00:02:47.530> here<00:02:47.830> this<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:49.050> actually<00:02:50.050> a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
I've done one here this is actually a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.020 
I've done one here this is actually a
fiberglass<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.070> pole<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:51.430> it's<00:02:51.580> just<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.790> demo

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
fiberglass of pole so it's just a demo

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.860 
fiberglass of pole so it's just a demo
it's<00:02:52.240> really<00:02:52.540> heavy

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
it's really heavy

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.720 
it's really heavy
again<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.860> put<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.310> tap<00:02:54.580> on<00:02:54.760> here<00:02:55.200> taped<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.350> on

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
again I put the tap on here taped it on

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.910 
again I put the tap on here taped it on
shroud<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.790> connector<00:02:58.210> here<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:59.230> that<00:02:59.440> when

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
shroud a connector here so that when

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.190 
shroud a connector here so that when
it's<00:03:00.070> connected<00:03:00.420> it's<00:03:01.420> never<00:03:01.690> trailing<00:03:02.080> on

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
it's connected it's never trailing on

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.490 
it's connected it's never trailing on
the<00:03:02.290> ground<00:03:02.790> take<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.000> first<00:03:04.240> section<00:03:04.840> of

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
the ground take the first section of

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:17.720
