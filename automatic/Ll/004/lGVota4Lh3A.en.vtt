 what's up with youtube and well then today in that 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.360

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:15.450
 manu area by ball and other meter 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.840
 phone to use again with line 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.910
 Well, what you will need us is 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.840
 a fine knit complexion 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.840
 and powerful 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.190
 a hands free of a cell phone that does not 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.410
 use with 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.200
 While 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.180
 spoken a little more control you 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.650
 you have the normal one if you can not buy 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.770
 a comple with 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.380
 well 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.590
 that makes 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.010
 well for the not good control also the 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.670
 they will need is a 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.670
 a microphone 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.130
 like this 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.340
 and good start to 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.490
 [Music] 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.290
 I am here now I have sisters 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.010
 I'm just going to tell you more or less 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.830
 as for exceeding average but nothing else 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.040
 It upset me and good to change the 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.730
 microphone 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.830
 [Music] 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.660
 you when you have it normal you can 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.720
 center the two all the two 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.480
 better hearing aids will start in the 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.620
 that he does not have 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.140
 [Music] 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.970
 they're going to leave the one with the microphone 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.420
 I am where I came so I just 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.600
 remove 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.830
 and good for people who do not know that 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.440
 morning 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.220
 of the free hands well maybe I do not like 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.220
 we want small 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.750
 it does not make any difference 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.750
 well we all arrived 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.550
 they will leave the one with the 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.760
 This resemblance to the plus and quito 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.630
 and we see them the other two cables are going 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.270
 to separate and they will connect the microphone 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.240
 it does not matter which side the cables do not 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.190
 they are just going to connect to wait tell me 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.190
 I connect it and now I have heat
