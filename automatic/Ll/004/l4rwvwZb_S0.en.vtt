00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hi everyone guys and welcome to the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:17.100
 top five strong dubbing to parry 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:19.410
 matches alone today are here here 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.240
 first episode of the top five a series 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.039
 to be held on my channel every Monday 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.050
 apart from this episode that for reasons 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.900
 personal and will be released Tuesday and will see 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.730
 precisely to all the champions in my opinion 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.230
 stronger to play games and 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.989
 win practically in one against 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.760
 five top lane and jungle and midland e 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.530
 this before I saw how I said already 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.270
 also previously and as you have noticed 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.010
 from the title we will talk about the top line e 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.360
 therefore of champion which in my opinion are 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.920
 absolutely the strongest 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.600
 so let's start talking about it 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 theme fifth place purchase we have 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.539
 kernel yes so it is not a champion 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.550
 which has many strengths is difficult 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.219
 to use in the sense is not a champion who 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.629
 given in hands of any person succeed 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.340
 to win the game alone though 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.229
 indeed it is a sample that with a 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.580
 couple of items including the area so much 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.320
 for one thing 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.960
 thanks to his huge by mine is the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.610
 did that have a great escape one sit 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.700
 repetition everywhere even one 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.530
 possibility of pop bar farmar instance 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.970
 in the lanning face is really a 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 very strong advantage in when 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.900
 arrives in team fight if you arrive already 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.690
 with three or four killers it really is a 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.460
 total waste has closed 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.010
 so if you have still played me 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.020
 a top ten will realize that the thing 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.300
 really devastating as it mentions the top 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.070
 line says that the magic match then 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.840
 let's move on to the fourth news somewhat 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.700
 place I put in champion that I would not have 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.950
 really wanted to put in as there 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.210
 it will also be a top five suitcase in the future 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.370
 even to the small spoiler 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.350
 we are talking about pinocchio in kong Ã¨ 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.930
 an exceptional champion in the sense that it has 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.420
 the chance to escape rather 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.760
 easily to great harm e 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.500
 especially thanks to his latest cup the 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.460
 great damage that really makes a 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.810
 slaughterhouse 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.370
 in fact it is a champion who 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.870
 basically you win the games from 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.760
 just for the simple fact that thanks 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.130
 to the devastating greetings it kills anyone 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.080
 it happens against him and if it all goes to one 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.270
 excellent utility also for your team 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.730
 as even if you have team with you 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.040
 a team of no- humans succeed anyway 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.410
 to compile something as you have it 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.790
 stop enemies even a trust because the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.980
 toxin will probably succeed 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.870
 entrusting it is also a center in my opinion 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.150
 makes media in jungle but of this ne 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.130
 we'll talk in the next episode though 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.870
 even the top lines actually is a 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.830
 champion who really at his points of 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.600
 power 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.239
 but now let's move on to the third rate 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.970
 place we find already ex is a champion who 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.220
 he is always in the goal but he never uses it almost 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.140
 no one for example who has potential 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.880
 who the highest a possibility of 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.120
 kill the curry really in a 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.989
 second and therefore the possibility of 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.060
 only managed to stamp the game 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.760
 really very easy to have king tisi 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.380
 you have a stand that absorbs the damage 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.750
 car attack than a very useful thing 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.940
 especially with this goal he sees in 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.890
 many junger cars dock boy from 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.290
 feral flake then in my opinion in 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.970
 champion that will also be reviewed a lot in 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.650
 topless with this current method of 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.750
 evening at the fringe angle that it really was 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.280
 however very strong in general his 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.560
 it really is though that hunter the fact that 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.360
 you know a curry on this blog 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.090
 in short it is absolutely not a thing to be 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.190
 underestimated and also does damage but there we 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.810
 so it's a great thing to be mobile 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.150
 therefore also thanks to the use of 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.379
 eggs 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.480
 how can you still jump for the 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.310
 map managing to manage is good for one 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.720
 multi that makes it almost immortal e 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.180
 thanks to the combination of his 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.280
 double it the iii the blow that however falls 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.659
 adults will really be a hangman damage 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.189
 you seem to use it 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.409
 you have won the game as enough as you can 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.359
 really take a couple of chili lane 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.799
 and or even without taking pounds 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.239
 just get inc in fight take a 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.519
 couple of pounds managed to change the 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.680
 match alone is recent because me 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.290
 banner is very happy if it were not 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.629
 for the fact that almost never uses anyone a 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:00.099
 part me is practically we now move on to 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:03.579
 second place in second place we have 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.379
 another character really capable of 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.900
 win matches one on five 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.420
 we are talking about laugh despite the 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.670
 numerous nerf and the fact that until recently 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.379
 long ago it was out of meta I had the 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.599
 pleasure of finally revising in the 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.160
 competitive games and it's something that I do 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.970
 loved it 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.289
 this champion is something really 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.970
 monstrous in my opinion because apart from 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.880
 game that actually is his only one 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.729
 weak point as a scalet game at a 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.949
 butchery of damage keep because obviously 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.780
 stop on the hand the moves you have many 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.380
 tent thank you allow to have 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.300
 human like frozen art for example e 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.430
 times to try a casino a lot of 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.530
 damage away thanks to wikileaks pulls a lot 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.750
 therefore always thanks to the last broken 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.780
 you have repetition move in passive house 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.190
 so it's a well-known character there's a 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.979
 step one of the favorite characters 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.860
 I think and playing it too much actually is 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.330
 a very very good thing as or 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.550
 however he can keep up with the 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.050
 top line up such as shiva in 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.930
 world I am right now three 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.250
 even strong champions or manages to 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.720
 despite ever suffering the lines ever 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.580
 against characters like the net woman 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.259
 manages out monstrously 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.849
 and therefore be something that goes 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:19.430
 stante l 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:20.870
 but we pass I think many of you and 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.060
 I did the count of the centers also 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.280
 have thought which one is 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.780
 champion who did not name exactly 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.789
 speaking precisely of flourishes a center to the 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.800
 net unlocked but affects once one 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.680
 person and linke is taken for granted because he feels 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.909
 flower and go out sixteen more times because 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.030
 do harm to the Madonna 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:39.530
 you have the opportunity to move home 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.419
 your bike to his i minion aversana e 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.740
 therefore similar to that of wukong non 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.509
 you have the possibility of course 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.020
 cook tight when ever a move that 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:51.050
 for other opponents attacks 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.400
 you have monstrous damage in third and passive 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.139
 of your moves from w 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.990
 if I'm not mistaken, it is a character that one 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.550
 time he took any two kin 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.099
 what because once you believed the side 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.810
 native morning lost mister and among many in 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.509
 fight sees us practically all with the 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.240
 your skill set press r sketch of 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:14.150
 amat and take refuge by removing a 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.830
 life brothel then the opponents 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.479
 guys for this first to top five is 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.860
 everything I hope you enjoyed 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.840
 let me in the comments what you 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.669
 think of this top five that 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.710
 champion you think are stronger than 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.599
 those that you put I expect in a 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.210
 next episode next Monday the top 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:30.979
 five of the jungle less pure you already 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.210
 he will guess which centers are rigged 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:35.270
 I also want to know what you think 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.529
 maybe what you can foresee the memory 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.440
