00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.809
 hello my name is alia yesterday I 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.050
 went to the disappeared 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.869
 so today I want to take off man's sky 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.360
 Still a review of this film is possible 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.490
 correctly so called because I'm under 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.020
 so impressed with this movie that 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.390
 just not knowing it was very strong 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.660
 impressions from the book itself gillian 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.820
 flynn so when i went to the movie i 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.489
 thought as usual she hours liver 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.280
 sport now again did so 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.500
 I turn half of the plot as far as there 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.030
 everything was believable there almost find 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.879
 they don't seem to take you like this 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.640
 could open a book like that they say 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.129
 exactly the same thing in the book I am very 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.570
 This was surprised because everything was 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.190
 exactly the same as the author wanted as 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.800
 the author wanted to introduce his 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.670
 head writers also exactly 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.369
 all on camera 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.680
 the book tells us about happy 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.830
 checked dan are collected from 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.330
 red your wedding anniversary 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.439
 five years anniversary this beautiful 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.780
 day 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.530
 husband comes home and find out what his 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.560
 the wife is gone find traces of struggle and all 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.210
 the rest comes the police and of course 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.090
 according to the law of the genre the police starts 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.650
 suspect him but the plot wraps up 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.790
 so you involuntarily start thinking 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.130
 I wonder what if he really killed 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.659
 own wife that I am very, very 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.450
 liked the movie so it 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.570
 atmospheric course the film lasts two s 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.130
 half an hour and all I told you that 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.509
 I'm going to say I'm going crazy 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.720
 gone you don't you sit so much in 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.479
 the cinema but i sat u just like that i 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.430
 enjoyed every shot in this movie 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.040
 Of course stas near me periodically 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.540
 fidgeted because he was nervous at first 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.399
 second, he did not understand what will happen next 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.259
 difference from me which I read everything 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.780
 found out wanted told him half 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.540
 plot 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.840
 some piquant plot details 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.880
 books and he morskoy knew what all 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.130
 end but still he was nervous he 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.050
 was afraid that it seemed like horror movies 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.790
 someone picked this one around the corner because on 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.520
 actually attend it there 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.410
 horror horror element i can say 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.569
 because music throughout 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.610
 the film she was so straining 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.340
 you thought that the real that what 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.800
 you should happen now and smoothly 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.230
 could gradually the director let us down 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.720
 the culmination of this story is therefore 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.300
 how to end it all happened all 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.400
 what was going to happen there you went 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.320
 with the cinema you attacking smile just 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.060
 in enjoyment at least i would 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.790
 laughed at one point in which 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.420
 I obviously didn't have to laugh, but I just 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.110
 could not but influence at this moment 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.480
 I don't know why I'm just carying me 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.950
 it was just i don't know why i 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.350
 laughed it seems to me the only thing 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.690
 the whole room laughed probably neighbors 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.170
 We looked on as everything is probably full 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.079
 should and I'm lying I certainly laughed at them 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.030
 voice but I could not calm down on 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.620
 loyalty the next five minutes five minutes 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.780
 I missed the movie because I 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.489
 laughed a separate thank you have to give 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.220
 ben affleku because it seems to me for 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.410
 him it was the perfect role he is forever 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.239
 what kind of men plays which type 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.680
 everyone knows and does not know anything and 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:32.010
 they are such stupid to say 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.320
 fools because yes i don't know where 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.480
 my wife is gone haha I'm glad that disappeared 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.430
 my desire is why i'm not manual all words 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.709
 I lived and now throughout the film 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.350
 he gave the same crown phrases that 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:47.040
 Actually, I do not know Ben's catchphrase 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.680
 affletion and of course rosamund pike what 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.070
 behind women when i looked at her in 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.560
 The role of Amy, it seemed to me that I was her 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.620
 and represented in the book I do not know why 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.260
 she inspired me it seems to me that I 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.410
 crazy when I looked at Rosamund Pike 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.780
 the role of emi it seemed to me that oh she is 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.299
 cutie what's in the book i immense bottom 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.599
 hated and here I wanted and 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.220
 imitate i'm crazy of course the movie is not for 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.080
 all at least 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.110
 lari with us 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:24.380
 described as usual about 16 why not 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.780
 understand but at least 21 to how 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.960
 cigarettes like beer sell kikina 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.700
 children only after 21 because 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.610
 violent violence scenes of everything else 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.560
 cannot be shown to children of 16 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.000
 and imagine that there is some old lady 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.490
 who sits on the bench talked about 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.370
 not a little crust and did not see 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.280
 you thing in this tip and a whole like me 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.560
 Already a million times I repeat and the book and 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.270
 the movie is really like me already rather 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.490
 I want to continue to get acquainted with this 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.620
 the author since the book then became five 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.040
 score movies probably also put 10 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.250
 points 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.170
 because ideally he added a book I 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.390
 saw nothing superfluous and not 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.730
 saw something very mouth and wrought 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.830
 and sometimes even when you are very long 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.050
 read a book to you do you watch a movie 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.210
 would not something there was not a 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.520
 I didnâ€™t even have this idea 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.580
 I did not want to criticize the movie for a second 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.560
 losing grip as grandma says 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.570
 if you already turned 21 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.550
 watch movie 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.200
 if not, then still refrain well 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.730
 or at least read the book first then 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.919
 you will be ready for anything there 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.970
 happens because all the same some 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.030
 moments of such 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.040
 the film and in the book I don't remember 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.380
 I really wanted to re-read this book 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.510
 considering you look like from the cinema the first thing 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.030
 you want to do this will throw books and 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.620
 there and then just once again in one gulp 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.300
 swallow so read 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:54.590
 the missing jillian captivity and watch 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:59.200
 films disappeared well done and i'm all 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.200
 said on it all 7 books
