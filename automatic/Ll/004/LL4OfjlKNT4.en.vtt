00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
if we swipe to the right then we

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.670 
if we swipe to the right then we
navigate<00:00:35.489> through<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.270> video<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:37.469> like

navigate through the video just like

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.130 
navigate through the video just like
that<00:00:37.920> now<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.520> can<00:00:38.670> actually<00:00:38.910> change<00:00:39.600> how

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
that now you can actually change how

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.110 
that now you can actually change how
sensitive<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.340> sometimes<00:00:41.820> it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
sensitive this is and sometimes it

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.760 
sensitive this is and sometimes it
actually<00:00:42.239> gets<00:00:42.450> stuck<00:00:42.930> like<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.649> around

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
actually gets stuck like right around

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.560 
actually gets stuck like right around
the<00:00:43.980> 15-second<00:00:44.730> mark<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.480> I

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the 15-second mark so you can see if I

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.830 
the 15-second mark so you can see if I
swipe<00:00:45.840> back<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:47.340> swipe<00:00:47.640> forward<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.270> stuck

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
swipe back and I swipe forward it stuck

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.660 
swipe back and I swipe forward it stuck
at<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> 15-second<00:00:49.860> mark<00:00:49.890> now<00:00:50.250> i'm<00:00:50.370> not<00:00:50.489> sure

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
at the 15-second mark now i'm not sure

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.910 
at the 15-second mark now i'm not sure
what<00:00:50.879> that's<00:00:51.059> about<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.719> i<00:00:52.410> try<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> swipe

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
what that's about as i try to swipe

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.840 
what that's about as i try to swipe
across<00:00:53.239> but<00:00:54.239> once<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.510> gets<00:00:54.660> past<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.850> then

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
across but once it gets past that then

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.970 
across but once it gets past that then
you<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.359> if<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.719> swipe<00:00:58.050> again<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.859> it's

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
you can see if I swipe again then it's

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.009 
you can see if I swipe again then it's
going<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.219> start<00:00:59.430> scrolling<00:01:00.239> through<00:01:00.660> again

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
going to start scrolling through again

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.540 
going to start scrolling through again
so<00:01:01.500> that's<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:01.859> something<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.250> keep<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.489> mind

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
so that's just something to keep in mind

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.070 
so that's just something to keep in mind
if<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:03.000> stuck<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.269> that<00:01:03.329> 15-second<00:01:04.050> mark

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
if you get stuck in that 15-second mark

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.960 
if you get stuck in that 15-second mark
just<00:01:04.350> wait<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.590> second<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.160> then<00:01:05.190> try<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> swipe

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
just wait a second and then try to swipe

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.510 
just wait a second and then try to swipe
pass<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.450> 16<00:01:06.930> second<00:01:07.410> mark<00:01:07.590> now<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.190> we<00:01:08.310> switch

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
pass the 16 second mark now if we switch

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.580 
pass the 16 second mark now if we switch
back<00:01:08.820> over<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.660> scroll<00:01:09.900> back<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:10.470> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
back over and we scroll back here and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.560 
back over and we scroll back here and
open<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> settings<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.940> we<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:12.270> open<00:01:12.510> up

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
open up the settings that we can open up

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.760 
open up the settings that we can open up
video<00:01:12.840> gestures<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.410> I<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.590> show<00:01:13.620> you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
video gestures and I can show you

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.710 
video gestures and I can show you
exactly<00:01:13.860> what<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.400> has<00:01:14.550> to<00:01:14.610> offer<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.510> can

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
exactly what this has to offer you can

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.780 
exactly what this has to offer you can
enable<00:01:16.260> or<00:01:16.380> disable<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.950> right<00:01:17.280> here<00:01:17.520> you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
enable or disable this right here you

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.970 
enable or disable this right here you
also<00:01:17.940> have<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.450> volume<00:01:18.810> scrolling<00:01:19.440> ratio<00:01:19.800> as

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
also have a volume scrolling ratio as

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.040 
also have a volume scrolling ratio as
well<00:01:20.160> as<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> video<00:01:20.640> scrolling<00:01:21.150> ratio<00:01:21.510> so

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
well as a video scrolling ratio so

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.420 
well as a video scrolling ratio so
basically<00:01:22.410> what<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.710> does<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.190> if<00:01:23.310> you

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
basically what this does is if you

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.460 
basically what this does is if you
toggle<00:01:23.760> this<00:01:24.000> down<00:01:24.300> to<00:01:24.960> make<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.320> less

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
toggle this down to make it less

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.650 
toggle this down to make it less
responsive<00:01:26.190> or<00:01:26.310> less<00:01:26.460> sensitive<00:01:26.940> so<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.630> we

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
responsive or less sensitive so if we

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.080 
responsive or less sensitive so if we
move<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.260> the<00:01:28.350> way<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.680> then<00:01:29.490> that's<00:01:29.850> going

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
move it all the way up then that's going

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.810 
move it all the way up then that's going
to<00:01:30.270> actually<00:01:30.390> make<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:31.080> extremely<00:01:31.820> sensitive

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
to actually make it extremely sensitive

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.790 
to actually make it extremely sensitive
and<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.420> also<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.690> natural<00:01:34.230> scrolling<00:01:34.650> so

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
and you also have natural scrolling so

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.440 
and you also have natural scrolling so
basically<00:01:35.130> what<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.490> does<00:01:35.760> if<00:01:35.940> we<00:01:36.300> toggle

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
basically what this does if we toggle

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.870 
basically what this does if we toggle
that<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:37.050> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.320> invert<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.280> video

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
that on it's going to invert the video

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.520 
that on it's going to invert the video
scrolling<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:39.930> we<00:01:39.990> swipe<00:01:40.230> to<00:01:40.410> the<00:01:40.500> right

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
scrolling so if we swipe to the right

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.200 
scrolling so if we swipe to the right
it's<00:01:40.830> actually<00:01:41.040> going<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.250> go<00:01:41.310> back<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.120> it

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
it's actually going to go back so it

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.640 
it's actually going to go back so it
just<00:01:42.360> kind<00:01:42.510> of<00:01:42.540> depends<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.990> your<00:01:43.140> preference

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
just kind of depends on your preference

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.130 
just kind of depends on your preference
but<00:01:44.160> let's<00:01:44.340> go<00:01:44.460> back<00:01:44.490> into<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> videos<00:01:45.750> here

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
but let's go back into the videos here

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.010 
but let's go back into the videos here
and<00:01:46.820> you<00:01:47.820> can<00:01:47.940> see<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:49.020> start<00:01:49.260> to<00:01:49.380> play<00:01:49.560> this

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
and you can see if we start to play this

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.570 
and you can see if we start to play this
it's<00:01:52.020> extremely<00:01:52.470> sensitive<00:01:53.010> scrolling<00:01:53.490> up

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
it's extremely sensitive scrolling up

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.130 
it's extremely sensitive scrolling up
and<00:01:53.700> down<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.060> almost<00:01:54.270> goes<00:01:54.450> all<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.750> way<00:01:54.960> up

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and down it almost goes all the way up

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.170 
and down it almost goes all the way up
and<00:01:55.260> all<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.440> way<00:01:55.560> down<00:01:55.860> just<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:56.610> one<00:01:56.820> swipe

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and all the way down just with one swipe

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.510 
and all the way down just with one swipe
now<00:01:57.750> again<00:01:57.900> if<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.230> swipe<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> right<00:01:58.890> you

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
now again if we swipe to the right you

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.580 
now again if we swipe to the right you
can<00:01:59.670> see<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.240> video<00:02:00.990> actually<00:02:01.230> goes

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
can see that the video actually goes

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.320 
can see that the video actually goes
back<00:02:01.620> and<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.190> much<00:02:02.460> more<00:02:02.670> sensitive<00:02:03.060> than

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
back and it's much more sensitive than

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
back and it's much more sensitive than
previously<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.600> see<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.780> just

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
previously so you can see that just

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.499 
previously so you can see that just
right<00:02:07.560> there<00:02:07.830> so<00:02:08.580> video<00:02:08.940> justice<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> pretty

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.660 
right there so video justice is a pretty
