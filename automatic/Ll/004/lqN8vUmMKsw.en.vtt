00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
having a modded controller which they

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.020 
having a modded controller which they
usually<00:02:56.370> do<00:02:56.700> when<00:02:56.850> i'm<00:02:56.970> using<00:02:57.180> this<00:02:57.270> gram<00:03:02.030> yeah

don't<00:03:05.060> give<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.210> couple<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.510> reasons<00:03:06.660> one

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
don't give you a couple of reasons one

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.840 
don't give you a couple of reasons one
because<00:03:07.320> i'm<00:03:07.710> not<00:03:07.800> actually<00:03:07.950> firing<00:03:08.430> very

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
because i'm not actually firing very

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.600 
because i'm not actually firing very
fast<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:10.580> lot<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.610> people<00:03:11.670> fire<00:03:12.060> passing<00:03:12.480> me<00:03:13.610> too

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
fast a lot of people fire passing me too

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.210 
fast a lot of people fire passing me too
because<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:15.240> modded<00:03:15.630> controller<00:03:16.050> will<00:03:16.590> fire<00:03:16.890> in

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
because a modded controller will fire in

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.980 
because a modded controller will fire in
a<00:03:17.280> steady<00:03:17.670> rate<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.060> fire<00:03:18.240> you<00:03:18.870> know<00:03:18.960> a

a steady rate of fire you know a

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
a steady rate of fire you know a
constant<00:03:20.420> at<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.510> constant<00:03:21.810> rate<00:03:21.960> I<00:03:22.320> do<00:03:22.590> not

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
constant at a constant rate I do not

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.850

my finger goes you know it's just and
thirdly<00:03:29.700> that's<00:03:30.000> not<00:03:30.150> actually<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.480> fastest

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
thirdly that's not actually the fastest

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.110 
thirdly that's not actually the fastest
i<00:03:31.020> can<00:03:31.170> go<00:03:31.320> i<00:03:34.160> can<00:03:35.160> shoot<00:03:35.370> faster<00:03:35.880> but<00:03:36.030> it's

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
i can go i can shoot faster but it's

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.360
