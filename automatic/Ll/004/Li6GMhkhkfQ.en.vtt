 new to the channel here I am to bring you 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.490
 the last information that has come out 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.320
 about colo city advanced warfare yesterday 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.720
 during the microsoft conference in 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.359
 On e3 2014 we had something that I 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.699
 I personally craved that this channel 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.679
 he craved and it was a kind of gameplay 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.710
 trailer about call of advanced advanced 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:27.380
 warfare where we could already see little things 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.499
 the gameplay in game campaign within 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.329
 game I'm going to do an analysis on that 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.649
 video so important that they took in 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.020
 first place you have it in the description 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.090
 down here is a video which you 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.890
 I recommend enjoying alone without 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.629
 analysis first and then I recommend you 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.149
 that you come to this video because I'm going to 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.579
 tell a lot of things we can see a 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.920
 heaps of things laser weapons types of 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.469
 grenades the setting of the game the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.600
 graphics the exoskeletons in a way 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.760
 nearest a lot of things guys 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.640
 that as always you are going to have analyzed 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.370
 next first because 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.850
 I put the webcam is a way of 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.220
 approaching to address you from a 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.760
 more directly and on the other hand 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.100
 for 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.620
 a little bit more the video because with these 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.120
 with this theme of the trailers and such is 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.860
 they put very strict with the theme of 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.330
 copyright and I run the risk that I 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.430
 drop a strike so this way 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.410
 trump transformed a bit more of the 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.290
 video image and I run a risk 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.540
 quite minor and guys let's see a 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.790
 gameplay and I advance you quite 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.070
 futuristic you can see that these people have 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.180
 taken seriously about the future but a lot 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.880
 people are also believed that the 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.770
 multiplayer is going to be this way 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.469
 I want to remember you when the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.170
 gameplay precisely the color e3 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:45.119
 The two of us were shown a rifle 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.369
 that traversed walls with a 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.509
 atmosphere not as futuristic as this 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.640
 gameplay that we're going to see next 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.110
 from city ​​color to trans warfare but if 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.789
 set in a future that people 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.700
 He said host, as if in the 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.990
 multiplayer are going to load it a lot 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.350
 what I mean is that we can see 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.299
 something very futuristic in this trailer of the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.380
 campaign but then the multiplayer by 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.459
 another side is something totally playable 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.410
 balanced you know what I mean 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.510
 right so nothing guys no more 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.040
 procrastination we are going to analyze this trailer 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.630
 I will go part by part putting 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.950
 slow cameras in the most areas 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.440
 important 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.750
 let's say with it ok guys to start 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.670
 this gameplay trailer apparently we're going 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.620
 in a kind of aircraft 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.720
 helicopter of these of the future with 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.819
 three other colleagues and it seems that 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.890
 we go to the point where 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.840
 concentrates the war that in this case the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.370
 we can see we are subject to a series of 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.349
 supports of course with our 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.269
 exoskeletons when we seem to touch 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.370
 with something a partner I almost know there's 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.420
 we have to close the door and good the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.970
 ship starts 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.190
 crash into a building then with 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.650
 another but well finally we finish 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.420
 unharmed here, make sure that go go host 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.800
 moon times explode and others do not but 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.930
 when it turns out that we are 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.090
 perfectly alive thanks to these 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.220
 supports and good we go with our 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.350
 super fitted suits we stick a mega 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.239
 kick with a bestial force to that 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.880
 door that was barred and here already 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.770
 we see a little the graphic atmosphere 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.870
 full of particles of effects of 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.819
 explosions I have personally noticed 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.950
 pretty advance chart in this call of 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.170
 duty to fix here and here 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.630
 see a weapon that reminds me of the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.549
 would qualify as a scare h of the future 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.069
 36 bullet this charger two hundred in 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.560
 five bullets in total and it reminds me 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.330
 personally a lot to the fifth and appear 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.459
 because bike it is equipped with a 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.290
 red point unit here we see a 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.470
 aircraft that greets us the atmosphere 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.030
 very cool futuristic totally and here 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.950
 let's see a great detail where 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.049
 look like we have to pull towards 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.510
 below and a bar appears to us that 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.299
 seem to indicate the fuel that 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.650
 We wear the exo suit well when falling 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.959
 we let ourselves fall 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.970
 in free fall with our suit but 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.310
 before touching the ground we started 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.620
 activate the propellers and in this way 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.689
 we do not crash we do not hurt 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.459
 we run out of fuel but what 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:02.430
 important is that we are well and fix 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.010
 now to the exit of this this building 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.159
 the whole atmosphere full of particles 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.109
 of the effects of things moving and not me 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.000
 say you do not notice the graphic advance 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.549
 this is the first call of duty that I think 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.130
 that the progress is really going to be noticed 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.440
 graphic so personally guys the 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.530
 I love the room and it shows 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.389
 heap the step that they have given this already 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.650
 which is next and here we see a partner 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.960
 with the exoskeleton but well let's go 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.210
 there to a part with more action here 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.860
 we see this kind of tank 4 torque 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.199
 my mother in the trailer looked like a lot 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.060
 smaller but fuck are pretty 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.770
 great since we saw the first 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.380
 Soldiers using their ex or suit 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.840
 hitting jumps and later we will see in 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.150
 first person already in game from our 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.919
 camera as this character jumps 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.470
 here we load a few fixos 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.960
 in the way of recharging up as a 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.129
 turn to the charger and set here as 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.229
 uses double 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.869
 jump at the same time and then another to get on 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.909
 to this hot recharge one more time and 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:01.709
 without problems let's get to that 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:04.589
 bus in front when it seems 

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:08.969
 this is in china in japan by that with 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:10.949
 that movie 'confident assault we rolled and 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:15.899
 apparently now guys come a surge 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:19.619
 of mini hemming in qualifying these days 

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:21.239
 They are like small 4tours robots insects 

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:23.550
 that apparently good our colleagues 

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:25.080
 they get safe but they do not attack us 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.269
 us directly what yes that 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.610
 we have to do is pull a door 

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:32.039
 of a car later to cover us 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.319
 of the impact of these but I already say no 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.539
 they attack us directly we go to a 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:39.119
 very cool area of ​​the trailer where we have 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.709
 grenades we can choose what they are going to 

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:43.409
 what role are they going to play 

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:45.929
 stun fragmentation because in this case 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.849
 we throw the threat grenade that is like 

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:49.709
 well we saw in previous trailer that 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.779
 It works as an oracle of the colo city 

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:54.059
 goes marks the enemies in red during 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:56.219
 a long period of time we take the 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:58.710
 shotgun guys how good it looks like 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:06:00.870
 uses bullets but personally 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.790
 as I think it pulls like a burst of 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.040
 wind reminds me a lot at the thunder 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.870
 of the zombies and here we also see a 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.540
 very important movement that is that 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.190
 sort of slip helping us from 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.260
 the propellers that carries álex or suit 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.570
 the mini four towers those insects 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.670
 there is always by air and here we take 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.500
 a laser gun you remember what I told you 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.840
 that there was going to be a laser weapon, because here 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.720
 you guys have the truth I do not see any 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.400
 indicator that therefore that indicates the 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.140
 number of bullets the amount of 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.660
 ammunition of this weapon there is there as a 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:33.240
 series of polygons of circles but not 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.000
 I can understand if this is going to be used 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.830
 bullets and that from overheating but 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.060
 apparently the enemies do not die 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.130
 instantly costs a little bit 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.140
 die but they die pretty easy here 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.270
 once again we choose between fragmentation 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:48.480
 contact and finally we use the 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.940
 smart grenade smart grenade that 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.160
 detects the enemies as a series of 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.900
 This sensor saves eating too 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.460
 is a little bit in the air and goes for 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.620
 the enemies my mother how it extends 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.300
 multiplayer I'm going to piss off a little and 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.800
 here in the final scene there is a detail 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.960
 that I liked a lot gives this 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.510
 bomb to detonate this enemy ship 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.400
 when suddenly the door to 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.230
 our partner is caught 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.180
 pull down because the ship is going to 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.970
 take off so we can save ourselves here 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.370
 we received this mega explosion with all 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:20.130
 us because we give to stay there 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.650
 looking and fixing this table hits 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.090
 just with our arm and here in 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.950
 the detail that I liked a lot 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.409
 when our friend drags our 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.539
 body our arm 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:32.429
 comes off of our body and guys we 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:33.659
 we have lost that arm 

00:07:32.429 --> 00:07:36.300
 it has seemed bestial
