ground moves if the percent difference
or<00:01:02.850> rather<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> projectile<00:01:04.280> doesn't<00:01:05.280> do

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
or rather if the projectile doesn't do

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.179 
or rather if the projectile doesn't do
nine<00:01:05.790> or<00:01:05.939> more<00:01:06.060> percent<00:01:06.740> than<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> other<00:01:07.979> one

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
nine or more percent than the other one

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.810 
nine or more percent than the other one
um<00:01:09.380> nine<00:01:10.380> more<00:01:10.710> or<00:01:10.950> more<00:01:11.189> percent<00:01:11.549> than<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
um nine more or more percent than the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.000 
um nine more or more percent than the
other<00:01:11.939> one<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.119> guess<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.450> should<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
other one I guess it should be then the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.460 
other one I guess it should be then the
projectile<00:01:14.490> will<00:01:14.670> fizzle<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.150> die

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
projectile will fizzle out and die

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.140 
projectile will fizzle out and die
however<00:01:16.490> certain<00:01:17.490> ones<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.790> them<00:01:17.939> like

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
however certain ones of them like

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.990 
however certain ones of them like
Zelda's<00:01:18.720> side<00:01:19.290> B<00:01:19.470> do<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> lot<00:01:20.549> when<00:01:20.880> they're

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
Zelda's side B do a lot when they're

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.490 
Zelda's side B do a lot when they're
fully<00:01:21.210> charged<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.750> they<00:01:21.869> will<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.049> tweaked

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
fully charged so they will be tweaked

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.410 
fully charged so they will be tweaked
moves<00:01:22.799> because<00:01:23.159> they<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.400> do<00:01:23.490> nine<00:01:23.850> more<00:01:24.150> or

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
moves because they will do nine more or

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.399 
moves because they will do nine more or
more<00:01:25.020> percent<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:26.070> other<00:01:26.220> move<00:01:27.409> special

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
more percent the other move special

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.120 
more percent the other move special
moves<00:01:29.030> basically<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.360> adapt<00:01:31.079> either<00:01:31.439> ground

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
moves basically just adapt either ground

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.390 
moves basically just adapt either ground
move<00:01:32.549> or<00:01:32.909> air<00:01:33.390> move<00:01:33.950> depending<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.130> where<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
move or air move depending on where the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.830 
move or air move depending on where the
hitbox<00:01:35.700> comes<00:01:35.939> out<00:01:36.650> now<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.950> don't<00:01:38.100> mean<00:01:38.490> like

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
hitbox comes out now I don't mean like

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.510 
hitbox comes out now I don't mean like
projectiles<00:01:39.840> vessels<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.619> mean<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:41.040> specials

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
projectiles vessels I mean like specials

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.569 
projectiles vessels I mean like specials
items<00:01:44.780> act<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.990> projectiles<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.860> can

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
items act like projectiles that can

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.969 
items act like projectiles that can
strike<00:01:47.729> multiple<00:01:48.149> objects<00:01:48.619> that<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.770> strike

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
strike multiple objects that can strike

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.719 
strike multiple objects that can strike
multiple<00:01:50.579> objects<00:01:51.470> but<00:01:52.470> only<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.460> time<00:01:53.700> each

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
multiple objects but only one time each

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.789 
multiple objects but only one time each
for<00:01:54.119> example<00:01:54.509> if<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.810> throw<00:01:55.020> my<00:01:55.140> armor<00:01:55.409> piece<00:01:55.590> at

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
for example if I throw my armor piece at

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.819 
for example if I throw my armor piece at
you<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.850> throw<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.149> fireball<00:01:57.439> it'll<00:01:58.439> hit

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
you and you throw a fireball it'll hit

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.069 
you and you throw a fireball it'll hit
the<00:01:58.979> fireball<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.579> it'll<00:02:00.090> stop<00:02:00.329> moving<00:02:00.659> but

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
the fireball and it'll stop moving but

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.840 
the fireball and it'll stop moving but
if<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.380> run<00:02:01.560> into<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.860> item<00:02:02.159> it'll<00:02:02.549> hit<00:02:02.729> you

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
if you run into the item it'll hit you

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.450 
if you run into the item it'll hit you
because<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.329> fireball<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:04.020> not<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.680> part<00:02:05.399> of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
because the fireball is not a part of

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.969 
because the fireball is not a part of
you<00:02:05.960> however<00:02:06.960> your<00:02:07.140> shield<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.829> for

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
you however your shield is so for

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.260 
you however your shield is so for
example<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.310> throw<00:02:08.489> an<00:02:08.610> item<00:02:08.819> at<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.090> you

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
example I throw an item at you you

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.719 
example I throw an item at you you
shield<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.959> then<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.110> grab<00:02:10.319> it

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
shield it and then you grab it

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.500 
shield it and then you grab it
it's<00:02:11.480> all<00:02:11.599> good<00:02:12.610> then<00:02:13.610> we<00:02:13.760> have<00:02:13.879> transcendent

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
it's all good then we have transcendent

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.530 
it's all good then we have transcendent
moves<00:02:14.690> those<00:02:15.230> moves<00:02:15.530> don't<00:02:16.099> interact<00:02:16.540> with

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
moves those moves don't interact with

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.890 
moves those moves don't interact with
any<00:02:17.780> other<00:02:17.930> hitboxes<00:02:18.739> only<00:02:19.310> hurt<00:02:19.519> boxes<00:02:20.000> so

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
any other hitboxes only hurt boxes so

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.410 
any other hitboxes only hurt boxes so
that<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.680> can<00:02:21.890> test<00:02:22.159> if<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.150> move<00:02:23.299> is

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
that you can test if a move is

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.020 
that you can test if a move is
transcendent<00:02:24.019> or<00:02:24.140> not<00:02:24.290> based<00:02:24.950> on<00:02:25.190> if<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.700> stops

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
transcendent or not based on if it stops

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.350 
transcendent or not based on if it stops
projectiles<00:02:26.900> or<00:02:27.230> items<00:02:27.769> so<00:02:28.670> if<00:02:28.910> meh<00:02:29.090> tonight

more than nine percent 21 the damage
comes<00:03:54.750> out<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:56.280> it's<00:03:56.430> just<00:03:56.610> my<00:03:56.730> move

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
we go I didn't even need to frame my

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.290 
we go I didn't even need to frame my
frame<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:42.930> that<00:04:43.140> did<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:43.470> see<00:04:43.620> how<00:04:43.740> we<00:04:43.800> tied

I'm a man and that didn't like
way<00:04:47.070> more<00:04:47.100> percent<00:04:47.640> than<00:04:47.760> mine<00:04:48.200> ok<00:04:49.200> so<00:04:49.260> that's

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
way more percent than mine ok so that's

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.770 
way more percent than mine ok so that's
grounded<00:04:50.040> hair<00:04:50.280> projectile<00:04:51.000> let<00:04:51.300> me<00:04:51.390> show<00:04:51.750> you

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
first pet like what you see the

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.550 
first pet like what you see the
projectile<00:05:16.270> that<00:05:16.300> I<00:05:16.630> through<00:05:16.930> counts<00:05:17.410> as

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
projectile that I through counts as

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.260 
projectile that I through counts as
something<00:05:17.770> different<00:05:17.950> so<00:05:18.490> the<00:05:18.700> armors<00:05:19.090> don't

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
something different so the armors don't

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.970 
something different so the armors don't
hit<00:05:19.390> me<00:05:20.220> and<00:05:21.220> now<00:05:22.530> transcendent<00:05:23.530> i<00:05:23.650> guess<00:05:23.830> i

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
hit me and now transcendent i guess i

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.260 
hit me and now transcendent i guess i
can<00:05:24.100> show<00:05:24.280> you<00:05:24.310> throw<00:05:24.640> the<00:05:24.760> item<00:05:24.940> down<00:05:27.090> my<00:05:28.090> down

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
can show you throw the item down my down

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.880 
can show you throw the item down my down
smash<00:05:28.540> is<00:05:28.690> not<00:05:28.720> interacting<00:05:29.380> with<00:05:29.500> it<00:05:29.650> because

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
smash is not interacting with it because

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.940 
smash is not interacting with it because
it's<00:05:30.190> transcendent<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:35.560> can<00:05:35.710> tell<00:05:35.860> the

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
it's transcendent and you can tell the

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.560 
it's transcendent and you can tell the
hitbox<00:05:36.520> is<00:05:36.670> still<00:05:36.820> active<00:05:37.180> even<00:05:37.270> though<00:05:37.450> the

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
hitbox is still active even though the

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.190 
hitbox is still active even though the
down<00:05:37.720> smash<00:05:37.960> is<00:05:38.080> a<00:05:38.170> part<00:05:38.380> of<00:05:38.470> me<00:05:38.940> um<00:05:39.940> and<00:05:40.720> now<00:05:41.170> i

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
down smash is a part of me um and now i

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.400 
down smash is a part of me um and now i
guess<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:41.740> wanting<00:05:42.130> to<00:05:42.220> show<00:05:42.430> you<00:05:42.490> is

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
guess the wanting to show you is

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:51.720 
guess the wanting to show you is

stupid priority I don't understand how
it<00:06:48.400> works<00:06:48.460> I<00:06:48.760> think<00:06:49.090> it<00:06:49.210> has<00:06:49.330> its<00:06:49.480> own<00:06:49.690> modifier

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:50.790 
it works I think it has its own modifier

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.310 
it works I think it has its own modifier
the<00:06:51.790> closest<00:06:52.330> thing<00:06:52.450> that<00:06:52.480> I<00:06:52.660> can<00:06:52.840> fingered<00:06:53.170> is

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320 
the closest thing that I can fingered is

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.540 
the closest thing that I can fingered is
it's<00:06:53.590> a<00:06:54.540> projectile<00:06:55.540> so<00:06:56.440> it's<00:06:56.650> not<00:06:57.010> attached

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
it's a projectile so it's not attached

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.510 
it's a projectile so it's not attached
to<00:06:57.820> him<00:06:58.090> so<00:06:58.810> when<00:06:59.110> you<00:06:59.290> hit<00:06:59.530> a<00:06:59.590> move<00:06:59.860> into<00:07:00.070> Kings

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
to him so when you hit a move into Kings

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.020 
to him so when you hit a move into Kings
he<00:07:00.880> doesn't<00:07:01.180> get<00:07:01.240> hit<00:07:01.540> and<00:07:02.280> then

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030 
he doesn't get hit and then

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.150 
he doesn't get hit and then
you<00:07:04.270> just<00:07:04.480> I<00:07:04.780> don't<00:07:05.410> really<00:07:05.620> know<00:07:05.890> then<00:07:06.100> you

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 
you just I don't really know then you

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.620 
you just I don't really know then you
get<00:07:06.280> hit<00:07:06.370> by<00:07:06.460> the<00:07:06.520> next<00:07:06.790> one<00:07:06.940> it's<00:07:07.120> stupid<00:07:07.540> it

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:07.630 
get hit by the next one it's stupid it

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:08.640 
get hit by the next one it's stupid it
doesn't<00:07:07.870> make<00:07:07.930> sense<00:07:07.990> to<00:07:08.260> me<00:07:08.350> and<00:07:08.530> I<00:07:08.590> don't

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.650 
doesn't make sense to me and I don't

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.370 
doesn't make sense to me and I don't
understand<00:07:09.130> it<00:07:09.690> and<00:07:10.690> my<00:07:10.810> neutral<00:07:11.110> air<00:07:11.230> it

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380 
understand it and my neutral air it

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.080 
understand it and my neutral air it
always<00:07:11.650> enters<00:07:11.890> the<00:07:11.980> MOOC<00:07:12.160> you<00:07:12.400> and<00:07:12.550> it<00:07:12.640> kind

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
always enters the MOOC you and it kind

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.670 
always enters the MOOC you and it kind
of<00:07:13.270> acts<00:07:13.510> like<00:07:13.780> an<00:07:14.140> item<00:07:14.380> attached<00:07:14.650> me<00:07:14.920> again

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
of acts like an item attached me again

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.400 
of acts like an item attached me again
so<00:07:17.680> like<00:07:17.920> for<00:07:18.250> example<00:07:18.340> if<00:07:18.790> you<00:07:18.940> throw<00:07:19.410> armor

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410 
so like for example if you throw armor

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.130 
so like for example if you throw armor
piece<00:07:20.590> at<00:07:20.770> me<00:07:20.920> and<00:07:21.130> I<00:07:21.640> hit<00:07:21.790> it<00:07:21.910> with<00:07:21.940> Nair<00:07:22.180> it'll

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.140 
piece at me and I hit it with Nair it'll

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.630 
piece at me and I hit it with Nair it'll
hit<00:07:23.500> the<00:07:23.650> armor<00:07:23.890> piece<00:07:24.070> and<00:07:24.280> then<00:07:24.370> I'll<00:07:24.490> get

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:24.640 
hit the armor piece and then I'll get

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.770 
hit the armor piece and then I'll get
hit<00:07:24.820> which<00:07:25.000> doesn't<00:07:25.270> make<00:07:25.360> sense<00:07:25.570> but

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.780 
hit which doesn't make sense but

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.840 
hit which doesn't make sense but
whatever<00:07:26.040> so<00:07:27.040> I<00:07:27.070> guess<00:07:27.190> there<00:07:27.610> is<00:07:27.820> a

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:27.850 
whatever so I guess there is a

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.310 
whatever so I guess there is a
projectile<00:07:28.420> that's<00:07:28.630> attached<00:07:28.870> to<00:07:28.900> me<00:07:29.140> so<00:07:29.290> you

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.320 
projectile that's attached to me so you

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.650 
projectile that's attached to me so you
can't<00:07:29.530> report<00:07:29.830> it<00:07:31.110> and<00:07:33.090> just<00:07:34.090> as<00:07:34.240> a<00:07:34.270> reference

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:34.660 
can't report it and just as a reference

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.610 
can't report it and just as a reference
all<00:07:34.810> Mars<00:07:35.140> Pikmin<00:07:35.680> are<00:07:36.180> items<00:07:37.470> they<00:07:38.470> can

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:38.620 
all Mars Pikmin are items they can

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.830 
all Mars Pikmin are items they can
strike<00:07:38.800> multiple<00:07:39.190> objects<00:07:39.550> once<00:07:40.270> each<00:07:40.510> time

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 
strike multiple objects once each time

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.790 
strike multiple objects once each time
but<00:07:41.830> they<00:07:42.010> get<00:07:42.190> stuffed<00:07:42.610> really<00:07:43.090> easy<00:07:43.800> that's

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 
but they get stuffed really easy that's

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.760 
but they get stuffed really easy that's
why<00:07:45.100> a<00:07:45.130> lot<00:07:45.310> of<00:07:45.490> characters<00:07:46.030> with<00:07:46.590> decent<00:07:47.590> down

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:47.770 
why a lot of characters with decent down

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.390 
why a lot of characters with decent down
airs<00:07:48.010> just<00:07:48.910> like<00:07:49.750> fall<00:07:50.620> on<00:07:50.890> him<00:07:51.070> with<00:07:51.220> downer

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 
airs just like fall on him with downer

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.090 
airs just like fall on him with downer
and<00:07:51.670> they<00:07:51.820> always<00:07:52.090> win<00:07:52.650> so<00:07:53.650> I<00:07:53.680> hope<00:07:53.860> that<00:07:53.950> this

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:54.100 
and they always win so I hope that this

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.160 
and they always win so I hope that this
