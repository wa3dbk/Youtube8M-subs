00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.030 

um<00:00:00.269> basically<00:00:00.900> it's<00:00:01.050> four<00:00:01.319> sections<00:00:01.770> which<00:00:01.920> is

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
um basically it's four sections which is

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.679 
um basically it's four sections which is
like<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.190> diamond<00:00:02.490> section<00:00:02.909> so<00:00:03.300> it's<00:00:03.449> kind<00:00:03.629> of

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
like a diamond section so it's kind of

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.950 
like a diamond section so it's kind of
like<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:04.020> beats<00:00:04.259> over<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.770> ear

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960 
like the beats over the ear

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.310 
like the beats over the ear
and<00:00:06.069> the<00:00:07.069> other<00:00:07.250> piece<00:00:07.519> over<00:00:07.790> the<00:00:08.029> year<00:00:08.320> and

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
and the other piece over the year and

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.650 
and the other piece over the year and
then<00:00:09.530> you<00:00:09.620> would<00:00:09.769> separate<00:00:10.370> the<00:00:10.700> top<00:00:10.940> and<00:00:11.330> the

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
then you would separate the top and the

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.039 
then you would separate the top and the
back<00:00:12.070> the<00:00:13.070> 19<00:00:13.370> base<00:00:13.549> we<00:00:13.789> have<00:00:13.969> core<00:00:14.299> steps<00:00:14.750> and

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
back the 19 base we have core steps and

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.720 
back the 19 base we have core steps and
hopefully<00:00:15.320> you<00:00:15.590> can<00:00:15.680> see<00:00:15.859> my<00:00:15.980> sections<00:00:16.400> okay

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
hopefully you can see my sections okay

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.050 
hopefully you can see my sections okay
so<00:00:16.789> we<00:00:17.060> have<00:00:17.180> one<00:00:17.210> here<00:00:18.820> one<00:00:19.820> here

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.900 

here<00:00:23.690> and<00:00:24.260> then<00:00:25.160> the<00:00:25.340> one<00:00:25.520> coming<00:00:25.790> back

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
here and then the one coming back

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.670 
here and then the one coming back
through<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:26.780> crown<00:00:27.970> so<00:00:29.110> when<00:00:30.110> we<00:00:30.230> work<00:00:30.440> with

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
through the crown so when we work with

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.190 
through the crown so when we work with
braids<00:00:31.070> through<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:32.360> most<00:00:32.570> important<00:00:32.990> thing

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
braids through the most important thing

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.800 
braids through the most important thing
is<00:00:33.580> sectioning<00:00:34.580> and<00:00:34.820> then<00:00:34.940> also<00:00:35.210> keeping<00:00:35.750> your

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
is sectioning and then also keeping your

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.320 
is sectioning and then also keeping your
ear<00:00:36.260> sections<00:00:36.740> been<00:00:36.830> incredibly<00:00:37.220> clean<00:00:37.640> but

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
ear sections been incredibly clean but

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.910 
ear sections been incredibly clean but
the<00:00:38.450> actual<00:00:38.780> manipulations<00:00:39.530> of<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:39.770> are<00:00:39.890> very

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
the actual manipulations of it are very

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.020 
the actual manipulations of it are very
very<00:00:40.370> very<00:00:40.520> simple<00:00:41.140> so<00:00:42.140> when<00:00:42.680> you<00:00:43.010> gather<00:00:43.760> this

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
very very simple so when you gather this

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.090 
very very simple so when you gather this
hair<00:00:44.330> you<00:00:44.809> want<00:00:44.900> to<00:00:45.050> gather<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.500> first<00:00:45.830> piece

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
hair you want to gather the first piece

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
hair you want to gather the first piece
come<00:00:46.430> over<00:00:46.640> here<00:00:47.260> into<00:00:48.309> like<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.520> perk<00:00:49.760> feeds

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
come over here into like the perk feeds

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.350 
come over here into like the perk feeds
in<00:00:50.510> your<00:00:50.809> left<00:00:51.050> hand<00:00:51.400> then<00:00:52.400> take<00:00:52.700> with<00:00:52.940> second

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
in your left hand then take with second

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.190 
in your left hand then take with second
heat<00:00:53.510> from<00:00:53.780> underneath

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
heat from underneath

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.300 
heat from underneath
but<00:00:55.770> regarding<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.280> second

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.800 

what<00:01:00.310> could<00:01:00.430> be<00:01:00.520> drawn<00:01:00.730> something<00:01:01.060> like<00:01:01.330> that

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
what could be drawn something like that

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.880 
what could be drawn something like that
so<00:01:02.140> one<00:01:02.800> piece<00:01:03.100> here<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.870> finger<00:01:05.230> one

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
so one piece here in the finger one

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.210 
so one piece here in the finger one
piece<00:01:06.130> here<00:01:06.720> then<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.930> third<00:01:08.230> piece<00:01:08.680> comes<00:01:09.010> to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
piece here then the third piece comes to

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.880 
piece here then the third piece comes to
look<00:01:09.370> up<00:01:09.550> down<00:01:10.180> into<00:01:10.780> like<00:01:10.900> my<00:01:11.140> ring<00:01:11.410> finger

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
look up down into like my ring finger

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.080 
look up down into like my ring finger
o'clock

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
o'clock

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.859 
o'clock
here<00:01:14.719> and<00:01:15.109> now<00:01:15.229> I<00:01:15.259> have<00:01:16.359> let's<00:01:17.359> build<00:01:17.570> it<00:01:17.630> down

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
here and now I have let's build it down

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.930 
here and now I have let's build it down
that's<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.259> one

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
that's the one

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.600 
that's the one
to<00:01:20.510> here

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.200 

three<00:01:24.210> feet

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.310 

do<00:01:27.780> three<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.180> then<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.300> fourth<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.630> finally

do three and then the fourth one finally
comes<00:01:31.530> from<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:31.980> and<00:01:32.190> wrapped<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.880> my<00:01:33.150> pinky

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
comes from here and wrapped in my pinky

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.440 
comes from here and wrapped in my pinky
but<00:01:34.909> now<00:01:35.060> I<00:01:35.090> have<00:01:35.540> my<00:01:35.990> score

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:49.350 

okay<00:01:39.450> hopefully<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.439> okay

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.000 

three

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010

okay<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.420> now<00:01:53.600> when<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.230> have<00:01:54.260> this<00:01:54.620> braid

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
okay so now when you have this braid

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.540 
okay so now when you have this braid
gathered<00:01:55.970> here<00:01:56.180> you<00:01:56.390> want<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.630> take<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.830> third

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
gathered here you want to take the third

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.940 
gathered here you want to take the third
heat<00:01:59.060> so<00:01:59.540> now<00:01:59.720> I'm<00:02:00.080> working<00:02:00.260> with<00:02:00.410> both<00:02:00.680> hands

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
heat so now I'm working with both hands

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.890 
heat so now I'm working with both hands
but<00:02:01.280> basically<00:02:01.610> this<00:02:02.210> braid<00:02:02.480> is<00:02:02.630> going<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.840> be

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
but basically this braid is going to be

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.870 
but basically this braid is going to be
passed<00:02:03.110> from<00:02:03.380> one<00:02:03.470> hand<00:02:03.980> to<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.400> other<00:02:04.520> hand

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880

passed from one hand to the other hand
so<00:02:05.750> as<00:02:05.780> I'm<00:02:06.050> working<00:02:06.200> this<00:02:06.500> braid<00:02:06.800> through<00:02:07.130> I

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
so as I'm working this braid through I

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.550 
so as I'm working this braid through I
basically<00:02:08.240> want<00:02:08.510> to<00:02:08.540> take<00:02:08.630> this<00:02:09.020> braid<00:02:09.350> and

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
basically want to take this braid and
