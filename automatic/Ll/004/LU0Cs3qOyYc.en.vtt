00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.540
 I do not 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.019
 of the summer 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.210
 hello and welcome to the chain 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.329
 former officials present my name ex 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.890
 warning so I will present you a 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.350
 new video about a bug that I 'm there 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.110
 found myself on gta 5 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.309
 I hope to have discovered you 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.890
 discovered myself because I have not seen 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:52.260
 videos on it so how to hover 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:55.980
 with a bike and it's easy 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.320
 create your circuit on gta 5 you 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.879
 do online multiplayer ago 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.219
 stupid editors something like that 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.989
 you put a start of the race will be more 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.259
 high hill of the game you put the hungry 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.130
 down the descent and you do that 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:13.020
 I show you 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.149
 So here I am showing you a quick 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.820
 little demo of a normal jump and a 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.500
 jump where I go flat and so first 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.039
 second normal jump jump hover 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.039
 Warning 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.619
 john john deere 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.470
 it's impressive when she is 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:41.260
 all over 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:41.260
 yes yes I saw myself 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.470
 a figaro I found a bug look at you 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.770
 put your bike upside down 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:03.370
 it's a crazy thing look look I 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:07.510
 fly away it's a crazy thing 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:10.899
 in fact as you have seen so 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.310
 on these two excerpts we will say that I 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.690
 go 500 meters further on the 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.870
 second video 1 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.930
 see the difference so it's not 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.160
 hard to get down you see the only 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.810
 thing I'm doing it's right but that the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.489
 joystick back this is not hard 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.680
 to find 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.270
 good it's fun it's not stolen a good 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.070
 it's not I did not find a guy from 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.959
 sick but good hover with a motorcycle 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.250
 that's not bad 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.040
 what you have to do is just a 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.290
 point high enough because good on 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.850
 soups if I do not know if you 're going over 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.140
 far away or what maybe it can 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.850
 advance on some stuff I know 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.100
 nothing he's lying on big jumps it's 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.160
 really see see there I'm really going 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.170
 much further than a classic jump 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.340
 so and again because on the first 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.720
 jump I showed you ch 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.670
 just do a backflip I'm going a 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.170
 little further than a normal jump without 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.370
 make flip flip that's why 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.480
 besides that I found the bug 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.470
 Moreover, it is by making 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.850
 backflips so here it is so it's a bug 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.640
 nice to do so it's just for 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.900
 hover with the bike so here's for 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.390
 to go squarely on the city in 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.620
 below 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.090
 so that's how flat with a motorcycle 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.430
 so you just have to put your 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.840
 joystick back to be the most 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.730
 treacherous airs possible with the 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.459
 motorcycle it's pretty complicated in the sense 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.120
 that your character wants to put all the 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.370
 time flat it's going to be boring because 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.230
 if you go too far back 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.489
 fall too fast if you fall and if 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.840
 you release the joystick it will go 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.260
 put forward you will fall too 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.880
 it takes a foot very small 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.739
 little on the joystick backwards for 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.680
 really stabilize your character 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.630
 So here we are, I hope this video 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.910
 you will have liked to try to have it edited 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.980
 your race all that and try to do 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.340
 what kind of toy it's going to be 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.140
 so fun so look at the others 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.720
 videos share this video if you 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.550
