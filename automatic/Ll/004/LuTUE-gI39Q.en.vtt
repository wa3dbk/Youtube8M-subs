00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
of guys doing we're going to sink all

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.150 
of guys doing we're going to sink all
the<00:01:44.090> way<00:01:44.210> down<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.810> bomb<00:01:44.960> come<00:01:45.500> halfway<00:01:45.740> up

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
the way down to the bomb come halfway up

again come three quarters the way up
the<00:01:50.270> idea<00:01:50.660> is<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:51.020> never<00:01:51.320> want<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.680> take<00:01:51.830> the

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
the idea is you never want to take the

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.160 
the idea is you never want to take the
tension<00:01:52.250> off<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.550> quads<00:01:52.940> there's<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:53.840> really

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
tension off the quads there's a really

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.320 
tension off the quads there's a really
strict<00:01:54.410> movement<00:01:54.890> weights<00:01:55.369> not<00:01:55.580> fun<00:01:55.910> but

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
strict movement weights not fun but

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.670 
strict movement weights not fun but
strict<00:01:56.660> form<00:01:56.930> is

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:29.559 

get<00:02:01.520> even<00:02:02.120> prefer

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569
