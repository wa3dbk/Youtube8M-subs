00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.360
 hello today i will you 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.120
 present a knit stitch so he 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.590
 is to make a kind of motives 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.420
 in herringbone that is called in English 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.710
 the art is from where herring stop 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.510
 and which is rather thick enough with a 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.680
 look pretty nice so there it is small 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.570
 so you see a lot of bordiot but 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.230
 if you do it a wider you 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.820
 will mostly have this motive there all along 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.260
 and that's so it's nice enough to do 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.969
 like point he looks complicated 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.790
 some say it is but in 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.920
 reality it 's not at all if we 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.690
 try to understand a very movement 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.960
 fast I advise you to take for 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.719
 this son apps for this this absolutely point 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.890
 any son the condition that this 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.360
 is a filter that allows to do 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.710
 point out the points of course that 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.149
 that they are not too much texture is but 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.890
 you can always try that can 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.180
 to be nice 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.160
 I chose charm because it is 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.660
 big and well round which allows to 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.070
 see the point well and that allows me to 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.920
 explain things correctly 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.090
 charmed adria fix a super cop who 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.040
 is sweet because a little cashmere 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.540
 in and that's very easy to 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.650
 work because it does not disintegrate 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.260
 everything there are a lot of little ones 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.119
 son that he constitutes douala then for 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.570
 do 7 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.390
 this texture is the other side 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.810
 info to make his texture and this point 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.020
 this is how you have to do 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.909
 can mount the number of mails that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.490
 you want it and you can try 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.320
 to mount the stitches so as to 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.770
 cows 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.440
 too tight for the first rank so and 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.570
 so you 've got lema up here here you go 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.479
 how it works 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.840
 you will knit two stitches 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.159
 together taking strands by 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.979
 behind 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:59.240
 so you will pass your needles 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:01.970
 like that and take a stitch and take 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.890
 your son you're going to knit both 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.670
 hands and normally not 100 like 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.179
 it 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.500
 from behind to the front she was pulling this 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.650
 son as his verve in front of you and there 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.450
 as usual you will make it fall 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.830
 is the godmother but there you have it 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.230
 knit 2 is what you will do 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.060
 and it's the strangeness of this point it's 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.100
 that you will release only one of 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.600
 two stitches knit and you go 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.090
 do the same thing and transplant them 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:35.630
 in the knitting 2 was pulling the loop towards 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.200
 you and released only the first 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:43.640
 of the two and we continue I take the 2 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:50.120
 from behind I knit I pull my son 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:56.150
 loose jeans one I knit 2 I pull my 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:58.610
 son I release a loops hop I 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.120
 continues until the end of the rhÃ´ne then 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.920
 I advise you when you do that 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.209
 to check your miles well 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.680
 loose do not pull too much because 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.560
 it's a point that can be difficult to 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.180
 to knit on laurent number two that's 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:18.800
 a big one pattern that is done on two 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.520
 ranks here are shot 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:26.360
 green lease is released Navy ideas 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:31.400
 to sting and brown from the back and 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.420
 I do not think that 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.690
 become the places I did that 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.760
 of image here you arrive at the end there 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.470
 you stay tomorrow and on the eur / 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.450
 the eel you take them all 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.030
 two points behind you do 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.400
 exactly the same thing to release 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.230
 at the level remains a mesh here and you 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.490
 go there knit then portrays the 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.350
 border you want but I I the 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:57.950
 knit at the place normally and that's it 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.380
 you made your first rank in 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.720
 attack the number two rank for 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.610
 as much work 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.020
 here we are and here we will knit to 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.150
 the wrong way exactly the same way 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.480
 that just now will take two of 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.540
 near you cut the past of aiguilhe 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.040
 messina both arms we pass the 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:21.500
 wire as always when we're in 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:25.520
 knit in this sense here here is 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.840
 we remove the loop there we will do 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.480
 drop cable only one of the two 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.480
 always the same thing here 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:39.219
 then we will continue my two 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:43.110
 son knits them back I hold my 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:43.110
 mouth I'm going to fall a d2 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:50.750
 we continue to the end 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:53.930
 if I get to man I go there 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:58.790
 shot I will fall both I knit 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:01.730
 but must still behind the slide 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.660
 Here then it goes a lot faster 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.030
 camp I'm not doing a 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.710
 demo and that I 'll pay attention to that 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.280
 I do it there is a rhythm that is taken 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.420
 of course but at the back it's 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.440
 always a little more time from 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.300
 that's why you have to be careful 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.060
 of good to have matches of the miles h 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.060
 not games 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.910
 so we're at last my throw a 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.630
 little oil 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.630
 here 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.810
 3 mhz 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.740
 humor s2 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.460
 and there I have more than one and that game 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:56.790
 knit back stupidly while 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:59.340
 only as I would normally and 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.530
 now that's how that's 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.290
 give back some of the species 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.500
 line like that and that's what it 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.500
 given 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:14.160
 on that side and so here at the very beginning 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.070
 I had fun taking a needle 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.620
 of age and needles number 12 with 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.820
 charm is good with this point of having 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.120
 Needles a little bigger 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.560
 that them and ask him by the label 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.510
 villa the label she asks for eight 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.130
 month I squarely took 2,12 and at 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.870
 I wanted to see what it was like 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.160
 to have a larger needle whose 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.280
 I took a needle 12 a needle 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.630
 10 and so you have a point which is a 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.370
 little bigger than the other do a 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.449
 quite nice effect and then when you 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.370
 have both needles of the same 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:41.820
 size you have east of oran who have 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.889
 the same 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.930
 the two little stockings that have the same 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.289
 size but if you have big ones and 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.990
 little ones 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.950
 this is to alternate my example and 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.479
 not very nice because we see 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.479
 a lot of borders but if you 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:55.979
 imagine this central part like that 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.270
 expand on the width you can 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:00.060
 do a solo of you can do some 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:03.180
 lots of things with that it's a point that 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.110
 is very nice and will leave his thick have 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.030
 very hot for the winter 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.030
 it's up to you soon
