00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.440 

okay<00:00:23.000> so<00:00:23.410> I<00:00:24.410> got<00:00:24.820> someone<00:00:25.820> gave<00:00:26.060> me<00:00:26.090> actually

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
okay so I got someone gave me actually

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.800 
okay so I got someone gave me actually
that<00:00:27.020> extreme<00:00:27.530> glimmer<00:00:27.860> set<00:00:28.190> and<00:00:28.460> I<00:00:29.420> was

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
that extreme glimmer set and I was

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.350 
that extreme glimmer set and I was
really<00:00:30.110> excited<00:00:30.410> to<00:00:30.680> try<00:00:30.920> it<00:00:31.180> but<00:00:32.180> it's

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
really excited to try it but it's

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.860 
really excited to try it but it's
definitely<00:00:33.970> hard<00:00:34.970> time<00:00:35.180> working<00:00:35.390> with<00:00:35.690> it

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
definitely hard time working with it

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.020 
definitely hard time working with it
without<00:00:36.200> getting<00:00:36.489> fallout<00:00:37.489> like<00:00:37.760> all<00:00:38.000> over

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
without getting fallout like all over

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.700 
without getting fallout like all over
themselves<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:38.960> looking<00:00:39.200> like<00:00:39.290> a<00:00:39.350> glitter

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
themselves and looking like a glitter

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.400 
themselves and looking like a glitter
ball<00:00:39.920> in<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.190> end<00:00:40.340> so<00:00:41.030> I've<00:00:41.750> been<00:00:41.900> turning<00:00:42.170> for

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
ball in the end so I've been turning for

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.720 
ball in the end so I've been turning for
the<00:00:42.440> last<00:00:42.650> couple<00:00:42.830> of<00:00:43.010> weeks<00:00:43.220> to<00:00:43.400> find<00:00:43.610> a

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
the last couple of weeks to find a

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.750 
the last couple of weeks to find a
solution<00:00:44.059> to<00:00:44.300> that<00:00:45.290> particular<00:00:45.590> problem<00:00:46.160> and

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
solution to that particular problem and

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.660 
solution to that particular problem and
I<00:00:47.300> think<00:00:47.330> I<00:00:47.630> sort<00:00:47.840> of<00:00:47.960> have<00:00:48.170> it's<00:00:48.500> not<00:00:48.710> maybe<00:00:49.550> a

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
I think I sort of have it's not maybe a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.990 
I think I sort of have it's not maybe a
perfect<00:00:50.450> solution<00:00:50.870> but<00:00:50.900> I<00:00:51.290> think<00:00:51.770> it's<00:00:51.920> on<00:00:52.760> its

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
perfect solution but I think it's on its

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.140 
perfect solution but I think it's on its
way<00:00:53.089> so<00:00:53.780> what<00:00:54.199> I<00:00:54.230> have<00:00:54.530> is<00:00:54.820> clinique<00:00:55.820> city

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
way so what I have is clinique city

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.829 
way so what I have is clinique city
block<00:00:56.500> 40<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:58.000> what<00:00:59.000> it<00:00:59.120> is<00:00:59.300> this<00:00:59.510> that<00:00:59.690> you

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
block 40 and what it is this that you

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.420 
block 40 and what it is this that you
can<00:01:00.019> use<00:01:00.140> it<00:01:00.260> on<00:01:00.350> your<00:01:00.500> face<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:01.010> it<00:01:01.129> says<00:01:01.309> you

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
can use it on your face and it says you

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.939 
can use it on your face and it says you
can<00:01:01.580> use<00:01:01.730> it<00:01:01.760> on<00:01:02.120> your<00:01:02.480> eyes<00:01:02.660> as<00:01:02.930> well<00:01:03.110> and<00:01:03.500> it's

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
can use it on your eyes as well and it's

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.439 
can use it on your eyes as well and it's
supposed<00:01:04.220> to<00:01:04.309> be<00:01:04.460> like<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.670> primer<00:01:05.030> for<00:01:05.300> your

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
supposed to be like a primer for your

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.090 
supposed to be like a primer for your
makeup<00:01:05.780> as<00:01:05.960> well<00:01:05.990> as<00:01:06.350> like<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:06.560> sunblock<00:01:07.010> and

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
makeup as well as like a sunblock and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.790 
makeup as well as like a sunblock and
stuff<00:01:07.520> so<00:01:07.790> I<00:01:08.000> I'd<00:01:08.750> been<00:01:08.960> using<00:01:09.290> this<00:01:09.380> because<00:01:09.710> I

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
stuff so I I'd been using this because I

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.470 
stuff so I I'd been using this because I
ran<00:01:09.950> out<00:01:10.130> of<00:01:10.159> primer<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:11.180> works<00:01:11.300> pretty

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
ran out of primer and it works pretty

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.390 
ran out of primer and it works pretty
fairly<00:01:12.110> well<00:01:12.350> as<00:01:12.470> a<00:01:12.500> primer<00:01:12.800> it's<00:01:13.010> not<00:01:13.159> great

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
fairly well as a primer it's not great

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.890 
fairly well as a primer it's not great
if<00:01:13.580> you<00:01:13.670> have<00:01:13.820> oily<00:01:14.030> eyelids<00:01:14.480> it<00:01:14.630> probably

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
if you have oily eyelids it probably

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.470 
if you have oily eyelids it probably
wouldn't<00:01:15.050> work<00:01:15.110> at<00:01:15.350> all<00:01:15.440> but<00:01:15.740> um<00:01:16.040> so<00:01:17.030> it's<00:01:17.270> kind

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
wouldn't work at all but um so it's kind

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.120 
wouldn't work at all but um so it's kind
of<00:01:17.540> this<00:01:17.690> mixed<00:01:17.990> between<00:01:18.080> like<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.770> moisturizer

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
of this mixed between like a moisturizer

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.260 
of this mixed between like a moisturizer
and<00:01:19.580> a<00:01:19.670> primer<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.590> so<00:01:21.590> I<00:01:21.860> got<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.340> idea<00:01:23.000> to

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
and a primer and so I got the idea to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.660 
and a primer and so I got the idea to
take<00:01:23.840> some<00:01:24.080> of<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:24.590> mix<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.430> with<00:01:25.550> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
take some of this and mix it with the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.420 
take some of this and mix it with the
extreme<00:01:26.090> glimmers<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:27.680> that<00:01:28.100> way<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:28.370> makes

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
extreme glimmers and that way it makes

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.980 
extreme glimmers and that way it makes
kind<00:01:28.790> of<00:01:28.940> like<00:01:29.090> more<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.390> like<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.630> cream

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
kind of like more of like a cream

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.080 
kind of like more of like a cream
eyeshadow<00:01:30.020> paste<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.280> that<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:31.520> don't<00:01:31.670> get<00:01:31.790> so

eyeshadow paste so that you don't get so

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.140 
eyeshadow paste so that you don't get so
much<00:01:32.300> fallout<00:01:32.570> on<00:01:32.900> your<00:01:33.460> face<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:34.970> do

already<00:01:45.830> done<00:01:45.950> here<00:01:46.700> is<00:01:46.820> I<00:01:46.970> have<00:01:47.000> on<00:01:47.360> primer<00:01:48.110> I

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
already done here is I have on primer I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.260 
already done here is I have on primer I
since<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:49.040> did<00:01:49.190> I<00:01:49.220> ran<00:01:49.520> out<00:01:49.640> of<00:01:49.670> primer<00:01:49.940> I<00:01:50.090> got

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
since I did I ran out of primer I got

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.150 
since I did I ran out of primer I got
the<00:01:50.480> drugstore<00:01:51.260> brand<00:01:51.500> I<00:01:51.620> got<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.890> Loreal

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
the drugstore brand I got the Loreal

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.490 
the drugstore brand I got the Loreal
decrease<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.180> that's<00:01:53.750> what<00:01:53.930> i<00:01:53.960> have<00:01:54.140> on<00:01:54.170> as<00:01:54.470> a

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
decrease so that's what i have on as a

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.670 
decrease so that's what i have on as a
base<00:01:54.710> but<00:01:54.980> i<00:01:55.010> think<00:01:55.370> probably<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.680> Urban

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
base but i think probably the Urban

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.840 
base but i think probably the Urban
Decay<00:01:57.710> primer<00:01:58.160> potion<00:01:58.400> or<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:01.340> prime<00:02:01.640> time

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
Decay primer potion or the prime time

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.580 
Decay primer potion or the prime time
for<00:02:02.030> eyes<00:02:02.150> from<00:02:02.480> bare<00:02:02.660> essentials<00:02:03.140> would<00:02:03.440> be

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
for eyes from bare essentials would be

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.970 
for eyes from bare essentials would be
better<00:02:04.600> so<00:02:05.600> but<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.140> l'oreal<00:02:06.470> one's<00:02:06.710> not<00:02:06.950> bad

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
better so but the l'oreal one's not bad

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.040 
better so but the l'oreal one's not bad
i<00:02:07.160> mean<00:02:07.430> if<00:02:07.550> you<00:02:07.700> again<00:02:08.330> don't<00:02:08.539> have<00:02:08.720> loyally

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
i mean if you again don't have loyally

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.359 
i mean if you again don't have loyally
eyelids<00:02:09.410> i<00:02:09.530> think<00:02:09.739> it<00:02:09.830> would<00:02:09.979> be<00:02:10.099> a<00:02:10.129> great

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
honey amber in the crease and then i

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.750 
honey amber in the crease and then i
already<00:02:24.290> put<00:02:24.410> on<00:02:24.470> some<00:02:24.800> liner<00:02:25.040> here<00:02:25.459> and

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
that's the smoky quartz so what i'm

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.040 
that's the smoky quartz so what i'm
going<00:02:28.999> to<00:02:29.060> do<00:02:29.239> is<00:02:29.269> just<00:02:29.540> take<00:02:29.930> some<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.349> this

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
going to do is just take some of this

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.050 
going to do is just take some of this
see<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.770> can<00:02:32.950> see<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.220> kind<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:33.670> looks<00:02:33.850> like<00:02:33.940> a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
see you can see it kind of looks like a

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.930 
see you can see it kind of looks like a
mac<00:02:34.330> pigment<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.410> jar<00:02:35.650> but<00:02:35.950> it's<00:02:36.550> really

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
mac pigment in the jar but it's really

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.030 
mac pigment in the jar but it's really
actually<00:02:37.660> kind<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.290> different<00:02:38.680> than<00:02:38.860> Mac

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
actually kind of different than Mac

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.510 
actually kind of different than Mac
pigments<00:02:39.520> so<00:02:40.530> what<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.560> do<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:41.800> I'm<00:02:42.190> just<00:02:42.340> like

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
pigments so what I do is I'm just like

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.160 
pigments so what I do is I'm just like
spooning<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.240> kind<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:44.080> top<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:46.170> little

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
spooning it kind of on top of the little

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.840 
spooning it kind of on top of the little
blob<00:02:47.380> of<00:02:47.850> moisturizer<00:02:48.850> stuff<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:54.550> I'm

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
blob of moisturizer stuff and so I'm

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.810 
blob of moisturizer stuff and so I'm
just<00:02:55.030> going<00:02:55.210> to<00:02:55.300> take<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.510> few<00:02:55.960> of<00:02:56.400> those<00:02:57.400> and

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
just going to take a few of those and

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.820 
just going to take a few of those and
then<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.750> might<00:02:58.900> want<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.200> just<00:02:59.290> try<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.590> mix

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
then you might want to just try to mix

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.130 
then you might want to just try to mix
it<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.250> little<00:03:00.400> batch<00:03:01.240> at<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.540> time<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.050> you

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
it in a little batch at a time so you

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.750 
it in a little batch at a time so you
can<00:03:02.290> try<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.530> work<00:03:02.680> with<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:02.980> proportions<00:03:03.550> and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
can try to work with the proportions and

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.660 
can try to work with the proportions and
get<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.060> just<00:03:04.210> right<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:05.500> makes<00:03:06.070> this<00:03:06.250> kind<00:03:06.490> of

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
get it just right it makes this kind of

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.340 
get it just right it makes this kind of
creamy<00:03:07.260> paste<00:03:08.260> like<00:03:09.070> that<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:10.170> that's<00:03:11.170> what

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
creamy paste like that and that's what

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.210 
creamy paste like that and that's what
you<00:03:11.500> want<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.710> can<00:03:14.710> see<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:14.950> kind<00:03:15.100> of

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
you want and you can see it kind of

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.890 
you want and you can see it kind of
sticks<00:03:15.460> to<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.730> brush<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:15.940> little<00:03:16.090> bit<00:03:16.450> but<00:03:16.750> you

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
sticks to the brush a little bit but you

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.270 
sticks to the brush a little bit but you
do<00:03:17.080> get<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.800> can<00:03:17.950> see<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.850> bronze<00:03:19.240> space

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
too just to see how smooth it is and

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.890 
too just to see how smooth it is and
it's<00:03:26.110> looking<00:03:26.470> pretty<00:03:26.710> good<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.690> all<00:03:28.690> I'm

it's looking pretty good so all I'm
going<00:03:28.960> to<00:03:29.080> do<00:03:29.260> now<00:03:29.410> is<00:03:29.710> just<00:03:29.800> use<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.880> like<00:03:31.000> I

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
going to do now is just use it like I

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.600 
going to do now is just use it like I
would<00:03:31.420> a<00:03:31.450> foiled<00:03:32.110> kind<00:03:32.800> of<00:03:32.890> eye<00:03:33.010> shadow<00:03:33.040> and

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
would a foiled kind of eye shadow and

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.660 
would a foiled kind of eye shadow and
I'm<00:03:34.390> just<00:03:34.630> gonna<00:03:34.810> you<00:03:35.800> know<00:03:35.920> kind<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.310> Pat<00:03:36.489> it

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
I'm just gonna you know kind of Pat it

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
I'm just gonna you know kind of Pat it
on<00:03:36.790> there<00:03:37.980> they<00:03:38.980> don't<00:03:39.220> blend<00:03:39.690> exceptionally

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
on there they don't blend exceptionally

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.410 
on there they don't blend exceptionally
well<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.200> especially<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:42.550> silver<00:03:42.940> one<00:03:43.120> it's

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
well and especially the silver one it's

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.860 
well and especially the silver one it's
kind<00:03:43.630> of<00:03:44.580> really<00:03:45.580> bad<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:46.060> like<00:03:46.300> blending<00:03:46.750> it

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
kind of really bad of like blending it

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.300 
kind of really bad of like blending it
into<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.739> other<00:03:47.920> extreme<00:03:48.730> glimmers<00:03:49.270> so

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
into the other extreme glimmers so

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.670 
into the other extreme glimmers so
that's<00:03:51.310> why<00:03:51.520> I'm<00:03:51.700> just<00:03:52.060> using<00:03:52.270> regular<00:03:52.680> non

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
that's why I'm just using regular non

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.010 
that's why I'm just using regular non
extreme<00:03:54.190> Clippers<00:03:54.610> as<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:55.510> base<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.900> this

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
extreme Clippers as the base of this

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.520 
extreme Clippers as the base of this
look<00:03:56.850> just<00:03:57.850> because<00:03:58.450> they're<00:03:59.020> kind<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.350> hard

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
look just because they're kind of hard

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.979 
look just because they're kind of hard
to<00:03:59.709> blend<00:04:00.040> into<00:04:00.310> each<00:04:00.489> each<00:04:00.940> other<00:04:01.270> even

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
to blend into each each other even

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.840 
to blend into each each other even
though<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:02.320> can<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.830> did<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.040> look<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.520> maybe

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
though you can I did a look and maybe

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.910 
though you can I did a look and maybe
I'll<00:04:04.030> just<00:04:04.120> put<00:04:04.360> the<00:04:04.450> pictures<00:04:04.780> on<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:05.200> with

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
I'll just put the pictures on to with

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.840 
I'll just put the pictures on to with
the<00:04:06.040> extreme<00:04:06.459> plum<00:04:06.820> in<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.180> extreme<00:04:07.540> silver

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
the extreme plum in the extreme silver

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.900 
the extreme plum in the extreme silver
and<00:04:09.850> I'm<00:04:10.720> just<00:04:10.900> going<00:04:11.050> up<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:11.950> crease<00:04:12.160> you

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
and I'm just going up to the crease you

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.070 
and I'm just going up to the crease you
might<00:04:13.060> want<00:04:13.239> to<00:04:13.300> go<00:04:13.360> below<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.750> crease

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
might want to go below the crease

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.900 
might want to go below the crease
because<00:04:14.320> it<00:04:14.620> does<00:04:14.800> kind<00:04:15.130> of<00:04:15.190> end<00:04:15.370> up<00:04:15.489> creasing

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
because it does kind of end up creasing

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.090 
because it does kind of end up creasing
a<00:04:15.970> little<00:04:16.180> bit<00:04:16.330> later<00:04:16.750> on<00:04:16.989> during<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.350> day<00:04:17.380> now

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
a little bit later on during the day now

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.430 
a little bit later on during the day now
it<00:04:18.220> looks<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.549> little<00:04:18.790> not<00:04:19.480> extreme<00:04:19.900> glimmer<00:04:20.169> at

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
it looks a little not extreme glimmer at

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.120 
it looks a little not extreme glimmer at
all<00:04:20.590> but<00:04:21.220> as<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:22.410> moisturizer<00:04:23.410> sort<00:04:23.740> of<00:04:23.830> sinks

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
all but as the moisturizer sort of sinks

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.159 
all but as the moisturizer sort of sinks
tin<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.669> dries<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.120> little<00:04:25.270> bit<00:04:25.570> you'll<00:04:26.020> be

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
tin and dries a little bit you'll be

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.990 
tin and dries a little bit you'll be
able<00:04:26.230> to<00:04:26.350> see<00:04:26.590> a<00:04:26.620> lot<00:04:26.860> more<00:04:26.890> of<00:04:27.130> that<00:04:27.340> gene<00:04:27.760> that

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
able to see a lot more of that gene that

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.210 
able to see a lot more of that gene that
the<00:04:28.210> extreme<00:04:28.840> glimmers<00:04:29.169> have<00:04:29.380> so<00:04:29.710> um<00:04:32.220> that's

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
the extreme glimmers have so um that's

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.770 
the extreme glimmers have so um that's
all<00:04:33.430> I'm<00:04:33.550> going<00:04:33.669> to<00:04:33.730> do<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.030> so<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.300> just<00:04:34.630> did

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
all I'm going to do and so I just did

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.040 
all I'm going to do and so I just did
hat<00:04:34.990> like<00:04:35.200> used<00:04:35.470> half<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:36.040> blob<00:04:36.310> of<00:04:36.340> a

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
hat like used half the blob of a

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.219 
hat like used half the blob of a
moisturizer<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:38.410> that<00:04:39.160> way<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:39.370> can<00:04:39.580> sort<00:04:39.790> of

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
moisturizer and that way you can sort of

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.670 
moisturizer and that way you can sort of
make<00:04:41.229> it<00:04:41.880> creamy<00:04:42.880> again<00:04:43.270> just<00:04:43.630> by<00:04:44.260> adding<00:04:44.470> a

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
make it creamy again just by adding a

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.080 
make it creamy again just by adding a
little<00:04:44.830> bit

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
little bit

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.450 
little bit
more<00:04:45.180> moisturizer<00:04:45.720> as<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.050> go<00:04:46.230> to<00:04:47.100> keep<00:04:47.310> it

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
more moisturizer as you go to keep it

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.650 
more moisturizer as you go to keep it
the<00:04:47.550> right<00:04:47.699> consistency<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:50.520> just<00:04:51.150> again<00:04:51.419> you

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
the right consistency and just again you

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.659 
the right consistency and just again you
can<00:04:51.810> test<00:04:52.020> on<00:04:52.199> your<00:04:52.350> hand<00:04:52.590> just<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.190> check<00:04:53.460> it

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
can test on your hand just to check it

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.900 
can test on your hand just to check it
before<00:04:54.030> you<00:04:54.240> actually<00:04:54.479> put<00:04:54.810> it<00:04:54.930> on<00:04:55.020> your<00:04:55.169> eye<00:04:55.910> I

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
before you actually put it on your eye I

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.780 
before you actually put it on your eye I
also<00:04:57.330> put<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.840> eyeliner<00:04:58.229> on<00:04:58.350> first<00:04:58.889> because<00:04:59.250> I

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
also put the eyeliner on first because I

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.430 
also put the eyeliner on first because I
was<00:05:00.330> having<00:05:00.449> trouble<00:05:00.900> when<00:05:01.050> I<00:05:01.080> did<00:05:01.290> the<00:05:01.410> first

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
was having trouble when I did the first

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.770 
was having trouble when I did the first
look<00:05:01.919> doing<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.699> eyeliner<00:05:05.150> over<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.330> extreme

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
look doing the eyeliner over the extreme

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.260 
look doing the eyeliner over the extreme
glimmers<00:05:07.139> yeah<00:05:08.130> they<00:05:08.310> were<00:05:08.370> kind<00:05:08.790> of<00:05:08.850> taking

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
glimmers yeah they were kind of taking

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.909 
glimmers yeah they were kind of taking
and<00:05:09.510> looking<00:05:10.320> weird<00:05:10.530> so<00:05:11.419> that's<00:05:12.419> why<00:05:12.660> I<00:05:12.930> did

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
and looking weird so that's why I did

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.170 
and looking weird so that's why I did
the<00:05:14.040> liner<00:05:14.280> first<00:05:16.250> okay<00:05:17.250> I<00:05:17.460> want<00:05:17.850> to<00:05:17.940> kind<00:05:18.090> of

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
the liner first okay I want to kind of

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.180 
the liner first okay I want to kind of
come<00:05:18.360> up<00:05:18.389> by<00:05:18.630> the<00:05:18.690> crease<00:05:18.990> but<00:05:19.200> you<00:05:20.010> know<00:05:20.130> you

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
come up by the crease but you know you

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.680 
come up by the crease but you know you
might<00:05:20.430> get<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:20.610> little<00:05:20.790> crease<00:05:21.090> eNOS<00:05:21.419> through

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
might get a little crease eNOS through

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.320 
might get a little crease eNOS through
the<00:05:21.870> day<00:05:22.050> now<00:05:22.919> I<00:05:22.979> think<00:05:23.160> after<00:05:23.460> about<00:05:23.850> like<00:05:24.210> an

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
the day now I think after about like an

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.870 
the day now I think after about like an
hour<00:05:24.479> two<00:05:25.050> maybe<00:05:25.380> three<00:05:25.710> I<00:05:25.919> started<00:05:26.639> to<00:05:26.760> get

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
hour two maybe three I started to get

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.460 
hour two maybe three I started to get
just<00:05:27.120> a<00:05:27.240> little<00:05:27.270> crease<00:05:27.720> eNOS<00:05:28.020> right<00:05:28.229> here

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
just a little crease eNOS right here

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.219 
just a little crease eNOS right here
where<00:05:28.680> my<00:05:28.919> I<00:05:29.160> creases<00:05:29.790> but<00:05:30.419> if<00:05:30.630> I<00:05:30.840> just<00:05:31.110> found

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
where my I creases but if I just found

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:32.600 
where my I creases but if I just found
if<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:31.530> just<00:05:31.740> kind<00:05:31.919> of<00:05:31.950> smoothed<00:05:32.220> it<00:05:32.340> out<00:05:32.430> with

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
if I just kind of smoothed it out with

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.110 
if I just kind of smoothed it out with
my<00:05:32.729> finger<00:05:33.060> it<00:05:33.210> was<00:05:33.360> fine<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:35.550> other<00:05:35.700> thing<00:05:35.970> is

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
my finger it was fine the other thing is

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.990 
my finger it was fine the other thing is
it's<00:05:36.450> a<00:05:36.930> little<00:05:37.710> hard<00:05:37.919> to<00:05:38.100> sort<00:05:38.340> of<00:05:38.400> keep<00:05:38.789> it

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
it's a little hard to sort of keep it

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.020 
it's a little hard to sort of keep it
blending<00:05:39.960> up<00:05:40.250> so<00:05:41.250> that's<00:05:41.520> why<00:05:41.669> I<00:05:41.700> put<00:05:41.910> the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
blending up so that's why I put the

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.000 
blending up so that's why I put the
honey<00:05:42.210> amber<00:05:42.840> up<00:05:43.139> there<00:05:43.320> so<00:05:43.560> it<00:05:43.680> kind<00:05:43.889> of

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
honey amber up there so it kind of

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.990 
honey amber up there so it kind of
blends<00:05:44.850> nicely<00:05:44.970> into<00:05:45.570> that<00:05:46.699> similar<00:05:47.699> color

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
blends nicely into that similar color

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.540 
blends nicely into that similar color
and<00:05:51.380> you<00:05:52.380> don't<00:05:52.530> have<00:05:52.710> too<00:05:52.889> many<00:05:53.010> harsh<00:05:53.280> lines

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
and you don't have too many harsh lines

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.200 
and you don't have too many harsh lines
so<00:05:54.270> that's<00:05:54.990> the<00:05:55.229> extreme<00:05:55.680> plumber<00:05:55.889> and<00:05:56.280> again

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
so that's the extreme plumber and again

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.790 
so that's the extreme plumber and again
as<00:05:57.419> it<00:05:57.570> kind<00:05:57.750> of<00:05:57.810> dries<00:05:58.050> you'll<00:05:58.320> see<00:05:58.500> more<00:05:58.680> of

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
as it kind of dries you'll see more of

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.190 
as it kind of dries you'll see more of
the<00:05:58.889> glimmer<00:05:59.100> come<00:05:59.370> out<00:05:59.720> you<00:06:00.720> could<00:06:00.930> probably

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
the glimmer come out you could probably

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.860 
the glimmer come out you could probably
go<00:06:01.590> back<00:06:01.740> and<00:06:02.099> fix<00:06:02.849> any<00:06:03.060> eyeliner<00:06:03.419> that<00:06:03.599> you

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
go back and fix any eyeliner that you

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.659 
go back and fix any eyeliner that you
needed<00:06:04.169> to<00:06:04.349> fix<00:06:04.950> but<00:06:05.690> that's<00:06:06.690> really<00:06:07.250> it<00:06:08.250> and

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
needed to fix but that's really it and

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.159 
needed to fix but that's really it and
the<00:06:08.760> bronze<00:06:08.970> is<00:06:09.210> really<00:06:09.479> pretty<00:06:09.630> like<00:06:09.840> this<00:06:10.020> i

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169

two<00:06:17.430> colors<00:06:17.610> that<00:06:17.820> i<00:06:18.090> did<00:06:18.360> before<00:06:19.639> so<00:06:20.810> there

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
two colors that i did before so there

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.170 
two colors that i did before so there
you<00:06:21.900> go<00:06:21.990> that's<00:06:22.260> my<00:06:22.500> idea<00:06:22.889> if<00:06:23.760> you<00:06:23.880> don't<00:06:24.060> have

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
you go that's my idea if you don't have

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.760 
you go that's my idea if you don't have
the<00:06:24.330> city<00:06:24.539> block<00:06:24.750> you<00:06:25.110> could<00:06:25.289> mix<00:06:25.470> a<00:06:25.620> little

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
the city block you could mix a little

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.279 
the city block you could mix a little
bit<00:06:25.979> of<00:06:26.330> regular<00:06:27.330> primer<00:06:27.599> like<00:06:27.870> prime<00:06:28.080> time

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
bit of regular primer like prime time

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.350 
bit of regular primer like prime time
for<00:06:28.470> eyes<00:06:28.590> or<00:06:28.830> the<00:06:29.130> Urban<00:06:29.610> Decay<00:06:29.639> kind<00:06:30.150> or

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
for eyes or the Urban Decay kind or

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.300 
for eyes or the Urban Decay kind or
Deloria<00:06:30.780> decrease<00:06:31.349> even<00:06:31.680> I<00:06:31.770> tried<00:06:32.099> it<00:06:32.220> with

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
Deloria decrease even I tried it with

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.879 
Deloria decrease even I tried it with
that<00:06:32.460> and<00:06:32.669> it<00:06:32.729> works<00:06:32.910> okay<00:06:33.260> and<00:06:34.260> then<00:06:34.440> just<00:06:34.470> Pat

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889 
that and it works okay and then just Pat

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.210 
that and it works okay and then just Pat
it<00:06:34.919> on<00:06:35.160> you<00:06:35.849> know<00:06:35.970> I'm<00:06:36.270> Pat<00:06:37.169> the<00:06:37.380> paste<00:06:37.620> on<00:06:37.889> but

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
it on you know I'm Pat the paste on but

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.500 
it on you know I'm Pat the paste on but
you<00:06:38.370> got<00:06:38.520> to<00:06:38.550> work<00:06:38.760> quickly<00:06:39.030> if<00:06:39.270> you're<00:06:39.389> going

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
you got to work quickly if you're going

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.700 
you got to work quickly if you're going
to<00:06:39.599> do<00:06:39.750> it<00:06:39.870> with<00:06:39.990> just<00:06:40.020> straight<00:06:40.440> primer

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
to do it with just straight primer

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.830 
to do it with just straight primer
because<00:06:40.950> you<00:06:41.849> know<00:06:41.970> that<00:06:42.150> stuff<00:06:42.419> dries<00:06:42.660> really

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
because you know that stuff dries really

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.680 
because you know that stuff dries really
fast<00:06:42.960> and<00:06:43.500> so<00:06:44.220> that's<00:06:45.090> the<00:06:45.210> one<00:06:45.360> disadvantage

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
fast and so that's the one disadvantage

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.629 
fast and so that's the one disadvantage
doing<00:06:46.500> just<00:06:46.710> straight<00:06:46.889> primer<00:06:47.099> but<00:06:47.310> I<00:06:47.340> bet<00:06:47.550> it

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 
doing just straight primer but I bet it

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:48.920 
doing just straight primer but I bet it
won't<00:06:47.729> crease<00:06:48.060> as<00:06:48.210> much<00:06:48.389> if<00:06:48.539> you<00:06:48.660> just<00:06:48.870> use

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
won't crease as much if you just use

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.100 
won't crease as much if you just use
primer<00:06:49.380> by<00:06:49.590> yourself<00:06:49.950> so<00:06:50.550> okay<00:06:51.539> so<00:06:51.570> that's<00:06:51.960> my

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
primer by yourself so okay so that's my

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.770 
primer by yourself so okay so that's my
um<00:06:52.590> and<00:06:53.340> as<00:06:53.700> you<00:06:53.820> can<00:06:53.969> see<00:06:54.000> I<00:06:54.120> really<00:06:54.539> didn't

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
um and as you can see I really didn't

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.080 
um and as you can see I really didn't
get<00:06:54.930> any<00:06:55.140> fallout<00:06:55.530> at<00:06:55.710> all<00:06:55.890> on<00:06:56.310> my<00:06:56.580> eye<00:06:56.610> so<00:06:56.940> if

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
get any fallout at all on my eye so if

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.080 
get any fallout at all on my eye so if
you<00:06:57.180> have<00:06:57.330> context

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
you have context

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.960 
you have context
think<00:06:58.330> this<00:06:58.449> is<00:06:58.600> probably<00:06:58.780> a<00:06:59.370> good<00:07:00.370> idea<00:07:00.430> if

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970 
think this is probably a good idea if

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.330 
think this is probably a good idea if
you<00:07:01.120> want<00:07:01.270> to<00:07:01.389> try<00:07:01.540> these<00:07:01.600> colors<00:07:02.139> okay<00:07:03.100> well

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340 
you want to try these colors okay well

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:12.510 
you want to try these colors okay well
thanks<00:07:03.610> for<00:07:03.760> watching

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.580 

you
