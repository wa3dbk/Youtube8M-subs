00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
places we probably shouldn't been but we

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.509

environment<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.180> like<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.870> Court<00:03:13.170> itself<00:03:13.319> we

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
environment so like the Court itself we

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.140 
environment so like the Court itself we
just<00:03:14.099> started<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.489> think<00:03:14.730> about<00:03:14.849> how<00:03:15.090> the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
just started to think about how the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.420 
just started to think about how the
shoes<00:03:15.420> should<00:03:15.569> be<00:03:15.750> more<00:03:15.959> sturdy<00:03:16.680> first<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.310> all

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
shoes should be more sturdy first of all

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.020 
shoes should be more sturdy first of all
and<00:03:17.670> more<00:03:18.360> resistant<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:18.989> abrasion<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:20.030> would

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
and more resistant to abrasion and would

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.390 
and more resistant to abrasion and would
it<00:03:21.120> be<00:03:21.209> okay<00:03:21.599> to<00:03:21.959> actually<00:03:22.470> just<00:03:23.040> make<00:03:23.250> the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
it be okay to actually just make the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.550 
it be okay to actually just make the
whole<00:03:23.430> thing<00:03:23.519> black<00:03:24.049> if<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.170> spent<00:03:25.379> any<00:03:25.410> time

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
whole thing black if you spent any time

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.110 
whole thing black if you spent any time
in<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.890> street<00:03:26.129> your<00:03:26.280> shoes<00:03:26.459> get<00:03:26.640> real<00:03:26.879> dirty

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
real fast bringing color to the outsoles

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.180 
real fast bringing color to the outsoles
in<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.209> midsole<00:03:30.599> and<00:03:30.660> did<00:03:31.019> two<00:03:31.200> things<00:03:31.230> one

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
in the midsole and did two things one

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.220 
in the midsole and did two things one
and<00:03:32.459> made<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.849> stance<00:03:33.239> of<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.629> shoe<00:03:33.870> look

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
and made the stance of the shoe look

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.729 
and made the stance of the shoe look
tougher<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:34.950> more<00:03:35.280> rugged<00:03:35.579> it<00:03:35.849> also

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
tougher and more rugged it also

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.259 
tougher and more rugged it also
eliminated<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:37.860> very<00:03:38.129> right<00:03:38.700> because<00:03:39.060> now

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
eliminated that very right because now

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.479 
eliminated that very right because now
kid<00:03:39.600> says<00:03:39.870> he<00:03:39.989> doesn't<00:03:40.290> get<00:03:40.350> dirty<00:03:40.500> fast<00:03:40.889> so
