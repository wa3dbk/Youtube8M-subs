00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
ropes and the area that we did not

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.820 
ropes and the area that we did not
handle<00:02:08.270> well<00:02:08.509> was<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.899> pressure<00:02:09.200> the

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
handle well was the pressure the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.760 
handle well was the pressure the
full-court<00:02:10.310> pressure<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.110> really<00:02:12.110> taking

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
full-court pressure and really taking

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.970 
full-court pressure and really taking
that<00:02:13.900> full-court<00:02:14.900> press<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.349> scoring<00:02:15.830> down

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
that full-court press and scoring down

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.550 
that full-court press and scoring down
on<00:02:16.129> the<00:02:16.220> other<00:02:16.310> end<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:18.170> know<00:02:18.319> once

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
on the other end of it and you know once

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.800 
on the other end of it and you know once
we<00:02:18.769> we<00:02:19.129> had<00:02:19.340> which<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:19.670> easier<00:02:20.420> said<00:02:20.480> than<00:02:20.750> done

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
we we had which is easier said than done

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.660 
we we had which is easier said than done
but<00:02:21.110> once<00:02:21.379> you<00:02:21.620> handle<00:02:22.069> that<00:02:22.190> if<00:02:22.340> we<00:02:22.489> were<00:02:22.550> able

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
but once you handle that if we were able

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.660 
but once you handle that if we were able
to<00:02:22.819> handle<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:24.319> game<00:02:24.620> we<00:02:25.459> could

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
to handle that in that game we could

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.550 
to handle that in that game we could
have<00:02:25.849> had<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.720> know<00:02:26.810> our<00:02:26.930> very<00:02:27.170> different

different results
we<00:02:29.790> came<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.270> game<00:02:30.510> all<00:02:31.050> hype<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.500> coaches

quarter and the third and just from now

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.910 
quarter and the third and just from now
on<00:02:38.580> we<00:02:38.940> tried<00:02:39.210> but<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.810> u.s.<00:02:40.020> got<00:02:40.260> us<00:02:40.440> yeah

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
on we tried but the u.s. got us yeah

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.950 
on we tried but the u.s. got us yeah
just<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.430> mental<00:02:41.850> thing<00:02:41.880> he's<00:02:42.300> trying<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.750> grow

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
just a mental thing he's trying to grow

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.050 
just a mental thing he's trying to grow
and<00:02:43.200> learn<00:02:43.890> what<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.190> do<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.490> those<00:02:44.610> type<00:02:44.940> of

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
and learn what to do in those type of

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.690 
and learn what to do in those type of
scenarios<00:02:45.860> once<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.950> fourth<00:02:47.160> quarter<00:02:47.400> came

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
scenarios once the fourth quarter came

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.970 
scenarios once the fourth quarter came
they<00:02:47.970> came<00:02:48.150> again<00:02:48.360> without<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> lot<00:02:48.960> closer<00:02:49.170> or

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
they came again without a lot closer or

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.720 
they came again without a lot closer or
down<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:51.350> guess<00:02:52.380> we<00:02:52.680> came<00:02:53.070> together<00:02:53.220> but

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
down to I guess we came together but

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.110 
down to I guess we came together but
we're<00:02:53.850> just<00:02:53.880> gonna<00:02:54.120> execute<00:02:54.450> on<00:02:54.840> both<00:02:55.020> ends<00:02:55.350> so

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
we're just gonna execute on both ends so

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.400 
we're just gonna execute on both ends so
we're<00:02:57.120> very<00:02:57.150> close<00:02:57.540> we<00:02:57.750> had<00:02:57.900> oh<00:02:57.930> all<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.380> way

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
we're very close we had oh all the way

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.990 
we're very close we had oh all the way

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
to like five minutes in the fourth

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.970 
to like five minutes in the fourth
quarter<00:03:00.270> so<00:03:01.020> just<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.320> five<00:03:01.500> minutes<00:03:01.830> got<00:03:01.950> a

quarter so just I five minutes got a

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.010 
quarter so just I five minutes got a
lock-in<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.640> stay<00:03:02.940> focused<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.480> we'll<00:03:03.870> get

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
lock-in and stay focused and we'll get

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.230 
lock-in and stay focused and we'll get
there<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:05.100> we<00:03:05.160> could<00:03:05.340> go<00:03:05.490> back<00:03:05.700> there<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.060> play

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240

go<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.300> is<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.480> moment<00:03:15.780> this<00:03:16.020> is<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.170> time

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
go this is the moment this is a time

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.650 
go this is the moment this is a time
let's<00:03:16.650> do<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.040> there's<00:03:17.790> no<00:03:17.880> fear<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.360> this

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
let's do it I there's no fear in this

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.370 
let's do it I there's no fear in this
group<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:20.510> there's<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.660> think<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.960> strong

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
group and there's I think a strong

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.750 
group and there's I think a strong
belief<00:03:22.740> that's<00:03:22.980> bolstered<00:03:23.520> by<00:03:23.550> this

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
belief that's bolstered by this

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.760 
belief that's bolstered by this
performance<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:25.170> know<00:03:25.260> in<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.440> end<00:03:25.590> there's

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
performance you know in the end there's

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.800 
performance you know in the end there's
still<00:03:26.010> some<00:03:26.190> work<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.400> do<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.910> each<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.690> them

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
still some work to do and each of them

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.630 
still some work to do and each of them
need<00:03:28.020> to<00:03:28.140> continue<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.650> get<00:03:28.740> better<00:03:28.920> over<00:03:29.550> this

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640
