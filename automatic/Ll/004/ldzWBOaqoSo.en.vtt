00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.029
 me 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.029
 me 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.029
 Hmm 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.660
 dj 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.630
 tee 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.450
 me 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.570
 me 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.570
 tan 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.570
 Hmm 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.400
 Hmm 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.410
 It is Hi light is 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.430
 I am troubled that the shot is bent such as slice ball and hook ball this time 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.670
 For those who are 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:47.320
 I would like to introduce the secret that straight balls can strike 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.829
 First you need 3 steps to hit a straight ball 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:01:08.850
 First of all 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:01:12.420
 It had road its three working days I here to myself 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:17.409
 If there is no straight ball will come out 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.000
 I also use these three steps when teaching contract players 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.880
 I will do my best 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:31.229
 First of all it is the first step, the point of knowing your swing of the first step 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.229
 We would like to introduce 10 points this time, so please practice by all means 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.990
 Who would like you to first check if you first check the swing from 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.990
 Address 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:49.960
 First we will address this way 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:55.920
 At this time, the base of the shoulders and the elbows and knees 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.920
 Please check if the line is vertically aligned 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.610
 Then say you check the orbit of the head 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.560
 When viewed from behind like this 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:11.340
 Of the shaft 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:14.370
 I'm not steaming this neck with line and Paul 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.670
 In this triangle 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.840
 From the back swing 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.400
 Downswing 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.860
 up to true 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.440
 Going to bed 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.420
 Club head 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.760
 Grip end both 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.780
 In the western part 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.140
 If it is included 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:40.000
 It can be said that it is a correct orbit 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.000
 It is acceptable that the party is pointing from 12 o'clock to 1 o'clock in the half name down 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.050
 People who party in this position would point to the 11 o'clock direction 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:52.150
 Evidence that the face is open 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:57.659
 Please note that this makes it easier to slice out 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.659
 At that time, this is the position of this hand, but the position of the hand is 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.409
 Almost their 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.409
 Right ear 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.120
 It's about 4 pieces right around 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.990
 Please have an image that comes straight 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.180
 had 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.819
 When this happens 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.760
 From the right arm 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:24.170
 The left foot is just diagonal 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.500
 It is good from there if you can do this position 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.040
 If you have the flexibility of the body is more 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.560
 And the torsion 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.710
 Just until the shaft is parallel to the ground 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.400
 Because even wearing is ok 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.650
 Firmly at the top of this 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.280
 Beside your right ear 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.650
 Grip comes, right hand and left foot 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.650
 Please check if it is diagonal 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.600
 Hmm 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.930
 me 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.400
 Hmm 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.620
 Hmm 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.620
 Hmm 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.620
 Hmm 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.250
 Hmm 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.140
 Hmm 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.140
 ten 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.140
 voodoo
