00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.930
 hey people gave me a nice one 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.140
 recipe book and although he is this time of 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.200
 attacked 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.760
 He wanted to have a tarte flambÃ©e 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.430
 with different side dishes 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.220
 but I think I will not 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:31.060
 original flammenkuchen make so in 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.310
 the case with humidifier and if one 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.720
 suggest a few variations and then 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.500
 you can become active at home yourself 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.270
 and so a bit of trial and error going on 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.489
 It's for the dough I have here only 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.410
 sometimes 200 grams of light sink 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.550
 there comes first a teaspoon 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:53.490
 salt a tablespoon of oil in this 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.480
 case of olive oil and 110 milliliters of water 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:00.580
 and that could become one now 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.810
 nice part of much cheese if still one 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.970
 should stick a bit to the hands 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:11.200
 could a little bit of flour 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:17.320
 give in and knead that under until long 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.490
 the dough can be solved nicely and so 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.659
 if you have such a nice tackling 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.299
 then you can now again 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.210
 in the bowl and rest for a while 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.479
 so thank you then have the sauce for it 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.469
 I here 200 grams should be here well 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.170
 first comes about halfway 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:35.499
 teaspoon salt then ran one 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.389
 knife tip nutmeg 1 tablespoon 

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:41.649
 olive oil and some pepper and at the 

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:43.149
 Rousse could already be pretty 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.009
 could vary a lot for example could there 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.539
 make a Mediterranean sauce out of it 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.439
 with a bit of rosemary thyme 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.210
 oregano marjoram bit small 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.109
 grated garlic for example 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.689
 enter or paprika powder for example 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:01.600
 there you have a beautiful one, too 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.829
 Mediterranean sauce or you can do that 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.689
 even for example if you want 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.389
 So enter the Indian direction 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.160
 Pair of Indian birth cumin turmeric 

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:11.290
 For example, I could be very good 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.550
 introduce in there and you can too 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.709
 to work with fresh herbs 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.620
 example, you can chopped there small 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.800
 dill and small chopped parsley 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.110
 fold 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.230
 and then you have such a nice one 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.110
 herbal sauce so for that I stir it 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.600
 first off and first again aside 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.250
 put 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.840
 then I have two medium sized ones here 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.960
 onions and 100 grams or tofu the 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.370
 I will now be civil in civil 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.370
 cut thin halved slices 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.250
 the can you able to get a bowl 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.600
 then give the weeds tofu the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.550
 I decide to cut first 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:58.090
 even half a centimeter thick 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:01.210
 then strip and finish the dice 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.690
 and that just goes to the 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.240
 in between if any 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.340
 Preheat oven to 200 degrees 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.050
 because of should the flammkuchen 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.350
 rhine is already hot in any case 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.120
 his 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.200
 to theories and tofu is coming now 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.520
 another tablespoon of olive oil and the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.200
 of course, you can also cover again 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.510
 can vary a lot for example 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.730
 you with the medial variant tomatoes 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.260
 and use paprika and zucchini for 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.580
 example in the Indian variant 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.590
 Can you really take what you 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:35.440
 I would probably like to join 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.550
 pumpkin or carrots what I try 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.100
 I can also well imagine 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.800
 for example for the herb 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.770
 small cut mushrooms onions as well 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.950
 onions and tofu we have to enter now 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.750
 bit by with it the olive oil 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.410
 a little bit evenly 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.900
 distributed and then it goes on the same 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.800
 the dough you can do a bit first 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:04.060
 Flour on a work surface then go 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:07.540
 lay the dough on it and then this 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.550
 roll out flat 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.830
 if you have smaller flammkuchen 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.280
 Of course, you can also do it in advance 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.280
 divide 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:24.190
 then they go the best on a sheet 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:26.039
 then with baking paper thin with topping 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.180
 be quite difficult 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:32.020
 then you can take a brush or 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:36.789
 a schlesinger and just goes the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:39.789
 sauce on the day spreads nicely 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.590
 evenly load in each case one 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:46.150
 small margin on left not too wide 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:52.150
 but absolutely about 1 cm wide 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:58.020
 and then you can do it completely 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.020
 just your onions and top parts 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.699
 if you already distributed then press 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:07.810
 once again 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:10.180
 the onions beautiful in the ground like that 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.190
 unfinished is your flammkuchen the 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.620
 gets now as I said at 200 degrees 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.620
 oven for about twenty minutes 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.110
 so everything is exactly 20 minutes 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.480
 Yes 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.590
 but not sold 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.569
 before laying out 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.879
 a bit of abyss 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.879
 so will now cut and 

00:05:55.709 --> 00:06:09.279
 finished flammkuchen yaman cost so 

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:12.279
 really delicious that's like I said 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:14.169
 the very simple variant and all 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:14.740
 Variations would have to be at home 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.509
 try out 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.419
 I will definitely ask you too

 very delicious and yes there are also here 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:25.689
 a sweet variant you can then with 

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:27.309
 make apple or green pieces and the 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:31.089
 Give sauce a little bit of time 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:32.529
 maybe some maple syrup around 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:33.479
 the whole thing a special note 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:35.469
 to rent 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:40.389
 In any case, I also do a lot 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:43.149
