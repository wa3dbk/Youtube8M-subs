you go here go this way go this way
after<00:03:31.590> you've<00:03:31.800> done<00:03:32.160> this<00:03:32.430> for<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.820> little<00:03:33.150> bit

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
after you've done this for a little bit

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.540 
after you've done this for a little bit
and<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.510> dog<00:03:33.750> starts<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.680> get<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.040> hang<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.400> it

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
and the dog starts to get the hang of it

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.440 
and the dog starts to get the hang of it
now<00:03:35.790> what<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.840> can<00:03:37.050> do<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.610> you<00:03:38.610> do<00:03:38.760> left<00:03:39.060> hand

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
now what you can do is you do left hand

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.960 
now what you can do is you do left hand
turns<00:03:39.810> which<00:03:40.440> will<00:03:40.650> really<00:03:41.040> sharpen<00:03:41.640> this<00:03:41.790> up

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
turns which will really sharpen this up

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.180 
turns which will really sharpen this up
so<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.240> walk<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.880> go<00:03:44.880> left<00:03:45.920> but<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.040> do

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
so you walk and you go left but you do

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.900 
so you walk and you go left but you do
it<00:03:47.220> sharp<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:47.700> notice<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.360> whisky<00:03:49.910> will

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
it sharp and notice that whisky will

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.030 
it sharp and notice that whisky will
turn<00:03:51.209> see<00:03:51.480> how<00:03:51.570> he<00:03:51.630> stops<00:03:51.990> and<00:03:52.290> turns<00:03:52.470> before<00:03:53.010> I

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
turn see how he stops and turns before I

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.490 
turn see how he stops and turns before I
turn<00:03:53.400> that's<00:03:54.000> what<00:03:54.240> your<00:03:54.810> dog<00:03:54.990> will<00:03:55.170> learn<00:03:55.320> now

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
turn that's what your dog will learn now

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.590 
turn that's what your dog will learn now
he<00:03:55.560> may<00:03:55.770> run<00:03:56.040> into<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.550> a<00:03:56.580> little<00:03:56.880> bit<00:03:57.000> but

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
he may run into you a little bit but

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.020 
he may run into you a little bit but
that's<00:03:57.810> okay<00:03:58.200> so<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.040> can<00:03:59.280> do<00:03:59.400> left<00:03:59.640> hands

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
that's okay so you can do left hands

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.990 
that's okay so you can do left hands
just<00:04:00.420> like<00:04:00.600> this<00:04:01.220> now<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.640> a<00:04:02.670> very

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
just like this now that is a very

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.880 
just like this now that is a very
abbreviated<00:04:03.540> version<00:04:04.320> of<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:04.560> but<00:04:04.740> it's

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
abbreviated version of that but it's

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.770 
abbreviated version of that but it's
very<00:04:04.950> important<00:04:05.730> that<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:05.970> take<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.240> dog<00:04:06.540> out

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
very important that you take the dog out

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.040 
very important that you take the dog out
exercise<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.950> walk<00:04:08.820> it<00:04:08.850> anything<00:04:09.360> you<00:04:09.690> can<00:04:09.900> do

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
exercise it walk it anything you can do

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.220 
exercise it walk it anything you can do
to<00:04:10.350> lower<00:04:10.709> its<00:04:10.980> energy<00:04:11.520> before<00:04:12.300> you<00:04:12.870> take<00:04:13.110> it

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
to lower its energy before you take it

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.810 
to lower its energy before you take it
into<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.590> house<00:04:13.770> so<00:04:14.010> it's<00:04:14.130> very<00:04:14.340> important

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
into the house so it's very important

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.120 
into the house so it's very important
that<00:04:14.850> you<00:04:15.420> get<00:04:15.630> that<00:04:15.870> done<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.440> can't<00:04:16.799> express

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
that you get that done I can't express

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.460 
that you get that done I can't express
how<00:04:18.060> important<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:18.900> make<00:04:19.200> sure<00:04:19.320> you

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
how important that is so make sure you

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.620 
how important that is so make sure you
do<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:19.770> and<00:04:20.010> again<00:04:20.910> if<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:21.299> want<00:04:21.450> more

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
do that and again if you want more

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.930 
do that and again if you want more
details<00:04:22.230> or<00:04:22.530> maybe<00:04:22.860> he's<00:04:23.070> really<00:04:23.550> really

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
details or maybe he's really really

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.190 
details or maybe he's really really
pulling<00:04:24.330> I<00:04:24.450> have<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.600> whole<00:04:24.810> nother<00:04:24.990> video

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
pulling I have a whole nother video

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.260 
pulling I have a whole nother video
series<00:04:25.800> on<00:04:25.950> that<00:04:26.160> that<00:04:26.730> you'll<00:04:26.910> have<00:04:27.030> access

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
series on that that you'll have access

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.730 
series on that that you'll have access
