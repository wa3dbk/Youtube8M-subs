00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
going to want to put it kind of an angle

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.360 
going to want to put it kind of an angle
you<00:01:33.420> want<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.660> kind<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.930> like<00:01:34.110> put<00:01:34.980> it<00:01:35.100> kind<00:01:35.280> of

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
you want to kind of like put it kind of

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.910 
you want to kind of like put it kind of

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
like this when you put it in so you just

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.330 
like this when you put it in so you just
kind<00:01:38.160> of<00:01:38.190> put<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.490> an<00:01:38.610> angle<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:40.100> usually<00:01:41.100> start

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
kind of put it an angle I usually start

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.100 
kind of put it an angle I usually start
with<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.550> bottom<00:01:41.910> part<00:01:41.940> you<00:01:42.390> push<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.780> bottom

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
with the bottom part you push the bottom

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.860 
with the bottom part you push the bottom
piece<00:01:43.380> through<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.690> you'll<00:01:45.690> have<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
piece through like that so you'll have a
