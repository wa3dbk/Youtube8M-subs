00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.270
 if you are hearing and coming 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.289
 it seems to me very well actually existing many film festivals of all kinds 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.490
 and there are issues and 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.390
 he does not know if this kind of president deserves a particular space 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:27.929
 It's the first time that I'm in a festival like that 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.390
 but the experience has been very interesting because it is 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.340
 there's everything right 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.570
 in first a cinematography and that abort your subjects 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.590
 if I there also published today and created a with a link between them 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.030
 between a cinema in a certain subject and an audience that seems useful and 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.330
 necessary because if not 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.220
 if they get lost in the middle of all the production 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.140
 the one that exists in the world especially the issues do not and then I find it important 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.130
 let him go 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.460
 it seems to me a work of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.460
 it is very inaccurate area 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.670
 it's funny because or club sure as a jury of the opportunity to see many 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.800
 films 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.700
 i the journey the film intuits what is the group with profiles of 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.000
 activate it 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.190
 The sensitivity is not 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.600
 and then wish 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.400
 the approval in general I think it has been pcv not all are 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.250
 the one in the movie that shows all have been good movies 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.830
 and within that, you have to be a 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.500
 An election based on the criteria that arise is not the same as a member 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.450
 of the jury from the context of everything 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.510
 but now I'm satisfied because I've seen I had the opportunity to see very 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.710
 good movie 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.700
 i 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.790
 and I've had the luck of meeting people 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.020
 I always open a little 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.440
 By the way, the world has ended, it has been determined 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 i was not in a super happy to be here 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.800
 the case has presided over the price with the time 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.100
 percent goes to the topic that played but 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.380
 the son will not die important that the seacex and the public everything 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.200
 to many countries where perhaps the problem was not the same or is not 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.059
 same level 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:12.619
 and that facilitated the one that was 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:14.929
 who had much greater access 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.929
 to the big circuits to the big markets 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.709
 and I want to say something club place should exist would be Havana 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.129
 because in the case of this festival for example a gay and lesbian festival 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.639
 in cuba there is a need there is an advance on sale a long time ago 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.689
 that a certain thing can happen 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.889
 and one of them is that there may be 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.089
 for example festival where they touch 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.259
 percent talk about d 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:47.239
 of anything instead of for example de facto history of whatever and 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.409
 then it was the murder of a large section of the population 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.749
 interested in these subjects 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:55.799
 % e ypf and I believe that it should exist and I think it will exist 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.079
 It will be possible to fly to Barcelona 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.669
 a sample of this festival take it there and exhibit it a room and surely 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:06.720
 is going to have a 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.219
 the importance and the province of cÃ³rdoba 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.489
 I continue to do something to facilitate it, I will try with it after having 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.539
 been here 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:18.409
 at the beginning of the championship with the festival ambassador
