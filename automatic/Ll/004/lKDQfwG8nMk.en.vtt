00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
I've never really welded pipe before so

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.280 
I've never really welded pipe before so
don't<00:01:29.690> really<00:01:29.869> know<00:01:30.050> what<00:01:30.170> I'm<00:01:30.259> doing

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
don't really know what I'm doing

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.630 
don't really know what I'm doing
especially<00:01:30.920> with<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.130> angles<00:01:31.460> that<00:01:31.580> are

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
especially with the angles that are

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.800 
especially with the angles that are
always<00:01:31.729> changing<00:01:32.240> there<00:01:32.360> makes<00:01:32.600> things

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
always changing there makes things

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.660 
always changing there makes things
interesting<00:01:33.009> but<00:01:34.009> I'm<00:01:34.130> pretty<00:01:34.280> happy<00:01:34.369> with

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
interesting but I'm pretty happy with

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.920 
interesting but I'm pretty happy with
the<00:01:34.759> way<00:01:34.850> it's<00:01:35.000> coming<00:01:35.210> out<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.540> other<00:01:35.570> thing

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
the way it's coming out the other thing

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.690 
the way it's coming out the other thing
is<00:01:36.080> there's<00:01:36.259> a<00:01:36.320> huge<00:01:36.590> learning<00:01:36.979> curve<00:01:37.340> for<00:01:37.369> me

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
is there's a huge learning curve for me

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.060 
is there's a huge learning curve for me
you<00:01:38.300> know<00:01:38.420> on<00:01:38.570> this<00:01:38.810> on<00:01:39.229> this<00:01:39.350> project<00:01:39.619> just

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
you know on this on this project just

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.310 
you know on this on this project just
because<00:01:40.340> I<00:01:40.490> haven't<00:01:41.000> done<00:01:41.210> really<00:01:41.750> any<00:01:41.869> MIG

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
because I haven't done really any MIG

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.590 
because I haven't done really any MIG
welding<00:01:42.740> before<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.340> I've<00:01:43.970> got<00:01:44.149> I've<00:01:44.240> gotten

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
welding before and I've got I've gotten

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.420 
welding before and I've got I've gotten
more<00:01:44.720> hood<00:01:44.930> time<00:01:45.140> in<00:01:45.350> on<00:01:45.470> this<00:01:45.680> build<00:01:46.070> alone

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
more hood time in on this build alone

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.490 
more hood time in on this build alone
that<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:46.700> have<00:01:46.910> you<00:01:47.119> know<00:01:47.240> my<00:01:47.420> entire<00:01:47.690> life<00:01:48.020> up

gonna be to make the you know the cover

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.570 
gonna be to make the you know the cover
plates<00:02:00.170> for<00:02:00.410> all<00:02:00.500> five<00:02:00.770> of<00:02:00.979> these<00:02:01.070> things<00:02:01.280> and

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
plates for all five of these things and

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.830 
plates for all five of these things and
make<00:02:01.729> them<00:02:01.820> adjustable<00:02:02.390> with<00:02:02.509> a<00:02:02.600> steel<00:02:02.810> rod

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
make them adjustable with a steel rod

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.480 
make them adjustable with a steel rod
whereas<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.649> just<00:02:03.860> turn<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:04.160> and<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.310> plate

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
whereas you just turn it and the plate

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.370 
whereas you just turn it and the plate
goes<00:02:04.640> like<00:02:04.940> that<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.509> opens<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.259> up<00:02:06.320> for

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
goes like that and opens it up for

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.050 
goes like that and opens it up for
closes<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.070> off<00:02:07.190> depending<00:02:07.610> on<00:02:07.700> what<00:02:07.880> you're

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
closes it off depending on what you're

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.740 
closes it off depending on what you're
after<00:02:08.800> we<00:02:09.800> gotta<00:02:10.009> cut<00:02:10.910> out<00:02:11.030> all<00:02:11.239> these<00:02:11.360> various

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
after we gotta cut out all these various

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.960 
after we gotta cut out all these various
ventilation<00:02:12.290> ports<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.310> have<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.640> fit<00:02:13.820> my

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
ventilation ports and I have to fit my

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.030 
ventilation ports and I have to fit my
head<00:02:14.180> my<00:02:14.540> ginormous<00:02:14.780> head<00:02:15.290> with<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.590> respirator

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
head my ginormous head with a respirator

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.520 
head my ginormous head with a respirator
and<00:02:16.400> apply<00:02:16.760> some<00:02:16.790> torch<00:02:17.239> inside<00:02:17.630> that's<00:02:17.870> 16<00:02:18.350> by

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
and apply some torch inside that's 16 by

cuz<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.630> know<00:03:28.750> you<00:03:28.810> take<00:03:29.110> as<00:03:29.380> tall<00:03:29.769> as<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:30.130> is

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
cuz you know you take as tall as that is

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.979 
cuz you know you take as tall as that is
you<00:03:30.459> stack<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.849> up<00:03:30.910> on<00:03:31.060> top<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:31.480> had<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.750> really

that happen so just come on over here to

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.009 
that happen so just come on over here to
the<00:04:06.190> Hypertherm<00:04:06.700> which<00:04:07.330> may<00:04:07.510> or<00:04:07.599> may<00:04:07.690> not<00:04:07.840> be

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
the Hypertherm which may or may not be

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.890 
the Hypertherm which may or may not be
plugged<00:04:08.260> in<00:04:08.819> nope<00:04:09.819> I<00:04:10.030> unplugged<00:04:10.360> it<00:04:10.480> okay<00:04:10.720> well
