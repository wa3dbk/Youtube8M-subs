00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.580

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.619

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.530

 always these packs will cost 590 riot 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.220
 points but in case of not having the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.650
 champion we will also have a 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.409
 complete package with the champion the skin 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.830

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.619

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.090

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.780
