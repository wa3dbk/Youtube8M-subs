devo<00:03:10.630> colleg<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.920> Belgium<00:03:12.280> striker<00:03:12.580> who

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
devo colleg the the Belgium striker who

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.090 
devo colleg the the Belgium striker who
left<00:03:13.060> lil<00:03:13.300> and<00:03:13.600> then<00:03:14.049> came<00:03:14.260> back<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:14.739> think<00:03:15.010> it

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
left lil and then came back I think it

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.650 
left lil and then came back I think it
was<00:03:15.220> very<00:03:15.400> important<00:03:15.820> fully<00:03:16.060> in<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.329> for

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
was very important fully in and for

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.660 
was very important fully in and for
French<00:03:16.900> football<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:17.799> be<00:03:17.920> able<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.220> keep<00:03:18.430> him

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
French football to be able to keep him

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.520 
French football to be able to keep him
and<00:03:19.180> I<00:03:19.299> think<00:03:19.480> Liverpool<00:03:19.660> understood<00:03:20.290> that

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
and I think Liverpool understood that

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.750 
and I think Liverpool understood that
he's<00:03:20.829> going<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.130> play<00:03:21.250> Champions<00:03:21.670> League

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
he's going to play Champions League

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.069 
he's going to play Champions League
football<00:03:21.940> with<00:03:22.269> lead<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:22.780> he's<00:03:22.900> going<00:03:23.019> to

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
football with lead so he's going to

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.740 
football with lead so he's going to
continue<00:03:23.260> is<00:03:23.799> its<00:03:24.459> progress<00:03:24.880> continue<00:03:25.630> to

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
continue is its progress continue to

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.390 
continue is its progress continue to
improve<00:03:26.110> in<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.560> french<00:03:26.799> league<00:03:26.980> instead<00:03:27.310> of
