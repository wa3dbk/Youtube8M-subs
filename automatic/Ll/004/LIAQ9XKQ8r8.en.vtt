00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
hello okay that's fun let's see if I can

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.220 
hello okay that's fun let's see if I can
find<00:01:04.170> some<00:01:04.500> materials<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:05.610> fire<00:01:05.940> so<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
find some materials for fire so the

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.920 
find some materials for fire so the
controls<00:01:07.620> seem<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.100> working<00:01:08.250> out<00:01:08.810> with<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
controls seem to be working out with the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.260 
controls seem to be working out with the
controller<00:01:10.290> pretty<00:01:10.890> well<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.430> game<00:01:11.700> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
controller pretty well for this game you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.740 
controller pretty well for this game you
can<00:01:12.480> move<00:01:12.660> around<00:01:12.810> with<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:14.420> movement<00:01:15.420> pad<00:01:15.570> as

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
can move around with the movement pad as

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.020 
can move around with the movement pad as
normally<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.980> then<00:01:17.160> I<00:01:17.370> guess<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.700> rest<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.970> it

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
normally and then I guess the rest of it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.850 
normally and then I guess the rest of it
is<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.180> kind<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.420> point-and-click<00:01:18.860> which

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
is just kind of point-and-click which

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.810 
is just kind of point-and-click which
works<00:01:20.730> really<00:01:20.940> well<00:01:21.120> because<00:01:21.450> that's<00:01:22.820> simple

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
works really well because that's simple

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.100 
works really well because that's simple
and<00:01:23.970> perfect<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.500> what<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.620> controller<00:01:26.010> does

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
and perfect for what the controller does

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.620 
and perfect for what the controller does
so<00:01:28.110> I'm<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.350> clicking<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.890> right

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
so I'm just clicking with the right

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.630 
so I'm just clicking with the right
triggers<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.840> would<00:01:30.960> probably<00:01:31.380> expect<00:01:31.800> yeah

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
triggers you would probably expect yeah

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.310 
triggers you would probably expect yeah
I've<00:01:32.760> been<00:01:32.940> on<00:01:32.970> kind<00:01:33.300> of<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.540> survival<00:01:34.140> game

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
got dark cuz I couldn't figure out how

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.059 
got dark cuz I couldn't figure out how
to<00:02:14.810> craft<00:02:15.080> anything<00:02:16.780> cuz<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:18.709> know<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.890> was<00:02:18.980> my

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069
