00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
it will leave now you can do it either

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.310 
it will leave now you can do it either
with<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> rolling<00:00:56.880> or<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.360> chords<00:00:57.870> whichever

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
with the rolling or the chords whichever

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.740 
with the rolling or the chords whichever
one<00:00:58.560> is<00:00:58.710> easier<00:00:59.130> for<00:00:59.400> you<00:00:59.580> the<00:01:00.180> chords<00:01:00.600> are

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
one is easier for you the chords are

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.290 
one is easier for you the chords are
normally<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.290> course<00:01:01.320> easier<00:01:02.040> but<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
normally of course easier but the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.840 
normally of course easier but the
rolling<00:01:03.690> sounds<00:01:04.110> prettier<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.770> it's<00:01:05.520> really

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
rolling sounds prettier so it's really

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.850 
rolling sounds prettier so it's really
up<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.229> sounds<00:01:07.470> figure<00:01:07.740> at

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
up to you I think it sounds figure at

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:20.490 
up to you I think it sounds figure at
least

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.760 

so<00:01:21.420> that's<00:01:22.420> cool<00:01:22.690> a<00:01:22.780> chance<00:01:23.110> so<00:01:23.380> now<00:01:23.530> i'm<00:01:23.650> going

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
so that's cool a chance so now i'm going

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:53.400 
so that's cool a chance so now i'm going
to<00:01:23.860> play<00:01:24.010> together<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.700> entire<00:01:24.850> thing

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.990 

so<00:01:54.410> I<00:01:54.440> know<00:01:54.710> that's<00:01:55.100> not<00:01:55.280> exactly<00:01:55.580> how<00:01:55.790> it

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
so I know that's not exactly how it

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.080 
so I know that's not exactly how it
really<00:01:56.270> ends<00:01:56.870> but<00:01:57.170> um<00:01:57.500> I<00:01:57.740> just<00:01:57.890> put<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:58.640> own

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
really ends but um I just put that own

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.990 
really ends but um I just put that own
twist<00:01:59.840> to<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.110> because<00:02:00.830> I<00:02:01.160> don't<00:02:01.550> know<00:02:01.640> I<00:02:01.760> felt

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
twist to it because I don't know I felt

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.400 
twist to it because I don't know I felt
like<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.420> sorry<00:02:02.690> but<00:02:04.600> so<00:02:05.600> we're<00:02:05.960> going<00:02:06.170> to
