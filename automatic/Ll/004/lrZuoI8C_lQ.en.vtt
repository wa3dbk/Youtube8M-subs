rvs zero two zero eight one three and
let's<00:00:13.790> get<00:00:13.910> right<00:00:14.090> into<00:00:14.269> it<00:00:14.450> the<00:00:15.380> system<00:00:15.710> comes

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
let's get right into it the system comes

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.410 
let's get right into it the system comes
with<00:00:16.039> two<00:00:16.189> main<00:00:16.340> components<00:00:16.519> and<00:00:17.090> they<00:00:17.300> would

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
with two main components and they would

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.320 
with two main components and they would
be<00:00:17.539> the<00:00:17.660> camera<00:00:18.050> and<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:19.070> transmitter<00:00:19.640> in
