the<00:00:22.270> horses<00:00:22.660> respiratory<00:00:23.169> systems<00:00:23.710> often

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:23.919 
the horses respiratory systems often

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.400 
the horses respiratory systems often
referred<00:00:24.460> to<00:00:24.490> as<00:00:24.849> a<00:00:25.000> weak<00:00:25.270> point<00:00:25.570> in<00:00:25.900> the<00:00:26.140> chain

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
referred to as a weak point in the chain

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.470 
referred to as a weak point in the chain
of<00:00:26.439> getting<00:00:26.980> oxygen<00:00:27.490> from<00:00:27.670> outside<00:00:28.150> in<00:00:28.359> the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
of getting oxygen from outside in the

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.240 
of getting oxygen from outside in the
air<00:00:28.600> down<00:00:28.990> to<00:00:29.260> the<00:00:29.349> muscles<00:00:29.560> where<00:00:29.949> it's<00:00:30.099> going

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
air down to the muscles where it's going

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.549 
air down to the muscles where it's going
to<00:00:30.310> be<00:00:30.430> used<00:00:30.699> and<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:31.480> reason<00:00:31.960> for<00:00:32.199> this<00:00:32.320> is

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
to be used and the reason for this is

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.640 
to be used and the reason for this is
that<00:00:32.590> in<00:00:32.860> unfit<00:00:33.550> untrained<00:00:34.390> horses<00:00:34.989> it's<00:00:35.410> the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
that in unfit untrained horses it's the

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.380 
that in unfit untrained horses it's the
heart<00:00:35.920> and<00:00:36.129> the<00:00:36.220> muscles<00:00:36.699> of<00:00:36.879> the<00:00:37.000> weakest

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
heart and the muscles of the weakest

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.210 
heart and the muscles of the weakest
link<00:00:37.629> but<00:00:37.780> with<00:00:37.930> training<00:00:38.559> the<00:00:38.680> muscles<00:00:39.160> and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
link but with training the muscles and

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.180 
link but with training the muscles and
the<00:00:39.339> heart<00:00:39.940> improve<00:00:40.900> they<00:00:41.320> adapt<00:00:41.710> and<00:00:42.070> they

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
the heart improve they adapt and they

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.430 
the heart improve they adapt and they
get<00:00:42.340> fitter<00:00:42.610> but<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.629> respiratory<00:00:44.290> system

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
get fitter but the respiratory system

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.680 
get fitter but the respiratory system
doesn't<00:00:45.129> change<00:00:45.399> so<00:00:45.730> it's<00:00:45.879> exactly<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.510> same

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
doesn't change so it's exactly the same

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.959 
doesn't change so it's exactly the same
before<00:00:46.899> and<00:00:47.200> after<00:00:47.649> training<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.460> after

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
before and after training and after

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:50.819 
before and after training and after
training<00:00:49.239> in<00:00:49.510> fit<00:00:49.780> horses<00:00:50.230> it's<00:00:50.649> the

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
training in fit horses it's the

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.619 
training in fit horses it's the
respiratory<00:00:51.309> system<00:00:51.460> that's<00:00:51.969> the<00:00:52.090> weak<00:00:52.300> point

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
respiratory system that's the weak point

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.389 
respiratory system that's the weak point
and<00:00:52.870> therefore<00:00:53.289> it<00:00:53.620> needs<00:00:53.649> all<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.100> help<00:00:54.129> it

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
and therefore it needs all the help it

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.529 
and therefore it needs all the help it
can<00:00:54.460> get<00:00:56.309> some<00:00:57.309> people<00:00:57.670> think<00:00:57.850> that<00:00:58.239> nasal

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
can get some people think that nasal

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.330 
can get some people think that nasal
strips<00:00:58.989> are<00:00:59.140> only<00:00:59.320> for<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.710> top<00:00:59.920> riders

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
strips are only for the top riders

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.639 
strips are only for the top riders
professionals<00:01:01.059> but<00:01:01.329> actually<00:01:01.870> horse<00:01:02.350> is<00:01:02.620> that

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
professionals but actually horse is that

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.380 
professionals but actually horse is that
all<00:01:03.070> different<00:01:03.579> levels<00:01:03.699> can<00:01:04.030> potentially

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
all different levels can potentially

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.570 
all different levels can potentially
benefit<00:01:04.839> from<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.080> fair<00:01:05.289> horses<00:01:06.280> at<00:01:06.399> lower

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
benefit from the fair horses at lower

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.520 
benefit from the fair horses at lower
levels<00:01:06.970> sometimes<00:01:07.450> may<00:01:07.600> not<00:01:07.780> be<00:01:07.869> quite<00:01:08.080> as<00:01:08.140> fit

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
levels sometimes may not be quite as fit

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.249 
levels sometimes may not be quite as fit
might<00:01:08.950> not<00:01:09.100> be<00:01:09.160> so<00:01:09.430> athletic<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.630> therefore

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
might not be so athletic and therefore

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.380 
might not be so athletic and therefore
they<00:01:11.710> might<00:01:11.950> actually<00:01:12.160> struggle<00:01:12.970> a<00:01:13.060> bit<00:01:13.090> more

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
they might actually struggle a bit more

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.749 
they might actually struggle a bit more
with<00:01:13.539> exercise<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:14.050> so<00:01:14.619> could<00:01:14.800> benefit<00:01:15.310> to

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
with exercise and so could benefit to

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.889 
with exercise and so could benefit to
flare<00:01:16.090> strips<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.209> other<00:01:19.360> problems<00:01:19.810> the

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
flare strips one the other problems the

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.749 
flare strips one the other problems the
horses<00:01:20.289> experience<00:01:20.860> is<00:01:21.069> the<00:01:21.369> thing<00:01:21.550> called

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
horses experience is the thing called

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.880 
horses experience is the thing called
exercise<00:01:22.060> induced<00:01:22.599> pulmonary<00:01:23.110> hemorrhage<00:01:23.530> or

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhage or

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.859 
exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhage or
bleeding<00:01:24.009> and<00:01:24.700> this<00:01:25.119> is<00:01:25.270> breaking<00:01:25.479> blood

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
bleeding and this is breaking blood

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.930 
bleeding and this is breaking blood
vessels<00:01:26.259> in<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.530> lung<00:01:26.709> now<00:01:27.250> we<00:01:27.310> used<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.759> think

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
vessels in the lung now we used to think

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.510 
vessels in the lung now we used to think
this<00:01:28.209> was<00:01:28.270> only<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:29.200> problem<00:01:29.410> for<00:01:29.679> resources<00:01:30.160> we

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
this was only a problem for resources we

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.150 
this was only a problem for resources we
now<00:01:30.789> know<00:01:31.060> this<00:01:31.270> happens<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.959> all<00:01:32.410> horses<00:01:32.979> the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
now know this happens to all horses the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.760 
now know this happens to all horses the
exercise<00:01:33.610> at<00:01:33.789> more<00:01:34.030> than<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.300> canter<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:35.319> that

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
exercise at more than a canter so that

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.699 
exercise at more than a canter so that
would<00:01:35.890> be<00:01:35.920> show<00:01:36.220> jumpers<00:01:37.020> Venters<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.050> polo

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
would be show jumpers Venters and polo

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:40.559 
would be show jumpers Venters and polo
ponies<00:01:39.220> don't<00:01:39.610> have<00:01:39.759> to<00:01:39.880> see<00:01:40.030> blood<00:01:40.300> at<00:01:40.450> the

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
ponies don't have to see blood at the

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.440 
ponies don't have to see blood at the
nostrils<00:01:41.039> we<00:01:42.039> now<00:01:42.220> go<00:01:42.459> know<00:01:42.670> that<00:01:42.849> you<00:01:43.000> go<00:01:43.149> into

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
nostrils we now go know that you go into

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.120 
nostrils we now go know that you go into
the<00:01:43.539> windpipe<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.170> look<00:01:44.380> we<00:01:44.530> will<00:01:44.679> see<00:01:44.860> blood

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
the windpipe and look we will see blood

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.699 
the windpipe and look we will see blood
after<00:01:45.340> exercising<00:01:45.970> these<00:01:46.330> horses<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:47.020> this

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
after exercising these horses and this

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:49.620 
after exercising these horses and this
is<00:01:47.890> another<00:01:48.220> thing<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.940> nasal<00:01:49.360> strip

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
is another thing that the nasal strip

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.600 
is another thing that the nasal strip
does<00:01:49.840> is<00:01:50.110> it<00:01:50.410> makes<00:01:50.440> it<00:01:50.830> easier<00:01:51.220> for<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.429> horse

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
does is it makes it easier for the horse

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.969 
does is it makes it easier for the horse
to<00:01:51.670> breathe<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.239> it<00:01:52.300> reduces<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:53.319> physical

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
to breathe and it reduces the physical

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.800 
to breathe and it reduces the physical

to<00:01:56.470> reduce<00:01:56.679> the<00:01:57.130> iph

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
to reduce the iph

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.660 
to reduce the iph
you<00:02:00.549> imagine<00:02:01.090> trying<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:02.159> exercise<00:02:03.159> while

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
you imagine trying to exercise while

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.490 
you imagine trying to exercise while
somebody's<00:02:04.330> got<00:02:04.600> their<00:02:04.750> hand<00:02:05.049> over<00:02:05.350> your

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
exercise you can be concentrating on

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
exercise you can be concentrating on
trying<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.819> breathe

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.300 

what<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.140> can<00:02:20.319> hear<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.800> horse<00:02:21.040> comes

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
what you can hear is the horse comes

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.449 
what you can hear is the horse comes
towards<00:02:21.849> each<00:02:22.360> stride<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.380> each<00:02:23.620> breath<00:02:24.130> or<00:02:24.430> a

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
towards each stride and each breath or a

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.940 
towards each stride and each breath or a
perfect<00:02:25.000> synchrony<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:28.380> that's<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.620> sign<00:02:29.890> of

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
perfect synchrony and that's the sign of

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.020 
perfect synchrony and that's the sign of
a<00:02:30.160> healthy<00:02:30.190> horse<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:35.380> we're<00:02:35.620> actually

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
a healthy horse so we're actually

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.059 
a healthy horse so we're actually
perfectly<00:02:37.030> linked<00:02:37.330> together<00:02:37.540> at<00:02:38.319> Cantor<00:02:38.920> and

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
perfectly linked together at Cantor and

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.670 
perfectly linked together at Cantor and
gallop<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.660> becomes<00:02:40.870> even<00:02:41.230> more<00:02:41.260> critical

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
gallop and it becomes even more critical

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.729 
gallop and it becomes even more critical
once<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.370> all<00:02:42.489> starts<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:43.000> jump<00:02:43.590> what<00:02:44.590> we

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
once that all starts to jump what we

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.350 
once that all starts to jump what we
should<00:02:44.950> hear<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.340> what<00:02:45.459> comes<00:02:45.790> through<00:02:45.880> the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
should hear is what comes through the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.470 
should hear is what comes through the
holes<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.810> record<00:02:47.290> jump<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:49.120> it's<00:02:49.269> normal

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
holes of record jump and it's normal

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.040 
holes of record jump and it's normal
breathing<00:02:49.900> doesn't<00:02:50.410> start<00:02:50.739> till<00:02:51.519> Strider

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
breathing doesn't start till Strider

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.080 
breathing doesn't start till Strider
glad<00:02:53.050> then<00:02:53.680> gets<00:02:53.920> back<00:02:54.130> into<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.610> one-to-one

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
glad then gets back into this one-to-one

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.090 
glad then gets back into this one-to-one
river

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.590 

and<00:03:02.670> we<00:03:02.760> can<00:03:02.940> see<00:03:03.120> when<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.390> horse<00:03:03.540> is

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
and we can see when the horse is

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.720 
and we can see when the horse is
exercising<00:03:04.350> how<00:03:04.500> wide<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.220> holds<00:03:05.640> its

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
exercising how wide it holds its

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.880 
exercising how wide it holds its
nostrils<00:03:05.970> open<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.020> this<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.380> because<00:03:07.710> all

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
nostrils open and this is because all

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.380 
nostrils open and this is because all
the<00:03:08.100> air<00:03:08.220> that's<00:03:08.490> going<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.760> go<00:03:08.880> into<00:03:09.090> those

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
the air that's going to go into those

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.170 
the air that's going to go into those
lungs<00:03:09.750> that's<00:03:10.560> about<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> bucket<00:03:11.490> of<00:03:11.610> air<00:03:11.820> every

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
lungs that's about a bucket of air every

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.150 
lungs that's about a bucket of air every
stride<00:03:12.600> there's<00:03:13.230> got<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.590> go<00:03:13.710> through<00:03:13.980> those

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
stride there's got to go through those

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.610 
stride there's got to go through those
two<00:03:14.520> marow<00:03:14.850> nostrils<00:03:18.230> so<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.350> interesting

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
two marow nostrils so the interesting

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.070 
two marow nostrils so the interesting
thing<00:03:20.160> about<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.970> horse<00:03:21.210> that's<00:03:21.870> very

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
thing about the horse that's very

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.170 
thing about the horse that's very
different<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.560> us<00:03:22.680> is<00:03:23.010> we<00:03:23.700> can<00:03:23.940> breathe

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
different to us is we can breathe

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.510 
different to us is we can breathe
through<00:03:24.540> our<00:03:25.050> nose<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.650> through<00:03:26.100> our<00:03:26.250> mouth

through our nose and through our mouth

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.760 
through our nose and through our mouth
the<00:03:27.150> horse<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.660> only<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:28.050> be<00:03:28.080> able<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.530> breathe

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
the horse is only to be able to breathe

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.730 
the horse is only to be able to breathe
through<00:03:28.920> its<00:03:29.130> nose<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:31.260> horse<00:03:31.500> has<00:03:31.710> got

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
through its nose and the horse has got

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
down here but we've got this bit of skin

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.730 
down here but we've got this bit of skin
in<00:03:41.550> here<00:03:41.850> which<00:03:42.030> isn't<00:03:42.240> supported<00:03:43.080> there's<00:03:43.560> no

skin gets sucked in words and when the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.200 
skin gets sucked in words and when the
horse<00:03:54.330> breeze<00:03:54.630> out<00:03:55.460> has<00:03:56.460> been<00:03:56.490> sucked<00:03:56.910> in<00:03:57.060> now

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
horse breeze out has been sucked in now

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.780 
horse breeze out has been sucked in now
it<00:03:57.390> gets<00:03:58.020> balloons<00:03:58.920> out<00:03:59.250> now<00:03:59.400> that's<00:03:59.580> not<00:03:59.730> a

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
it gets balloons out now that's not a

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.670 
it gets balloons out now that's not a
problem<00:04:00.060> when<00:04:00.270> it<00:04:00.360> breathes<00:04:00.600> out<00:04:00.840> but<00:04:01.380> it<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.650> a

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
problem when it breathes out but it is a

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.260 
problem when it breathes out but it is a
problem<00:04:02.010> when<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.400> halt<00:04:02.580> freezing<00:04:03.120> because

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
problem when the halt freezing because

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.660 
problem when the halt freezing because
that<00:04:03.570> makes<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.500> inside<00:04:05.130> of<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.310> nostril

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
that makes in inside of the nostril

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.660 
that makes in inside of the nostril
narrower<00:04:06.210> and<00:04:06.620> obstructs<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.830> movement

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
narrower and obstructs the movement

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.710 
narrower and obstructs the movement
there<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:11.610> important<00:04:12.060> thing<00:04:12.090> with<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.450> flare

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
there the important thing with the flare

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.620 
there the important thing with the flare
strip<00:04:13.140> is<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.490> has<00:04:14.670> these<00:04:14.940> supportive

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
strip is that it has these supportive

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.380 
strip is that it has these supportive
bands<00:04:16.670> inside<00:04:17.670> and<00:04:17.850> there's<00:04:18.000> three<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.270> them

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
bands inside and there's three of them

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.060 
bands inside and there's three of them
and<00:04:18.600> this<00:04:18.690> is<00:04:18.900> this<00:04:19.049> is<00:04:19.260> along<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.650> lines<00:04:19.859> of

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
and this is this is along the lines of

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.550 
and this is this is along the lines of
the<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:21.060> idea<00:04:21.359> of<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:21.570> human<00:04:21.930> nasal<00:04:22.140> strip

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
the the idea of the human nasal strip

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.430 
the the idea of the human nasal strip
and<00:04:23.000> what<00:04:24.000> these<00:04:24.180> bands<00:04:24.480> have<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.930> do<00:04:25.140> is

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
and what these bands have to do is

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.250 
and what these bands have to do is
support<00:04:25.890> this<00:04:26.220> skin<00:04:26.610> over<00:04:26.910> here<00:04:27.210> now<00:04:27.960> that

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
support this skin over here now that

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.220 
support this skin over here now that
means<00:04:28.590> if<00:04:29.010> we've<00:04:29.190> got<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.520> up<00:04:29.640> too<00:04:30.180> high<00:04:30.510> then

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
means if we've got it up too high then

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.900 
means if we've got it up too high then
again<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.800> can<00:04:32.010> see<00:04:32.310> that<00:04:32.340> we're<00:04:32.700> not

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
again you can see that we're not

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.230 
again you can see that we're not
supporting<00:04:33.330> this<00:04:33.780> skin<00:04:34.470> here<00:04:34.890> too<00:04:35.280> similarly

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
supporting this skin here too similarly

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.300 
supporting this skin here too similarly
if<00:04:36.390> we've<00:04:36.540> got<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:36.840> down<00:04:36.870> here<00:04:37.590> if<00:04:37.890> it's<00:04:38.070> too

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
if we've got it down here if it's too

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.540 
if we've got it down here if it's too
low<00:04:38.610> then<00:04:39.330> we're<00:04:39.930> still<00:04:40.200> not<00:04:40.380> supporting<00:04:41.010> so

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
low then we're still not supporting so

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.600 
low then we're still not supporting so
these<00:04:42.480> bands<00:04:43.380> have<00:04:43.500> got<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.800> be<00:04:43.830> over<00:04:44.160> that

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
these bands have got to be over that

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.470 
these bands have got to be over that
part<00:04:44.970> of<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.240> scheme<00:04:46.040> there<00:04:47.040> to<00:04:47.730> support<00:04:47.940> it

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
part of the scheme there to support it

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.690 
part of the scheme there to support it
and<00:04:48.840> that's<00:04:49.110> that's<00:04:49.410> about<00:04:50.100> right<00:04:50.370> there

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
and that's that's about right there

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.640 
and that's that's about right there
because<00:04:51.300> we've<00:04:51.450> got<00:04:51.630> bone<00:04:51.840> up<00:04:52.050> there<00:04:52.080> and

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
because we've got bone up there and

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.950 
because we've got bone up there and
we've<00:04:53.010> got<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.760> cartilage<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.420> bone<00:04:54.630> down

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
we've got to the cartilage and bone down

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.450 
we've got to the cartilage and bone down
here<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:55.530> we're<00:04:56.070> right<00:04:56.970> in<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.270> right<00:04:57.450> place

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
here and we're right in the right place

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.820 
here and we're right in the right place
to<00:05:00.060> support<00:05:00.240> that<00:05:00.539> when<00:05:00.870> it's<00:05:01.020> there<00:05:01.289> the

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
to support that when it's there the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.680 
to support that when it's there the
other<00:05:01.949> important<00:05:02.460> thing<00:05:02.490> of<00:05:02.669> course<00:05:02.729> is<00:05:03.300> that

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
other important thing of course is that

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.370 
other important thing of course is that
it's<00:05:04.110> not<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:05.100> one<00:05:05.280> side<00:05:05.610> or<00:05:05.910> the<00:05:06.000> other<00:05:06.419> it's

it's not to one side or the other it's

it's not to one side or the other it's

got to be straight in the middle and

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.749 
got to be straight in the middle and
these<00:05:09.509> bands<00:05:09.870> have<00:05:10.319> got<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.650> be<00:05:10.740> over<00:05:10.949> that

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
these bands have got to be over that

these bands have got to be over that
part<00:05:12.090> of<00:05:12.240> skin<00:05:12.539> there<00:05:13.490> for<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.550> flare<00:05:14.759> nasal

part of skin there for the flare nasal
strip<00:05:15.539> to<00:05:15.870> work<00:05:16.050> effectively<00:05:16.470> it's<00:05:17.099> got<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.490> be

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
strip to work effectively it's got to be

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.180 
strip to work effectively it's got to be
fitted<00:05:17.940> correctly<00:05:18.139> making<00:05:19.139> sure<00:05:19.169> that<00:05:19.800> the

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
skin is clean and this means using the

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.730 
skin is clean and this means using the
template<00:05:24.210> that's<00:05:24.389> supplied<00:05:24.750> with<00:05:25.259> the<00:05:25.289> nasal

template that's supplied with the nasal
strip<00:05:26.039> and<00:05:26.300> lining<00:05:27.300> this<00:05:27.449> up<00:05:27.509> with<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.139> top<00:05:28.349> of

strip and lining this up with the top of
the<00:05:28.650> nostril<00:05:29.190> and<00:05:29.479> then<00:05:30.479> pushing<00:05:30.900> into<00:05:31.110> place

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.640 

you<00:05:37.500> can<00:05:37.680> see<00:05:37.919> that<00:05:37.949> sean<00:05:38.430> has<00:05:38.460> fitted<00:05:38.940> this

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
you can see that sean has fitted this

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.860 
you can see that sean has fitted this
perfectly<00:05:40.650> he's<00:05:41.130> used<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.490> template<00:05:42.060> to

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
perfectly he's used the template to

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.219 
perfectly he's used the template to
align<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:44.669> here<00:05:45.630> with<00:05:45.780> the<00:05:45.870> top<00:05:46.050> of<00:05:46.169> the

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
align the here with the top of the

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.680 
align the here with the top of the
nostrils<00:05:46.740> and<00:05:46.949> you<00:05:47.789> can<00:05:47.940> see<00:05:48.090> the<00:05:48.180> strips<00:05:48.509> in

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
nostrils and you can see the strips in

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.080 
nostrils and you can see the strips in
exactly<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:49.349> right<00:05:49.500> place<00:05:49.800> we've<00:05:50.699> got<00:05:50.970> the

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
exactly the right place we've got the

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.230 
exactly the right place we've got the
skin<00:05:51.419> here<00:05:51.930> fully<00:05:52.560> supported<00:05:53.250> by<00:05:53.699> the<00:05:53.759> strip

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
skin here fully supported by the strip

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.800 
skin here fully supported by the strip
and<00:05:54.509> if<00:05:54.870> I<00:05:54.990> put<00:05:55.199> my<00:05:55.229> hand<00:05:55.590> over<00:05:56.330> you<00:05:57.330> see<00:05:57.569> that

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
and if I put my hand over you see that

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.149 
and if I put my hand over you see that
when<00:05:57.930> the<00:05:58.020> horse<00:05:58.199> breeze<00:05:58.440> in<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:58.680> skin

00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.159 
when the horse breeze in the skin

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.219 
when the horse breeze in the skin
doesn't<00:05:59.400> collapse<00:05:59.819> anywhere<00:06:00.479> near<00:06:00.810> as<00:06:00.990> much

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
doesn't collapse anywhere near as much

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.200 
doesn't collapse anywhere near as much
when<00:06:01.979> the<00:06:02.099> horse<00:06:02.280> tries<00:06:02.550> to<00:06:02.729> breathe<00:06:02.940> in

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
when the horse tries to breathe in

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.779 
when the horse tries to breathe in
because<00:06:03.960> that's<00:06:04.139> because<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:05.159> strip<00:06:05.580> is

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
because that's because the strip is

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.820 
because that's because the strip is
attached<00:06:06.690> to<00:06:06.720> the<00:06:07.080> coat<00:06:07.349> here<00:06:07.620> and<00:06:07.740> it's

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
attached to the coat here and it's

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.550 
attached to the coat here and it's
keeping<00:06:08.070> the<00:06:08.970> skin<00:06:09.630> over<00:06:09.810> the<00:06:09.960> nostrils<00:06:10.440> and

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
keeping the skin over the nostrils and

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:17.590 
keeping the skin over the nostrils and
keeping<00:06:10.860> them<00:06:10.949> open

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.749 

so<00:06:18.600> clear<00:06:18.870> nasal<00:06:19.050> strips<00:06:19.560> are<00:06:19.830> easy<00:06:20.190> to<00:06:20.520> use

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 
so clear nasal strips are easy to use

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:24.140 
so clear nasal strips are easy to use
well<00:06:21.360> tolerated<00:06:21.630> by<00:06:22.139> horses<00:06:22.650> and<00:06:22.940> reduce<00:06:23.940> the

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
well tolerated by horses and reduce the

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.939 
well tolerated by horses and reduce the
stress<00:06:24.419> on<00:06:24.630> the<00:06:24.720> respiratory<00:06:25.169> system<00:06:25.320> which

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
stress on the respiratory system which

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:27.740 
stress on the respiratory system which
should<00:06:26.190> mean<00:06:26.370> improve<00:06:26.789> the<00:06:26.970> performance<00:06:27.030> and

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
should mean improve the performance and

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.889 
should mean improve the performance and
reduced<00:06:28.320> lung<00:06:28.620> bleed
