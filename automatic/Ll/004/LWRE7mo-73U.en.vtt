so<00:01:35.549> forth<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.000> think<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.360> moving<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.200> years<00:01:37.829> of

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
so forth I think it's moving in years of

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.060 
so forth I think it's moving in years of
five<00:01:38.189> years<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.700> know<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.290> I<00:01:40.290> think<00:01:40.920> that's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
five years you know and I think that's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.770 
five years you know and I think that's
that's<00:01:41.280> very<00:01:41.430> interesting<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.659> the

moment I have zero

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.880
