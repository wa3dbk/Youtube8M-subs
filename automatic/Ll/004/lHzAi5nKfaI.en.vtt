 You can clearly play this difference between tipping and not bouncing 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.630
 We had an article meeting, but because it comes to eat hiccup fairly well, it is offensive 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.290

 It looks like this, I say this with my mouth already 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:06.130
 I think it 's pretty early to put in the rhythm, so let's say what kind of rhythm hall together 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.340
