00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
the color it's gold and it's by smooth

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.920 
the color it's gold and it's by smooth
on<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:31.650> can<00:02:31.769> get<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.010> from<00:02:32.099> their<00:02:32.310> site<00:02:32.549> I

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
on you can get it from their site I

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.869 
on you can get it from their site I
think<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.019> can<00:02:34.140> get<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.379> on<00:02:34.440> ebay<00:02:35.220> too<00:02:35.280> and

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
think you can get it on ebay too and

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.610 
think you can get it on ebay too and
this<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.750> meant<00:02:37.080> for<00:02:37.440> coloring<00:02:38.069> casting<00:02:39.060> resin

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
this is meant for coloring casting resin

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.289 
this is meant for coloring casting resin
because<00:02:40.620> resin<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.160> hard<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.579> paint<00:02:41.879> so<00:02:42.239> you

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
because resin is hard to paint so you

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.069 
because resin is hard to paint so you
can<00:02:43.579> paint<00:02:44.579> this<00:02:44.790> into<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.269> mold<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.870> then

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
can paint this into the mold and then

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.650 
can paint this into the mold and then
the<00:02:46.230> casting<00:02:46.829> will<00:02:47.310> come<00:02:47.610> out<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:48.000> color<00:02:48.269> and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
the casting will come out this color and

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.940 
the casting will come out this color and
they<00:02:48.780> sell<00:02:48.989> them<00:02:49.079> in<00:02:49.140> all<00:02:49.290> sorts<00:02:49.470> different

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
they sell them in all sorts different

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.059 
they sell them in all sorts different
colors<00:02:50.340> what<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.150> use<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.690> for<00:02:51.720> more<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.739> the

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
colors what I use it for more so the

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:01.069 
colors what I use it for more so the
mass<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:54.810> paint<00:02:55.230> on<00:02:55.700> these<00:02:58.160> cars<00:02:59.299> so<00:03:00.299> and

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079

like gold flake and it will stick you

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.870 
like gold flake and it will stick you
kind<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.569> have<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.750> be<00:03:33.900> delicate<00:03:34.169> with<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.880> but

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880

errors<00:03:44.519> in<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.819> paint<00:03:46.519> works<00:03:47.519> well<00:03:47.730> for<00:03:47.970> that

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
errors in the paint works well for that

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.659 
errors in the paint works well for that
all<00:03:48.780> right<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.380> something's<00:03:50.250> gonna<00:03:50.340> fall<00:03:50.430> off

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
all right and something's gonna fall off
