00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:11.480
 New herbicides that are harmless and harmless to the human body are our technology. 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.489
 This herbicide can kill all the weeds at once. World Herbicide 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.089
 We are getting attention in the market 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:16.089
 It is reporter Lee Jung - woo . 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:27.500
 The pharmacopoeia is excellent and is safe for people and animals. 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:31.669
 In the first case, the route is spraying d12, 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:36.589
 Compared to the subject now 2 3 days of drug efficacy appears 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:41.449
 Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT) is a joint development with domestic firms is a particular herbicide weed 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:43.940
 Once all the coordinates, unlike the selective therapy that targets only year cycle 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:49.339
 p Selectivity will be submitted 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:54.500
 Very safe and also effective on humans or the environment is also a conventional formulation 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:58.070
 It is more effective for such weeds that do not listen , 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:03.949
 It is expected to be the second sister-in-law to declare 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:08.990
 20 Substance 3 theme exhibits the effect of inhibiting photosynthetic action 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:14.150
 Passed the safety test of more than 90 items in the United States and the UK, 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.369
 We can kill weeds that are resistant to covering, so in terms of cost and environmental safety 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.440
 Competitiveness is excellent 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:26.870
 2:00 Substance Substance Submitted Patent technology transfer contract and future new substance 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:32.600
 We concluded a joint research contract for pipeline construction and commercialized it. 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:37.370
 At present , patent registration in Terados in more than 20 countries including USA, Japan, China and Europe 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.390
 After having completed the patent in more than 10 countries such as Brazil and India, including progress 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.909
 is 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.130
 Even if this is a hit in the verification process, so that a good illustration that 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.090
 It is different 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:54.979
 Right in the very competitive drug empty framed against 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.240
 The world b-selectivity retracement market has a good condition of 5.9 billion 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.040
 Dollar line 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:06.619
 Following the launch of domestic products in the coming 17 years , 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:09.640
 We expect more than $ 500 million annually in sales in 30 countries. 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.640
 The two kinds ytn
