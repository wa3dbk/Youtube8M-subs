00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.690 
like run really really fast with a knife
but<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.720> die<00:01:40.259> pretty<00:01:40.650> quick<00:01:40.950> too<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> don't<00:01:41.490> I

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700

but you die pretty quick too I don't I
feel<00:01:41.729> like<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.360> nine<00:01:42.600> kills<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.140> row<00:01:43.170> it's

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
feel like for nine kills in a row it's

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.149 
feel like for nine kills in a row it's
not<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:43.950> good<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.369> should<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.960> um<00:01:45.979> but<00:01:46.979> then

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
not as good as it should be um but then

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.910 
not as good as it should be um but then
again<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.520> dog<00:01:47.990> any<00:01:48.990> kind<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.290> dog<00:01:49.500> gets<00:01:49.740> for

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
again the dog any kind of dog gets for

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.620 
again the dog any kind of dog gets for
you<00:01:50.009> adds<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.460> kill<00:01:50.759> Sheik<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.270> know

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
you adds to that kill Sheik so you know

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.510 
you adds to that kill Sheik so you know
it<00:01:51.840> balances<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.409> out<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.560> little<00:01:52.740> bit<00:01:52.890> makes<00:01:53.430> a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
it balances it out a little bit makes a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.789 
it balances it out a little bit makes a
little<00:01:53.670> bit<00:01:53.850> easier<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.649> know

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
little bit easier to get but you know

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.870 
little bit easier to get but you know
the<00:01:55.950> kill<00:01:56.130> streaks<00:01:56.399> aren't<00:01:56.579> really<00:01:56.759> that

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
the kill streaks aren't really that

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.359 
the kill streaks aren't really that
useful<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.750> game<00:01:57.960> at<00:01:58.350> all<00:01:58.590> actually<00:01:59.159> well

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369

the three that we got to use at the you
know<00:02:02.100> review<00:02:02.430> there<00:02:02.640> might<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:02.820> more<00:02:03.149> I'm<00:02:03.420> just

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
know review there might be more I'm just

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.289

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
bit more excitement to the game and it

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.129 
bit more excitement to the game and it
just<00:02:26.969> adds<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.359> know<00:02:27.389> that<00:02:27.629> extra<00:02:27.930> element
