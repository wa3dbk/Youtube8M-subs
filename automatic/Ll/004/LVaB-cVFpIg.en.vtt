00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.690 

now<00:00:01.199> we're<00:00:01.350> gonna<00:00:01.469> replace<00:00:01.770> these<00:00:02.220> switches

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
now we're gonna replace these switches

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.300 
now we're gonna replace these switches
in<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.000> bathroom<00:00:03.389> obviously<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.560> power<00:00:04.710> is

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
in the bathroom obviously the power is

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.470 
in the bathroom obviously the power is
off<00:00:05.490> which<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:05.819> why<00:00:05.970> we<00:00:06.060> have<00:00:06.180> this<00:00:06.299> weird

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
off which is why we have this weird

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.009 
off which is why we have this weird
light<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.870> coming<00:00:07.109> from<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.379> other<00:00:07.470> room

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
light and coming from the other room

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.530 
light and coming from the other room
it's<00:00:10.019> nice<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.410> start<00:00:10.590> by<00:00:10.800> removing<00:00:11.540> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
it's nice to start by removing the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.970 
it's nice to start by removing the
faceplate<00:00:15.080> unscrew<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.230> switch<00:00:16.529> from<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
faceplate unscrew the switch from the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.759 
faceplate unscrew the switch from the
wall<00:00:21.020> so<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> wires<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.470> just<00:00:22.590> wrapped

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
wall so the wires are just wrapped

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.540 
wall so the wires are just wrapped
around<00:00:22.920> these<00:00:23.100> screws<00:00:23.519> here<00:00:24.710> that's<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.830> switch

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
around these screws here that's a switch

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.820 
around these screws here that's a switch
it's<00:00:27.510> just<00:00:27.869> opening<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.500> closing<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
it's just opening and closing the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.359 
it's just opening and closing the
connections<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.670> can't<00:00:29.849> really<00:00:30.000> matter

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
connections so it can't really matter

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.160 
connections so it can't really matter
where<00:00:32.369> they<00:00:32.550> are<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> switch<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.840> basic

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
where they are on the switch in a basic

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.709 
where they are on the switch in a basic
circuit<00:00:34.530> three-way<00:00:35.010> circuits<00:00:35.399> are<00:00:35.719> another

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
circuit three-way circuits are another

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.319 
circuit three-way circuits are another
story<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.170> tackling<00:00:40.129> this<00:00:41.129> circuit<00:00:42.000> only<00:00:42.210> has

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
story in tackling this circuit only has

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:50.830 
story in tackling this circuit only has
one<00:00:42.510> switch<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:45.360> wire<00:00:45.539> placement<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.260> not

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.240 

what<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.930> critical<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.469> make<00:00:52.739> sure<00:00:52.770> that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
what is critical is to make sure that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.119 
what is critical is to make sure that
the<00:00:54.030> top<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.660> switch<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> top<00:00:55.890> of

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the top of the switch is on the top of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.279 
the top of the switch is on the top of
the<00:00:56.250> new<00:00:56.370> switch<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.840> says<00:00:57.870> top

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the new switch so here it says top

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.170 
the new switch so here it says top
started<00:00:58.859> going<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:01.850> let<00:01:02.850> me<00:01:03.000> show

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
started going just like so let me show

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:13.660 
started going just like so let me show
you<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.449> wire<00:01:03.629> underneath<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:06.299> screen

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:32.929 

here<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.789> go

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:02:11.960 

it's<00:01:33.810> gonna<00:01:33.960> take

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.700 

I<00:02:13.080> was<00:02:14.080> just<00:02:14.170> trying<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.440> push<00:02:14.560> this

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
I was just trying to push this

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.970 
I was just trying to push this
insulation<00:02:15.130> down<00:02:15.460> so<00:02:15.970> that<00:02:16.120> there's<00:02:16.360> less

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
insulation down so that there's less

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:28.740 
insulation down so that there's less
exposed<00:02:17.980> wire<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:26.940> always<00:02:27.940> double<00:02:28.180> check<00:02:28.240> again

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
exposed wire I always double check again

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.200 
exposed wire I always double check again
to<00:02:28.780> make<00:02:29.020> sure<00:02:29.050> top<00:02:29.410> is<00:02:29.590> on<00:02:29.710> top<00:02:29.950> so<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.030> your

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
to make sure top is on top so that your

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.130 
to make sure top is on top so that your
lights<00:02:31.450> turn<00:02:31.720> on<00:02:31.840> switches<00:02:32.800> oh<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:35.020> the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
lights turn on switches oh and the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.540 
lights turn on switches oh and the
screws<00:02:35.410> are<00:02:35.560> close<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:36.040> getting<00:02:36.280> nowhere

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
screws are close to getting nowhere

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.370 
screws are close to getting nowhere
-<00:02:37.030> we're<00:02:37.510> gonna<00:02:37.630> tighten<00:02:37.990> up<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:39.550> outlet

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
- we're gonna tighten up the outlet

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:49.650 
- we're gonna tighten up the outlet
properly<00:02:41.380> aligned<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:43.780> it'll<00:02:43.930> be<00:02:44.080> straight

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.790 

and<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.560> next<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:52.690> testing<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.260> plate

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
and the next just testing the plate

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.670 
and the next just testing the plate
listen<00:02:54.760> set<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.540> little<00:02:55.720> bit<00:02:55.840> soft<00:02:56.290> back<00:02:56.470> off

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
listen set a little bit soft back off

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.250 
listen set a little bit soft back off
the<00:02:56.860> screws<00:02:57.160> just<00:02:57.460> a<00:02:57.580> little<00:03:00.660> extra<00:03:01.660> take<00:03:01.960> this

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
the screws just a little extra take this

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:18.090 
the screws just a little extra take this
one<00:03:02.440> off<00:03:02.560> instead<00:03:04.800> not<00:03:05.800> close<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.340> even<00:03:17.100> there

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
one off instead not close to even there

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.180 
one off instead not close to even there
you<00:03:18.160> go<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.550> brand<00:03:18.760> new<00:03:18.880> so<00:03:19.000> just
