a tape the cord still moves freely
within<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.969> tape<00:00:56.210> but<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.170> can't<00:00:57.530> pull<00:00:57.859> it

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:57.889 
within the tape but you can't pull it

out<00:00:58.129> very<00:00:58.489> far<00:00:58.870> you<00:00:59.870> want<00:01:00.049> to<00:01:00.109> make<00:01:00.289> sure<00:01:00.319> that

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:00.889 
out very far you want to make sure that

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:03.759 
out very far you want to make sure that
the<00:01:01.039> tack<00:01:01.309> points<00:01:01.909> on<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.420> tape<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:03.019> eight

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
inches or less in between so that you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.980 
inches or less in between so that you
get<00:01:06.409> a<00:01:06.440> very<00:01:06.680> small<00:01:07.070> loop<00:01:07.430> which<00:01:08.150> is<00:01:08.420> not<00:01:08.780> the

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990

can see where I would have grabbed my
pins<00:01:55.399> I<00:01:55.640> can<00:01:55.820> see<00:01:56.090> where<00:01:56.450> they<00:01:56.630> were<00:01:56.659> sewn<00:01:57.079> on

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
this will also help to hold the fabric

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.540 
this will also help to hold the fabric
together<00:02:14.210> if<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:15.230> move<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.650> shade<00:02:15.920> around<00:02:16.310> if

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
together if you move the shade around if

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.730 
together if you move the shade around if
you<00:02:16.640> wanted<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.030> take<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.390> shade<00:02:17.660> over<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.710> a

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
worry if you have excess cord here right

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.190 
worry if you have excess cord here right
now<00:03:30.220> we're<00:03:30.820> going<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.209> tug<00:03:31.540> on<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.810> and

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
now we're going to tug on that and

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.720 
now we're going to tug on that and
straighten<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.650> out<00:03:32.800> later<00:03:32.860> now<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:33.550> is<00:03:33.700> a

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
straighten it out later now this is a

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.940 
straighten it out later now this is a
relaxed<00:03:34.330> shade<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.080> cord<00:03:35.350> actually<00:03:35.530> runs

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
relaxed shade so the cord actually runs

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.940 
relaxed shade so the cord actually runs
at<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.130> slight<00:03:36.489> angle<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.260> where<00:03:38.260> I<00:03:38.290> have<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.560> pin

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
at a slight angle so where I have a pin

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.810 
at a slight angle so where I have a pin
I'm<00:03:39.250> going<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:40.030> go<00:03:40.150> ahead<00:03:40.300> and<00:03:40.540> pin<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.050> tape

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
I'm going to go ahead and pin the tape

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.020 
I'm going to go ahead and pin the tape
to<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:43.239> shade<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:44.739> each<00:03:44.920> pin<00:03:45.250> was<00:03:45.489> where<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:45.700> cut

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
to the shade so each pin was where I cut

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:55.229 
to the shade so each pin was where I cut
away<00:03:46.300> a<00:03:46.600> Roman<00:03:47.170> shade<00:03:47.410> ring

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.099 

at<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.420> top<00:03:56.689> allow<00:03:57.319> enough<00:03:57.890> tape<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.930> go

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
at the top allow enough tape to go

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.030 
at the top allow enough tape to go
across<00:04:00.530> your<00:04:00.950> shade<00:04:01.359> and<00:04:02.409> over<00:04:03.409> and<00:04:03.739> however

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
across your shade and over and however

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.490 
across your shade and over and however
far<00:04:04.459> down<00:04:04.760> you<00:04:05.150> need<00:04:05.359> your<00:04:05.599> cord<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:06.049> go<00:04:06.079> and

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
far down you need your cord to go and

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.110 
far down you need your cord to go and
this<00:04:06.590> depends<00:04:06.890> on<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.069> size<00:04:07.189> of<00:04:07.700> your<00:04:07.730> shade

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
this depends on the size of your shade

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.009 
this depends on the size of your shade
I'm<00:04:09.019> going<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.290> just<00:04:09.409> cut<00:04:09.620> it<00:04:09.709> off<00:04:09.859> right<00:04:10.189> here

I'm going to just cut it off right here

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.559 
I'm going to just cut it off right here
that<00:04:12.019> leaves<00:04:12.170> me<00:04:12.349> plenty<00:04:12.920> if<00:04:13.909> this<00:04:14.120> was<00:04:14.269> we're

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
that leaves me plenty if this was we're

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.050 
that leaves me plenty if this was we're
a<00:04:14.599> bigger<00:04:14.900> shade<00:04:15.290> every<00:04:16.160> time<00:04:16.400> you<00:04:16.609> brought<00:04:16.850> up

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060
