00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:16.230
 the means of service their effects in internal combustion engines 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.750
 any general condition, formation of residues that always have TV technique 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.010
 on the working methods and on the degree of effectiveness of an engine 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.280
 especially the residues in the area of ​​the ring retaining rings 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.610
 scraper and their grooves 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.610
 cause a decrease in compression 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.390
 the worsening combustion of the resulting mixture of air and fuel 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.410
 causes a decrease in performance 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.750
 consequently it increases oil and fuel consumption 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.840
 this causes too much of the residues of the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.890
 combustion 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.350
 and on the other side of the too high values ​​of the castes 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.480
 in addition to the acceleration and wear of the engines 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.520
 some parts of the mixture and vega star combustion evaporate in the 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.670
 engine crankcase accelerating oil aging and can 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.360
 cause damage to the operation of the vent in the basement itself 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.590
 you would like more consistent impurities like traces of hardened resin in the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.920
 oil lines 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.000
 they can obstruct the lubrication of important elements such as 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.220
 the camshaft 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.880
 but these impurities are eliminated with a normal oil change 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.920
 for a better clarification let's take another look inside the 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.480
 engine stand 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.380
 at a normal oil change the old olive tree is discharged 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.950
 however, by discharging the old oil we do not get rid of all the impurities 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.990
 linked to the service a part remains in the form of a deposit in the circuit 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.420
 oil and lubrication 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.030
 when the engine is freshly filled, it is fresh and clean and starts again 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.860
 the new oil take a if residuals and gentlemen dirty in the turn of 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.999
 very short time 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:22.129
 that is naturally negative effects on the performance of the new lion 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.409
 to keep both the performance and economy of combustion engines high 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.080
 internal 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.179
 we advise you to carry out before every oil change 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.179
 cleaning all the oil in the lubrication circuit 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:39.499
 after adding to the old oil of our purifier the motor must be operated 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:41.060
 with an empty run 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.999
 10 15 minutes 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:47.239
 in this time only all the dirt molecules accumulated during the 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.659
 functioning as here we can see in some particularly delicate areas 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.869
 these are for example 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:58.869
 the area of ​​the retaining rings 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.379
 the area of ​​the Salento Elba vent 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.599
 and the camshaft lubrication zone 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.730
 at the same time, highly lubricated components protect the motor 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.239
 during the entire cleaning process 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.090
 elastomeric and the shaft washers and sealing joints are held 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.319
 doughy 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.459
 all the impurities are removed from the old olive tree 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.230
 so we get 1 io and a very clean lubrication circuit we start xul 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.230
 with the new fresh olive tree 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:44.319
 only now in the clean environment the new wolf optimally offer its own 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.940
 features and meet lubrication needs 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.350
 waterproof 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.350
 cool off by retaining the particles 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:58.660
 I want fresh I take delivery of new important now 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.340
 and the old residues are no longer limited in its performance 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.369
 therefore our result 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:10.369
 fresh oil the new in a clean engine 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.249
 optimal fuel oil consumption 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:17.189
 an improved engine performance 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:19.659
 - engine wear 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.699
 - gaseous emissions 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.049
 and a longer life of the catalyst
