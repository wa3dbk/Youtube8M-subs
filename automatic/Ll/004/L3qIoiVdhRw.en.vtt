00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.340 
here I'm just gonna give you a little
think<00:00:03.540> that<00:00:03.659> scrape<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:03.990> little<00:00:04.170> more

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
think that scrape a little more

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.470 
think that scrape a little more
prominent<00:00:04.859> really<00:00:05.430> just<00:00:05.640> like<00:00:05.790> that<00:00:06.000> just<00:00:06.420> a

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
prominent really just like that just a

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.270 
prominent really just like that just a
little<00:00:06.600> Wow<00:00:06.839> see<00:00:07.319> that's<00:00:07.500> that<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.919> texture

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
little Wow see that's that the texture

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.589 
little Wow see that's that the texture
gives<00:00:08.370> it<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.580> scraping<00:00:09.090> effect<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.510> them

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
gives it that scraping effect of them

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.509 
gives it that scraping effect of them
you<00:00:09.660> can<00:00:09.750> use<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.650> end<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.860> sponges<00:00:11.250> without

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
you can use the end of sponges without

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.910 
you can use the end of sponges without
the<00:00:11.670> makeup<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.240> get<00:00:12.780> off<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.990> excess<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:13.830> it

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
the makeup to get off the excess so it

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.070 
the makeup to get off the excess so it
looks<00:00:13.980> yeah<00:00:14.460> naive<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.450> just<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.839> little

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
looks yeah naive that just a little

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.170 
looks yeah naive that just a little
scrape<00:00:16.440> on<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> ship<00:00:16.920> okay<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:17.940> that's

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
scrape on the ship okay so that's

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.390 
scrape on the ship okay so that's
basically<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.630> red<00:00:18.840> effect<00:00:19.199> ok<00:00:19.710> I'm<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.340> to

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
basically the red effect ok I'm going to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.480 
basically the red effect ok I'm going to
move<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> next<00:00:21.380> color<00:00:22.380> with<00:00:23.310> that

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
move on to the next color with that

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.939 
move on to the next color with that
would<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.850> which<00:00:24.840> would<00:00:25.080> be<00:00:25.320> I'm<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> use

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
would be which would be I'm going to use

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.460 
would be which would be I'm going to use
a<00:00:25.980> little<00:00:26.310> black<00:00:27.119> now<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> charring

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
effect okay and that's just going to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.150 
effect okay and that's just going to
give<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.570> effect<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:31.439> you

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
especially if you're creating a

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.810 
especially if you're creating a
character<00:01:41.270> more<00:01:42.270> times<00:01:42.540> than<00:01:42.659> not<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.869> have

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
character more times than not you have

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.030 
character more times than not you have
an<00:01:44.820> idea<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.270> what<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> director<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.920> know

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
an idea of what the director you know

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.460 
an idea of what the director you know
it's<00:01:47.399> going<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.570> even<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> mean

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it's going right and even then I mean

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.840 
it's going right and even then I mean
there's<00:01:49.649> always<00:01:49.890> room<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.670> experimentation

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
there's always room for experimentation

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.510 
there's always room for experimentation
