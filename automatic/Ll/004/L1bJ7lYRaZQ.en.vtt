from International Harvester and very
simple<00:02:27.060> operation<00:02:29.690> we<00:02:30.690> generally<00:02:31.140> use<00:02:31.410> this

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
simple operation we generally use this

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.180 
simple operation we generally use this
machine<00:02:32.550> when<00:02:33.180> weeds<00:02:33.420> are<00:02:33.780> about<00:02:34.080> just<00:02:34.560> just

machine when weeds are about just just
starting<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.520> germinate<00:02:35.730> that's<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.300> best

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
starting to germinate that's the best

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.830 
starting to germinate that's the best
time<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.930> go<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.910> slight<00:02:39.270> disruption<00:02:39.750> on

time to go in that slight disruption on
the<00:02:39.900> ground<00:02:41.000> small<00:02:42.000> weeds<00:02:42.210> they<00:02:42.570> die

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
the ground small weeds they die

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.890 
the ground small weeds they die
instantly<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.910> you<00:02:44.910> do<00:02:45.060> get<00:02:45.240> behind<00:02:45.390> however

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
instantly if you do get behind however

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.440 
instantly if you do get behind however
and<00:02:46.440> we'd<00:02:46.590> start<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.070> germinate<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:48.120> they<00:02:48.270> get

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
and we'd start to germinate and they get

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.510 
and we'd start to germinate and they get
even<00:02:48.570> up<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.900> six<00:02:49.170> we've<00:02:49.620> even<00:02:49.890> used<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.310> at

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
even up to six we've even used this at

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.210 
even up to six we've even used this at
12<00:02:50.730> inches<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.180> height<00:02:51.830> because<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.010> round

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
12 inches in height because the round

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.760 
12 inches in height because the round
discs<00:02:53.670> are<00:02:53.820> there<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.300> get<00:02:54.480> no<00:02:54.690> clog<00:02:55.020> up<00:02:55.260> that

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
discs are there you get no clog up that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.770 
discs are there you get no clog up that
you<00:02:55.860> would<00:02:55.980> normally<00:02:56.340> get<00:02:56.460> on<00:02:56.520> all<00:02:57.000> straight

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
you would normally get on all straight

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.980 
you would normally get on all straight
teeth<00:02:58.520> so<00:02:59.520> it's<00:02:59.670> great<00:02:59.910> if<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.240> can<00:03:00.660> get<00:03:00.870> in

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
teeth so it's great if you can get in

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.110 
teeth so it's great if you can get in
early<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.350> if<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.740> happen<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.070> not<00:03:02.820> get<00:03:03.030> in

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
early and if you happen to not get in

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.170 
early and if you happen to not get in
early<00:03:03.410> they<00:03:04.410> still<00:03:04.620> will<00:03:04.740> do<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.890> great<00:03:05.190> job<00:03:05.430> the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
early they still will do a great job the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.080 
early they still will do a great job the
only<00:03:06.390> difference<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:06.870> you'd<00:03:07.080> have<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.380> do<00:03:08.090> we

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
only difference is you'd have to do we

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.640 
only difference is you'd have to do we
add<00:03:09.150> six<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.570> twelve<00:03:09.810> inches<00:03:09.930> in<00:03:10.230> height<00:03:10.410> you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
add six to twelve inches in height you

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.390 
add six to twelve inches in height you
may<00:03:10.770> have<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.070> do<00:03:11.540> your<00:03:12.540> rows<00:03:12.750> six<00:03:13.350> about<00:03:14.130> six

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
may have to do your rows six about six

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.510 
may have to do your rows six about six
times<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.970> get<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.120> complete<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:17.130> know<00:03:17.220> clean

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
times to get a complete you know clean

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.730 
times to get a complete you know clean
area<00:03:17.970> whereas<00:03:18.690> if<00:03:18.960> you<00:03:19.050> get<00:03:19.260> in<00:03:19.380> at<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.590> right

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
area whereas if you get in at the right

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.360 
area whereas if you get in at the right
time<00:03:19.800> usually<00:03:20.550> twice<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.420> year<00:03:21.990> is<00:03:22.920> all<00:03:23.160> that

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
time usually twice a year is all that

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.160 
time usually twice a year is all that
you<00:03:23.520> need<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.760> be<00:03:23.850> done<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.900> particular

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
you need to be done this particular

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.950 
you need to be done this particular
field<00:03:25.560> has<00:03:25.890> been<00:03:26.040> done<00:03:26.280> twice<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:27.060> what

field has been done twice and what

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.670 
field has been done twice and what

offers us also with this unit is we can
put<00:03:31.830> down<00:03:31.950> fertilizer<00:03:32.490> at<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.510> same<00:03:33.720> time

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
put down fertilizer at the same time

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.920

that<00:03:34.170> we're<00:03:34.290> cultivating<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:35.790> with<00:03:36.060> what<00:03:36.780> so

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
that we're cultivating so with what so

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.740 
that we're cultivating so with what so
getting<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.500> lot<00:03:37.650> of<00:03:37.680> things<00:03:37.920> done<00:03:38.130> with<00:03:38.280> one
