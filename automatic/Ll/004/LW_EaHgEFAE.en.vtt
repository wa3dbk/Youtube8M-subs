00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello to all and their echo 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.390
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.670
 unbridled motorcycle because since 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.809
 I had my bike finally even before I 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.849
 looked on the internet and I saw that they 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.000
 had no video for who was showing 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.279
 how unbridled a motorcycle so I have 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.010
 deduce that every bike to a flange 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.480
 staff I want to say then me 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.150
 my main bridle is at the potty 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.470
 so I have a derby war of x trem e 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.610
 for those who for connoisseurs end 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.940
 I think there are who will watch 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.040
 the video 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.000
 so me my main bridel is here 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.719
 so I removed his three goals I 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.149
 do fart what was to 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.760
 the end interior fart game light I 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.200
 damn a bang that my hunger it 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.000
 allowed me to better pass the gas 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.039
 it's like a funnel as if 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.390
 finally you understand me and the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.949
 thing that must not be done 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.090
 few there are a lot of people who 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.949
 say it must be done is remove 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.579
 this thing that sort of thing 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.350
 weird because it reduces it barely 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.970
 the gases and if you take it down you 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.409
 have earned what 3.4 km hour this is 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.580
 absolutely nothing and in addition the cops 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.360
 are going to want to piss you off if it's worth 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.090
 not this bar 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:18.520
 so council does not cut and especially not 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:22.720
 this bar on pain of having 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.790
 rather boring consequences then bah 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.990
 yeah there usually the flanges the 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.080
 main bray-dunes motorcycles are on 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.610
 the skins what you can 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.590
 do you can change the piston 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.040
 it's a 58th kit of origin I just die 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.540
 break the pot and I take 80-90 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.670
 derby meter so I think that's 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.860
 a little less hop 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.640
 can you do that too but 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.619
 the focus you can change the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.590
 pinion output box 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.509
 so me it's a twelve pinion or 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.340
 thirteen which I do not know at all what 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.220
 you can do it's finally add 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.259
 put in gear a year or two of 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.490
 more basically it's like on a bike if 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.740
 you are in first gear you go 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.420
 galley to pedal up to 10 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.630
 kilometers an hour you have pedaling like 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.649
 a donkey and if you climb speed 1st 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.729
 2nd 3rd you 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.040
 you will see that it will go right away yes 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.209
 finally I think you understood me and 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.860
 Well, that's exactly the same 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.950
 principle so you can change 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.439
 the exit opinion of box 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.239
 what can you change too 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.340
 this big gear the balm and frankly 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.959
 I do not really see any use except 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.950
 changes apart from unleashing the pot or the 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:34.489
 downright change it put a kit 5 50 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.819
 70 or 80 and change that little sprocket I 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:41.109
 think the bike will already be pretty good 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.310
 unbridled me I intend to put a kit 70 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.829
 with all the complete kit 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.220
 that is to say, the reinforced bike that 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.620
 it was brief rector so I you 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.730
 advise to laon but the focus 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.189
 I thought you if you want to unleash 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.220
 your bike to inform you at a 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:02.900
 garage owner who does it because it takes 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.560
 do it informally and that's it 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.609
 quite complex 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.230
 if you do not do it well this unbridled 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.610
 there may be sequelae on your 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.040
 motorcycle so 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.280
 do be careful here 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.390
 today it's a little video for 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.760
 if I showed you the sound of my bike a 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:32.770
 little since the video two years not that 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:32.770
 can not be bad so wait here 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.210
 so I do not know if you hear me 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.710
 but a motorcycle that is throttled 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.460
 can much less go out at wholesale 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.140
 that's what a cycle there is the flange 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.460
 hop there y'a pus the bri so find it 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.920
 much bigger the gases spend more 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.780
 him plus he goes into bigger 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.430
 quantity and the bike can not go up to 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.020
 over 8000 or 9000 early I looked 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:07.470
 I did the test with a friend and when 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:08.030
 she is unbridled low that gives it here 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.720
 here 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.700
 I forgot to tell you something 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.590
 when you finish your rodez it's up to 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.270
 say to 1000 kilometers that you go to 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.100
 garage to do the overhaul 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.840
 they will tighten you all the screws 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.820
 of your motorcycle finally it depends what 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.650
 also 600 children of the motor brief and 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.060
 those above are likely to decide and 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.680
 to fall it depends on the models I do not know 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.480
 so sure others alone does anyway 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.710
 this is the party so watch out because 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.180
 that it can be dangerous enough 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.050
 so this visit can fall 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.050
 here are dear of the world
