familiar of the term obd2 yeah find the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.800 
familiar of the term obd2 yeah find the
OBD<00:01:16.290> port<00:01:17.509> it's<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.869> believe<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.380> above<00:01:20.100> your

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
OBD port it's I believe it's above your

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.940 
OBD port it's I believe it's above your
brake<00:01:21.810> pads<00:01:23.060> well<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.740> if<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.799> have

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
a manual transmission it's above your

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.600 
a manual transmission it's above your

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
the left foot or left leg so what if we

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:26.059 
the left foot or left leg so what if we
do<00:02:01.299> let's<00:02:02.080> start<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.560> feel<00:02:15.480> case<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.750> shift<00:02:17.080> n

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.009 

now<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.160> instruction<00:02:27.910> said<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.959> should

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
now the instruction said that it should

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.280

mind it just bling like infinitely for
no<00:02:36.220> reason<00:02:37.800> but<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:39.760> might<00:02:40.000> be<00:02:40.440> showing<00:02:41.440> that

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
no reason but that might be showing that

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.940
