00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.740 
problems
so<00:02:23.460> this<00:02:23.910> hair<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:25.620> doesn't<00:02:26.010> tangle

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
so this hair it just doesn't tangle

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.030 
so this hair it just doesn't tangle
especially<00:02:27.750> when<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.290> straight<00:02:28.680> form

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
especially when it's in a straight form

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.710 
especially when it's in a straight form
when<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.820> was<00:02:30.060> wearing<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.630> in<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:32.420> clippings<00:02:33.420> I

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
when I was wearing it in the clippings I

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.320 
when I was wearing it in the clippings I
was<00:02:34.290> catching<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.920> little<00:02:35.100> snags<00:02:35.730> here<00:02:36.210> and

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
was catching a little snags here and

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.430 
was catching a little snags here and
there<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.170> kept<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.770> hair<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.990> wand<00:02:39.990> curls

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
there but I kept the hair in wand curls

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.490 
there but I kept the hair in wand curls

trimmed the hair and put some layers
into<00:04:42.849> it<00:04:43.029> that<00:04:43.689> the<00:04:44.080> ends<00:04:44.560> are<00:04:44.710> getting<00:04:45.099> a

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:45.189 
into it that the ends are getting a
