00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
plug in one cable one on the input side

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.770 
plug in one cable one on the input side
that's<00:02:24.440> other<00:02:24.650> side<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.100> cable<00:02:25.510> should<00:02:26.510> go

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
that's other side of the cable should go

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.360 
that's other side of the cable should go
to<00:02:26.840> your<00:02:27.020> guitar<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.790> then<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.690> output

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370

to your guitar and then on the output
put<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.460> another<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.230> then<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:34.580> part<00:02:34.960> let's

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
put in another and then this part let's

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.480 
put in another and then this part let's
go<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.110> your<00:02:36.230> amp<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.240> power<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:39.490> pretty

there<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:44.840> go<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.550> plug<00:02:46.760> in<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.510> end<00:02:47.810> to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
there you go and you plug in this end to

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.120 
there you go and you plug in this end to
the<00:02:48.320> wall<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:49.880> push<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.209> on<00:02:50.860> flat<00:02:51.860> I'll<00:02:51.980> turn

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
the wall you push it on flat I'll turn

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.400 
the wall you push it on flat I'll turn
on<00:02:52.250> it's<00:02:52.400> not<00:02:52.550> plugged<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:52.880> right<00:02:53.000> now<00:02:53.410> but

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
on it's not plugged in right now but

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.320 
on it's not plugged in right now but
that's<00:02:54.530> how<00:02:54.739> it<00:02:54.830> works<00:02:55.010> all<00:02:55.940> right<00:02:56.000> if<00:02:56.239> you

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
that's how it works all right if you

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.140 
that's how it works all right if you
decide<00:02:56.630> not<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.930> use<00:02:57.370> one<00:02:58.370> spot<00:02:58.700> or<00:02:58.850> something

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
decide not to use one spot or something

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.010 
decide not to use one spot or something
similar<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.750> get<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.770> battery<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:02.810> push

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
similar to get to the battery you push

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:13.750 
similar to get to the battery you push
down<00:03:03.050> in<00:03:04.010> pedal<00:03:04.450> you<00:03:05.450> untwist<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:12.670> get<00:03:13.670> it

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
down in pedal you untwist this get it

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.320 
down in pedal you untwist this get it
away<00:03:13.970> down<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:15.110> then<00:03:15.230> it'll<00:03:15.410> open<00:03:15.530> up<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.970> as

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
away down and then it'll open up and as

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.900 
away down and then it'll open up and as
you<00:03:17.540> can<00:03:17.570> see<00:03:17.690> in<00:03:17.989> there<00:03:18.340> there's<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.430> spring

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
you can see in there there's a spring

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.960 
you can see in there there's a spring
that<00:03:20.739> helps<00:03:21.739> this<00:03:21.860> spring<00:03:22.430> open<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:22.760> close

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
that helps this spring open and close

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.460 
that helps this spring open and close
and<00:03:23.780> then<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:24.200> is<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.530> actual<00:03:26.230> button<00:03:27.230> over

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
and then this is the actual button over

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.150 
and then this is the actual button over
here<00:03:28.810> that'll<00:03:29.810> turn<00:03:29.959> on<00:03:30.110> off<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.410> pedal<00:03:30.680> but

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
here that'll turn on off the pedal but

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.190 
here that'll turn on off the pedal but
here<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.519> the<00:03:31.790> battery<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.299> you<00:03:32.360> have<00:03:33.049> your

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
here is the battery and you have your

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.229 
here is the battery and you have your
standard<00:03:33.640> red<00:03:34.640> and<00:03:34.760> black<00:03:35.260> positive<00:03:36.260> negative

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
standard red and black positive negative

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.509 
standard red and black positive negative
inputs<00:03:38.380> so<00:03:39.380> if<00:03:39.500> you<00:03:39.590> do<00:03:39.680> decide<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:39.980> use<00:03:40.489> a
