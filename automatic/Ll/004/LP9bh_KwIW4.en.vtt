away<00:01:26.220> obviously<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:27.119> good<00:01:27.270> thing<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.509> Trevor

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
does a lot of damage to Dracula so the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.999 
does a lot of damage to Dracula so the
first<00:01:30.420> form<00:01:30.810> will<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.140> too<00:01:31.350> much<00:01:31.500> trouble<00:01:31.740> with

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
first form will be too much trouble with

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.520 
first form will be too much trouble with
only<00:01:32.160> Trevor<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:33.360> second<00:01:33.750> form<00:01:33.990> however<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
only Trevor the second form however is a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.859 
only Trevor the second form however is a
little<00:01:34.860> bit<00:01:34.950> more<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.250> pain<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:36.210> as<00:01:36.360> easy<00:01:36.570> as

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
little bit more of a pain not as easy as

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.840 
little bit more of a pain not as easy as
grant<00:01:37.409> because<00:01:38.100> he's<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.820> able

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
to move as quickly or jump as high and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.520 
to move as quickly or jump as high and
as<00:01:41.490> well<00:01:41.670> as<00:01:41.700> no<00:01:42.090> multi<00:01:42.600> projectiles<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.289> can

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
go in a range you're not going to have

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.270 
go in a range you're not going to have
as<00:01:45.600> easy<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.869> time<00:01:46.080> hitting<00:01:46.320> up<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> air<00:01:47.039> if

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
as easy a time hitting up in the air if

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.180 
as easy a time hitting up in the air if
I<00:01:47.850> had<00:01:48.000> kept<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.390> axe<00:01:48.690> item<00:01:49.320> before<00:01:49.710> entering

this<00:01:50.399> battle<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.850> obviously<00:01:51.300> could<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.539> used

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
this battle I obviously could have used

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.450 
this battle I obviously could have used
that<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.110> my<00:01:52.140> advantage<00:01:52.289> but<00:01:52.800> unfortunately<00:01:53.430> I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
that to my advantage but unfortunately I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.010 
that to my advantage but unfortunately I
picked<00:01:53.850> up<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> knife<00:01:54.270> right<00:01:54.600> before<00:01:54.899> this

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
picked up the knife right before this

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.109 
picked up the knife right before this
fight<00:01:55.289> but<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.220> permit<00:01:56.550> acts<00:01:56.789> along

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
fight but if you do permit acts along

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.300 
fight but if you do permit acts along
you<00:01:57.929> can<00:01:58.140> actually<00:01:58.320> do<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.679> lot<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:58.860> damage<00:01:59.160> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
you can actually do a lot of damage to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.310 
you can actually do a lot of damage to
it<00:01:59.550> waltz<00:01:59.789> in<00:01:59.910> the<00:02:00.000> air<00:02:00.149> using<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> hearts

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
it waltz in the air using up the hearts

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.690 
it waltz in the air using up the hearts
that<00:02:01.440> you<00:02:01.560> collect<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.039> throughout<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.429> stage

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
that you collect it throughout the stage

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.730 
that you collect it throughout the stage
but<00:02:03.330> even<00:02:03.600> without<00:02:03.690> that<00:02:03.929> it<00:02:04.289> just<00:02:04.440> takes<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
but even without that it just takes a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.680 
but even without that it just takes a
few<00:02:04.770> extra<00:02:05.280> seconds<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:06.210> wait<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:06.539> him<00:02:06.570> to

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
few extra seconds just wait for him to

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.060 
few extra seconds just wait for him to
come<00:02:06.869> down<00:02:06.929> and<00:02:07.289> go<00:02:07.410> under<00:02:07.830> when<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
come down and go under when the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.669 
come down and go under when the
opportunity<00:02:08.340> arises<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.450> deal<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:10.080> damage<00:02:10.440> to

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
opportunity arises a deal your damage to

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.680 
opportunity arises a deal your damage to
them<00:02:10.769> the<00:02:11.280> top<00:02:11.519> two<00:02:11.760> heads<00:02:12.000> are<00:02:12.150> obviously<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
them the top two heads are obviously the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.479 
them the top two heads are obviously the
hardest<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.170> hit<00:02:13.320> with<00:02:13.470> trevor<00:02:13.739> because<00:02:14.400> you

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
hardest to hit with trevor because you

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.890 
hardest to hit with trevor because you
have<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.760> time<00:02:14.970> your<00:02:15.180> jump<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.810> you

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
have the time your jump so that you

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.870 
have the time your jump so that you
reach<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.350> height<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.459> deliver<00:02:17.790> a

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
reach the height so you can deliver a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:35.650 
reach the height so you can deliver a
hit<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.329> either<00:02:18.360> side<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:18.959> those<00:02:19.200> heads
