not cute a little bit of my background
last<00:00:46.920> year<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.430> was<00:00:48.059> really<00:00:48.300> really<00:00:48.450> really

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
last year I was really really really

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.569 
last year I was really really really
inconsistent<00:00:49.289> with<00:00:49.590> laser<00:00:49.800> hair<00:00:50.070> removal<00:00:50.190> and

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
inconsistent with laser hair removal and

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.770 
inconsistent with laser hair removal and
that's<00:00:50.730> why<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.940> feel<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.390> didn't<00:00:51.600> work

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.299 
that's why I feel like it didn't work
but<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.289> main<00:00:52.500> thing<00:00:52.800> with<00:00:52.920> laser<00:00:53.160> hair

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
but the main thing with laser hair

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.970 
but the main thing with laser hair
removal<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.480> doesn't<00:00:54.870> work<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.199> light<00:00:55.680> hair

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980

to<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:29.490> rid<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.329> know<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.689> just

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
to get rid of and you know like just

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.780 
to get rid of and you know like just
quicker<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.920> because<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.490> fairer

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
quicker to go because it's like fairer

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.100 
quicker to go because it's like fairer
and<00:01:33.150> all<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.360> stuff<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.750> there's<00:01:33.930> something

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and all that stuff and there's something

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
and all that stuff and there's something
in<00:01:34.350> dark<00:01:34.619> hair<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:35.100> reacted<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.520> laser

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
in dark hair that just reacted the laser

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.580 
in dark hair that just reacted the laser
basically<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:36.810> dark<00:01:37.079> hair<00:01:37.140> laser

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
basically if you have dark hair laser

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.530 
basically if you have dark hair laser
hair<00:01:37.829> removal<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.299> work

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
hair removal is for you it will work

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.050 
hair removal is for you it will work
over<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> period<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.009> time<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.670> only<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:41.939> it

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
over a period of time you can only do it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.670 
over a period of time you can only do it
like<00:01:42.090> once<00:01:42.210> every<00:01:42.630> month<00:01:42.780> or<00:01:42.990> six<00:01:43.259> weeks<00:01:43.350> or

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
like once every month or six weeks or

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.990 
like once every month or six weeks or
something<00:01:43.829> like<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.399> was<00:01:44.549> honestly<00:01:44.939> kind

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
something like that I was honestly kind

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.100 
something like that I was honestly kind
of<00:01:45.299> feeling<00:01:45.479> results<00:01:45.810> from<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> laser

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
of feeling results from the laser

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.200 
of feeling results from the laser
because<00:01:46.350> not<00:01:46.530> all<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.740> hair<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.399> my<00:01:47.700> body<00:01:47.880> is

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
because not all the hair on my body is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.510 
because not all the hair on my body is
pure<00:01:49.020> pure<00:01:49.320> pure<00:01:49.590> blonde<00:01:49.890> there<00:01:50.130> are<00:01:50.280> some

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
pure pure pure blonde there are some

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.249 
pure pure pure blonde there are some
very<00:01:50.700> very<00:01:50.850> light<00:01:51.149> brown<00:01:51.450> hair<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.990> went

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
very very light brown hair so I went

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.289 
very very light brown hair so I went
over<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.530> electrolysis<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.610> when<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> say<00:01:54.090> that

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
over to electrolysis so when I say that

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.490 
over to electrolysis so when I say that
it<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> most<00:01:54.750> painful<00:01:55.020> thing<00:01:55.229> I've<00:01:55.470> ever

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
it is the most painful thing I've ever

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.980 
it is the most painful thing I've ever
endure<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.820> most<00:01:57.000> painful<00:01:57.570> thing<00:01:57.780> I

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
endure it is the most painful thing I

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.080 
endure it is the most painful thing I
have<00:01:58.140> ever<00:01:58.350> endure<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.430> rank<00:01:59.729> them<00:01:59.909> both

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
have ever endure just to rank them both

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.060 
have ever endure just to rank them both
out<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.360> 10<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.840> think<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.320> laser<00:02:01.770> hair

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
out of 10 I think that laser hair

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.209 
out of 10 I think that laser hair
removal<00:02:02.219> would<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.299> like<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.530> 5<00:02:04.799> out<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.009> 10

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
removal would be like a 5 out of 10

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.859 
removal would be like a 5 out of 10
because<00:02:05.460> all<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:05.969> feel<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.659> feel<00:02:06.840> a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
because all you really feel you feel a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.419 
because all you really feel you feel a
little<00:02:07.200> bit<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.380> heat<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.890> feel<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.190> maybe

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
little bit of heat you feel it maybe

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.359 
little bit of heat you feel it maybe
like<00:02:08.700> they<00:02:09.179> explain<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.629> as<00:02:09.750> like<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
like they explain it as like a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.949 
like they explain it as like a
elastic<00:02:10.819> band<00:02:11.000> being<00:02:11.209> pulled<00:02:11.480> back<00:02:11.659> and

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
elastic band being pulled back and

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.630 
elastic band being pulled back and
snapped<00:02:12.200> on<00:02:12.349> your<00:02:12.500> skin<00:02:12.739> I<00:02:12.890> don't<00:02:13.280> really<00:02:13.400> feel

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
snapped on your skin I don't really feel

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.339 
snapped on your skin I don't really feel
the<00:02:13.819> pinch<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.180> much<00:02:14.390> probably<00:02:15.019> cuz<00:02:15.110> my<00:02:15.230> hair

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
the pinch that much probably cuz my hair

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.479 
the pinch that much probably cuz my hair
is<00:02:15.440> blonde<00:02:15.680> he<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.040> kind<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.250> feels<00:02:16.430> like

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
is blonde he that kind of feels like

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.009 
is blonde he that kind of feels like
it's<00:02:16.610> like<00:02:16.760> burning<00:02:17.120> your<00:02:17.239> skin<00:02:17.360> but<00:02:17.720> you

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
it's like burning your skin but you

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.809 
it's like burning your skin but you
could<00:02:18.200> get<00:02:18.290> into<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.680> maybe<00:02:19.129> even<00:02:19.430> like<00:02:19.519> a<00:02:19.549> 4

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
could get into it maybe even like a 4

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:20.350 
could get into it maybe even like a 4
out<00:02:19.909> of<00:02:20.000> 10

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
out of 10

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.360 
out of 10
electrolysis<00:02:21.019> is<00:02:21.319> literally<00:02:21.620> like<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.860> 10<00:02:22.099> or

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
electrolysis is literally like a 10 or

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.059 
electrolysis is literally like a 10 or
11<00:02:22.760> it's<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.360> fucked<00:02:23.930> up<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.349> always<00:02:24.680> say<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.890> my

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
11 it's so fucked up I always say to my

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.440 
11 it's so fucked up I always say to my
girl<00:02:25.310> when<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.489> go<00:02:25.640> there<00:02:25.819> I'm<00:02:25.879> like<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.239> is

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
girl when I go there I'm like this is

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.630 
girl when I go there I'm like this is
like<00:02:26.629> Chinese<00:02:27.140> torture<00:02:27.470> like<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:28.430> could

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
like Chinese torture like this could

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.339 
like Chinese torture like this could
drive<00:02:28.819> someone<00:02:28.879> and<00:02:29.329> say<00:02:29.510> like<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.019> like<00:02:30.200> I

drive someone and say like and like I
used<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.799> book<00:02:30.980> like<00:02:31.159> three<00:02:31.430> hour

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
used to book like three hour

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.220 
used to book like three hour
appointments<00:02:32.120> with<00:02:32.239> it<00:02:32.390> but<00:02:32.540> now<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.900> can

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
appointments with it but now I can

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.780 
appointments with it but now I can
actually<00:02:33.470> only<00:02:33.799> handle<00:02:34.190> an<00:02:34.280> hour<00:02:34.400> like<00:02:34.640> my

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
actually only handle an hour like my

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.539 
actually only handle an hour like my
threshold<00:02:35.269> for<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.409> pain<00:02:36.620> is<00:02:36.799> only<00:02:37.099> one<00:02:37.370> hour

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
threshold for the pain is only one hour

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.670 
threshold for the pain is only one hour
how<00:02:37.819> electrolysis<00:02:38.540> works<00:02:38.959> is<00:02:39.260> first<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.620> all

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
how electrolysis works is first of all

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.750 
how electrolysis works is first of all
you're<00:02:39.860> like<00:02:39.980> laying<00:02:40.220> down<00:02:40.489> obviously

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
you're like laying down obviously

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.240 
you're like laying down obviously
there's<00:02:41.599> no<00:02:41.780> cream<00:02:42.110> or<00:02:42.260> anything<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.859> know<00:02:42.920> I'm

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
there's no cream or anything I know I'm

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.890 
there's no cream or anything I know I'm
when<00:02:43.459> I<00:02:43.489> got<00:02:43.700> when<00:02:43.879> I<00:02:43.910> got<00:02:44.090> lasered<00:02:44.299> they<00:02:44.720> put

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
when I got when I got lasered they put

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.780 
when I got when I got lasered they put
like<00:02:45.049> a<00:02:45.079> blue<00:02:45.319> gel<00:02:45.590> on<00:02:45.799> me<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.549> was<00:02:46.640> like

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
like a blue gel on me and it was like

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.550 
like a blue gel on me and it was like
kind<00:02:46.819> of<00:02:47.060> cold<00:02:47.299> whatever<00:02:47.450> but<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:47.900> still<00:02:48.230> felt

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
kind of cold whatever but I still felt

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.050 
kind of cold whatever but I still felt
all<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:48.890> pain<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.280> laser<00:02:49.459> even<00:02:49.879> though<00:02:49.970> it

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
all the pain of the laser even though it

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.190 
all the pain of the laser even though it
wasn't<00:02:50.239> even<00:02:50.299> that<00:02:50.480> painful<00:02:50.720> compared<00:02:51.140> to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
wasn't even that painful compared to

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.110 
wasn't even that painful compared to
this<00:02:51.319> you<00:02:51.859> hold<00:02:52.069> like<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.280> little<00:02:52.549> probe<00:02:52.790> in<00:02:53.000> one

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
this you hold like a little probe in one

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.119 
this you hold like a little probe in one
of<00:02:53.209> your<00:02:53.329> hands<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:53.780> connects<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:54.799> like

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
of your hands and it connects to like

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.160 
of your hands and it connects to like
the<00:02:55.670> device<00:02:56.269> that<00:02:56.510> she's<00:02:56.690> using<00:02:56.900> because

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
the device that she's using because

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.050 
the device that she's using because
basically<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:57.829> attracts<00:02:58.159> moisture<00:02:58.370> I<00:02:58.909> don't

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
basically it attracts moisture I don't

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.280 
basically it attracts moisture I don't
even<00:02:59.120> know<00:02:59.359> but<00:02:59.540> you're<00:02:59.629> holding<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.900> probe<00:03:00.109> so

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
even know but you're holding a probe so

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.750 
even know but you're holding a probe so
it's<00:03:00.409> like<00:03:00.530> very<00:03:00.769> very<00:03:00.829> very<00:03:01.129> intense<00:03:01.400> feels

removal but I swear when I did it I
bought<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.599> package<00:03:54.139> but<00:03:54.319> I<00:03:54.410> was<00:03:54.530> like<00:03:54.620> really

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
bought a package but I was like really

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.229 
bought a package but I was like really
done<00:03:55.099> with<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:55.400> because<00:03:55.519> I<00:03:55.669> was<00:03:55.760> moving<00:03:56.060> at<00:03:56.150> the

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
done with it because I was moving at the

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.819 
done with it because I was moving at the
time<00:03:56.449> so<00:03:56.629> I<00:03:56.660> didn't<00:03:56.930> do<00:03:57.049> my<00:03:57.230> fault<00:03:57.500> like<00:03:57.680> I<00:03:57.769> just

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
time so I didn't do my fault like I just

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.050 
time so I didn't do my fault like I just
paid<00:03:58.129> too<00:03:58.250> much<00:03:58.280> okay<00:03:58.669> I<00:03:58.699> think<00:03:58.790> it<00:03:58.970> was

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
paid too much okay I think it was

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.449 
paid too much okay I think it was
something<00:03:59.359> like<00:03:59.449> $1,000<00:04:00.379> for<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.829> whole<00:04:01.040> year

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
something like $1,000 for the whole year

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.099 
something like $1,000 for the whole year
so<00:04:01.819> like<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.120> could<00:04:02.239> go<00:04:02.359> as<00:04:02.510> much<00:04:02.660> as<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:02.900> want

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
so like you could go as much as you want

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.479 
so like you could go as much as you want
but<00:04:03.260> they<00:04:03.379> only<00:04:03.500> let<00:04:03.709> you<00:04:03.739> go<00:04:03.919> every<00:04:04.160> like<00:04:04.310> four

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
but they only let you go every like four

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.369 
but they only let you go every like four
to<00:04:04.579> six<00:04:04.790> weeks<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.299> I<00:04:05.569> guess<00:04:06.139> that's<00:04:06.260> like

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
to six weeks so I guess that's like

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.650 
to six weeks so I guess that's like
twelve<00:04:06.769> or<00:04:07.099> like<00:04:07.340> eleven<00:04:07.699> electrolysis<00:04:08.389> is<00:04:08.629> a

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
twelve or like eleven electrolysis is a

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.569 
twelve or like eleven electrolysis is a
lot<00:04:08.900> cheaper<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.709> they<00:04:09.829> don't<00:04:10.040> really<00:04:10.190> go<00:04:10.400> by

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
lot cheaper and they don't really go by

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.520 
lot cheaper and they don't really go by
areas<00:04:11.090> on<00:04:11.329> your<00:04:11.359> body<00:04:11.599> they<00:04:12.079> kind<00:04:12.319> of<00:04:12.379> just

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
areas on your body they kind of just

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.550 
areas on your body they kind of just
judge<00:04:13.160> it<00:04:13.310> by<00:04:13.430> hours<00:04:13.910> where<00:04:14.299> I<00:04:14.329> go<00:04:14.540> now<00:04:14.720> is<00:04:14.900> $50

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
judge it by hours where I go now is $50

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.740 
judge it by hours where I go now is $50
per<00:04:15.590> hour<00:04:15.919> 56<00:04:16.699> dollars<00:04:16.940> which<00:04:17.389> is<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.539> great

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
per hour 56 dollars which is a great

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.270 
per hour 56 dollars which is a great
price<00:04:17.959> I<00:04:18.109> mean<00:04:18.229> that's<00:04:18.409> so<00:04:18.590> cheap<00:04:18.799> but<00:04:18.919> it<00:04:19.039> adds

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
price I mean that's so cheap but it adds

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.279 
price I mean that's so cheap but it adds
up<00:04:19.549> over<00:04:19.820> time<00:04:20.180> because<00:04:20.479> electrolysis<00:04:20.989> takes

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
up over time because electrolysis takes

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:22.810 
up over time because electrolysis takes
a<00:04:21.440> lot<00:04:21.590> longer<00:04:21.739> it's<00:04:22.219> not<00:04:22.460> like<00:04:22.580> she's<00:04:22.729> gonna

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
a lot longer it's not like she's gonna

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.900 
a lot longer it's not like she's gonna
be<00:04:22.909> able<00:04:23.060> to<00:04:23.150> do<00:04:23.270> your<00:04:23.390> whole<00:04:23.599> face

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
be able to do your whole face

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.310 
be able to do your whole face
in<00:04:24.030> an<00:04:24.150> hour<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.510> into<00:04:24.600> how<00:04:24.810> much<00:04:24.930> pain<00:04:25.200> you

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
in an hour and into how much pain you

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.810 
in an hour and into how much pain you
can<00:04:25.470> take<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.770> all<00:04:25.860> that<00:04:26.070> I<00:04:26.280> definitely

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
can take and all that I definitely

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.070 
can take and all that I definitely
recommend<00:04:27.060> getting<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:27.480> topical<00:04:27.900> anesthetic

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
recommend getting a topical anesthetic

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.820 
recommend getting a topical anesthetic
