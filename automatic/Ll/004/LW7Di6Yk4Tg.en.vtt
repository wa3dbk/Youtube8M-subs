00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello to everything in this tutorial 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.589
 today we will learn how to achieve 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.090
 a very realistic negative I you 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.769
 invite to go on the world chain 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.380
 fim who also realized her 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.880
 tutorial for a realistic get i 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.350
 been very inspired by one of 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.000
 his photos to get into 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.930
 ventured the 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.330
 our two techniques are very 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.070
 complementary since according to 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.230
 the use you need you 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.930
 will be able to use one or the other 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.939
 mine, for example, allows you to create 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.830
 nougatine shapes that can pass 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.230
 in the oven and therefore be included in your 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.840
 finished creations we will first start 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.730
 by the colorization and so find the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.730
 color of our nougatine I have 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.539
 chose to use so watercolor ink 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.219
 that use the four colors that 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.280
 you see there so it's the yellow the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.050
 blue the magenta and the brown but you 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.030
 can according to your tastes of course 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.670
 use only yellow and red 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.340
 example I'm going to create a strand to his 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.190
 orange trees to give the appearance so 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.780
 caramelized of the night and it's like 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.530
 you do not see too many blues otherwise 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.530
 done to girls 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.790
 let's move on to the ingredient 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.620
 essential 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.910
 here is silicone I invite you to 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.460
 take clear silicone 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.690
 attention transparent and not translucent 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.640
 or white very transparent it does not 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.690
 remains more than to include it in our 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.690
 ink and mix everything 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.430
 it gives us some sort of dough and get 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.159
 in caramel pasta a year will take from 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.600
 the fimo you can learn it raw but 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.550
 the best is to take the firm 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.140
 which has already been cooked and just the 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.369
 cut into very small pieces as if 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.490
 it was small pieces of almonds 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.490
 slivered 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.250
 now that we cut all our 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.900
 film in very small pieces as if 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.640
 it was crushed hazelnuts or 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.619
 before we crush we will come 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.340
 mix it all with the dough we have 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.340
 just now 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.370
 to you now in doses and if you 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.090
 want a lot or a little bit 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.980
 fines in your mix now is going 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.250
 come and spread out this paste that we got 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.840
 on cooking film attention 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.280
 some cooking films are not going 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.840
 worked because they are coated with a 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.060
 silicone shape so you will not be able 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.520
 not to unmould then just need to 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.170
 fold the film and flatten with 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.060
 a roll to make a thickness 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.980
 homogeneous everywhere to you of course 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.420
 now to choose the thickness if 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.970
 you want to do something very 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.070
 fine or a little thicker though 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.540
 you see that it does not come off 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.120
 as you want to demold 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.890
 you have to use either cooking film 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.180
 either state them with a spatula on a 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.540
 plastic stand personally 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.710
 this is my favorite technique so is a 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.510
 when all that is dry 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.790
 of course following the recommendations 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.010
 on the silicone tube do you have left 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.020
 more than to unwind and to serve you 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.070
 your plate of fresh nougatine 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.070
 as you see fit 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.760
 by the way if you want an example of 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.740
 creation that can be achieved with 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.670
 this negative I invite you to click 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.980
 on the tutorial 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.170
 we will be able to see how 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.150
 to achieve a course that is greedy 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.160
 chips of nougatine 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:52.800
 go ahead click on the bottom left 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.870
 but yes if you can that's it I hope that 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.040
