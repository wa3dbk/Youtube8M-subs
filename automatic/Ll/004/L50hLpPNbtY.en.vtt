00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.390
 working on the animations of the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.270
 people who walk the streets in the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.299
 game is valid during July and August 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.920
 2009 while the second one would have 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.780
 worked on new tools and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.899
 Character and interactive features 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.340
 for my rose age 2 highlighting the 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.009
 classifications of the game and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.780

 that the developers to give us 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.929
 surprises in the form of names and shapes 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.700

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.100
