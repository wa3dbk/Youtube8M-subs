00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.880
 hello howard company personnel 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.320
 personal record that accompanies the 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.750
 record videos by news 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.720
 automotive my colleagues on the channel 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.470
 mechanical production on youtube only 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.480
 For a long time I've been asking for a 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.890
 video talking about the new world 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.960
 for those who do not know their property in the 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.660
 11.01 equipped with the new engine in the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:47.180
 capital of the river fae that actually 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.210
 retro fire in my personal opinion at 1 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.160
 It took me a while to put this video on because 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.739
 in these months I'm with the car 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.010
 was a constant struggle for 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.770
 remedy the defects that 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.980
 They came in my car 0 km 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.950
 before even removing the car from the net 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:11.090
 I already authorized problems with 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.970
 scratches on the bumpers is a problem and 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.220
 pierre miro painting for shock is not 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.590
 A lot of anger that I spent with this car 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.340
 in the concessionaire sign of beautiful 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.319
 horizon 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.300
 Well, I 'm not in favor of it. 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.979
 use of fuel alcohol without the use of 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.630
 gasoline 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.039
 unfortunately I have to swallow the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.390
 fuel alcohol is like a flex car 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.409
 thank you to rent flex which gave rise to 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.960
 exclusively water 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:44.179
 lina but it has no powder I had that problem 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.130
 at the time now in the year of lack of something 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.200
 normal cable 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.780
 here you will get the madonna is the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.450
 the ignition of the engine that is 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.590
 harmful world, right? 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.890
 so come back to us 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.810
 concessionaires than people who were 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.090
 feature is vehicle original 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.079
 managed to be part of the project is 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.060
 that's the way it is 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.740
 only that fitch goes against it 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.299
 speaking this because I have material of 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.670
 training so that I am a 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.950
 symbol and kit where he talks about the dangers 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.060
 prohibition of installation fell on the 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.849
 motor 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.010
 in fact the cril is to count a dozen 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.970
 an explosion taking the combustion chamber 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.220
 always at the right time will defend 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.670
 a beautiful definition of a high 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.870
 definition and and motor sufferrosa 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.940
 literally 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.799
 so these cars today no charge 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.500
 compression ratio weighted that the 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.900
 brand almus girl and these acts of 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.910
 ignition that is advanced 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.209
 the motor of the championship so that you 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.030
 fuel a car has gasoline has 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.010
 revealed as a consultant come talk 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.099

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.510
 listen here looking guy I do not accept as 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.150
 a hair stylist 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.530
 You're going to have to solve this car. 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.020
 spent almost 30 days to solve the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.230
 problem 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.490
 change the printhead so you 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.790
 who owns a fiat fire 1.4 10 and does not 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.890

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.800
 this video with you and if that is not the case 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.140
 I accept the engine detonating in gasoline my 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.870
 did not shine anymore they changed the head 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.310
 at least that's what they told me 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.580
 I do not know if they did a job in the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.460
 head to decrease or increase in size 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.340
 of the combustion chamber may reduce the 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.220
 The rate is that I do not know what to do anymore. 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.160
 Talking milan along this problem 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.070

 KaKa the car houses a trash beauty already 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.800
 I took three times to the concessionaire and 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.360
 nothing to solve 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.660
 I can not move that the case of 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.730

 is an improvement of the 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.349
 engine management but it does not 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:40.340
 fashion neither by e-mail 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:43.520

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:09.139
 bacula themselves to be able to do the 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:12.289
 lying elections and fruits are and 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:15.219
 put on the market of products that come 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:17.930
 many defects several hidden vices 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:21.530
 problems to be solved in justice, which is the 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.569
 which I will do soon with regard to 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.479
 these defects existed because your car 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:28.520
 It was almost two months without cah 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.639
 to solve crap 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.720
 one does not solve anything the car continues 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.819
 with problems 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.490

 I soon decided to show the staff. 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.720
 so if you think about buying a car 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:46.970
 luxury in the world as mine I suggest 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.280
 You wait another time. 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:52.280
 wait for channels that have not yet 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:56.750
 managed to heal and think of another 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:58.669
 car suddenly because I've been as 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:02.060
 fitch director, I am no longer graceful and 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:04.699
 now that you are engaged in relation to 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.669
 to this brand and I do not want but never again 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:11.270
 buy a zero car to call on the 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:12.319
 that leaves the personal paula and each one does 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:16.479
 Whatever you think is best 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.479
 a big hug to the staff and even more
