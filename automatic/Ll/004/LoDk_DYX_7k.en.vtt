00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
use the Internet to do that as well

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.510 
use the Internet to do that as well
all<00:01:20.080> right<00:01:20.530> that's<00:01:20.770> a<00:01:21.399> lot<00:01:21.700> better<00:01:23.399> now<00:01:24.399> if

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
all right that's a lot better now if

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.980 
all right that's a lot better now if
you're<00:01:24.640> ever<00:01:24.790> in<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:25.000> situation<00:01:25.149> where<00:01:25.780> your

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
you're ever in a situation where your

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.200 
you're ever in a situation where your
Wi-Fi<00:01:26.440> signal<00:01:26.500> is<00:01:26.979> not<00:01:27.130> that<00:01:27.399> good<00:01:27.610> there's<00:01:28.149> a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
Wi-Fi signal is not that good there's a

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.240 
Wi-Fi signal is not that good there's a
simple<00:01:28.659> trick<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:29.080> can<00:01:29.200> use<00:01:29.409> to<00:01:29.619> boost<00:01:30.040> your

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
simple trick you can use to boost your

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.460 
simple trick you can use to boost your
Wi-Fi<00:01:30.490> signal<00:01:31.179> and<00:01:31.270> get<00:01:31.690> a<00:01:31.750> range<00:01:32.080> of<00:01:32.289> about

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
Wi-Fi signal and get a range of about

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.960 
Wi-Fi signal and get a range of about
three<00:01:32.770> miles<00:01:32.979> so<00:01:33.220> you<00:01:33.250> can<00:01:33.429> pretty<00:01:33.610> much<00:01:33.700> get

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
three miles so you can pretty much get

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.880 
three miles so you can pretty much get

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
tablet might not have an actual CBR

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.050 
tablet might not have an actual CBR
antenna<00:01:55.990> attachment<00:01:56.860> but<00:01:57.369> if<00:01:57.580> you<00:01:57.729> just<00:01:57.909> hold

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
antenna attachment but if you just hold

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.790 
antenna attachment but if you just hold
it<00:01:58.240> up<00:01:58.330> to<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.450> side<00:01:58.720> you<00:01:59.289> should<00:01:59.530> be<00:01:59.649> able<00:01:59.710> to

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
it up to the side you should be able to

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.859 
it up to the side you should be able to
boost<00:02:00.069> your<00:02:00.220> signal<00:02:00.429> just<00:02:01.060> like<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:01.659> and

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
boost your signal just like that and

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.630 
boost your signal just like that and
you'll<00:02:02.319> be<00:02:02.500> able<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.770> get<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:02.920> range<00:02:03.190> of<00:02:03.429> about

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
you'll be able to get a range of about

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.400 
you'll be able to get a range of about
three<00:02:04.119> miles<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:04.690> you<00:02:04.720> could<00:02:04.899> pretty<00:02:05.050> much<00:02:05.140> get

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
three miles so you could pretty much get

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.650 
three miles so you could pretty much get
internet<00:02:05.830> anywhere<00:02:06.190> you<00:02:06.340> want<00:02:06.550> now<00:02:07.360> in<00:02:07.539> a

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
internet anywhere you want now in a

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.540 
internet anywhere you want now in a
survival<00:02:08.050> situation<00:02:08.319> you<00:02:08.950> really<00:02:09.310> want<00:02:09.489> to

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
survival situation you really want to

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.670 
survival situation you really want to
maximize<00:02:09.970> your<00:02:10.330> battery<00:02:10.750> life<00:02:10.929> this<00:02:11.530> is

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
maximize your battery life this is

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.110 
maximize your battery life this is
pretty<00:02:11.890> decent<00:02:12.130> but<00:02:12.580> we're<00:02:12.730> gonna<00:02:12.819> want

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
pretty decent but we're gonna want

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.949 
pretty decent but we're gonna want
several<00:02:13.810> days<00:02:14.050> worth<00:02:14.349> extra<00:02:15.129> so<00:02:15.879> there's<00:02:16.870> an

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
several days worth extra so there's an

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.690 
several days worth extra so there's an
actual<00:02:17.260> trick<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.770> can<00:02:17.890> use<00:02:17.950> only<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.640> the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
actual trick you can use only in the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.070 
actual trick you can use only in the
survival<00:02:19.060> situation<00:02:19.660> because<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:19.930> will

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
survival situation because it will

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.610 
survival situation because it will
damage<00:02:20.410> your<00:02:20.800> charger<00:02:21.340> but<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:23.020> wild<00:02:23.230> if

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
damage your charger but in the wild if

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.510 
damage your charger but in the wild if
you<00:02:23.980> plug<00:02:24.459> your<00:02:24.819> actual<00:02:25.690> charger<00:02:26.319> cable<00:02:26.709> into

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
you plug your actual charger cable into

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.930 
you plug your actual charger cable into
a<00:02:27.550> tree<00:02:28.230> then<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.500> will<00:02:29.830> absorb<00:02:30.040> some<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.819> the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
a tree then it will absorb some of the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.600 
a tree then it will absorb some of the
Earth's<00:02:31.120> electromagnetic<00:02:31.739> energy<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.069> the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
Earth's electromagnetic energy and the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.970 
Earth's electromagnetic energy and the
energy<00:02:34.030> from<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.420> tree<00:02:34.660> itself<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.319> you<00:02:35.739> can

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
energy from the tree itself and you can

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.150 
energy from the tree itself and you can
actually<00:02:36.160> get<00:02:36.640> about<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.319> 15%<00:02:38.319> extra<00:02:38.560> battery

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
actually get about a 15% extra battery

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.250 
actually get about a 15% extra battery
life<00:02:39.340> over<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.730> course<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.810> tablet's

life over the course of the tablet's

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.100 
life over the course of the tablet's
life<00:02:41.560> now<00:02:42.220> again<00:02:42.849> I<00:02:43.060> would<00:02:43.360> never<00:02:43.629> do<00:02:43.930> this

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
life now again I would never do this

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.710 
life now again I would never do this
unless<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:44.980> had<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.550> because<00:02:45.970> this<00:02:46.390> could

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
unless you had to because this could

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.809 
unless you had to because this could
damage<00:02:46.959> your<00:02:47.260> charger<00:02:47.800> but<00:02:48.370> it's<00:02:48.580> good<00:02:48.790> to

getting a couple apps that you can use
such<00:03:01.870> as<00:03:02.050> drawing<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.980> that'll<00:03:03.310> be<00:03:03.430> pretty

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
such as drawing and that'll be pretty

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.250 
such as drawing and that'll be pretty
entertaining<00:03:03.819> or<00:03:04.629> you<00:03:04.780> can<00:03:04.900> also<00:03:05.019> use
