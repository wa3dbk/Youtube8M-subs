00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.999
 Dr. Alberto Martí showed under many years with children as colon 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.219
 pediatric until given the poor results obtained with the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.890
 conventional treatments 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.970
 especially 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.610
 seeing every day enormous suffering and with it caused them abandoned 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.350
 definitely figures 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.340
 today more than twenty years later and after forming widely indisciplines that 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.510
 they teach us the medical school 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.750
 address cancer in a holistic way 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.990
 taking into account first of all the Hippocratic principle of the first 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.250
 nozar that makes you pass a neighbor ternas that happens 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.660
 is it really costs senna hospital facility 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.219
 welcome everyone with a color with chemotherapy 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.620
 returning, finding himself fatal 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.420
 asking you habits that do not give him the chemotherapy that everyone decides 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.560
 they reject it outright because of how bad they are then do not do this to me ' 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.420
 Alberto, do not do this to me. ' 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.420
 then this is the album good wife ocher dozens of children 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.610
 with him the intention is that the child goes better we want to inherit him to heal 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.700
 its sunset hours exceeded the teaches 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.329
 to overcome a lymphoma 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.150
 to overcome a sarcoma 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.200
 and you realize that really suffering that you give them is huge 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.580
 so you asked yourself how we can throw this child who suffers less 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.700
 and what in has the maximum possible benefit treatment that we are doing 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.950
 and that's what led me to investigate to be the same that are pending 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.510
 what way could it reach and to the oncological patient 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.440
 for what 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.100
 in the proposed treatment 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.060
 The profound scientist is what Latin faculty presents to you, which is what 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.010
 be you type of tennis 20 years 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.010
 then he works without interfering with him 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.250
 and I really believe that the great response of the world highlighted the treatment that 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.810
 takes into account the psychological and emotional aspects in addition to 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.380
 physical 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.410
 areas since he visited music 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.960
 solve possible orthomolecular mineral vitamin deficiencies is enzymatic and 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.009
 hormonal 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.079
 boosting the immune system and balancing the organism bio 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.259
 energetically 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.569
 are always useful and necessary steps now is that human beings 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.979
 we face the area decades the other diseases with a real war 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.729
 that you have to fight against your external aggressors as responsible 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:31.759
 bacteria, fungi, viruses, private parasites that you have to fight against and 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:34.759
 I see that I can not do anything, I think it's going to be his own organism 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:40.059
 of certain segments has hurt us the medicine based on the elimination of 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.309
 moral fleet 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:44.819
 but not in the restoration of the metabolic pathways that are the ones that have been 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.819
 damaged and that are what have led to the development of the tumor 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.980
 then what it is about is understanding that you can change 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.900
 the grounds and you can reverse percent and it shows the commotion of the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.689
 Barcelona 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:02.139
 dv provoke what we will technically call peace short pettinato it 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.549
 tells us what he said, what you have to do is cut off your head as if 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.129
 it may be surgery 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.109
 in case of not being able to cut the head of the surgical force 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.949
 tributary treatment 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.369
 Well, you can consider 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.849
 radiation therapy at a fire burning of a tumor a cicada 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:23.889
 the other option would be chemotherapy poisoning training will be 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:24.599
 taken 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.189
 and if the chemotherapy fails the surgery eagerness of the network of tata españa 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:29.629
 they must supply 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.109
 then we are the goal 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.519
 maybe we think about the idea that if we analyze the context 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.969
 dt uptake or will see the isolation 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:41.309
 I was saying 12 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.809
 we also have advanced we can to the fourth step and even then neither does 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.519
 I need to say nothing and ask that the fans and 12 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.519
 that was done in heaven because when you have a difficult team to beat 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.989
 because the system was to corral the enemy 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.209
 remove from food the food without water without food 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.929
 Asia is waiting and where that vision of lack of health has taken us 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.609
 to not know how to cure practically any of the so-called diseases 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.539
 maybe because there really are no piniella enemies to fight 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.309
 on the other hand, even if it were so if they gave up the tactic of 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.280
 assaulting our own path with the absurd argument that so 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.729
 we help is simply stupid 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.639
 Among those who think so is Dr. Alberto Martin who voice after 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.169
 share as we said for some time the dominant philosophy of the 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.819
 medical class monde to the conclusion that the best that can be done before 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.749
 any pathological process 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:39.229
 is to help the organism to face the problem by boosting its 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.370
 immune system 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.500
 and lead to a state of ideal balance and harmony through a 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.939
 deep detoxification and proper nutrition 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:48.770
 in mind that the vegetarian diet 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.870
 help us 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.870
 to clean the filters help interpol coin china 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.629
 file ap attachments together this system the plants fish plants that give them 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:02.580
 for good thyme west board there are plants that militate in the liver 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.939
 oscar federal cacho that intervened in the world the devil 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.800
 there are plants that management measures the green tea the horsetail the canary 

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:14.339
 Then I can take a good counselor ankle 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.779
 the cdc 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:20.669
 efe on a palace floor when that what those getaria treatments what 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:21.339
 also 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:22.849
 take those plants 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.849
 we are promoting the cleaning of the filters 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.860
 then we have what will help us to eliminate two per day the renal duck 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.749
 and pulmonary 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:34.630
 and we are not seeing that the expenses percutaneously 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.750
 through the osmosis baths there we have california 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.110
 we can improve the performance of liver and kidney lung strength we know that the 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.560
 vitamin d for example 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.599
 esthetic 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.139
 the more vitamin measures immediately Pauline becomes very 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.419
 yellow because it is explained by porriño see that it activates the renal function how much 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.389
 more vitamin b finance vitamin b12 protective factor to improve the 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.169
 lecturer alignment of the athletic with this data 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:00.430
 vitamin d 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.990
 also has more features in saltillo critical to anemic 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.630
 in that subject it improves the conduction in the department of the heart therefore 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.679
 when through terminals you are improving things elements 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.520
 are those that make the immune system of the oncological patient 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.439
 it is very sight very depressed 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:20.669
 cook in an acid medium the immune system or three morondo work 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.620
 back to the same 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.830
 note that the ph of the blood morgan under normal conditions of seven with four 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.360
 Sincerely to Cali 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.090
 therefore we return that quality immune system back to 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.159
 work even if you do not give up 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.680
 when now we really need to fight tumors that grow and put in 

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:41.179
 danger life for example by preventing at a given moment the correct 

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:45.330
 organ functioning but with smarter tactics and less 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.409
 aggressive a brilliant paper that nobody should miss 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:52.649
 let's talk
