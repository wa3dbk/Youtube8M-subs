00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
far it'll slip all the way over so I

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.310 
far it'll slip all the way over so I
brought<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.270> right<00:02:35.420> up<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.750> edge<00:02:36.020> I'm

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
brought it right up to the edge I'm

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.520 
brought it right up to the edge I'm
hoping<00:02:36.590> as<00:02:36.739> it<00:02:36.890> melts<00:02:37.190> down<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.610> will<00:02:38.140> melt<00:02:39.140> out

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
hoping as it melts down it will melt out

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.160 
hoping as it melts down it will melt out
and<00:02:40.130> kind<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.340> keep<00:02:40.520> an<00:02:40.670> eye<00:02:40.790> on<00:02:40.820> that<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.540> didn't

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
and kind of keep an eye on that I didn't

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.240 
and kind of keep an eye on that I didn't
want<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.350> put<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:42.530> right<00:02:42.620> over<00:02:42.680> my<00:02:42.980> glider

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
want to put it right over my glider

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.340 
want to put it right over my glider
because<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.700> don't<00:02:43.850> want<00:02:44.000> salty<00:02:44.450> rush<00:02:45.020> of<00:02:45.170> water

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
because I don't want salty rush of water

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.710 
because I don't want salty rush of water
and<00:02:45.680> dripping<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.040> my<00:02:46.190> glider<00:02:46.720> mid-quarter

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
and dripping on my glider mid-quarter

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.630 
and dripping on my glider mid-quarter
makes<00:02:48.410> like<00:02:48.620> another<00:02:48.860> one<00:02:49.040> down<00:02:49.220> on<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.489> other

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
makes like another one down on the other

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.600 
makes like another one down on the other
end<00:02:49.910> there<00:02:50.120> with<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.110> other<00:02:51.350> leg<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:54.549> wasn't<00:02:55.549> as

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
end there with the other leg I wasn't as

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.920 
end there with the other leg I wasn't as
hard<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.880> throw<00:02:56.060> up<00:02:56.209> there<00:02:56.420> at<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.630> thought<00:02:56.810> it

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
hard to throw up there at the thought it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.620 
hard to throw up there at the thought it
might<00:02:57.110> be<00:02:57.310> how<00:02:58.310> much<00:02:58.519> -<00:02:58.790> just<00:02:59.180> kind<00:02:59.360> of<00:02:59.390> close

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
might be how much - just kind of close

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.570 
might be how much - just kind of close
though<00:03:00.019> unless<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.650> can<00:03:00.830> see<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.130> but<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.400> can

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
though unless you can see it but I can

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:38.340 
though unless you can see it but I can
feel<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:02.049> okay<00:03:03.080> No

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:46.360 

pull<00:03:39.350> it<00:03:39.440> over<00:03:39.560> too<00:03:39.830> much<00:03:44.620> wow<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:45.800> is<00:03:45.830> solid

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
pull it over too much wow it is solid

00:03:46.370 --> 00:04:05.620 
pull it over too much wow it is solid
ice<00:03:46.520> up<00:03:46.760> there<00:03:46.790> is<00:04:03.790> needs<00:04:04.790> to<00:04:04.910> be<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.450> edge

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
ice up there is needs to be to the edge

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.290 
ice up there is needs to be to the edge
this<00:04:05.960> one<00:04:06.140> just<00:04:06.320> barely<00:04:06.500> is<00:04:06.950> what<00:04:07.880> I<00:04:07.910> might<00:04:08.120> do

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
this one just barely is what I might do

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.330 
this one just barely is what I might do
if<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.570> leaks<00:04:08.900> if<00:04:09.170> it<00:04:09.380> melts<00:04:09.680> down<00:04:09.740> let's<00:04:10.220> try

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
if it leaks if it melts down let's try

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.700 
if it leaks if it melts down let's try
to<00:04:10.400> pull<00:04:10.610> it<00:04:10.700> out<00:04:10.820> a<00:04:10.850> little<00:04:10.940> bit<00:04:11.090> more<00:04:11.710> without

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
to pull it out a little bit more without

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.650 
to pull it out a little bit more without
having<00:04:13.010> it<00:04:13.100> fall<00:04:13.310> down<00:04:14.950> do<00:04:15.950> that<00:04:16.630> awesome<00:04:17.630> I

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
having it fall down do that awesome I

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.390 
having it fall down do that awesome I
had<00:04:17.870> it<00:04:18.049> stuck<00:04:18.650> back<00:04:18.830> here<00:04:18.890> in<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.250> hood

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
had it stuck back here in the hood

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.880 
had it stuck back here in the hood
somewhere
