basically<00:00:38.470> what<00:00:38.710> we<00:00:38.800> did<00:00:38.920> today<00:00:39.100> we<00:00:39.760> did<00:00:39.940> a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
basically what we did today we did a

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.410 
basically what we did today we did a
rear<00:00:40.870> ace<00:00:41.020> we<00:00:41.260> did<00:00:41.379> the<00:00:41.440> iron<00:00:41.590> marathon<00:00:42.420> we

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
rear ace we did the iron marathon we

attempted iron marathon we both did

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.020 
attempted iron marathon we both did
we<00:00:47.140> superset<00:00:47.649> at<00:00:47.739> the<00:00:47.829> movements<00:00:48.250> so<00:00:48.850> it's<00:00:49.000> a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
we superset at the movements so it's a

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.790 
we superset at the movements so it's a
lot<00:00:49.210> harder<00:00:49.420> than<00:00:49.540> a<00:00:49.780> typical<00:00:49.989> iron<00:00:50.320> marathon

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800

155 and a strict overhead press at 65
pounds<00:01:00.309> um<00:01:00.989> when<00:01:01.989> they<00:01:02.079> got<00:01:02.230> super<00:01:02.890> difficult

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
pounds um when they got super difficult

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.400 
pounds um when they got super difficult
she<00:01:03.489> switched<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:03.910> push<00:01:04.149> press<00:01:04.420> which<00:01:05.379> is

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
she switched to a push press which is

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.529 
she switched to a push press which is
fine<00:01:06.270> she<00:01:07.270> got<00:01:07.450> one<00:01:07.840> to<00:01:08.280> 14<00:01:09.280> or<00:01:09.310> 15<00:01:09.820> which<00:01:10.509> is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
beyond be small is very difficult so

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.969 
beyond be small is very difficult so
basically<00:01:13.360> starting<00:01:14.170> out<00:01:14.290> with<00:01:14.440> one<00:01:14.500> squat

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
basically starting out with one squat

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.969 
basically starting out with one squat
and<00:01:15.250> then<00:01:15.940> you<00:01:16.060> superset<00:01:16.510> it<00:01:16.630> with<00:01:16.750> one

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and then you superset it with one

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.640

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
overhead press two squats two overhead

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.609 
overhead press two squats two overhead
press<00:01:20.920> three<00:01:21.610> three<00:01:22.119> and<00:01:22.270> so<00:01:22.960> on<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.260> so<00:01:23.350> forth

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
press three three and so on and so forth

you will get muscle endurance you will

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.710 
you will get muscle endurance you will
increase<00:01:39.220> your<00:01:39.430> endurance<00:01:39.700> you're<00:01:40.420> getting<00:01:40.689> a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
increase your endurance you're getting a

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.390 
increase your endurance you're getting a
lot<00:01:40.900> of<00:01:40.930> cardio<00:01:41.290> training<00:01:41.680> like<00:01:41.890> this<00:01:42.040> because

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
lot of cardio training like this because

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.340 
lot of cardio training like this because
you're<00:01:43.000> elevating<00:01:43.509> your<00:01:43.600> heartrate<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:44.049> they

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
you're elevating your heartrate and they

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.960 
you're elevating your heartrate and they
stand<00:01:44.680> up<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.009> entire<00:01:45.250> time<00:01:45.490> because<00:01:45.850> you're

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
stand up the entire time because you're

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.420 
stand up the entire time because you're
not<00:01:46.150> breaking<00:01:46.360> you're<00:01:47.229> going<00:01:47.500> back<00:01:47.860> and<00:01:47.890> forth

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
not breaking you're going back and forth

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.609 
not breaking you're going back and forth
increasing<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.360> rep<00:01:49.600> so<00:01:50.020> basically<00:01:50.439> you're

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
increasing a rep so basically you're

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.149 
increasing a rep so basically you're
making<00:01:50.950> your<00:01:51.070> exercise<00:01:51.939> more<00:01:52.720> difficult

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
making your exercise more difficult

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.950 
making your exercise more difficult
every<00:01:54.159> rep<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:55.270> keep<00:01:55.479> going<00:01:55.689> there's

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
every rep and you keep going there's

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.920 
every rep and you keep going there's
really<00:01:56.110> no<00:01:56.320> breaks<00:01:56.650> so<00:01:57.400> it's<00:01:58.150> a<00:01:58.299> huge<00:01:58.570> mental

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
really no breaks so it's a huge mental

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.480 
really no breaks so it's a huge mental
unto<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.320> undertaking<00:01:59.979> more<00:02:00.130> than<00:02:00.280> anything

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
unto the undertaking more than anything

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.450 
unto the undertaking more than anything
the<00:02:01.270> physical<00:02:01.810> kicks<00:02:02.049> in<00:02:02.350> but<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:02.920> get<00:02:03.070> beyond

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
the physical kicks in but you get beyond

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.760 
the physical kicks in but you get beyond
to<00:02:03.700> where<00:02:03.880> it<00:02:04.119> hurts<00:02:04.329> so<00:02:04.990> it's<00:02:05.170> just<00:02:05.259> all<00:02:05.470> mine

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
to where it hurts so it's just all mine

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.510 
to where it hurts so it's just all mine
and<00:02:05.799> will<00:02:06.159> that<00:02:06.310> kicks<00:02:06.549> in<00:02:06.729> after<00:02:06.909> that<00:02:07.180> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520
