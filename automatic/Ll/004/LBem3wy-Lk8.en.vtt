00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
dirty so that one we unstrap by doing

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.960 
dirty so that one we unstrap by doing
it's<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.279> uh

and<00:01:12.020> wipe<00:01:12.260> that<00:01:12.290> off<00:01:12.470> there<00:01:19.660> you<00:01:20.660> can<00:01:20.810> use<00:01:20.960> your

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
and wipe that off there you can use your

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.620 
and wipe that off there you can use your
nails<00:01:21.490> on<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.640> stand<00:01:22.880> paper<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.270> get<00:01:23.390> up<00:01:23.510> in

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
nails on the stand paper to get up in

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.830 
nails on the stand paper to get up in
the<00:01:23.720> corners<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:24.229> stuff<00:01:25.420> so<00:01:26.420> that<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:26.660> can

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
the corners and stuff so that you can

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.740 
the corners and stuff so that you can
see<00:01:27.050> I'm<00:01:27.830> gonna<00:01:28.160> do<00:01:28.340> that<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.700> other<00:01:28.820> side

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.510 

I'm<00:01:35.750> not<00:01:36.020> sure<00:01:36.320> what<00:01:36.530> happened<00:01:36.950> on<00:01:37.070> this<00:01:37.280> side

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
I'm not sure what happened on this side

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.219 
I'm not sure what happened on this side
I<00:01:37.760> think<00:01:37.940> those<00:01:38.090> experimenting<00:01:38.900> with<00:01:39.050> some

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
I think those experimenting with some

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:52.990 
I think those experimenting with some
different<00:01:40.330> painting<00:01:41.330> techniques<00:01:51.820> looks<00:01:52.820> like

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
different painting techniques looks like

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.430 
different painting techniques looks like
I<00:01:53.119> might<00:01:53.270> have<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.509> grab<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.840> new<00:01:54.080> piece<00:01:54.259> of

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
I might have to grab a new piece of

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.950 
I might have to grab a new piece of
sandpaper<00:01:55.119> this<00:01:56.119> one's<00:01:56.360> being<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.600> little<00:01:56.840> bit

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
sandpaper this one's being a little bit

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.180 
sandpaper this one's being a little bit
clogged<00:01:57.320> up<00:01:57.590> here<00:02:02.500> all<00:02:03.500> right<00:02:03.649> that's<00:02:03.890> good<00:02:04.070> on

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.340 
to be using the weathering powders in
this<00:02:24.230> video<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:25.630> maybe<00:02:26.630> in<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.870> future<00:02:27.110> video

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
this video and maybe in a future video

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.870 
this video and maybe in a future video
I'll<00:02:28.299> use<00:02:29.299> an<00:02:29.450> airbrush<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.519> I'm<00:02:31.519> still

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
I'll use an airbrush so I'm still

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.199 
I'll use an airbrush so I'm still
working<00:02:32.180> on<00:02:32.269> that

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.860 

anyways<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.170> gives<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:38.689> a<00:02:39.689> nice

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
anyways this gives it just a nice

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:55.280 
anyways this gives it just a nice
texture<00:02:42.920> this<00:02:43.920> white<00:02:44.459> cup<00:02:44.790> here<00:02:53.659> already<00:02:54.659> I've

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
texture this white cup here already I've

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.780 
texture this white cup here already I've
just<00:02:55.470> barely<00:02:55.709> done<00:02:56.010> anything<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.549> but<00:02:56.579> you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
just barely done anything to it but you

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.750 
just barely done anything to it but you
can<00:02:56.939> see<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.209> looks<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:58.340> lot<00:02:59.340> better<00:02:59.579> than

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
can see that looks a lot better than

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
break off a little bit of it as you can

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.230 
break off a little bit of it as you can
see<00:05:07.880> right<00:05:08.060> there<00:05:09.550> I've<00:05:10.550> been<00:05:10.670> taking<00:05:11.060> some

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
see right there I've been taking some

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.170 
see right there I've been taking some
needle<00:05:11.480> nose<00:05:11.510> pliers<00:05:13.390> just<00:05:15.820> damage<00:05:16.820> it<00:05:16.910> on<00:05:17.030> the

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
needle nose pliers just damage it on the

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:24.550 
needle nose pliers just damage it on the
model

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.830 

now<00:05:25.560> usually<00:05:25.830> I'll<00:05:26.130> take<00:05:26.370> off<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:26.880> walkways

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
now usually I'll take off the walkways

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.650 
now usually I'll take off the walkways
on<00:05:28.260> the<00:05:28.800> roof<00:05:29.010> of<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.220> car<00:05:29.430> but<00:05:31.340> these<00:05:32.340> are

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
on the roof of the car but these are

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.970 
on the roof of the car but these are
really<00:05:33.660> fine<00:05:33.930> metal<00:05:34.350> and<00:05:34.500> I'm<00:05:34.590> pretty<00:05:34.860> sure

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
really fine metal and I'm pretty sure

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.920 
really fine metal and I'm pretty sure
they<00:05:35.370> break<00:05:35.700> if<00:05:35.880> I<00:05:35.970> tried<00:05:36.270> to<00:05:36.420> take<00:05:36.600> them<00:05:36.750> off

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
they break if I tried to take them off

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.200 
they break if I tried to take them off
so<00:05:36.960> I'm<00:05:37.520> not<00:05:38.520> going<00:05:38.670> to<00:05:38.730> do<00:05:38.850> that<00:05:39.030> in<00:05:39.120> this

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
so I'm not going to do that in this

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:47.750 
so I'm not going to do that in this
video<00:05:39.390> but<00:05:43.250> usually<00:05:44.250> I'll<00:05:44.340> do<00:05:44.520> that<00:05:44.730> so<00:05:46.760> you

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
video but usually I'll do that so you

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.370 
video but usually I'll do that so you
can<00:05:47.910> see<00:05:48.030> I'm<00:05:48.120> just<00:05:48.180> going<00:05:48.330> over<00:05:48.660> it<00:05:48.810> it<00:05:49.200> gives

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
can see I'm just going over it it gives

00:05:49.380 --> 00:06:15.629 
can see I'm just going over it it gives
it<00:05:49.530> a<00:05:49.590> real<00:05:49.770> nice<00:05:49.950> texture

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.540 

so<00:06:16.539> you<00:06:16.659> can<00:06:16.810> see<00:06:16.990> it's<00:06:17.199> coming<00:06:18.009> along<00:06:18.280> pretty

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
so you can see it's coming along pretty

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.149 
so you can see it's coming along pretty
well<00:06:20.129> I'm<00:06:21.129> just<00:06:21.219> going<00:06:21.400> to<00:06:21.430> continue<00:06:22.979> adding<00:06:23.979> a

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:24.159 
well I'm just going to continue adding a

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:30.779 
well I'm just going to continue adding a
couple<00:06:24.370> more<00:06:24.460> layers<00:06:28.349> and<00:06:29.550> there<00:06:30.550> you<00:06:30.610> go<00:06:30.729> I'm

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
couple more layers and there you go I'm

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.059 
couple more layers and there you go I'm
going<00:06:31.120> to<00:06:31.150> let<00:06:31.210> that<00:06:31.479> dry<00:06:31.539> and<00:06:32.319> then<00:06:33.000> I<00:06:34.000> will

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:35.069 
going to let that dry and then I will

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:37.649 
going to let that dry and then I will
put<00:06:36.069> some<00:06:36.219> powders<00:06:36.639> around<00:06:36.909> it<00:06:37.120> to<00:06:37.270> kind<00:06:37.479> of

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:37.659 
put some powders around it to kind of

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:41.400 
put some powders around it to kind of
brighten<00:06:38.199> it<00:06:38.349> up<00:06:38.500> and<00:06:38.710> bring<00:06:38.889> out<00:06:39.009> the<00:06:39.159> rest
