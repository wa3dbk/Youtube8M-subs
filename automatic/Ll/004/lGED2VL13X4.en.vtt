 from your keyboard 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.170

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.609
 tastelessness 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.500
 well first let's go 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.030
 we already know what 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.610
 our magician i the good i can not control bad taste 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.700

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.080
 we're going to press it on let's go control panel 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.480
 and then we will look like this list 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.610
 let's move the with the directional arrows 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.610

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.160
 up to this point 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.590
 I stayed more or less here where are the options to move them 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.340
 they will realize that they have already reached that option because it is shaded 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.050
 Orange 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.079
 eye 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.079
 the small lines enclosing this option 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.339
 and then we go 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.829

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.599
 they are going to seem like a first option 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.009
