this<00:00:10.050> car<00:00:10.320> was<00:00:10.590> for<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.889> year<00:00:11.040> teener<00:00:11.309> GP<00:00:11.960> last

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
this car was for the year teener GP last

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.870 
this car was for the year teener GP last
year<00:00:13.170> when<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.410> campaigned<00:00:13.920> our<00:00:14.190> time

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
year when you campaigned our time

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.660 
year when you campaigned our time
attacking<00:00:15.179> a4<00:00:15.630> with<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> 24<00:00:16.470> valve<00:00:16.680> er6<00:00:17.250> and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
attacking a4 with the 24 valve er6 and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.880 
attacking a4 with the 24 valve er6 and
we<00:00:17.910> swapped<00:00:18.270> all<00:00:18.390> three<00:00:18.600> events<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.830> we

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
we swapped all three events and so we

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.800 
we swapped all three events and so we
wanted<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> retire<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.520> car<00:00:20.970> move<00:00:21.390> on<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.750> an

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
wanted to retire that car move on to an

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.920 
wanted to retire that car move on to an
exciting<00:00:22.380> project<00:00:23.060> and<00:00:24.060> bouncing<00:00:24.869> around

kind of want to flip our last project on
its<00:00:33.630> head<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.200> instead<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.620> having<00:00:34.770> game<00:00:35.130> how

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
its head so instead of having game how

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.819 
its head so instead of having game how
do<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.969> want<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.180> Volkswagen<00:00:36.690> motor<00:00:36.930> this

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
do you want the Volkswagen motor this

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.799 
do you want the Volkswagen motor this
time<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.309> did<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.640> Volkswagen<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> howdy

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
time we did a Volkswagen with a howdy

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.880 
time we did a Volkswagen with a howdy
motor<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:41.670> bring<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.390> project<00:00:42.930> together<00:00:43.260> we

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
motor to bring this project together we

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.020 
motor to bring this project together we
had<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.219> employ<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> lot<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:46.190> Technology<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
had to employ a lot of Technology and a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.639 
had to employ a lot of Technology and a
lot<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.210> fabrication<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.320> lot<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
lot of fabrication and a lot of

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.170 
lot of fabrication and a lot of
engineering<00:00:50.010> solutions<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.789> we've<00:00:50.969> never

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
engineering solutions that we've never

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.580 
engineering solutions that we've never
done<00:00:51.449> before

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.760 

so<00:00:59.210> the<00:01:00.210> concept<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.750> done<00:01:00.960> with<00:01:01.170> an<00:01:01.289> image<00:01:01.559> and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
so the concept is done with an image and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.680 
so the concept is done with an image and
rear-wheel<00:01:02.250> drive<00:01:02.280> setup<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.480> really

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
rear-wheel drive setup and really

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.550 
rear-wheel drive setup and really
exciting<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.700> would<00:01:05.700> allow<00:01:05.909> us<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:09.409> in<00:01:10.409> order

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
exciting and would allow us to in order

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.830 
exciting and would allow us to in order
to<00:01:10.710> actually<00:01:11.400> mount<00:01:11.850> an<00:01:12.150> engine<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.659> back

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
to actually mount an engine in the back

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.020 
to actually mount an engine in the back
of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.080> GTI<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:14.250> had<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.490> cut<00:01:14.729> out<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> entire

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
of the GTI we had to cut out the entire

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.840 
of the GTI we had to cut out the entire
floor<00:01:15.960> pan<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.280> rear<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> car

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
floor pan in the rear of the car

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.880 
floor pan in the rear of the car
basically<00:01:18.600> starting<00:01:19.140> from<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.530> backseat

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
basically starting from the backseat

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.060 
basically starting from the backseat
area<00:01:20.280> all<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.759> way<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.720> rear<00:01:21.869> hatch<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
area all the way to the rear hatch and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.440 
area all the way to the rear hatch and
its<00:01:23.729> place<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.299> put<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> tubular<00:01:26.000> subframe<00:01:27.000> that

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
its place we put a tubular subframe that

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.380 
its place we put a tubular subframe that
we<00:01:27.570> built<00:01:28.369> with<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.549> help<00:01:29.729> from<00:01:29.790> Rolf<00:01:30.210> I

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
we built with the help from Rolf I

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.830 
we built with the help from Rolf I
design<00:01:31.100> that<00:01:32.100> that's<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.180> remounts<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
design that that's up remounts of the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.010 
design that that's up remounts of the
car<00:01:34.079> with<00:01:34.320> four<00:01:34.680> big<00:01:35.369> subframe<00:01:35.909> bolts<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
car with four big subframe bolts and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.870 
car with four big subframe bolts and
then<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.229> engine<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.710> transmission<00:01:37.880> all

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
then the engine the transmission all

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.580 
then the engine the transmission all
mounts<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.360> cradles<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:39.930> literally<00:01:40.409> we

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
mounts of the cradles so literally we

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.710 
mounts of the cradles so literally we
can<00:01:40.710> drop<00:01:40.890> four<00:01:41.220> bolts<00:01:41.610> disconnect<00:01:42.570> some

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
can drop four bolts disconnect some

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.220 
can drop four bolts disconnect some
hoses<00:01:42.899> and

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
hoses and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.870 
hoses and
very<00:01:46.230> quickly<00:01:46.530> drop<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.310> motor<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.760> of<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
very quickly drop the motor out of the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.250 
very quickly drop the motor out of the
car<00:01:48.090> there<00:01:48.420> are<00:01:48.510> a<00:01:48.540> lot<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.780> differences

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
car there are a lot of differences

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:56.210 
car there are a lot of differences
between<00:01:53.030> trouble<00:01:54.030> drive<00:01:54.240> cars<00:01:54.890> tend<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.980> push
