and in that sense you see a bunch of the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.560 
and in that sense you see a bunch of the
people<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> heroes<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:28.560> killed<00:01:28.950> gasps<00:01:29.909> now

especially a king they cut off his head
now<00:01:35.100> now<00:01:35.369> let's<00:01:35.610> think<00:01:35.700> about<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.060> where<00:01:36.750> is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
now now let's think about this where is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.170 
now now let's think about this where is
the<00:01:37.140> mark<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:39.200> chai<00:01:40.200> cos<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:41.159> neck<00:01:41.430> now<00:01:41.670> this

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the mark on chai cos the neck now this

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.999 
the mark on chai cos the neck now this
shows<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.570> right<00:01:42.689> there<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> chai<00:01:43.799> cos

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
shows you right there that the chai cos

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.340 
shows you right there that the chai cos
are<00:01:44.220> connected<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.119> gas<00:01:45.360> right<00:01:45.750> there<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
are connected to gas right there it is

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.580 
are connected to gas right there it is
proven<00:01:46.890> with<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:48.180> flashback<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.320> just

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
proven with that flashback it is just

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.230 
proven with that flashback it is just
they<00:01:49.920> might<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.189> well<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.549> shown<00:01:50.850> gas

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
they might as well have shown gas

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.210 
they might as well have shown gas
because<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.960> was<00:01:52.140> literally<00:01:52.439> obvious<00:01:53.009> it

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
because that was literally obvious it

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.789 
because that was literally obvious it
was<00:01:53.460> okay<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.180> didn't<00:01:54.600> perfectly<00:01:55.140> tell<00:01:55.380> all<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
was okay I didn't perfectly tell all the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.859 
was okay I didn't perfectly tell all the
figures<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.549> scene<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.600> probably

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
figures in that scene but if I probably

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.149 
figures in that scene but if I probably
was<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.170> go<00:01:58.259> back<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.619> count<00:01:58.740> them<00:01:58.979> most

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
was to go back and count them most

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.770 
was to go back and count them most
likely<00:01:59.219> there<00:01:59.610> was<00:01:59.670> enough<00:01:59.909> heroes<00:02:00.180> there<00:02:00.329> for

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
likely there was enough heroes there for

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.969 
likely there was enough heroes there for
me<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.079> prove<00:02:01.320> my<00:02:01.500> fury

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
me to prove my fury

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.749 
me to prove my fury
but<00:02:02.460> either<00:02:02.670> way<00:02:02.960> either<00:02:03.960> way<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:05.280> proves

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
but either way either way this proves

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.700 
but either way either way this proves
that<00:02:06.000> most<00:02:06.360> likely<00:02:06.540> these<00:02:06.899> chai<00:02:07.259> cos<00:02:07.530> are

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
that most likely these chai cos are

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.309 
that most likely these chai cos are
homunculus<00:02:08.220> they<00:02:08.789> are<00:02:09.000> artificially<00:02:09.780> created

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
homunculus they are artificially created

correct<00:03:50.000> because<00:03:50.510> all<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.710> chai<00:03:51.950> cos<00:03:52.190> are

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
correct because all the chai cos are

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.330 
correct because all the chai cos are
going<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.910> die<00:03:53.090> besides<00:03:53.990> one<00:03:54.320> most<00:03:54.680> likely<00:03:55.070> so

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
going to die besides one most likely so

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.670 
going to die besides one most likely so
that's<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.180> thing<00:03:56.360> okay<00:03:56.540> all<00:03:56.870> China's<00:03:57.500> will

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
that's the thing okay all China's will

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.310 
that's the thing okay all China's will
eventually<00:03:58.310> probably<00:03:58.460> die<00:03:58.880> Assad's<00:03:59.600> one<00:03:59.990> and

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
eventually probably die Assad's one and

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.930 
eventually probably die Assad's one and
maybe<00:04:00.560> that<00:04:00.770> one<00:04:00.980> might<00:04:01.190> even<00:04:01.340> die<00:04:01.490> too<00:04:01.550> since

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
maybe that one might even die too since

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.130 
maybe that one might even die too since

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
I knew it was good I sensed it from the

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.800 
I knew it was good I sensed it from the
beginning

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
beginning

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.060 
beginning
that's<00:06:18.110> why<00:06:18.230> I've<00:06:18.350> stuck<00:06:18.650> through<00:06:18.890> this

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
that's why I've stuck through this

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.520 
that's why I've stuck through this
series<00:06:19.280> this<00:06:19.580> long<00:06:19.850> but<00:06:20.660> I<00:06:20.720> did<00:06:21.050> not<00:06:21.230> think

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
series this long but I did not think

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.320 
series this long but I did not think
that<00:06:21.800> we<00:06:21.980> would<00:06:22.010> have<00:06:22.190> all<00:06:22.730> these<00:06:22.910> Furies

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
that we would have all these Furies

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.360 
that we would have all these Furies
answered<00:06:23.870> all<00:06:24.140> these<00:06:24.290> Furies<00:06:24.770> just<00:06:25.100> pretty

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
answered all these Furies just pretty

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.130 
answered all these Furies just pretty
much<00:06:25.490> correct<00:06:25.700> I<00:06:26.000> guessed<00:06:26.300> on<00:06:26.540> and<00:06:26.930> at<00:06:27.020> the

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.140 
much correct I guessed on and at the

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.110 
much correct I guessed on and at the
same<00:06:27.320> time<00:06:27.560> it's<00:06:27.800> leading<00:06:28.040> up<00:06:28.370> into<00:06:28.490> an<00:06:28.760> epic

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
same time it's leading up into an epic

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.080 
same time it's leading up into an epic
cliffhanger<00:06:29.360> for<00:06:30.170> us<00:06:30.350> season<00:06:30.770> two<00:06:30.980> and<00:06:31.310> that's

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
cliffhanger for us season two and that's

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.850 
cliffhanger for us season two and that's
pretty<00:06:32.300> much<00:06:32.420> what<00:06:32.750> this<00:06:32.960> season<00:06:33.350> one<00:06:33.500> is<00:06:33.710> up

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
pretty much what this season one is up

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.190 
pretty much what this season one is up
its<00:06:34.040> genotype<00:06:34.370> it's<00:06:34.760> clearly<00:06:35.060> just<00:06:35.450> build<00:06:36.020> up

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
its genotype it's clearly just build up

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.420 
its genotype it's clearly just build up
for<00:06:36.410> the<00:06:36.470> main<00:06:36.680> in-game

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430

whatever I don't know if it's completely

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.020 
whatever I don't know if it's completely
concluded<00:06:48.590> but<00:06:48.980> if<00:06:49.070> it<00:06:49.190> is<00:06:49.340> that's<00:06:49.700> gonna<00:06:49.850> be

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
concluded but if it is that's gonna be

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.970 
concluded but if it is that's gonna be
good<00:06:50.180> because<00:06:50.480> I<00:06:50.510> mean<00:06:50.750> season<00:06:51.200> two<00:06:51.410> will<00:06:51.890> have

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:51.980 
good because I mean season two will have

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.640 
good because I mean season two will have
a<00:06:52.040> very<00:06:52.340> good<00:06:52.430> definite<00:06:53.150> inning<00:06:53.810> but<00:06:54.350> if<00:06:54.470> it's

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650 
a very good definite inning but if it's

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.770 
a very good definite inning but if it's
not<00:06:54.890> finished<00:06:55.220> hopefully<00:06:56.120> they<00:06:56.600> don't

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
not finished hopefully they don't

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.990 
not finished hopefully they don't
destroy<00:06:57.200> a<00:06:57.290> season<00:06:57.830> two<00:06:58.040> by<00:06:58.340> trying<00:06:58.700> to<00:06:58.820> just

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 
destroy a season two by trying to just

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.970 
destroy a season two by trying to just
make<00:06:59.120> a<00:06:59.150> season<00:06:59.420> two<00:06:59.750> hopefully<00:07:00.200> explains

everything<00:07:01.310> and<00:07:01.580> if<00:07:01.640> they<00:07:01.760> have<00:07:02.000> to<00:07:02.210> hopefully

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
everything and if they have to hopefully

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.000 
everything and if they have to hopefully
they<00:07:03.020> leave<00:07:03.170> it<00:07:03.260> on<00:07:03.320> a<00:07:03.380> cliffhanger<00:07:03.650> if<00:07:03.920> they

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.010 
they leave it on a cliffhanger if they

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.530 
they leave it on a cliffhanger if they
must<00:07:04.280> wait<00:07:04.460> for<00:07:04.520> a<00:07:04.700> season<00:07:05.090> three<00:07:05.270> which<00:07:05.390> I'd
