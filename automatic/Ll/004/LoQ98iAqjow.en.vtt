00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.640
 I always told you this is very much 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.570
 but it 's real there's not much 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.579
 to talk about weapon 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.170
 I just know the cult she fucking me 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.450
 I think she's a light weapon like you are. 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.009
 watching her playing with her friend . 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.299
 ball which was referenced in the 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.460
 neighborhood remembers the last virtual using 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.799
 less good but finally differentiated in 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.289
 newsletter and I'm playing with her there 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.240
 in the same style looks yellow mile 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.829
 public when that yellow smoke 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.469
 proud of having arrived at nothing 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.329
 but anyway it's a cool and expensive 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.189
 hard and deceive canada turned 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.049
 suddenly behind is very beautiful and 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.670
 snail now hit a bench in the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.920
 What head will I ever have done for beretta? 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.020
 I did it, it's going to make you crazy because 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.759
 Yes, because life is crazy and it's as follows. 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.340
 Are you married? Got a message for you. 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.810
 and it is basically for this that uses 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.579
 of the videos and teaches the people that the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.829
 video is short but generally effective for 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.570
 a little message for you and even because the 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.250
 video is short and I do not know how to handle it 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.689
 such a long subject usually when 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.119
 I want to talk about dealing with a subject soon. 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.799
 I bring vogue to the channel other than the channel. 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.020
 the globe I bring one to the subject 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.070
 gigantic than video of explosive but 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.380
 Here's what I want to make clear to 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.020
 You guys, I really went back to school. 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.060
 It's probably me, I 'm thinking. 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.320
 I will not stop doing it and I remember 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.760
 I did not tell you when I came back to 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.920
 classes will make second videos again 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.830
 Wednesday and Friday but no boys will 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.080
 Try to bring video every day 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.330
 and I'll try to bring Friday video 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.550
 manifest penalty and manifest at least 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.140
 a blog video by ronaldo to the channel 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.330
 competitive will become a little fan of the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.430
 time and I think that 's what this is 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.140
 I'll give you a message, I'll give it to you. 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.960
 keep doing every day then 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.520
 was the main one but I do not walk anymore 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.040
 making so much worse not having played 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.410
 a lot with you and this will decrease 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.600
 little more is the bad thing about 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.490
 story because I have to go back 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.860
 Now I'm dedicating myself even more in the 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.690
 because the second 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.790
 grade of subjects are legal matters 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.310
 the busiest practice of requires more 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.560
 dedication and I'm dedicating myself little 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.810
 but then time will be well it will be alright 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.520
 squeezed even then the time I 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.170
 you have to be able to make an appeal to 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.180
 you guys I'm going to do 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.800

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.240
 but eleven and a half at night 11 hours back 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.980

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.610

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.360
 It's just paste that is not in rc so it's 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.890

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.540

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.880

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.110
 science and by then it is not favorite 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.690
 forget that one was for us to achieve 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.090

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.260
 paced destination stipulated ipp is the 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.340
