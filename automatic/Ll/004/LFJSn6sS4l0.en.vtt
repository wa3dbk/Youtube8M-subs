so now music has been changed from iPods
music<00:00:05.009> I<00:00:05.160> think<00:00:05.759> with<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.180> reason<00:00:06.509> why

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
music I think with the the reason why

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.480

they<00:00:06.839> changed<00:00:07.049> it<00:00:07.319> both<00:00:07.500> on<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.799> iphone<00:00:08.160> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
to click down there see it's kind of

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.510 
to click down there see it's kind of
annoying<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.320> smaller<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:23.189> font

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
annoying because it's smaller the font

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.039 
annoying because it's smaller the font
is<00:01:23.729> smaller<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.540> kind<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.780> nice<00:01:24.869> because

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
is smaller that's kind of nice because

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.469 
is smaller that's kind of nice because
it<00:01:25.229> displays<00:01:25.530> more<00:01:25.799> songs<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.369> time<00:01:26.580> before

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
it displays more songs at a time before

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.260 
it displays more songs at a time before
having<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:27.960> move<00:01:28.200> around<00:01:28.640> but<00:01:29.640> again<00:01:29.729> making

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
having to move around but again making

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.030 
having to move around but again making
fonts<00:01:30.750> more<00:01:30.990> isn't<00:01:31.229> always<00:01:31.439> such<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.799> great

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
fonts more isn't always such a great

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.090 
fonts more isn't always such a great
thing<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.840> because<00:01:33.840> now<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> lot

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
thing and because now this is a lot

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.660 
thing and because now this is a lot
easier<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.520> click<00:01:35.820> now<00:01:36.479> i<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.079> go<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.280> tap

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
easier to click now i have to go and tap

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.060 
easier to click now i have to go and tap
the<00:01:38.939> smaller<00:01:39.329> icon<00:01:39.990> there<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.500> i<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:40.860> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
the smaller icon there but i like that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.260 
the smaller icon there but i like that
they<00:01:41.189> brought<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> bar<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.060> it's<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> little
