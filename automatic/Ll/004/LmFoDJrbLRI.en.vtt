I want to talk about how the Titan is a
workhorse<00:00:21.560> class<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.949> destiny<00:00:23.460> arguably

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
workhorse class and destiny arguably

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.980 
workhorse class and destiny arguably
undeniably<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.859> weakest<00:00:26.430> PvP<00:00:27.180> class<00:00:27.570> and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
undeniably the weakest PvP class and

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.929 
undeniably the weakest PvP class and
destiny<00:00:28.560> has<00:00:28.740> always<00:00:29.039> been<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.519> weakest

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
destiny has always been the weakest

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.440 
destiny has always been the weakest
class<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.859> how<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:31.920> have<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.399> work<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:32.910> every

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
class and how we have to work for every

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.569 
class and how we have to work for every
single<00:00:33.899> kill<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.680> gameplay<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.250> think

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
single kill and in this gameplay I think

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.389 
single kill and in this gameplay I think
will<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:36.410> kind<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.500> maybe<00:00:37.620> wake<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.219> lot

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
is of course going to be just opposite

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.789 
is of course going to be just opposite
to<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.009> main<00:01:26.369> stream<00:01:26.850> trihard<00:01:27.180> gameplay<00:01:27.990> and

activate super number 10 kills so the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.230

so weak look at this blink ability of

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.719 
so weak look at this blink ability of
ours<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.470> actually<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.009> fly<00:01:47.340> over<00:01:47.369> our

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
somehow survive them with the shotgun

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.440 
somehow survive them with the shotgun
not<00:01:52.979> lucky<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.060> two<00:01:54.090> hit

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450

not lucky on that one and a two hit
melee<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.770> no<00:01:55.979> melee<00:01:56.460> kills<00:01:56.790> that

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
melee we have no melee kills that

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.850 
melee we have no melee kills that
essentially<00:01:57.659> one<00:01:57.869> hit<00:01:58.049> melee<00:01:58.380> other<00:01:58.649> than

essentially one hit melee other than

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.230 
essentially one hit melee other than
shoulder<00:01:59.250> charge<00:01:59.430> which<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.850> am<00:01:59.909> not<00:02:00.090> running

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
shoulder charge which I am not running

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.270 
shoulder charge which I am not running
in<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.600> gameplay<00:02:00.810> may<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.259> add<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.219> think

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
in this gameplay may I add and I think

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.859 
in this gameplay may I add and I think
shoulder<00:02:02.790> charge<00:02:02.969> gets<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.360> bad<00:02:03.509> rap<00:02:03.719> because

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
shoulder charge gets a bad rap because

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.690 
shoulder charge gets a bad rap because
more<00:02:04.320> often<00:02:04.439> not<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.799> results<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.460> suicide

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
more often not a results in a suicide

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.479 
more often not a results in a suicide
type<00:02:06.180> attack<00:02:06.509> there<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.259> number<00:02:07.619> two<00:02:07.860> was

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
type attack there it is number two was

super<00:02:08.879> activate<00:02:09.300> number<00:02:09.569> two<00:02:09.720> actually<00:02:09.989> I

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
super activate number two actually I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.650 
super activate number two actually I
think<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.289> missed<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:11.250> one<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.730> my<00:02:11.849> queue<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
think I missed that one in my queue and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.990 
think I missed that one in my queue and
might

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
might

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.670 
might

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
cali that is off the counter at the end

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.220 
cali that is off the counter at the end
I<00:02:14.980> pretty<00:02:15.550> much<00:02:15.670> got<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:15.970> kills<00:02:16.360> right<00:02:17.110> on

this<00:04:51.900> gun<00:04:52.140> I<00:04:52.170> think<00:04:52.500> it's<00:04:52.590> a<00:04:52.620> great<00:04:52.770> gun<00:04:53.070> if<00:04:53.310> you

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
this gun I think it's a great gun if you

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.340 
this gun I think it's a great gun if you
keep<00:04:53.670> it<00:04:53.820> at<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.270> ranges<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:54.780> needs<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.050> be<00:04:55.200> at

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
keep it at the ranges it needs to be at

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.930 
keep it at the ranges it needs to be at
which<00:04:55.650> is<00:04:55.800> close<00:04:56.040> to<00:04:56.070> medium<00:04:56.490> range<00:04:56.670> if<00:04:56.820> you

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
which is close to medium range if you
