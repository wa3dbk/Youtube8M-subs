00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
move each way it's not going to stretch

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.670 
move each way it's not going to stretch
that<00:02:24.120> much<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.780> pretty<00:02:25.050> good<00:02:25.260> silicone

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
that much so it is pretty good silicone

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
you guys can see the curve it's a very

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.780 
you guys can see the curve it's a very
form-fitting<00:03:22.050> case<00:03:22.260> not<00:03:22.920> too<00:03:23.160> much<00:03:23.310> slack<00:03:23.610> on

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
form-fitting case not too much slack on

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.220 
form-fitting case not too much slack on
it<00:03:23.940> except<00:03:24.239> for<00:03:24.270> around<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.570> edges<00:03:24.750> here

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
it except for around the edges here

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.810 
it except for around the edges here
because<00:03:25.770> it's<00:03:25.980> not<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:26.160> tight<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.670> a

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
because it's not that tight of a

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.310 
because it's not that tight of a
silicone<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.390> you<00:03:27.480> can<00:03:27.630> get<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.870> on<00:03:27.959> easier

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
silicone so you can get it on easier

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.050 
silicone so you can get it on easier
which<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.560> actually<00:03:28.709> pretty<00:03:28.980> neat<00:03:29.220> does<00:03:29.910> have

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
which is actually pretty neat does have

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.820 
which is actually pretty neat does have
a<00:03:30.120> nice<00:03:30.300> little<00:03:30.480> lay<00:03:30.720> on<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.930> table<00:03:30.959> design<00:03:31.530> so

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
a nice little lay on the table design so

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.770 
a nice little lay on the table design so
it<00:03:31.950> does<00:03:32.100> have<00:03:32.130> that<00:03:32.370> lip<00:03:32.640> right<00:03:33.330> there<00:03:33.390> this

it does have that lip right there this

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.330 
it does have that lip right there this
this<00:03:34.110> camera<00:03:34.410> does<00:03:34.530> not<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.739> autofocus<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.280> I

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
this camera does not the autofocus so I

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.040 
this camera does not the autofocus so I
can't<00:03:35.550> bring<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.790> up<00:03:35.850> here<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.150> have<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.900> auto
