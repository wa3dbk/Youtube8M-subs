00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
I think you'll slightly be familiar with

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.050 
I think you'll slightly be familiar with
this<00:00:18.990> sort<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.260> style<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.650> gameplay<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.789> game

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
this sort of style of gameplay this game

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.970 
this sort of style of gameplay this game
is<00:00:21.240> basically<00:00:21.660> one<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> biggest<00:00:22.590> ripoffs

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
is basically one of the biggest ripoffs

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.400 
is basically one of the biggest ripoffs
ever<00:00:23.279> now<00:00:23.970> there<00:00:24.510> was<00:00:24.630> loads<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.960> ripoffs

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
ever now there was loads of ripoffs

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.099 
ever now there was loads of ripoffs
after<00:00:25.710> Sonic<00:00:26.099> there<00:00:26.340> was<00:00:26.460> Bob<00:00:26.760> see<00:00:27.090> they<00:00:27.960> will

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
after Sonic there was Bob see they will

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.630 
after Sonic there was Bob see they will
Zul<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.650> know<00:00:28.769> they<00:00:28.890> all<00:00:29.010> ran<00:00:29.220> will<00:00:29.369> be<00:00:29.460> really

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
Zul you know they all ran will be really

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.519 
Zul you know they all ran will be really
fast<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.150> no<00:00:30.420> one<00:00:30.570> did<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.779> as<00:00:30.990> blatant<00:00:31.500> as

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
fast but no one did it as blatant as

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.780 
fast but no one did it as blatant as
socket<00:00:32.489> there<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.600> go<00:00:34.040> now<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.100> basically

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
socket there we go now you basically

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.340 
socket there we go now you basically
find<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.270> graphics<00:00:36.690> are<00:00:36.870> very<00:00:36.899> very

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
find that the graphics are very very

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.709 
find that the graphics are very very
similar<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.129> he's<00:00:38.460> even<00:00:38.700> animated<00:00:39.360> very

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
similar and he's even animated very

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.959 
similar and he's even animated very
similar<00:00:40.079> when<00:00:40.230> he<00:00:40.320> actually<00:00:40.739> runs<00:00:40.920> now<00:00:41.910> you

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
similar when he actually runs now you

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.250 
similar when he actually runs now you
play<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.390> character<00:00:42.719> they're<00:00:43.050> called

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
play this character they're called

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.560 
play this character they're called
socket<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:43.980> basically<00:00:44.700> he<00:00:44.940> plugs<00:00:45.210> estelle

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
socket and basically he plugs estelle

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.510 
socket and basically he plugs estelle
into<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> electric<00:00:46.379> socket<00:00:46.590> which<00:00:47.399> I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
into the electric socket which I

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.490 
into the electric socket which I
wouldn't<00:00:47.760> advise<00:00:47.969> anyone<00:00:48.390> doing<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.320> then<00:00:49.440> he

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
wouldn't advise anyone doing and then he

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.569 
wouldn't advise anyone doing and then he
gets<00:00:49.649> supercharged

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
gets supercharged

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.569 
gets supercharged
now<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.140> see<00:00:52.199> basically<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:53.190> plays

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
now as you can see basically it plays

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.930 
now as you can see basically it plays
pretty<00:00:54.329> much<00:00:54.570> exactly<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:55.079> Sonic<00:00:55.739> -<00:00:56.640> that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
pretty much exactly like Sonic - that

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.700 
pretty much exactly like Sonic - that
you<00:00:57.059> can't<00:00:57.329> turn<00:00:57.510> into<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.750> little<00:00:57.960> ball<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.440> a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
you can't turn into a little ball and a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.410 
you can't turn into a little ball and a
hit<00:00:58.890> thing<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.579> makes<00:00:59.820> things<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.329> little

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
hit thing so it makes things a little

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.000 
hit thing so it makes things a little
bit<00:01:00.629> difficult<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.960> can<00:01:03.960> do<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
bit difficult you know I can do this and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.980 
bit difficult you know I can do this and
again<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.369> sonic<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.270> need<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.630> sort<00:01:06.869> make

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
again like sonic you need to sort make

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.240 
again like sonic you need to sort make
sure<00:01:07.110> you've<00:01:07.229> got<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> nice<00:01:07.560> little<00:01:07.830> run<00:01:08.100> up

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
sure you've got a nice little run up

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.859 
sure you've got a nice little run up
before<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.850> run<00:01:08.970> up<00:01:09.090> steep<00:01:09.330> things<00:01:09.630> so

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
before you can run up steep things so

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.179 
before you can run up steep things so
I'm<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:10.020> gonna<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.290> able<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.130> I

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
I'm not gonna be able to do that so if I

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.630 
I'm not gonna be able to do that so if I
can<00:01:11.340> jump<00:01:11.520> through<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:13.130> see<00:01:14.130> that's<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:14.460> a

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
can jump through there see that's what a

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.980 
can jump through there see that's what a
socket<00:01:14.939> has<00:01:15.180> got<00:01:15.450> he's<00:01:15.600> got<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.900> little

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
socket has got he's got like a little

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.469 
socket has got he's got like a little
jump<00:01:16.320> cake<00:01:16.650> thing<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.700> not<00:01:17.880> very<00:01:18.090> good

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
jump cake thing and it's not very good

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.130 
jump cake thing and it's not very good

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.260 

I<00:01:23.200> mean<00:01:23.860> okay<00:01:24.100> graphically<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.820> game<00:01:24.850> does

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
I mean okay graphically the game does

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.670 
I mean okay graphically the game does

look very nice the music is pretty good

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.700 
look very nice the music is pretty good
as<00:01:29.800> well<00:01:30.040> but<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.790> only<00:01:30.909> thing<00:01:31.120> I'd<00:01:31.240> say<00:01:31.390> about

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
as well but the only thing I'd say about

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.100 
as well but the only thing I'd say about
socket<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:33.220> games<00:01:33.490> not<00:01:33.850> memorable

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
socket the games not memorable

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.620 
socket the games not memorable
Sonic<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.770> Hedgehog<00:01:35.890> had<00:01:36.640> levels<00:01:37.060> you<00:01:37.510> know

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
Sonic the Hedgehog had levels you know

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.450 
Sonic the Hedgehog had levels you know
it<00:01:37.810> had<00:01:38.050> an<00:01:38.229> amazing<00:01:38.650> level<00:01:38.770> design<00:01:39.190> had<00:01:39.430> a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
it had an amazing level design had a

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.370 
it had an amazing level design had a
great<00:01:39.850> sort<00:01:40.210> of<00:01:40.240> character<00:01:40.720> design<00:01:41.050> as<00:01:41.200> well

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
great sort of character design as well

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.960 
great sort of character design as well
and<00:01:41.710> that's<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.040> reason<00:01:42.310> why<00:01:42.430> it<00:01:42.490> worked<00:01:42.729> but

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
and that's the reason why it worked but

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.450 
and that's the reason why it worked but
socket<00:01:43.600> is<00:01:43.750> just<00:01:43.990> what<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.830> hell<00:01:44.950> is<00:01:45.070> he<00:01:45.190> meant

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
socket is just what the hell is he meant

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.830 
socket is just what the hell is he meant
to<00:01:45.610> be<00:01:45.790> some<00:01:46.060> sort<00:01:46.270> of<00:01:46.330> like<00:01:46.540> kind<00:01:46.869> of<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.580> or

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
to be some sort of like kind of and or

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.290

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.800 
collect all those little lightning bolts
and<00:02:28.299> they<00:02:29.110> basically<00:02:29.350> energize<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:31.630> that

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
and they basically energize you so that

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.860

a<00:02:34.959> long<00:02:35.200> video<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.650> I'll<00:02:35.739> be<00:02:35.860> doing<00:02:36.160> i've

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
a long video that I'll be doing i've

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.000 
a long video that I'll be doing i've
decided<00:02:36.880> rather<00:02:37.209> than<00:02:37.329> do<00:02:37.930> 10<00:02:38.320> 15<00:02:38.560> minute

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
decided rather than do 10 15 minute

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.160 
decided rather than do 10 15 minute
videos<00:02:39.280> like<00:02:39.459> i<00:02:39.489> do<00:02:39.700> sometimes<00:02:39.970> i<00:02:40.510> might<00:02:41.019> do

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
videos like i do sometimes i might do

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.900 
videos like i do sometimes i might do
some<00:02:41.350> short<00:02:41.590> videos<00:02:42.040> because<00:02:42.459> sometimes<00:02:42.820> i

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
some short videos because sometimes i

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.850 
some short videos because sometimes i
just<00:02:43.150> can't<00:02:43.360> be<00:02:43.510> bothered<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.870> make<00:02:44.260> videos

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
just can't be bothered to make videos

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.990 
just can't be bothered to make videos
that<00:02:44.890> are<00:02:45.040> longer<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:45.459> if<00:02:45.549> i'd<00:02:45.640> be<00:02:45.760> short

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
that are longer so if i'd be short

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.360 
that are longer so if i'd be short
videos<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:46.989> probably<00:02:47.440> get<00:02:47.620> see<00:02:47.920> more<00:02:48.100> videos

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370
