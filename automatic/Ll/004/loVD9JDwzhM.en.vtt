00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
super flies last year it seemed like it

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.349 
super flies last year it seemed like it
was<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.410> time<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.130> plasticy<00:03:44.790> material<00:03:45.239> that

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
was a time of a plasticy material that

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.270 
was a time of a plasticy material that
went<00:03:45.480> up<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.630> back<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:46.500> one<00:03:46.560> actually<00:03:47.010> seems

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
went up the back this one actually seems

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.240 
went up the back this one actually seems
to<00:03:47.489> be<00:03:48.019> it<00:03:49.019> seems<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.470> be<00:03:49.620> I'm<00:03:49.890> not<00:03:50.040> sure<00:03:50.160> if

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
to be it seems to be I'm not sure if

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.620 
to be it seems to be I'm not sure if
it's<00:03:50.340> real<00:03:50.519> leather<00:03:50.730> but<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.090> does<00:03:51.239> seem<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.480> be

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
it's real leather but it does seem to be

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.699 
it's real leather but it does seem to be
a<00:03:52.170> definitely<00:03:52.980> different<00:03:53.370> material<00:03:53.850> than<00:03:54.709> the

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
a definitely different material than the

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.410 
a definitely different material than the
last<00:03:55.950> boot<00:03:56.220> which<00:03:56.819> is<00:03:56.850> good<00:03:57.090> because<00:03:57.209> that's

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
last boot which is good because that's

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.539 
last boot which is good because that's
what<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.750> lot<00:03:58.109> trouble<00:03:58.260> with<00:03:58.530> these<00:03:59.190> ones<00:03:59.400> do

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
what I lot trouble with these ones do

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.099 
what I lot trouble with these ones do
you<00:03:59.579> see<00:03:59.790> me<00:03:59.910> breaking<00:04:00.120> in<00:04:00.359> faster<00:04:00.810> than<00:04:01.019> my

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
you see me breaking in faster than my

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.580 
you see me breaking in faster than my
previous<00:04:01.260> pair<00:04:02.480> that<00:04:03.480> may<00:04:03.810> be<00:04:03.870> because<00:04:04.440> the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
previous pair that may be because the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.970 
previous pair that may be because the
size<00:04:04.799> had<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.190> look<00:04:05.400> better<00:04:05.579> but<00:04:06.980> they

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
size had to look better but they

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.699 
size had to look better but they
definitely<00:04:08.130> do<00:04:08.900> feel<00:04:09.900> more<00:04:10.230> comfortable<00:04:10.560> in

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
definitely do feel more comfortable in

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.229 
definitely do feel more comfortable in
the<00:04:10.769> heel<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.280> left<00:04:11.519> one<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:11.940> only<00:04:12.120> one

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
the heel the left one is the only one

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.580 
the heel the left one is the only one
that's<00:04:12.540> gave<00:04:12.660> me<00:04:12.780> issue<00:04:12.900> my<00:04:13.109> right<00:04:13.260> one<00:04:13.440> is

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
that's gave me issue my right one is

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.800 
that's gave me issue my right one is
perfect<00:04:14.160> right<00:04:14.310> out<00:04:14.370> of<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.549> box<00:04:14.790> they<00:04:15.630> could

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
perfect right out of the box they could

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.199 
perfect right out of the box they could
be<00:04:15.959> because<00:04:16.079> I'm<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.650> righty<00:04:16.979> my<00:04:17.519> left<00:04:17.729> foots<00:04:17.880> a

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
be because I'm a righty my left foots a

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.509 
be because I'm a righty my left foots a
tiny<00:04:18.989> tiny<00:04:19.289> bit<00:04:19.440> bigger<00:04:19.739> than<00:04:20.099> my<00:04:20.159> right<00:04:20.280> foot

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
tiny tiny bit bigger than my right foot

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.039 
tiny tiny bit bigger than my right foot
so<00:04:21.090> those<00:04:21.239> are<00:04:21.330> all<00:04:21.390> things<00:04:21.419> that<00:04:21.780> might<00:04:21.930> come

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
so those are all things that might come

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.839 
so those are all things that might come
into<00:04:22.200> play<00:04:22.440> but<00:04:23.099> still<00:04:23.340> definitely<00:04:23.490> more

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
into play but still definitely more

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.040 
into play but still definitely more
comfortable

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
comfortable

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.809 
comfortable
then<00:04:25.349> the<00:04:25.500> size<00:04:25.680> nines<00:04:25.949> ahead<00:04:26.220> last<00:04:26.430> year<00:04:26.699> I

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
then the size nines ahead last year I

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:27.920 
then the size nines ahead last year I
think<00:04:26.909> these<00:04:27.060> boots<00:04:27.300> run<00:04:27.509> a<00:04:27.539> little<00:04:27.750> bit

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
think these boots run a little bit

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.409 
think these boots run a little bit
narrow<00:04:28.139> not<00:04:28.409> by<00:04:28.590> much<00:04:28.860> if<00:04:29.729> you<00:04:29.970> know<00:04:30.120> you<00:04:30.180> have

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
narrow not by much if you know you have

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:30.860 
narrow not by much if you know you have
wide<00:04:30.569> feet

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
wide feet

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.149 
wide feet
I<00:04:30.990> wouldn't<00:04:31.229> recommend<00:04:31.349> these<00:04:31.680> but<00:04:31.949> if<00:04:32.039> you

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:32.159 
I wouldn't recommend these but if you

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.779 
I wouldn't recommend these but if you
have<00:04:32.310> say<00:04:33.319> normal<00:04:34.319> to<00:04:34.740> narrow<00:04:34.979> feet<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.520> would

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
have say normal to narrow feet I would

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.279 
have say normal to narrow feet I would
say<00:04:35.909> you<00:04:35.970> should<00:04:36.030> be<00:04:36.210> fine<00:04:36.389> for<00:04:36.599> you<00:04:36.659> because

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
say you should be fine for you because

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.529 
say you should be fine for you because
of<00:04:37.409> the<00:04:37.470> Flyknit<00:04:37.830> upper<00:04:38.039> they<00:04:38.610> do<00:04:38.909> conform

first<00:04:58.500> I<00:04:58.680> laced<00:04:58.919> these<00:04:59.009> off<00:04:59.190> about<00:04:59.370> two<00:04:59.520> weeks

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
first I laced these off about two weeks

first I laced these off about two weeks
ago<00:04:59.909> for<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.120> first<00:05:00.389> time<00:05:01.039> started<00:05:02.039> practice

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
ago for the first time started practice

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.439 
ago for the first time started practice
first<00:05:02.729> shot<00:05:02.940> I<00:05:02.969> took<00:05:03.330> was<00:05:03.990> bar<00:05:04.469> down<00:05:04.740> upper<00:05:05.009> 90

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
first shot I took was bar down upper 90

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.899 
first shot I took was bar down upper 90
absolutely<00:05:06.449> perfect<00:05:07.039> and<00:05:08.039> I<00:05:08.159> know<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.699> boots

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
absolutely perfect and I know the boots

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.270 
absolutely perfect and I know the boots
don't<00:05:09.120> make<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.449> shot<00:05:09.659> but<00:05:10.080> definitely<00:05:11.009> felt

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
don't make the shot but definitely felt

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.709 
don't make the shot but definitely felt
better<00:05:11.370> than<00:05:11.789> what<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.120> boots<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:12.419> was<00:05:12.539> playing

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:12.719 
better than what the boots I was playing

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:14.540 
better than what the boots I was playing
again<00:05:12.900> before<00:05:13.050> if<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.740> to<00:05:13.979> read<00:05:14.129> him<00:05:14.250> I'd<00:05:14.430> give

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
again before if I to read him I'd give

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.589 
again before if I to read him I'd give
him<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.699> 9<00:05:14.819> a<00:05:14.849> 10<00:05:16.789> step<00:05:17.789> break-in<00:05:18.120> period<00:05:18.330> that

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
him a 9 a 10 step break-in period that

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.689 
him a 9 a 10 step break-in period that
that<00:05:18.960> kind<00:05:19.199> of<00:05:19.259> takes<00:05:19.440> away<00:05:19.530> once<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.430> broken

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
that kind of takes away once the broken
