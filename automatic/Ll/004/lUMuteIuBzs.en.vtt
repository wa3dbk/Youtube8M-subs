00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:10.700
 Hi is close to the color list 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:12.910
 I image a hairstyle using a color today with your grandmother Omi-chan. 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.650
 I think that I want to change the 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:24.009
 As styling is uh right now because it is straight 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:25.440
 The outer person of a little hair I think is in their own impression and What Do Kachotto lonely feeling to 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.130
 Softly 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:33.170
 I don't go to my curly hair but I feel a little soft after 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:38.570
 The name of the shop besides the rear horse is also sideways 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:41.060
 Even if you make a mistake, it feels like you're going to be 5 pieces too much, so cut some bangs a little 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.490
 I got a little school 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:50.000
 I think that just have to create a soft image even while also put out a little strength 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:54.530
 Color agent to adjust only a little 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.450
 We will image share hunting while mixing 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.950
 As I said earlier, it's just a bit of this movement 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.910
 flow 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:10.780
 Blows and look at the 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:17.880
 It's a little brighter and it looks like it's under haired hair. 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.880
 The basics are all tofu from the root and form 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.689
 With the part of the tide where the whole ended with the wind 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:37.439
 The front part is divided and the root part distinguishes the same color 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:42.020
 Middle hair part is the hair of it is a little brighter Nakka other net as the back is a little dark 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.020
 I would like to put in a villa of the base oil treatment 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:02:01.040
 It feels good It 's a little while buying a section like this while taking a section king 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:04.060
 And along with you, it's a bit deeper and the colors come out better 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.190
 It is a 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:15.080
 I'm going to finish raising it 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.080
 I think that the impression is very different because it has a very soft atmosphere 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.700
 me
