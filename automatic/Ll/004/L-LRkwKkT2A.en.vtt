00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
for about 11 so I think when it comes to

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.930 
for about 11 so I think when it comes to
climbing<00:00:45.239> outside<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.980> competing<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.160> feel

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
climbing outside and competing I feel

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.630 
climbing outside and competing I feel
well<00:00:48.899> experienced<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.920> still<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> lot

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
well experienced but I still have a lot

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.350 
well experienced but I still have a lot
to<00:00:50.670> learn<00:00:51.050> I<00:00:52.129> like<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.250> learn<00:00:53.399> from<00:00:53.460> my<00:00:53.850> peers<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
to learn I like to learn from my peers I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.389 
to learn I like to learn from my peers I
think<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.780> better<00:00:55.079> than<00:00:55.320> any<00:00:55.500> coach<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.190> your

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
think that better than any coach is your

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.299 
think that better than any coach is your
friends<00:00:57.109> every<00:00:58.109> individual<00:00:58.649> kind<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.129> has

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
friends every individual kind of has

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.180 
friends every individual kind of has
some<00:00:59.730> facet<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.270> learn<00:01:00.570> from<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.160> you<00:01:02.160> can

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
some facet to learn from and you can

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.250 
some facet to learn from and you can
always<00:01:02.609> improve<00:01:02.789> your<00:01:03.090> weaknesses<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.840> well

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
always improve your weaknesses as well

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.710 
always improve your weaknesses as well
as<00:01:04.439> augment<00:01:04.979> your<00:01:05.159> strengths<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> think

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
as augment your strengths so I think

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.660 
as augment your strengths so I think
that<00:01:07.110> especially<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.950> climbing<00:01:08.369> which<00:01:08.520> is

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
that especially in climbing which is

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.030 
that especially in climbing which is
such<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.260> physically<00:01:10.260> demanding<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:10.770> also

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
such a physically demanding but also

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.880 
such a physically demanding but also
mentally<00:01:11.640> demanding<00:01:12.000> sport<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:13.320> important

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
mentally demanding sport it's important

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.249 
mentally demanding sport it's important
to<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.490> open<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.880> other<00:01:15.150> people's<00:01:15.570> criticism

Cups just for her a depth of experience

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.670 
Cups just for her a depth of experience
and<00:01:38.600> because<00:01:39.600> she<00:01:39.750> never<00:01:39.960> gives<00:01:40.170> up

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and because she never gives up

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.280 
and because she never gives up
she'll<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.280> struggling<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.360> competition<00:01:42.810> or

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
she'll be struggling in a competition or

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.789 
she'll be struggling in a competition or
some<00:01:44.159> some<00:01:44.850> move<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:46.020> Ricci<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.680> her

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
some some move is to Ricci for her

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.950 
some some move is to Ricci for her
because<00:01:47.040> she's<00:01:47.430> little

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
because she's little

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.020 
because she's little
she's<00:01:48.960> short<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.530> me<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.310> she<00:01:50.610> finds<00:01:50.850> her

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
she's short like me but she finds her

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.490 
she's short like me but she finds her
way<00:01:51.180> around<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.079> think<00:01:52.320> that's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
way around it and I think that's

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.700 
way around it and I think that's
inspiring<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.930> Chris<00:01:54.930> Sharma<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.350> also

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
inspiring I think Chris Sharma is also

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.690 
inspiring I think Chris Sharma is also
always<00:01:55.890> going<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.700> my<00:01:56.729> aunts

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700

on<00:02:57.459> grades<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.780> know<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.110> they're<00:02:59.260> just

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
on grades and to know that they're just

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.970

a<00:02:59.590> number<00:02:59.890> and<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.190> way<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.370> try<00:03:00.670> track<00:03:01.269> progress
