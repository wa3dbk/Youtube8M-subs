00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 on the clock 530 full readiness of all 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.790
 services 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.919
 Minsk metro begins to take 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.080
 first passengers even on the most 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.540
 Unloaded stations are already waiting for 5 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.519
 discoveries for metro employees 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.710
 the beginning of the movement of trains is just a point 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.690
 New day countdown work in the subway 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.340
 non-stop while the station is closed 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.439
 a team of employees are engaged 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.510
 preparatory work for us to be 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:32.460
 sure of safety and in the morning again 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:34.829
 heard the usual first time trains with 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.840
 end stations goes into 5 in 32 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.450
 traditional meets attendant 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.730
 subway stations know in the price of time and how 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.989
 I understand nowhere that coherence and accuracy 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.329
 security pledge 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.610
 and for the answer to the almost childish question where 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.010
 trains spend the night going to the decor 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.210
 the driver and you're already preparing for departure 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.670
 driver's attendance begins with the fact that he 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.680
 comes into the world for testimony not 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.660
 Labeled health requirements are very 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.910
 serious machinists are underground 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.589
 7 hours work requires marginal 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.360
 concentration and responsibility 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.140
 started comes pre-trip 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:15.740
 medical examination we give him a machine 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.740
 on checking how alcohol use 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.409
 measure blood pressure 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.610
 fillable route pre-trip here 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.860
 machinist signs in a journal 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.960
 even goes away if all is well machinists 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.880
 getting on the line first start on 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.680
 work before descending into 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.170
 crafts and will be about an hour 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.920
 preparatory work take place before 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.880
 on duty 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.810
 in the depot for acceptance of the composition find out what 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:50.189
 the composition of the department is according to 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.340
 instructions taking composition means after 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.920
 the composition adopted to prepare for 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.140
 exit signals on the line 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.670
 and the driver leaves on whether and starts 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.710
 work or not composition means 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.220
 make sure it is fully prepared for 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.110
 work 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.210
 this is not a simple formality manually 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.160
 every little thing is here 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.260
 constantly talking about accuracy in everything 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.430
 the slightest failure in work can lead to 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.220
 traffic collapse 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:22.810
 final stage 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:26.580
 with 100 will be able to go to the flight to the old 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.580
 feed heights carefully 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.230
 about a million passengers daily 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.790
 use metro services 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.100
 four and a half thousand people 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.290
 working so that every Minsk resident could with 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.330
 ease to get anywhere in the city 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.910
 the last train leaves the end 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.120
 stations in the private 2 and so there is still 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.280
 a lot of work important and responsible am 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.540
 in metro met I will lay out and check 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.540
