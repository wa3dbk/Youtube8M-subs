00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.120
 namaste i am is drive 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.800
 Welcome back to the tycoon game we have 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.929
 glory to air stoxx he is doing 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.990
 sales, but it was enough 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.699
 Maluccio was not well understood and I want to 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.029
 create a game today that it was 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.359
 suggested by goldman 98 and in both 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.680
 video i'm wrong and it's called ace with 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.050
 the capital letter is east and braida of course 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.750
 will be a space action for PC let's try 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.010
 this time to make a PC game that 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.680
 it will cost quite little 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.480
 and we see what it is 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.280
 maybe this will also have more sequels 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.579
 let's always do it with graphics 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:51.059
 2d and let's start developing it ok then 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:57.059
 will have little history will have so much much 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:01.379
 so much gameplay is an action and 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.480
 let's see what turns up so much 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.850
 I see technological design and technology 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.530
 are good is an action then dialogues 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.960
 there are none 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.480
 level design we put it high as well 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.290
 artificial intelligence 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:21.000
 yes we have 6 against 23 we are helping 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.390
 very good with design but with the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.800
 technology a little less and word design 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:34.020
 high bass sound and high graphics ok a 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.270
 apparently from a rumor company 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.050
 Japanese is called I invent that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.730
 will save the understanding he is thinking of doing 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.200
 starting a gaming console and a lot 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.550
 soon then very probably 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.750
 nes will arrive 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.930
 soon the intervention is not known 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.910
 for the arcade arcade game dink 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.890
 and the kings that would be donkey kong instead 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.930
 ok 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.020
 we will also try to develop nintendo 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.020
 maybe doing a lot of pennies 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.790
 been we see this game as it does not have 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.920
 very high expectations has a lot of 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.450
 bug then we wait to solve them 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.700
 before starting it all in the meantime 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.160
 glory tor soft that made 10 thousand 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.920
 almost 11 thousand copies with 76 thousand therefore 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.570
 unfortunately not so much gain we see 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.850
 if this space appeals to the public no 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:37.410
 then it is a 9 10 is not high at all 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.970
 But let's see what we combine it 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.410
 a good combo so we need it 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.350
 great gameplay we did 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.670
 we begin to do some levels 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.040
 practically everywhere except the sound e 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.080
 in engine that hasn't developed so much 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.850
 but meanwhile we are at level 2 of almost 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.200
 all by the way, I am level 2 too 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:03:03.440
 and let's leave the game 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:03.440
 let's see a little that comes from five 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:15.790
 4 however is a good space combination 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:18.969
 and action 3 even my mom who 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.030
 what bad that you guys are though 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.980
 meanwhile we can start a research e 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.510
 the search will be this engine like 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:32.400
 see we are at 50 so let's go as well 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.629
 with the engine and let's see what awaits us 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.739
 meanwhile which sales are not for 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.780
 nothing else so we have to do 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.169
 definitely something soon with the 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:45.189
 new engine especially here it is 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:47.560
 to arrive and the test was confirmed 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:50.139
 it would be nes nintendo entertainment 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.959
 system 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:55.599
 as you see very similar to 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.790
 actually the loader among other things mi 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.200
 would like to have one for me so if 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.400
 you have old consoles from da 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.400
 sending me would be very pleased 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.060
 we have completed the search for del 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.030
 taste main game engine 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.879
 so now we can create the engine 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:17.199
 let's see a little krait cost but game engine 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:19.419
 let's see how much it costs to do it costs 120 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.000
 mila do it we don't have this money but 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.550
 we can procure them shortly with with 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.500
 everything in this case practically 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.229
 we have the possibility to have the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.960
 better graphics and other things than 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:35.590
 we will see shortly more among the themes of 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:42.099
 research I still want to do a research e 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:44.979
 will be the racing theme so you have even more 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:47.470
 possibility of advising me to finish 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.180
 this is then we conclude the episode and there 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.320
 see you at the next episode of this 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.300
 tai game with ok we researched e 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.800
 we can also search for steering wheel 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:02.169
 so the device this time I think 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.570
 we immediately see exact resource gameplay 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:09.460
 we have the sterile that is practically is 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:12.790
 the the steering wheel to be able to play ok is with 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.230
 let's see this develop 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.490
 I should develop a game and when 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.740
 developed the game and gained 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.940
 little something 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.670
 I'll try to switch to 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.170
 to develop the new game engine on 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.120
 engine the game engine 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.860
 ok with this is all I recommend 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.900
 write in the comments below I am 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.780
 reading all the videos included also 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.630
 the previous ones are in fact there 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.700
 very good ideas in the previous videos 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.010
 so continue to vote all of them 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.020
 video so take a look at everyone 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.670
 put together with this is all there 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.320
 see you at the next game episode of 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:53.920
 tycon I am seen braidot namastÃ¨ i 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:56.020
 braves and just a moment we go on 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.230
 historical gaming we end with space 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.270
 for pc maybe even the fact that it was for 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.700
 pc however a little bit of profit 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.260
 we managed to do it and wanted to give 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.730
 also a look at glory to air stop ska 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.820
 ok he made us earn anyway 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.970
 30,000 not 70,000 as the prince of padua 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:16.890
 but we also tried on pc from 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.890
 must have had been brive
