00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.570
 welcome are like in this new 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.270
 tutorial we are going to teach you how to do 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.820
 edible water capsules is 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.170
 get with a verification that now 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.020
 it's being used a lot in the kitchen 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.400
 is modern and here what we are going to do 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.400
 is to specify a little water 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.279
 what we are going to need are two 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.230
 main ingredients that would be to 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.579
 end of sodium here we have it what 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.340
 we must get to try enough 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.590
 easy one gram and then five grams of 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.940
 calcium lactate then I'm going to 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.410
 be a little coloring dye 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.659
 edible we will use in any 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.269
 cake to see how they form 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:45.040
 bubbles below what are we going to 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.540
 need are three containers in this 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.230
 case one big plus or minus with ones 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.630
 four glasses of water 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.550
 another a little bit smaller that will have a 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.980
 glass of water and another that will be for 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.290
 stop the specification with water a 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.090
 little bit cold then we will also quote 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.250
 a minipimer like this 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.710
 and then also three spoons to be able 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.479
 catch the balls first of all 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.950
 let's do is take our 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.979
 smaller container that we only have 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.150
 a glass of water and what we are going to put 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.580
 it's sodium alginate 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.740
 we take our envelope open and we go to 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.720
 put about one gram 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.710
 in this case they are 2 grams so I'm going 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.710
 to put half of the envelope 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.500
 and now we will also add a couple of 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.830
 drops of dye to take a little 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.830
 of color 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.170
 and now what we are going to do is remove 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.170
 with our mini skin carefully 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.260
 once 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.710
 we have removed it we will wait 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.330
 about 15 minutes for the whole mixture 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.880
 look good together and do not remain 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.750
 bubbles 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.750
 well here we see that the mix is already 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.430
 without bubbles what we are going to do now 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.100
 is to put the touch of calcium here 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.630
 inside carefully we add and what 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.630
 we will remove everything very well 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.940
 until it has been totally 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.940
 dissolved I repeat these are 5 grams 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.380
 and we are going to remove it 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.150
 we wait a moment we see that down still 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.100
 you have to finish solving and 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.870
 dissolve let's keep stirring 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.190
 and now what we 're going to do is catch 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.190
 a little bit of the previous mix 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.300
 and let's look at so many small 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.450
 and we have a 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.900
 and we are going to do one more 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.880
 we will not let rest more or less 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.010
 about two minutes 23 minutes 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.880
 what we are going to do is remove with a 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.880
 little bit of care 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.670
 so that everything is well mixed 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.590
 without breaking the accounts of 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.060
 agreement 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.810
 here we can observe the bubbles as 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.810
 they are forming 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.030
 well we 're going to take it out and we've already 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.920
 taken one as you can see how it is 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.300
 to get it out what we have to do is 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.680
 very carefully we have 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.630
 tried to make it as round as possible 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.060
 for I know it's a bit complicated but 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.890
 The truth is that we see how it is 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.230
 to remove it recommends with 6 a 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.240
 soup spoon to be able to catch well 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:15.420
 the entire ball and prevent it from breaking 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.660
 we take it like that and now with care let's go 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.660
 taking out 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.660
 and if you go 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.660
 you will be able to see how 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.390
 there really is like a gelatinous ball 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.400
 that this would already be bottled water 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.920
 we look to get the most out of the liquid 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.460
 that we can and now to stop the 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.200
 attraction 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.490
 what we do is put it in the third 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.110
 container that has a little water 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.360
 water a little cold we throw it here 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.100
 then we have already stopped the reaction 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.680
 since there is one there is more quantity 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.800
 only of water and now we repeat the 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.659
 process we take care 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.300
 with the spoon when putting the coloring 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.770
 it really is a little simpler to see it 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.889
 since if I did not have colorant really 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.169
 it would be completely transparent 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.590
 invisible and we would have to go with 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.750
 quite more careful 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.910
 with this we can do a lot of things 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.460
 of cooking this is the spherification a 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.590
 pretty new kitchen and if you want to see 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.660
 cooking videos we also have our 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.340
 channel where we will try to do some 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.180
 recipes for you to see them and you can 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.180
 surprise some 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.970
 we see how it really looks 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.670
 it's very good and I'll put it in my 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.360
 hand 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:34.420
 and caretakers and here I have broken a 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.460
 little and has burst 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.740
 we see the 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.720
 and the idea 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.080
 we see here inside now 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.330
 liquid 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.659
 and this we can eat without problems 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.230
 let's try to get the third 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:52.620
 also very carefully 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.620
 we want 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.760
 do not 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.350
 yes 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.350
 good 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.759
 and this we're going to go back and try to catch it 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.740
 let's take care 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.699
 and here we have the result 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.889
 as we see it is very interesting only 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.210
 with these products that we can 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.940
 get online we can get to 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.949
 get this and this is totally 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.330
 common edible right now what 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:38.830
 we could take and it would be as if 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.129
 we were taking a little sip of 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.749
 Water 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:44.819
 but what we are going to do now 

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:47.069
 finish I repeat we have our channel 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:50.189
 kitchen where we have many dishes 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:52.289
 that we would like and if you want to see some 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:54.719
 some video related to the subject of 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:56.459
 the specification we will already do some in 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:57.779
 when we have a little time already 

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:59.789
 you will see that the 

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:01.529
 dishes nothing I hope you like and here 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:02.849
 As you can see, you have the link to be able to 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:04.979
 adhere to it 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:06.419
 so nothing, I'm going to show you how these 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:08.699
 errenteria we hope you liked it 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:10.889
 this video and if you liked it please 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:12.240
 from arlanda and share it in any 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.279
 comment that you do we will look 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.919
 to answer it let's see how it 

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:19.940
 bust and to see that inside 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:22.550
 it's all liquid 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.610
 we see how it has burst and here 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.889
 we're just staying with 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.210
 the outer part that is the reaction that 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:31.810
 have made the two products that we have 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.810
 thrown into the water 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:37.000
 thank you very much and until the next 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.000
 video
