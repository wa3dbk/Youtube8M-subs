00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
used a river sand base here and we're

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.519 
used a river sand base here and we're
going<00:00:27.520> to<00:00:27.550> cap<00:00:27.790> it<00:00:27.970> with<00:00:28.000> sea<00:00:28.270> shell<00:00:28.540> takes<00:00:29.439> a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
going to cap it with sea shell takes a

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.140 
going to cap it with sea shell takes a
little<00:00:29.650> bit<00:00:29.770> more<00:00:29.920> time<00:00:30.100> to<00:00:30.220> compact<00:00:30.610> it<00:00:30.820> but

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
little bit more time to compact it but

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.500 
little bit more time to compact it but
it's<00:00:32.140> a<00:00:32.410> you<00:00:32.770> know<00:00:32.800> substantially<00:00:33.579> less<00:00:34.030> cost

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
it's a you know substantially less cost

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.530 
it's a you know substantially less cost
which<00:00:34.780> is<00:00:34.870> why<00:00:34.990> a<00:00:35.020> lot<00:00:35.170> of<00:00:35.320> builders<00:00:35.560> use<00:00:35.740> it

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
which is why a lot of builders use it

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.240 
which is why a lot of builders use it
we<00:00:37.990> on<00:00:38.200> the<00:00:38.290> other<00:00:38.320> hand<00:00:38.440> will<00:00:38.710> use<00:00:38.830> seashell

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
we on the other hand will use seashell

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.460 
we on the other hand will use seashell
for<00:00:39.430> the<00:00:39.490> entire<00:00:39.760> yard<00:00:40.090> and<00:00:40.750> will<00:00:40.990> use<00:00:41.140> kind<00:00:41.380> of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
for the entire yard and will use kind of

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.870 
for the entire yard and will use kind of
a<00:00:41.530> mix<00:00:41.740> in<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.420> slap

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
a mix in the for the slap

what we've done is you've actually run a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.300 
what we've done is you've actually run a
perforated<00:00:57.600> pipe<00:00:57.810> in<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.230> dug<00:00:58.800> some<00:00:59.040> trenches

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
perforated pipe in and dug some trenches

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.450 
perforated pipe in and dug some trenches
into<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.820> or<00:00:59.910> some<00:01:00.060> swales<00:01:00.390> into<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.460> buried

that<00:01:02.610> perforated<00:01:02.970> pipe<00:01:03.360> in<00:01:03.630> stone<00:01:04.020> covered<00:01:04.890> it

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
that perforated pipe in stone covered it

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.710 
that perforated pipe in stone covered it
in<00:01:05.100> landscaping<00:01:05.670> cloth<00:01:05.910> and<00:01:06.360> now<00:01:06.540> we're

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
in landscaping cloth and now we're

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.440

the property as we showed you yesterday
and<00:01:31.530> also<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.980> we've<00:01:32.190> cut<00:01:32.370> that<00:01:32.400> Y<00:01:32.730> end<00:01:33.000> we're

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
and also to we've cut that Y end we're

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.940 
and also to we've cut that Y end we're
going<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> run<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.480> perimeter<00:01:33.810> drain<00:01:34.200> down

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
going to run a perimeter drain down

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.350 
going to run a perimeter drain down
beside<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.310> fence<00:01:35.610> line<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.060> put<00:01:36.240> in

here<00:01:36.540> because<00:01:36.660> our<00:01:36.930> elevation<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.440> going<00:01:37.560> to

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
here because our elevation is going to

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.770 
here because our elevation is going to
be<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> little<00:01:37.980> bit<00:01:38.070> higher<00:01:38.540> another<00:01:39.540> thing
