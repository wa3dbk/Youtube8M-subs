we<00:00:28.789> talked<00:00:29.419> about<00:00:29.569> diseases<00:00:32.290> this<00:00:33.290> is<00:00:33.500> free

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:33.769 
we talked about diseases this is free

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:36.099 
we talked about diseases this is free
tutoring<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:34.609> I<00:00:34.670> expect<00:00:35.210> everyone<00:00:35.629> to<00:00:35.899> be<00:00:35.960> on

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
tutoring so I expect everyone to be on

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:44.729 
tutoring so I expect everyone to be on
time<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:37.000> not<00:00:38.000> turn<00:00:38.390> into<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.960> session<00:00:43.480> so<00:00:44.480> I

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
time and not turn into the session so I

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.529 
time and not turn into the session so I
understand<00:00:45.739> that<00:00:46.190> everybody<00:00:46.760> is<00:00:46.969> trying<00:00:47.210> to

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
understand that everybody is trying to

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.630 
understand that everybody is trying to
learn<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:47.989> physics<00:00:48.469> right<00:00:48.679> now<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.280> we<00:00:49.489> are

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
learn the physics right now so we are

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.959 
learn the physics right now so we are
going<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:50.030> explain<00:00:50.629> how<00:00:51.050> do<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:51.969> electric

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
going to explain how do you electric

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.470 
going to explain how do you electric
fields<00:00:53.510> work<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:54.050> different<00:00:54.499> systems<00:00:55.480> in

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
fields work and different systems in

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.189 
fields work and different systems in
this<00:00:56.749> first<00:00:57.170> one<00:00:57.410> you<00:00:57.620> see<00:00:57.920> there<00:00:58.219> are<00:00:59.199> usually

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
this first one you see there are usually

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.770 
this first one you see there are usually
when<00:01:00.769> you<00:01:00.890> are<00:01:01.100> trying<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.609> describe<00:01:01.999> electric

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
when you are trying to describe electric

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.160 
when you are trying to describe electric
field<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:03.620> want<00:01:03.859> to<00:01:04.129> look<00:01:04.909> at<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.900> positive

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
field you want to look at the positive

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.370 
field you want to look at the positive
in<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.860> negative<00:01:07.430> place<00:01:07.850> meter<00:01:08.330> to<00:01:08.660> brass

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
in the negative place meter to brass

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.800 
in the negative place meter to brass
place<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.160> the<00:01:10.310> negative<00:01:11.000> fields<00:01:11.480> we<00:01:11.600> go<00:01:11.630> to

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
place and the negative fields we go to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.720 
place and the negative fields we go to
go<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:12.200> way<00:01:12.410> we<00:01:12.710> can<00:01:12.740> understand<00:01:13.550> the

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
go this way we can understand the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.730 
go this way we can understand the
direction<00:01:13.910> of<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.510> electric<00:01:14.570> field<00:01:15.230> we<00:01:15.470> think

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
direction of the electric field we think

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.120 
direction of the electric field we think
of<00:01:15.860> it<00:01:16.010> in<00:01:16.160> the<00:01:16.280> terms<00:01:16.610> of<00:01:16.940> you<00:01:17.770> every<00:01:18.770> point

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
of it in the terms of you every point

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.640 
of it in the terms of you every point
charge<00:01:19.550> we<00:01:19.880> put<00:01:20.120> a<00:01:20.150> twin<00:01:20.540> charge<00:01:20.900> in<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.320> field

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
charge we put a twin charge in the field

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.340 
charge we put a twin charge in the field
nest<00:01:22.100> this<00:01:22.490> is<00:01:25.450> negligible<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.810> power<00:01:27.080> of<00:01:27.320> the

nest this is negligible the power of the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.350 
nest this is negligible the power of the
point<00:01:27.740> charge<00:01:28.100> but<00:01:28.400> it's<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.730> point<00:01:29.060> charge

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360

point charge but it's the point charge
is<00:01:29.510> always<00:01:29.840> positive<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:31.580> positive<00:01:31.850> is

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
is always positive the positive is

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.630 
is always positive the positive is
attracted<00:01:33.260> to<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.410> negative<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.250> we<00:01:34.370> scored

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
attracted to the negative so we scored

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.290 
attracted to the negative so we scored
to<00:01:34.700> want<00:01:34.910> to<00:01:35.000> go<00:01:35.180> to<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.450> z-<00:01:36.490> so<00:01:37.490> but<00:01:37.820> it's<00:01:38.060> very

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
to want to go to a z- so but it's very

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.690 
to want to go to a z- so but it's very
different<00:01:38.720> between<00:01:39.730> plates<00:01:40.730> and<00:01:41.150> in<00:01:41.780> 22

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
different between plates and in 22

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.150 
different between plates and in 22
points<00:01:43.700> did<00:01:44.360> our<00:01:44.540> challenge<00:01:45.080> because<00:01:45.980> the

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
points did our challenge because the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.060 
points did our challenge because the
place<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.730> electric<00:01:47.270> field<00:01:47.630> is<00:01:47.930> parallel<00:01:48.320> to

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
place the electric field is parallel to

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.120 
place the electric field is parallel to
the<00:01:49.850> 2d<00:01:51.940> 2d<00:01:52.940> place<00:01:53.300> but<00:01:54.080> over<00:01:54.440> here<00:01:54.710> in<00:01:54.980> the

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
the 2d 2d place but over here in the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.130 
the 2d 2d place but over here in the
plate<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:56.630> two<00:01:57.370> are<00:01:58.390> from<00:01:59.390> this<00:01:59.690> point<00:01:59.960> to

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
plate you two are from this point to

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.920 
plate you two are from this point to
deepen<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:01.000> because<00:02:02.000> when<00:02:02.180> it<00:02:02.330> leaves<00:02:02.600> each

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
deepen it because when it leaves each

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.850 
deepen it because when it leaves each
other<00:02:03.200> is<00:02:03.380> always<00:02:03.830> perfect

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
other is always perfect

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.910 
other is always perfect
