anything<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:24.030> excitement<00:01:24.689> every<00:01:25.350> time<00:01:25.530> he

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
anything is excitement every time he

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.560 
anything is excitement every time he
touches<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.040> ball<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.939> people<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
touches the ball the the people in the
