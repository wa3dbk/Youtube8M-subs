and I had this whole rant
it's<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.150> calculus<00:01:12.990> cannot<00:01:13.680> draft<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.250> into

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
it's like calculus cannot draft you into

the military insignia war Spanish class
cannot<00:01:17.250> execute<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.150> only<00:01:19.080> government<00:01:19.680> can

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
cannot execute you only government can

cannot execute you only government can
do<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.729> sails<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.270> teachings<00:01:22.130> 1/3

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
do that so it sails like teachings 1/3

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.240 
do that so it sails like teachings 1/3
sails<00:01:23.540> 1/3<00:01:24.540> performance-art<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:25.740> 1/3

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
