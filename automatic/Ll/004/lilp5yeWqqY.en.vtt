a waterproofing of high vent 2.5

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.770 
a waterproofing of high vent 2.5
it's<00:00:15.550> a<00:00:15.640> slight<00:00:15.910> improvement<00:00:15.940> of<00:00:16.600> the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
storm flap as well at the front so it

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.180 
storm flap as well at the front so it
offers<00:01:59.080> some<00:01:59.260> wind<00:01:59.530> protection<00:01:59.680> and

waterproofing as well and this is

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.260 
waterproofing as well and this is
absolutely<00:02:02.650> chucking<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.220> down<00:02:03.250> but<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.150> know

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
absolutely chucking it down but you know

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.460 
absolutely chucking it down but you know
that's<00:02:04.540> definitely<00:02:04.870> going<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:05.080> do<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.260> job

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
that's definitely going to do the job

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.590 
that's definitely going to do the job
and<00:02:05.830> yet<00:02:06.010> again<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.670> can<00:02:06.850> zip<00:02:07.090> them<00:02:07.210> up<00:02:07.330> and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
and yet again you can zip them up and

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.819 
and yet again you can zip them up and
away<00:02:08.469> you<00:02:08.499> go

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:08.829

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
basically that keeps everything nice

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.569 
basically that keeps everything nice
safe<00:02:10.629> and<00:02:10.840> secure<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.469> there<00:02:11.650> at<00:02:12.129> the<00:02:12.249> bottom

well so yet again just like the elastic
at<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.010> bottom<00:03:25.360> pretty<00:03:26.360> much<00:03:26.600> this<00:03:26.840> just<00:03:27.080> to

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
at the bottom pretty much this just to

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.350 
at the bottom pretty much this just to
help<00:03:27.380> you<00:03:27.620> reduce<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.160> windchill<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.880> also

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
help you reduce the windchill and also

help you reduce the windchill and also
means<00:03:29.600> you<00:03:29.780> can<00:03:29.960> tighten<00:03:30.410> up<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:31.610> jacket

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
a reduction from the wind chill as well

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.850 
a reduction from the wind chill as well
as<00:03:56.090> keeping<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.630> know<00:03:56.750> keeping<00:03:57.380> you<00:03:57.500> dry<00:03:57.650> as

as keeping you know keeping you dry as
well<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.190> that<00:03:58.280> covers<00:03:58.610> completely<00:03:59.240> the

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
visit completely so that should prevent

any water from getting in obviously on

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.340 
any water from getting in obviously on
the<00:04:03.620> inside<00:04:03.980> it's<00:04:04.760> just<00:04:05.030> your<00:04:05.350> standard

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
the inside it's just your standard

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.650 
the inside it's just your standard
standard<00:04:07.250> layout<00:04:07.550> there<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:07.940> they<00:04:08.360> haven't

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
standard layout there and they haven't

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.210 
standard layout there and they haven't
put<00:04:08.780> any<00:04:08.959> mesh<00:04:09.230> in<00:04:09.410> there<00:04:09.560> they<00:04:09.680> try<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:09.950> keep

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
put any mesh in there they try to keep

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.820 
put any mesh in there they try to keep
it<00:04:10.340> as<00:04:10.430> close<00:04:10.700> contact<00:04:11.270> as<00:04:11.480> possible<00:04:11.830> well

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
it as close contact as possible well

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.530 
it as close contact as possible well
this<00:04:13.400> really<00:04:13.670> is<00:04:13.910> just<00:04:13.940> for<00:04:14.480> the

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
this really is just for the

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.810 
this really is just for the
breathability<00:04:14.930> factor<00:04:15.770> because<00:04:16.549> you<00:04:16.640> don't

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
breathability factor because you don't

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.360 
breathability factor because you don't
have<00:04:16.970> that<00:04:17.090> mesh<00:04:17.359> paneling<00:04:17.900> now<00:04:18.140> in<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:19.160> first

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
have that mesh paneling now in the first

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.740 
have that mesh paneling now in the first
place<00:04:19.609> means<00:04:19.880> it's<00:04:20.209> going<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:20.420> reduce<00:04:20.540> the

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
place means it's going to reduce the

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.210 
place means it's going to reduce the
risk<00:04:21.080> of<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:21.290> actual<00:04:21.530> jacket<00:04:21.950> itself

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
risk of the actual jacket itself

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.010 
risk of the actual jacket itself
sticking<00:04:22.790> to<00:04:22.970> you<00:04:23.090> so<00:04:23.270> if<00:04:23.360> you<00:04:23.479> are<00:04:23.630> doing<00:04:23.840> a

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
sticking to you so if you are doing a

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.250 
sticking to you so if you are doing a
lot<00:04:24.140> of<00:04:24.169> activities<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:25.150> you

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
lot of activities and you

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.600 
lot of activities and you
is<00:04:26.380> definitely<00:04:26.530> going<00:04:27.040> to<00:04:27.070> be<00:04:27.190> one<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:27.520> look

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
is definitely going to be one to look

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.460 
is definitely going to be one to look
out<00:04:27.760> for<00:04:28.000> also<00:04:28.570> they've<00:04:28.810> collaborated<00:04:29.170> on

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
out for also they've collaborated on

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.720 
out for also they've collaborated on
they've<00:04:29.680> pretty<00:04:29.860> much<00:04:29.920> just<00:04:30.220> sealed<00:04:30.610> the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
they've pretty much just sealed the

air and then away you go and it's just

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.790 
air and then away you go and it's just
as<00:05:44.500> simple<00:05:44.530> as<00:05:44.920> zipping<00:05:45.250> it<00:05:45.370> up<00:05:46.230> and<00:05:47.230> away<00:05:47.770> you

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
as simple as zipping it up and away you

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.130 
as simple as zipping it up and away you
go<00:05:47.950> and<00:05:48.340> get<00:05:49.030> again<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:49.450> way<00:05:49.570> that<00:05:49.810> it's<00:05:49.930> got<00:05:50.110> a

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
go and get again the way that it's got a

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.900 
go and get again the way that it's got a
storm<00:05:50.470> flap<00:05:50.620> on<00:05:50.890> the<00:05:50.980> side<00:05:51.190> there<00:05:51.460> so<00:05:51.640> it<00:05:51.790> keeps

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
storm flap on the side there so it keeps

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.790 
storm flap on the side there so it keeps
everything<00:05:52.450> nice<00:05:52.780> and<00:05:52.840> water<00:05:53.380> proofing

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
everything nice and water proofing

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.280 
everything nice and water proofing
water-resistant<00:05:54.610> as<00:05:54.730> well<00:05:55.120> so<00:05:55.750> obviously

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
water-resistant as well so obviously

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.830 
water-resistant as well so obviously
earlier<00:05:56.740> I<00:05:56.800> mentioned<00:05:56.980> about<00:05:57.370> the<00:05:57.520> collar<00:05:57.840> now

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
earlier I mentioned about the collar now

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.200 
earlier I mentioned about the collar now
this<00:05:58.960> works<00:05:59.230> really<00:05:59.410> well<00:05:59.680> with<00:06:00.040> the<00:06:00.280> hood<00:06:00.520> so

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
this works really well with the hood so

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.790 
this works really well with the hood so
as<00:06:01.300> you<00:06:01.390> can<00:06:01.480> see<00:06:01.540> as<00:06:01.810> a<00:06:01.840> standard<00:06:02.320> as<00:06:02.440> it<00:06:02.470> hoods

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
as you can see as a standard as it hoods

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.980 
as you can see as a standard as it hoods
you've<00:06:03.130> got<00:06:03.340> the<00:06:03.580> peak<00:06:03.790> as<00:06:04.030> well<00:06:04.240> so<00:06:04.540> basically

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
you've got the peak as well so basically

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.960 
you've got the peak as well so basically
stops<00:06:05.680> the<00:06:05.890> actual<00:06:06.130> hood<00:06:06.250> from<00:06:06.370> doing<00:06:06.640> this

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
stops the actual hood from doing this

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.360 
stops the actual hood from doing this
so<00:06:07.870> in<00:06:07.990> the<00:06:08.110> rain<00:06:08.260> you<00:06:08.380> can<00:06:08.500> actually<00:06:08.650> see

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
so in the rain you can actually see

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.590 
so in the rain you can actually see
where<00:06:09.550> you're<00:06:09.700> going<00:06:09.820> so<00:06:10.030> you<00:06:10.150> can<00:06:10.270> see<00:06:10.420> where

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
where you're going so you can see where

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.300 
where you're going so you can see where
you've<00:06:10.690> been<00:06:10.870> where<00:06:11.440> you<00:06:11.620> are<00:06:11.650> and<00:06:12.010> where

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
you've been where you are and where

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.500 
you've been where you are and where
you're<00:06:12.400> going<00:06:12.580> to<00:06:12.640> be<00:06:12.730> going<00:06:12.880> so<00:06:13.150> it<00:06:13.240> gives<00:06:13.390> you

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
you're going to be going so it gives you

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.930 
you're going to be going so it gives you
all<00:06:13.570> good<00:06:13.930> round<00:06:14.140> vision<00:06:14.500> as<00:06:15.280> I<00:06:15.430> say<00:06:15.610> it<00:06:15.730> works

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
all good round vision as I say it works

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.750 
all good round vision as I say it works
really<00:06:16.210> well<00:06:16.300> having<00:06:17.290> it<00:06:17.620> all<00:06:17.800> tucked<00:06:18.250> inside

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
really well having it all tucked inside

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.100 
really well having it all tucked inside
maybe<00:06:19.030> the<00:06:19.210> shooters<00:06:19.540> role<00:06:19.750> it's<00:06:19.900> going<00:06:20.050> to

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
maybe the shooters role it's going to

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.900 
maybe the shooters role it's going to
reduce<00:06:20.230> the<00:06:20.560> wind<00:06:20.770> chills<00:06:21.040> to<00:06:21.580> pull<00:06:21.790> the

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
reduce the wind chills to pull the

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.150 
reduce the wind chills to pull the
troubles<00:06:22.300> on<00:06:22.480> the<00:06:22.570> side<00:06:22.810> there<00:06:23.170> and<00:06:23.440> then<00:06:24.010> you

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
troubles on the side there and then you

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.610 
troubles on the side there and then you
also<00:06:24.370> have<00:06:24.730> a<00:06:24.760> toggle<00:06:25.060> on<00:06:25.390> the<00:06:25.510> back<00:06:25.690> there<00:06:25.990> and

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
also have a toggle on the back there and

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.710 
also have a toggle on the back there and
that<00:06:26.770> basically<00:06:27.190> shrinks<00:06:27.730> the<00:06:27.910> UM<00:06:28.090> the<00:06:28.570> hood

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
that basically shrinks the UM the hood

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.660 
that basically shrinks the UM the hood
itself<00:06:29.050> and<00:06:29.410> it<00:06:29.560> basically<00:06:29.740> enables<00:06:30.280> it<00:06:30.640> to

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:30.670 
itself and it basically enables it to

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.280 
itself and it basically enables it to
actually<00:06:31.090> fit<00:06:31.390> and<00:06:31.570> move<00:06:31.780> with<00:06:31.990> your<00:06:32.110> head

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
actually fit and move with your head

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.930 
actually fit and move with your head
someone<00:06:32.980> that<00:06:33.160> sort<00:06:33.340> of<00:06:33.400> done<00:06:33.520> up<00:06:33.640> to<00:06:33.850> you

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
someone that sort of done up to you

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.640 
someone that sort of done up to you
obviously<00:06:34.030> your<00:06:34.390> specification<00:06:35.140> the<00:06:35.500> hood

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
obviously your specification the hood

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.839 
obviously your specification the hood
itself<00:06:36.330> will<00:06:37.330> move

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
itself will move

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:39.189 
itself will move
with<00:06:37.969> you<00:06:38.119> rather<00:06:38.330> than<00:06:38.569> its<00:06:38.719> say<00:06:38.869> in<00:06:38.929> doing

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 
with you rather than its say in doing

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:42.219 
with you rather than its say in doing

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:42.229 
this so there you go

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:43.749 
this so there you go
