00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.830 

okay<00:03:08.580> i<00:03:08.610> thought<00:03:08.940> i<00:03:09.000> had<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.240> needle<00:03:09.480> chart

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
okay i thought i had a needle chart

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.870 
okay i thought i had a needle chart
right<00:03:10.170> there<00:03:11.990> don't<00:03:12.990> see<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.320> needle<00:03:13.650> chart<00:03:13.950> i

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.120 

believe<00:03:17.880> it<00:03:18.000> will<00:03:18.060> use<00:03:18.270> up<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.600> 21<00:03:19.080> if<00:03:19.590> not<00:03:19.860> it

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
believe it will use up to a 21 if not it

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.690 
believe it will use up to a 21 if not it
will<00:03:20.280> use<00:03:20.490> at<00:03:20.820> least<00:03:20.850> up<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.300> an<00:03:21.540> 18<00:03:21.990> i<00:03:22.700> will

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
will use at least up to an 18 i will

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.460 
will use at least up to an 18 i will
find<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.120> information<00:03:24.420> out<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.290> will

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
find that information out and that will

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:33.520 
find that information out and that will
be<00:03:26.120> in<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.270> description

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.500 

because<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.590> know<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.860> 201<00:03:35.340> we<00:03:35.490> use<00:03:35.610> up<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:35.970> 21

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
because I know the 201 we use up to a 21

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.010 
because I know the 201 we use up to a 21
so<00:03:37.050> I'm<00:03:37.140> guessing<00:03:37.350> this<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.860> same<00:03:39.020> anyway

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
so I'm guessing this is the same anyway

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.380 
so I'm guessing this is the same anyway
