like and and how is that feels now like
endless<00:00:11.280> test<00:00:11.670> so<00:00:11.910> we're<00:00:12.090> we've<00:00:12.690> got<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
endless test so we're we've got the

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.470 
endless test so we're we've got the
system<00:00:13.349> going<00:00:13.590> on<00:00:13.710> we're<00:00:14.370> we're<00:00:15.000> testing<00:00:15.360> with

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
system going on we're we're testing with

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.960 
system going on we're we're testing with
cars<00:00:15.719> we're<00:00:15.990> putting<00:00:16.369> charts<00:00:17.369> pod<00:00:17.550> battery

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
cars we're putting charts pod battery

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.400 
cars we're putting charts pod battery
switch<00:00:18.150> stations<00:00:18.390> all<00:00:18.810> over<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.080> country

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
switch stations all over the country

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.870 
switch stations all over the country
we're<00:00:19.560> doing<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:19.890> Israel<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.490> Denmark

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
we're doing it in Israel and in Denmark

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.460 
we're doing it in Israel and in Denmark
and<00:00:21.390> then<00:00:21.510> Australia<00:00:21.900> will<00:00:22.170> come<00:00:22.320> right

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
and then Australia will come right

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.710 
and then Australia will come right
behind<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.890> shy<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.029> guys<00:00:24.210> are<00:00:24.359> different

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
behind that shy you guys are different

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.540 
behind that shy you guys are different
because<00:00:24.810> you're<00:00:25.199> actually<00:00:25.439> kind<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.130> selling

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
because you're actually kind of selling

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.519 
because you're actually kind of selling
electric<00:00:27.060> mile<00:00:27.269> vehicles<00:00:27.869> as<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.170> would<00:00:28.349> sell

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
electric mile vehicles as you would sell

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.140 
electric mile vehicles as you would sell
kind<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.890> minutes<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.730> very<00:00:29.760> different

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
kind of minutes so it's a very different

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.359 
kind of minutes so it's a very different
profit<00:00:30.720> model<00:00:30.929> how<00:00:31.769> do<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.949> why<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.279> think

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
profit model how do you why do you think

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.770 
profit model how do you why do you think
that<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.700> profit<00:00:33.149> model<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.510> going<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.690> be

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that this profit model is going to be

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.120 
that this profit model is going to be
sustainable<00:00:34.260> versus<00:00:34.649> what<00:00:34.860> we're<00:00:35.010> seeing

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
sustainable versus what we're seeing

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.470 
sustainable versus what we're seeing
with<00:00:35.219> other<00:00:35.489> automakers<00:00:36.149> where<00:00:36.360> they're

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
with other automakers where they're

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.910 
with other automakers where they're
creating<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.260> hybrid<00:00:37.829> electric

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
creating you know hybrid electric

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.549 
creating you know hybrid electric
vehicles<00:00:38.489> or<00:00:38.730> full<00:00:39.059> electric<00:00:39.420> vehicles<00:00:39.840> why

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
vehicles or full electric vehicles why

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.990 
vehicles or full electric vehicles why
do<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.680> think<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.010> infrastructure<00:00:41.700> and

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
do you think the infrastructure and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.880 
do you think the infrastructure and
really<00:00:42.420> basically<00:00:42.840> renting<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> batteries

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
really basically renting the batteries

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.880 
really basically renting the batteries
is<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> work<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.940> we've<00:00:45.680> analyzed<00:00:46.680> that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
is going to work but we've analyzed that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.920 
is going to work but we've analyzed that
the<00:00:47.219> consumers<00:00:47.700> will<00:00:47.879> simply<00:00:48.239> not<00:00:48.270> buy<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> card

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the consumers will simply not buy a card

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.630 
the consumers will simply not buy a card
that<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.200> more<00:00:49.350> expensive<00:00:49.530> than<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.340> average

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
that is more expensive than the average

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.700 
that is more expensive than the average
gasoline<00:00:50.850> car<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.809> had<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.140> reduce<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
gasoline car so you had to reduce the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.170 
gasoline car so you had to reduce the
price<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> consumer<00:00:53.340> when<00:00:53.850> they<00:00:53.969> buy<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
price to the consumer when they buy the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.660 
price to the consumer when they buy the
car<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.780> whereas<00:00:55.500> everybody<00:00:56.070> else<00:00:56.250> said<00:00:56.520> you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
car and whereas everybody else said you

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.040 
car and whereas everybody else said you
got<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.820> pay<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> bit<00:00:57.210> more<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.600> green<00:00:57.870> we

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
got to pay a bit more to be green we

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.510 
got to pay a bit more to be green we
said<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.379> actually<00:00:58.649> need<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.920> pay<00:00:59.070> less<00:00:59.309> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
said you actually need to pay less to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.400 
said you actually need to pay less to
tip<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> entire<00:01:00.120> market<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:01.079> took<00:01:01.230> the

tip the entire market we took the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.470 
tip the entire market we took the
battery<00:01:01.770> out<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.100> equation<00:01:02.430> by<00:01:02.820> buying

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
battery out of the equation by buying

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.570 
battery out of the equation by buying
the<00:01:03.629> battery<00:01:03.930> ourselves<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.979> don't<00:01:05.129> rent<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the battery ourselves we don't rent the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.670 
the battery ourselves we don't rent the
battery<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:05.970> what<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:07.320> sell<00:01:07.560> you

of<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.440> market<00:02:58.530> but<00:02:58.799> one<00:02:58.920> person<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.250> still<00:02:59.430> a

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
of the market but one person is still a

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.970 
of the market but one person is still a
lot<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.150> vehicles<00:03:00.450> when<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.500> talk<00:03:01.709> about<00:03:01.739> a

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
lot of vehicles when you talk about a

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.410 
lot of vehicles when you talk about a
global<00:03:02.370> perspective<00:03:02.489> why<00:03:03.000> do<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.150> think<00:03:03.299> you

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
global perspective why do you think you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.780 
global perspective why do you think you
can<00:03:03.600> do<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.750> well<00:03:04.350> we've<00:03:05.070> taken<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.519> very

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
can do it well we've taken a very

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.520 
can do it well we've taken a very
different<00:03:06.209> approach<00:03:06.269> than<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:07.200> other<00:03:07.380> guys

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
different approach than the other guys

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.170 
different approach than the other guys
and<00:03:07.769> says<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.130> we<00:03:08.250> didn't<00:03:08.519> go<00:03:08.670> after<00:03:08.850> the

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
and says that we didn't go after the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.030 
and says that we didn't go after the
segment<00:03:09.570> that<00:03:09.690> is<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.989> short<00:03:10.290> this
