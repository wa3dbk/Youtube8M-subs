compared to the fourth generation have

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.879 
compared to the fourth generation have
the<00:02:26.239> same<00:02:26.480> screen<00:02:26.840> size<00:02:28.299> same<00:02:29.299> screen<00:02:32.049> so<00:02:33.049> this

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:33.889 
the same screen size same screen so this

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:38.199 
the same screen size same screen so this
has<00:02:34.159> a<00:02:34.189> touch<00:02:35.000> will<00:02:35.329> the<00:02:35.750> click<00:02:35.989> wheel<00:02:37.209> with

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
has a touch will the click wheel with

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.170 
has a touch will the click wheel with
the<00:02:38.359> buttons<00:02:38.719> and<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:39.049> is<00:02:39.230> all<00:02:39.379> capacitive

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
the buttons and this is all capacitive

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.330 
the buttons and this is all capacitive
which<00:02:41.180> in<00:02:41.329> my<00:02:41.420> opinion<00:02:41.569> I<00:02:41.870> think<00:02:41.900> they

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
which in my opinion I think they

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.390 
which in my opinion I think they
downgraded<00:02:44.230> when<00:02:45.230> they<00:02:45.439> add<00:02:45.919> the<00:02:46.129> click<00:02:46.370> wheel

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
downgraded when they add the click wheel

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.979 
downgraded when they add the click wheel
of<00:02:47.329> course<00:02:48.579> it<00:02:49.579> could<00:02:49.730> have<00:02:49.819> been<00:02:49.909> a<00:02:49.989> upside

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
of course it could have been a upside

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.349 
of course it could have been a upside
for<00:02:51.169> some<00:02:51.379> people<00:02:51.739> some<00:02:52.579> people<00:02:52.639> prefer<00:02:53.120> the
