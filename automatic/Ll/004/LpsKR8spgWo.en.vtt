00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.939
 urania astronomy and astronautics newsletter edited by the institute 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:06.200
 national astrophysicist 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.200
 benritrovati from luca nobili and elena lazzaretto 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:14.369
 the habitable planets could be billions and the new estimate emerged from a 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.310
 meeting of experts that took place a few days ago honolulu in 

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:21.640
 which sums have been drawn about the discoveries of recent years 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.540
 the conclusion is that our house is almost certainly not a rare case 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.079
 the universe 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.109
 at the moment there are 200 36 planets known in orbit around others 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.059
 almost all stars of the gas giant type one in particular did 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.760
 jump of the series to the scientists as opposed to his brothers who in 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.140
 practice can be seen as giant spheres of gavassa this if 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.519
 instead completely covered with water and water is the fundamental ingredient 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.230
 for the development of life forms 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.800
 in the coming years the advent of new generation telescopes there 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.070
 will lead to identifying keep even the smallest eruption you for now 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.050
 the current telescopes escape and then we risk losing the account only 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.090
 in our galaxy there are 200 billion stars in the universe there 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.600
 are hundreds of billions of galaxies 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.369
 somewhere there will also be stars with planets similar to ours 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.660
 just find them 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.120
 and let us now turn to brief news 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.430
 only dedicated satellite grace the study of the sun could be identified 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.780
 some radio signals closely related to solar missions responsible for 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.840
 magnetic storms missions occur when the sun expels into the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.200
 space billions of tons of electrically charged particles 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.120
 speed of millions of kilometers per hour if directed towards the earth 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.000
 interact with our magnetic field causing the storms of 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.120
 radiation 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.930
 this kind of phenomena can damage harmful satellites 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.450
 badly to the health of astronauts not adequately protected and cause 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.610
 discomfort even on the ground 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.170
 now intercepting the radio signals preceding these events will be possible 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.950
 to foresee in time to limit the damages 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.560
 using telescopes in lite silk some telescopes a group of researchers is 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.829
 managed to determine the properties of a very particular copy of stars 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:20.290
 they are both very bright massive and very close to each other just a sixth 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.930
 of the average distance between the earth and the sun reserve diffuse actions allow to do 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.299
 predictions about their fate given the extreme closeness it is believed that between 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.549
 about a million years begins a process that will bring them together 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.039
 form one big star 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:40.689
 in chains white-space tele scotto h will be launched in 2013 will be the 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:46.209
 successor to the space telescope appropriates in space at 1,500,000 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.079
 kilometers of the earth go to 4 times the distance that separates us from the moon 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.279
 at first it was established that the telescope would not use the 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:58.669
 time of any kind of maintenance 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:04.059
 now instead the home announced by making small changes the jeans looks will be 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:07.679
 able to allow service satellites to attack 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:11.179
 urania stupid appointment to the next edition baby remember that 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:12.810
 you can find more news 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.569
