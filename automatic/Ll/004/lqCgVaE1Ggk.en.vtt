tournaments before that yeah

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.929 
tournaments before that yeah
particularly<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.860> example<00:01:18.310> of<00:01:18.430> Switzerland

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
particularly the example of Switzerland

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.149 
particularly the example of Switzerland
it's<00:01:19.390> quite<00:01:19.810> startling<00:01:20.380> there<00:01:20.530> two<00:01:20.740> results

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
it's quite startling there two results

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.039 
it's quite startling there two results
in<00:01:21.280> October<00:01:21.880> for<00:01:22.299> example<00:01:22.689> although<00:01:22.810> there

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
in October for example although there

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.929 
in October for example although there
were<00:01:23.110> two<00:01:23.259> qualifiers<00:01:23.860> they<00:01:24.610> were<00:01:24.670> worth

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
were two qualifiers they were worth

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.990 
were two qualifiers they were worth
seven<00:01:25.540> places<00:01:26.110> in<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.560> FIFA<00:01:26.770> ranking<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:27.790> they

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
seven places in the FIFA ranking so they

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.700 
seven places in the FIFA ranking so they
went<00:01:28.180> from<00:01:28.270> somewhere<00:01:28.659> in<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.840> mid-teens<00:01:29.259> and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
went from somewhere in the mid-teens and

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.800 
went from somewhere in the mid-teens and
just<00:01:30.280> because<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.670> beat<00:01:30.820> Slovakia<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.689> the

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
just because the beat Slovakia and the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.690 
just because the beat Slovakia and the
beat<00:01:31.960> Albania<00:01:32.470> all<00:01:32.650> of<00:01:33.009> a<00:01:33.070> sudden<00:01:33.369> that<00:01:33.460> gives

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
beat Albania all of a sudden that gives

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.010 
beat Albania all of a sudden that gives
them<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.909> right<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.210> compete<00:01:34.540> at<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:34.780> World<00:01:34.930> Cup

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
them a right to compete at the World Cup

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.620 
them a right to compete at the World Cup
as<00:01:35.259> a<00:01:35.290> top<00:01:35.560> seed<00:01:35.799> for<00:01:35.979> me<00:01:36.390> something<00:01:37.390> a<00:01:37.420> little
