snowstorm here is the view from our
backyard<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:12.090> can<00:00:12.300> see<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.870> snow<00:00:13.110> is

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
backyard you can see that the snow is

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.919 
backyard you can see that the snow is
about<00:00:13.620> approximately<00:00:14.250> two<00:00:15.179> up<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.719> two<00:00:15.900> feet

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
about approximately two up to two feet

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.279 
about approximately two up to two feet
and<00:00:16.470> sometimes<00:00:17.130> three<00:00:17.940> feet<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.510> certain

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
and sometimes three feet in certain

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.269 
and sometimes three feet in certain
areas<00:00:19.670> resulting<00:00:20.670> primarily<00:00:21.600> from<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.680> drift

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
areas resulting primarily from the drift

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.009 
areas resulting primarily from the drift
of<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> snow<00:00:24.529> it<00:00:25.529> was<00:00:25.830> extremely<00:00:26.369> windy<00:00:27.029> one

of the snow it was extremely windy one

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.250 
of the snow it was extremely windy one
can<00:00:28.320> see<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.970> snow<00:00:31.250> being<00:00:32.930> shifted<00:00:33.930> from<00:00:34.200> one

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
can see the snow being shifted from one

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.459 
can see the snow being shifted from one
place<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.829> another<00:00:35.690> because<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> horrific

place to another because of the horrific

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.650 
place to another because of the horrific
wind<00:00:38.570> that<00:00:39.570> was<00:00:39.899> blowing<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.620> snow<00:00:41.390> here<00:00:42.390> it

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
wind that was blowing the snow here it

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.020 
wind that was blowing the snow here it
covers<00:00:43.280> approximately<00:00:45.320> one<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.710> two<00:00:47.190> feet<00:00:47.399> in

will see it is even higher where the
