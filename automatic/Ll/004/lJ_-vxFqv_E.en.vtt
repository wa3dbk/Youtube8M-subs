00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
can just shine some light on some things

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.869 
can just shine some light on some things
so<00:00:32.509> when<00:00:33.110> I<00:00:33.410> start<00:00:33.860> my<00:00:33.980> burst<00:00:34.220> out<00:00:34.460> what<00:00:34.640> I<00:00:34.670> like

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
so when I start my burst out what I like

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.640 
so when I start my burst out what I like
to<00:00:35.030> do<00:00:35.180> is<00:00:35.420> I<00:00:35.600> get<00:00:35.750> them<00:00:35.839> get<00:00:36.080> my<00:00:36.199> guardian<00:00:36.530> of

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
to do is I get them get my guardian of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.530 
to do is I get them get my guardian of
ancient<00:00:36.949> kings<00:00:37.070> out<00:00:37.339> first<00:00:37.970> that's<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:38.300> very

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
ancient kings out first that's the very

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.150 
ancient kings out first that's the very
first<00:00:38.600> button<00:00:39.140> I<00:00:39.199> press<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.680> reason<00:00:40.040> why

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
first button I press and the reason why

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.860 
first button I press and the reason why
is<00:00:40.250> because<00:00:40.430> there's<00:00:41.089> quite<00:00:41.360> a<00:00:41.390> bit<00:00:41.570> of<00:00:41.690> time

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
is because there's quite a bit of time

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.439 
is because there's quite a bit of time
that<00:00:42.199> I<00:00:42.230> need<00:00:42.500> to<00:00:42.800> ramp<00:00:43.010> up<00:00:43.220> my<00:00:43.489> stacks<00:00:44.059> of

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
that I need to ramp up my stacks of

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.710 
that I need to ramp up my stacks of
ancient<00:00:44.869> power<00:00:45.049> to<00:00:45.619> increase<00:00:45.739> my<00:00:46.220> damage<00:00:46.580> so<00:00:47.180> I

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
ancient power to increase my damage so I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.570 
ancient power to increase my damage so I
need<00:00:48.199> 12<00:00:48.470> stacks<00:00:48.739> in<00:00:48.920> total<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:49.400> you<00:00:49.430> have

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
need 12 stacks in total and you have

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.549 
need 12 stacks in total and you have
plenty<00:00:49.850> of<00:00:49.940> time<00:00:50.180> after<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:50.750> reach<00:00:50.989> 12<00:00:51.290> stacks

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
plenty of time after you reach 12 stacks

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.680 
plenty of time after you reach 12 stacks
so<00:00:51.799> it's<00:00:52.580> not<00:00:52.760> it<00:00:52.970> shouldn't<00:00:53.210> be<00:00:53.269> a<00:00:53.299> problem<00:00:53.479> to

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
so it's not it shouldn't be a problem to

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.329 
so it's not it shouldn't be a problem to
reach<00:00:53.869> 12<00:00:54.170> sacks<00:00:54.350> before<00:00:54.680> you<00:00:54.769> actually<00:00:55.129> use

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
reach 12 sacks before you actually use

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:56.859 
reach 12 sacks before you actually use
your<00:00:55.489> full<00:00:55.699> burst<00:00:55.970> but<00:00:56.210> if<00:00:56.299> you're<00:00:56.510> rushed<00:00:56.720> in

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:56.869 
your full burst but if you're rushed in

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:59.560 
your full burst but if you're rushed in
arena<00:00:57.110> is<00:00:57.320> definitely<00:00:57.949> situational<00:00:58.640> and

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
arena is definitely situational and

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.840 
arena is definitely situational and
using<00:01:00.470> more<00:01:00.619> like<00:01:00.890> you<00:01:01.040> less<00:01:01.189> than<00:01:01.369> 12<00:01:01.610> sacks

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
using more like you less than 12 sacks

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.640 
using more like you less than 12 sacks
to<00:01:01.970> start<00:01:02.210> your<00:01:02.330> burst<00:01:02.570> isn't<00:01:03.229> necessarily

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
to start your burst isn't necessarily

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.160 
to start your burst isn't necessarily
