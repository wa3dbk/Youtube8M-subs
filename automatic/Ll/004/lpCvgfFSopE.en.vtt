rubber<00:01:55.250> it<00:01:55.369> is<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:55.640> have<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:55.880> find<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.210> for

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
rubber it is you have to find it for

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:56.800 
rubber it is you have to find it for
yourself

yourself

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.660

because<00:01:57.020> each<00:01:57.110> guitar<00:01:57.439> it's<00:01:57.590> different<00:01:57.830> but

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
because each guitar it's different but

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.800 
because each guitar it's different but
you're<00:01:58.789> going<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.970> brush<00:01:59.179> up<00:01:59.330> against<00:01:59.630> and

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
you're going to brush up against and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.870 
you're going to brush up against and
right<00:01:59.929> after<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:00.289> hit<00:02:00.500> it<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:00.799> that<00:02:01.429> harmonic

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
right after you hit it and that harmonic

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.830 
right after you hit it and that harmonic
will<00:02:01.970> come<00:02:02.119> out<00:02:02.240> for<00:02:02.479> you<00:02:02.599> the<00:02:02.689> more

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
will come out for you the more

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
will come out for you the more
distortion<00:02:03.259> on<00:02:03.349> your<00:02:03.590> guitar

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.100

generally<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:05.119> easier<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:05.569> is<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:05.689> get<00:02:05.959> these

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
generally the easier it is to get these

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.740

this<00:02:13.580> particular<00:02:13.880> guitar<00:02:14.180> like<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.599> said<00:02:14.810> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
this particular guitar like I said the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.120 
this particular guitar like I said the
first<00:02:15.110> harmonic<00:02:15.410> that<00:02:15.769> I'm<00:02:15.829> gonna<00:02:15.950> worry

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
first harmonic that I'm gonna worry

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.710 
first harmonic that I'm gonna worry
about<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.340> was<00:02:16.519> right<00:02:16.790> over<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.180> neck<00:02:17.540> pick

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
about it was right over that neck pick

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.910 
about it was right over that neck pick
up<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.989> second<00:02:18.319> one<00:02:18.349> is<00:02:18.500> kind<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.709> in<00:02:18.890> between

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
up the second one is kind of in between

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.490 
up the second one is kind of in between
more<00:02:19.610> towards<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.000> middle<00:02:20.030> pick<00:02:20.329> up<00:02:20.500> the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
more towards the middle pick up the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.930 
more towards the middle pick up the
other<00:02:21.709> one<00:02:21.799> that<00:02:22.010> I'm<00:02:22.099> going<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.250> focus<00:02:22.400> on<00:02:22.730> is

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
other one that I'm going to focus on is

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.449 
other one that I'm going to focus on is
right<00:02:23.120> over<00:02:23.329> the<00:02:23.510> middle<00:02:23.599> pickup<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.310> was

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
right over the middle pickup so I was

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.800 
right over the middle pickup so I was
just<00:02:25.640> doing<00:02:25.880> that<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.239> know<00:02:26.329> where<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.540> touch

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
just doing that you know where you touch

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.390 
just doing that you know where you touch
the<00:02:27.079> harmonic<00:02:27.500> just<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.739> could<00:02:27.890> do<00:02:27.980> down<00:02:28.130> on<00:02:28.340> the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
the harmonic just I could do down on the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.539 
the harmonic just I could do down on the
fritz<00:02:29.769> see<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:30.950> right<00:02:31.130> where<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.280> one<00:02:31.519> is

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
fritz see the right where that one is

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.660 
fritz see the right where that one is
just<00:02:32.060> I'm<00:02:32.180> just<00:02:32.209> touching<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.690> string<00:02:33.670> pick

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
just I'm just touching the string pick

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
the string and getting a harmonic like

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.600 
the string and getting a harmonic like
that<00:02:52.110> you're<00:02:52.470> going<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.620> hit<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.100> string<00:02:53.370> and

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
that you're going to hit the string and

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.790 
that you're going to hit the string and
then<00:02:53.700> with<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.450> part<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:54.960> your<00:02:55.110> thumb<00:02:55.350> right

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
then with this part of your thumb right

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.460 
then with this part of your thumb right
here<00:02:56.090> you're<00:02:57.090> just<00:02:57.120> going<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.480> graze<00:02:57.960> the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
here you're just going to graze the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.010 
here you're just going to graze the
string<00:02:58.830> right<00:02:59.490> after<00:02:59.850> you<00:02:59.940> hit<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.510> string

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
string right after you hit the string

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.640 
string right after you hit the string
with<00:03:01.170> your<00:03:01.290> pick

actually<00:03:46.010> do<00:03:46.460> the<00:03:46.880> harmonics<00:03:47.390> with<00:03:47.540> your

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
actually do the harmonics with your

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.360 
actually do the harmonics with your
thumb<00:03:47.930> you<00:03:48.350> have<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.650> experiment<00:03:49.010> with<00:03:49.220> your

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
thumb you have to experiment with your

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.740 
thumb you have to experiment with your
own<00:03:49.430> guitar<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:49.910> see<00:03:50.030> what<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.210> harmonics

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
own guitar and see what the harmonics

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.490 
own guitar and see what the harmonics
are<00:03:50.960> on<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.650> open<00:03:51.920> strings<00:03:53.200> it's<00:03:54.200> take<00:03:54.350> some

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
are on the open strings it's take some

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.950 
are on the open strings it's take some
time<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.920> go<00:03:55.010> through<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:55.280> okay<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.510> that's

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
time and go through it okay the that's

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.110 
time and go through it okay the that's
cool<00:03:57.290> but<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.740> tricky<00:03:58.040> part<00:03:58.250> is<00:03:58.340> we<00:03:58.910> need<00:03:59.060> to

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
cool but the tricky part is we need to

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.580 
cool but the tricky part is we need to
change<00:03:59.300> where<00:03:59.720> you're<00:03:59.840> sharing<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.320> guitar

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
change where you're sharing the guitar

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.250 
change where you're sharing the guitar
down<00:04:00.800> here<00:04:01.240> the<00:04:02.240> harmonics<00:04:02.810> kind<00:04:03.080> of<00:04:03.140> move

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
down here the harmonics kind of move

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.050 
down here the harmonics kind of move
around<00:04:03.410> so<00:04:03.860> I'll<00:04:03.980> show<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.250> so<00:04:04.760> I'm<00:04:04.850> playing

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
around so I'll show you so I'm playing

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.000 
around so I'll show you so I'm playing
it<00:04:05.180> hoping<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:05.540> get<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:06.380> first<00:04:06.590> time<00:04:06.740> on<00:04:06.890> it

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
it hoping to get that first time on it

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.660 
it hoping to get that first time on it
now<00:04:07.400> if<00:04:07.460> I<00:04:07.550> play<00:04:07.700> with<00:04:07.820> a<00:04:07.880> third<00:04:08.210> fret<00:04:09.670> I'm

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
now if I play with a third fret I'm

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.010 
now if I play with a third fret I'm
applying<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.180> same<00:04:11.330> place<00:04:11.570> and<00:04:11.720> watch<00:04:11.870> how

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
applying the same place and watch how

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.130 
applying the same place and watch how
that<00:04:12.080> harmonic<00:04:12.590> kind<00:04:12.740> of<00:04:12.800> disappears<00:04:14.140> not

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
that harmonic kind of disappears not

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.170 
that harmonic kind of disappears not
quite<00:04:15.350> in<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.470> right<00:04:15.530> spot<00:04:15.920> right<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:16.520> when

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
quite in the right spot right so when

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.090 
quite in the right spot right so when
you<00:04:17.239> move<00:04:17.390> up<00:04:17.660> on<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.020> fretboard<00:04:18.320> -<00:04:18.860> Freddie

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
you move up on the fretboard - Freddie

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.400 
you move up on the fretboard - Freddie
hand<00:04:19.370> you're<00:04:19.820> gonna<00:04:19.910> have<00:04:20.060> to<00:04:20.180> move<00:04:20.390> up<00:04:20.959> a

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
hand you're gonna have to move up a

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.740 
hand you're gonna have to move up a
little<00:04:21.709> bit<00:04:21.890> where<00:04:22.310> you're<00:04:22.430> picking<00:04:25.480> and<00:04:26.480> then

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
little bit where you're picking and then

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.180 
little bit where you're picking and then
it<00:04:27.080> just<00:04:27.230> gets<00:04:27.380> relative<00:04:27.890> to<00:04:28.010> where<00:04:28.130> the

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
it just gets relative to where the

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.660 
it just gets relative to where the
position<00:04:28.340> is<00:04:28.610> in<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.850> left<00:04:29.030> hand<00:04:29.240> so<00:04:29.390> you<00:04:29.510> have

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
position is in the left hand so you have

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.490 
position is in the left hand so you have
the<00:04:31.670> same<00:04:31.910> thing<00:04:32.090> with<00:04:32.270> harmonics<00:04:32.750> it's<00:04:33.260> just

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
the same thing with harmonics it's just

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.350 
the same thing with harmonics it's just
a<00:04:33.590> little<00:04:33.890> bit<00:04:33.980> different<00:04:34.370> so<00:04:34.700> when<00:04:34.970> you<00:04:35.060> play

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
a little bit different so when you play

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.210 
a little bit different so when you play
I've<00:04:35.900> got<00:04:36.200> a<00:04:36.230> different<00:04:36.590> view<00:04:36.680> here<00:04:36.950> and<00:04:37.070> show

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
I've got a different view here and show

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.290 
I've got a different view here and show
you<00:04:37.280> how<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.490> play<00:04:37.640> through<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.850> scale<00:04:38.120> with

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
you how to play through the scale with

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.020 
you how to play through the scale with
with<00:04:39.170> harmonics<00:04:39.590> real<00:04:39.710> quick<00:04:39.890> look<00:04:40.100> so<00:04:40.700> if<00:04:40.910> I

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
with harmonics real quick look so if I

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.790 
with harmonics real quick look so if I
do<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.210> G<00:04:41.480> major<00:04:41.720> pentatonic<00:04:41.810> scale<00:04:42.500> for<00:04:42.710> you

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
do a G major pentatonic scale for you

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.030 
do a G major pentatonic scale for you
real<00:04:42.950> quick<00:04:44.830> using<00:04:45.830> harmonics<00:04:46.360> so<00:04:47.360> now<00:04:48.040> every

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
real quick using harmonics so now every

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.650 
real quick using harmonics so now every
time<00:04:49.220> we<00:04:49.370> can<00:04:49.490> change<00:04:49.520> a<00:04:49.940> note<00:04:50.090> on<00:04:50.330> your<00:04:50.360> left

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
time we can change a note on your left

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.090 
time we can change a note on your left
hand<00:04:50.810> your<00:04:51.230> right<00:04:51.380> hand<00:04:51.560> is<00:04:51.650> going<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.830> change

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
hand your right hand is going to change

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.430 
hand your right hand is going to change
a<00:04:52.250> little<00:04:52.430> bit<00:04:52.640> to<00:04:52.820> to<00:04:53.060> kind<00:04:53.240> of<00:04:53.270> match<00:04:53.480> where

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
a little bit to to kind of match where

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.020 
a little bit to to kind of match where
your<00:04:54.620> fingers<00:04:54.980> are<00:04:55.100> going<00:04:55.280> on<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:55.640> left<00:04:55.820> hand

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
your fingers are going on the left hand

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.000 
your fingers are going on the left hand
to<00:04:56.480> find<00:04:56.690> that<00:04:56.870> harmonic<00:04:57.380> it's<00:04:57.740> really

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
to find that harmonic it's really

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.770 
to find that harmonic it's really
relative<00:04:58.490> to<00:04:58.700> wherever<00:04:59.030> your<00:04:59.180> fretting<00:04:59.570> on
