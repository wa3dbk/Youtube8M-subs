00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
positive numbers positive integers

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.730 
positive numbers positive integers
because<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.150> can<00:02:21.240> find<00:02:21.510> another<00:02:21.810> solution<00:02:22.350> to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
because you can find another solution to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.680 
because you can find another solution to
this<00:02:22.920> if<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.280> allow<00:02:23.490> negative<00:02:23.790> numbers<00:02:24.510> in

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
this if you allow negative numbers in

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.230 
this if you allow negative numbers in
there<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.680> Jeffie<00:02:26.130> Hardy<00:02:26.490> told<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.910> story

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
there so Jeffie Hardy told this story

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.260 
there so Jeffie Hardy told this story
and<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:28.230> think<00:02:28.770> people<00:02:29.220> tell<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.730> story<00:02:29.940> to

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
and I think people tell this story to

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.410 
and I think people tell this story to
show<00:02:30.780> how<00:02:31.050> brilliant<00:02:31.850> romnesia<00:02:32.850> Ohio<00:02:33.270> he

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
show how brilliant romnesia Ohio he

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.820 
show how brilliant romnesia Ohio he
could<00:02:33.600> he<00:02:33.660> could<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:33.990> come<00:02:34.230> up<00:02:34.260> with<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.680> at

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
could he could just come up with that at

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.740 
could he could just come up with that at
the<00:02:34.920> top<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.190> his<00:02:35.280> head<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.610> think<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.540> point

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
the top of his head I think the point

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.900 
the top of his head I think the point
Jeffy<00:02:37.170> Hardy<00:02:37.530> was<00:02:37.650> trying<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.920> make<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.220> no<00:02:38.670> he

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
Jeffy Hardy was trying to make is no he

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.740 
Jeffy Hardy was trying to make is no he
wasn't<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.360> genius

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
wasn't a genius

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.930 
wasn't a genius
now<00:02:40.320> anujan<00:02:40.740> had<00:02:40.860> come<00:02:41.130> up<00:02:41.310> with<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.640> fact

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
now anujan had come up with this fact

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.270 
now anujan had come up with this fact
already<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.720> his<00:02:42.870> previous<00:02:43.170> research<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.160> is

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
already in his previous research this is

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.250 
already in his previous research this is
something<00:02:44.550> he<00:02:44.640> studied<00:02:45.120> something<00:02:45.840> he<00:02:45.960> knew

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
something he studied something he knew

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.850 
something he studied something he knew
so<00:02:47.070> he<00:02:47.400> wasn't<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:48.180> genius<00:02:48.840> he<00:02:49.170> hadn't<00:02:49.620> just

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
so he wasn't a genius he hadn't just

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.160 
so he wasn't a genius he hadn't just
come<00:02:50.160> up<00:02:50.340> with<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:51.000> think<00:02:51.360> that's<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
come up with that I think that's the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.650 
come up with that I think that's the
point<00:02:52.380> he<00:02:53.070> was<00:02:53.250> trying<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.700> make<00:02:53.880> if<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.450> allow

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
point he was trying to make if you allow

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.250 
point he was trying to make if you allow
negative<00:02:54.990> numbers<00:02:55.800> then<00:02:56.460> I<00:02:56.700> can<00:02:56.910> write<00:02:57.150> down

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
negative numbers then I can write down

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.050 
negative numbers then I can write down
six<00:02:58.260> cubed<00:02:59.210> plus<00:03:00.290> minus<00:03:01.290> five<00:03:01.650> cubed<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
six cubed plus minus five cubed is the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.230 
six cubed plus minus five cubed is the
same<00:03:03.390> as<00:03:03.900> 4<00:03:04.530> cubed<00:03:05.090> plus<00:03:06.090> 3<00:03:06.900> cubed<00:03:07.370> which<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.400> 91

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
same as 4 cubed plus 3 cubed which is 91

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.620 
same as 4 cubed plus 3 cubed which is 91
so<00:03:10.050> this<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.710> the<00:03:11.160> smallest<00:03:11.550> number<00:03:12.060> which<00:03:12.450> is

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
so this is the smallest number which is

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.680 
so this is the smallest number which is
the<00:03:12.840> sum<00:03:13.050> of<00:03:13.080> two<00:03:13.500> cubes<00:03:13.790> in<00:03:14.790> two<00:03:15.510> different

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
the sum of two cubes in two different

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.110 
the sum of two cubes in two different
ways<00:03:16.080> if<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.800> allow<00:03:17.040> negative<00:03:17.280> numbers<00:03:18.000> and

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
ways if you allow negative numbers and

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.660 
ways if you allow negative numbers and
Rober<00:03:18.750> Newton<00:03:19.260> thought<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.830> was<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.250> because

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
Rober Newton thought it was that because

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.610 
Rober Newton thought it was that because
he<00:03:20.940> only<00:03:21.090> allowed<00:03:21.300> for<00:03:21.660> positive<00:03:22.080> numbers<00:03:22.110> and

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
he only allowed for positive numbers and

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.979 
he only allowed for positive numbers and
you<00:03:22.980> forgive<00:03:23.459> him<00:03:23.610> because<00:03:23.790> he<00:03:24.120> was<00:03:24.300> a<00:03:24.630> death

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
you forgive him because he was a death

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.770 
you forgive him because he was a death
door<00:03:25.290> at<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.560> time
