00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.260 
now because I must say that the
government<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.200> media<00:01:58.969> probably<00:01:59.969> six

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
government and the media probably six

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.670 
government and the media probably six
years<00:02:00.479> ago<00:02:00.630> they<00:02:00.869> really<00:02:01.020> had<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> huge

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
years ago they really had a huge

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.789 
years ago they really had a huge
campaign<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:03.170> in<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.259> government<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.680> done

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
campaign and in the government have done

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.020 
campaign and in the government have done
a<00:02:04.829> wonderful<00:02:05.040> job<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.640> they're<00:02:05.790> still<00:02:06.000> doing

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
a wonderful job and they're still doing

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.050 
a wonderful job and they're still doing
more<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.719> they<00:02:06.780> should<00:02:06.960> do<00:02:07.110> more

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
more and they should do more

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.839 
more and they should do more
to<00:02:08.720> adjust<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.289> situation<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.340> therefore<00:02:10.819> I

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
to adjust that situation so therefore I

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.770 
to adjust that situation so therefore I
think<00:02:11.060> we<00:02:11.690> have<00:02:12.170> we<00:02:12.620> have<00:02:12.739> moved<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.640> far<00:02:14.390> and

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
think we have we have moved so far and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.550 
think we have we have moved so far and
improved<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.680> whole<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.880> legislation's<00:02:17.840> the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
improved the whole the legislation's the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.870 
improved the whole the legislation's the
relationship<00:02:19.160> with<00:02:19.280> contractors<00:02:19.819> and

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
relationship with contractors and

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.050 
relationship with contractors and
Labor's<00:02:20.390> contracts<00:02:21.370> but<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.430> think<00:02:22.730> the

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
Labor's contracts but I think the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.280 
Labor's contracts but I think the
government<00:02:23.390> still<00:02:23.569> is<00:02:23.690> going<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.930> do<00:02:24.050> some

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
government still is going to do some

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.400 
government still is going to do some
more<00:02:24.470> in<00:02:25.010> my<00:02:25.340> views<00:02:25.610> on<00:02:26.239> which<00:02:26.780> they<00:02:26.959> issue<00:02:27.140> the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
more in my views on which they issue the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.930 
more in my views on which they issue the
passports<00:02:28.099> being<00:02:28.370> held<00:02:28.580> or<00:02:28.849> the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
passports being held or the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.390 
passports being held or the
accommodation<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.900> think<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.769> think<00:02:31.040> all<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.250> it

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
accommodation I think I think all of it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.830 
accommodation I think I think all of it
and<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.730> government<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.180> quite<00:02:32.360> concerned

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
and the government is quite concerned

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.460 
and the government is quite concerned
that<00:02:33.019> that<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:34.430> country<00:02:34.849> must<00:02:35.420> be<00:02:35.599> looked<00:02:36.230> at

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
that that the country must be looked at

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.330 
that that the country must be looked at
as<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.690> progressive<00:02:38.690> civilized<00:02:39.470> environment

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340

political activities in in India it is

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.770 
political activities in in India it is
oil<00:03:28.310> prices<00:03:28.870> as<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:29.900> result<00:03:30.260> as<00:03:31.069> well<00:03:31.780> therefore

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
oil prices as a result as well therefore

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.509 
oil prices as a result as well therefore
I<00:03:32.810> think<00:03:33.109> with<00:03:33.350> all<00:03:33.380> these<00:03:33.769> factors<00:03:34.340> it's

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
I think with all these factors it's

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.280 
I think with all these factors it's
affecting<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:34.970> rest<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.510> world<00:03:35.690> as<00:03:35.870> well

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
affecting the rest of the world as well

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.319 
affecting the rest of the world as well

at the same time any slowdown in in
values<00:03:47.030> we<00:03:47.870> really<00:03:48.109> believe<00:03:48.319> that<00:03:48.350> it's<00:03:48.950> a

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
values we really believe that it's a

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.780 
values we really believe that it's a
small<00:03:49.489> adjustment<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.389> a<00:03:50.690> long<00:03:51.790> wonderful

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
small adjustment in a long wonderful

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.150 
small adjustment in a long wonderful
future<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.239> this<00:03:53.420> of<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.780> city<00:03:54.049> where<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.680> is

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
future of this of the city where it is

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.430 
future of this of the city where it is
definitely<00:03:55.819> sitting<00:03:56.329> there<00:03:56.540> at<00:03:56.810> a<00:03:56.870> good<00:03:57.200> value

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440

got planned now in terms of the city of
Dubai<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.930> see<00:04:49.140> Ammar<00:04:49.500> have<00:04:49.680> have<00:04:50.010> started

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
Dubai you see Ammar have have started

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.440 
Dubai you see Ammar have have started
myself<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.050> my<00:04:52.140> team<00:04:52.820> have<00:04:53.820> always<00:04:53.970> thought

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
myself and my team have always thought

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.000 
myself and my team have always thought
that<00:04:55.040> creating<00:04:56.040> a<00:04:57.680> wonderful<00:04:58.680> environment

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
that creating a wonderful environment

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.860 
that creating a wonderful environment
for<00:04:59.340> people<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.700> live<00:04:59.850> is<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.240> key<00:05:00.390> to<00:05:00.450> success

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
for people to live is the key to success

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.500 
for people to live is the key to success
so<00:05:01.410> that's<00:05:01.620> why<00:05:01.800> we<00:05:02.400> really<00:05:02.550> have<00:05:02.820> never<00:05:03.060> built

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
so that's why we really have never built

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.230 
so that's why we really have never built
a<00:05:03.900> single<00:05:04.740> building<00:05:04.920> or<00:05:05.190> a<00:05:05.220> single<00:05:05.550> home<00:05:05.880> we

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
a single building or a single home we

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.220 
a single building or a single home we
have<00:05:06.360> always<00:05:06.510> started<00:05:07.580> large-scale<00:05:08.580> and

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
have always started large-scale and

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.620 
have always started large-scale and
managed<00:05:10.230> what<00:05:10.860> happens<00:05:11.340> on<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.730> ground<00:05:11.970> which

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
managed what happens on the ground which

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.060 
managed what happens on the ground which
means<00:05:12.840> that<00:05:13.020> what<00:05:13.170> type<00:05:13.380> of<00:05:13.410> life<00:05:13.740> do<00:05:13.980> we

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
means that what type of life do we

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.100 
means that what type of life do we
