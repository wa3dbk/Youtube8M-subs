00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.960
 all right 

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:12.960
 [Music] 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.600
 I'm in fourth year career 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.980
 engineering in natural resources 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.450
 Renewable Faculty of Sciences 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.850
 degrees 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.460
 when I came out the secondary I chose this 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.800
 career because I had dad and a friend 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.570
 who taught here and this race to 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.850
 being new was not it was not widespread 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.320
 and if I knew that I really liked the 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.020
 nature and in the university whose 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.840
 is the only one that has this approach together 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.880
 with agronomy or not but good was more 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.380
 oriented towards what was management 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.570
 environmental management what I wanted 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.300
 then it is to choose the race and my 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.400
 first years were like hard 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.710
 because it is difficult to adapt to the system 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.570
 educational because in the early years 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.870
 the subjects are very basic and hard 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.220
 mathematical physics chemistry and it's where the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.870
 more students are demotivated and they 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.630
 they stay but once those years pass 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.190
 and everything is is lighter and start 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.869
 to have the materials oriented towards 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.250
 that the career of management is good 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.170
 environmental or the development of 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.290
 renewable energy then you 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.390
 stimulate more and practically that you 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.900
 you receive once you passages very 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.550
 basic or technical 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.500
 [Music] 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.030
 the race lasts four 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.610
 years and a half according to the curriculum 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.240
 more the thesis is usually extended 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.280
 like years ago because he tries to raise 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.410
 a day but it gets complicated because the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.830
 course is very intensive and many hours in 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.620
 the classroom but you also leave visits 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.210
 in territory and well that also makes 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.340
 that is more bearable also come 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.410
 people to talks or people 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.780
 specialized in different subjects for 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.330
 more specific so that not all the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.040
 same teacher and also the students 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.260
 advanced have the possibility of 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.700
 collaborate in the dictation of subjects and 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.460
 that also makes me have a focus 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.220
 as more directed towards the student and 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.540
 from the student's gaze 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.540
 [Music] 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.710
 the title of the engineering degree in 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.390
 renewable natural resources and the countryside 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.370
 work that they have in the field 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.470
 private and at the state level in the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.270
 Private area you can do to dedicate yourself to 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.280
 what are consulting consultations 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.860
 when a company needs a study 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.690
 environmental impact has to have a 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.970
 seen approved then good then 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.860
 dedicate to that are the nexus more than anything 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.720
 between the different professions 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.670
 specific you're not going to do the one that's going to 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.990
 go to make the measurements in the field but 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.160
 if you are going to make the link between the one 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.070
 making field measurements the 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.860
 technical and which will extract and which 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.360
 are going to make the final conclusion this 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.350
 it's like more in the private sphere and in the 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.420
 state level 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.260
 you have teaching at the secondary level 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.730
 university student in the different 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.650
 institutes institutes of the state of 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.050
 flour knowing you have a lot in 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.880
 research and also good at 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.760
 part of management if you want to dedicate yourself 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.800
 more towards what is politics is also 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.250
 You can do it because you're facing 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.430
 that then like that field range 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.560
 labor is very diverse and also depends 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.930
 much of the student and depends on what 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.540
 August interest and how are you going you go 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.280
 making your way to be able the day that 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.230
 you get to be able to perform in what 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.940
 you chose when it was happening 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.280
 for the university I to a 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.290
 student at the beginning of this career 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.820
 I would say that in the first years he has 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.070
 to put a lot of perseverance 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.200
 when you are studying these subjects 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.030
 so difficult that it is important to make yourself 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.350
 of a study group and it's really a 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.850
 throughout the whole career have 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.920
 always a study group in which 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.200
 support you because in turn easier 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.120
 study and learn not only do you 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.880
 you have to dedicate to study and be 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.470
 in the classroom but also going out to the field 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.750
 dedicate yourself to what is extension 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.090
 university or research to have 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.700
 a more integral formation and that you see 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.780
 motivates you and passionate and that's 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.570
 final passion is what keeps you 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.250
 as learned in the race and what does 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.019
 that you receive then the important thing not 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.750
 only what you do in the classroom but 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.880
 what you are doing besides that 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.769
 teaching and learning that gives you the 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.570
 college are the tools that 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.160
 that is coming to you as you go 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.610
 happening because you have to be passionate about that 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.080
 It is the truth 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.330
 to finish having that exciting and 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.070
 you passion feed her with what 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.630
 you do every day 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.740
