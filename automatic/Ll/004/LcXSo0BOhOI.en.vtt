our<00:00:06.359> evolution<00:00:07.290> yeah<00:00:07.770> it's<00:00:08.010> not<00:00:08.160> an<00:00:08.340> evolution

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
our evolution yeah it's not an evolution

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.299 
our evolution yeah it's not an evolution
of<00:00:08.940> individuals<00:00:09.690> our<00:00:10.349> evolution<00:00:11.070> as<00:00:11.190> an

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
of individuals our evolution as an

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.330 
of individuals our evolution as an
individual<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:11.940> an<00:00:12.150> evolution<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.630> community

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
individual is an evolution of community

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.519 
individual is an evolution of community
that<00:00:14.570> before<00:00:15.570> they<00:00:15.750> were<00:00:15.809> multicellular

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
that before they were multicellular

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.019 
that before they were multicellular
organisms<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.279> planet<00:00:17.340> there<00:00:17.760> were<00:00:17.820> only

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
organisms on this planet there were only

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.570 
organisms on this planet there were only
single<00:00:18.330> cells<00:00:18.600> for<00:00:19.560> billions<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.100> years<00:00:20.160> all

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
single cells for billions of years all

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.070 
single cells for billions of years all
there<00:00:20.789> were<00:00:20.910> were<00:00:21.090> just<00:00:21.270> single<00:00:21.600> cells<00:00:21.810> had

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
there were were just single cells had

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.019 
there were were just single cells had
carrying<00:00:22.439> out<00:00:22.529> their<00:00:22.680> own<00:00:22.769> lives<00:00:23.039> but<00:00:23.400> what

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
carrying out their own lives but what

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.509 
carrying out their own lives but what
happened<00:00:24.480> was<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.260> cells<00:00:25.560> recognized<00:00:26.220> that

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
happened was the cells recognized that

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.700 
happened was the cells recognized that
they<00:00:26.640> could<00:00:26.820> increase<00:00:27.060> their<00:00:27.750> survival<00:00:28.590> by

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
they could increase their survival by

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.400 
they could increase their survival by
gaining<00:00:29.039> more<00:00:29.429> awareness<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.720> awareness<00:00:31.230> was

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
gaining more awareness but awareness was

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.740 
gaining more awareness but awareness was
the<00:00:31.560> membrane<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.759> how<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.090> gain<00:00:33.300> well<00:00:33.630> you

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the membrane so how do you gain well you

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.709 
the membrane so how do you gain well you
need<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.989> make<00:00:34.079> bigger<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.590> bigger<00:00:34.829> cells<00:00:35.160> or

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
need to make bigger and bigger cells or

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.690 
need to make bigger and bigger cells or
you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.870> take<00:00:37.050> groups<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.739> cells<00:00:37.980> plug<00:00:38.489> them

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
you can take groups of cells plug them

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.310 
you can take groups of cells plug them
together<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.239> let<00:00:39.390> their<00:00:39.570> membrane<00:00:39.989> share

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
together and let their membrane share

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200 
together and let their membrane share
information<00:00:41.070> because<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.460> membrane<00:00:41.910> will<00:00:42.059> only

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
information because a membrane will only

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.330 
information because a membrane will only
hold<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.719> much<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.590> then<00:00:43.860> they<00:00:43.950> break<00:00:44.190> apart

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
hold so much and then they break apart

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.639 
hold so much and then they break apart
right<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.090> keyboard<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.600> only<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:45.899> big<00:00:45.930> right

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
right the keyboard is only so big right

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.470 
right the keyboard is only so big right
so<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.160> add<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.910> hooked<00:00:48.180> up<00:00:48.360> with

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
so you can add we hooked up with

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.150 
so you can add we hooked up with
underwater<00:00:48.870> okay<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.649> create<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
underwater okay you create a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.220

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
but once we come together in community

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.620 
but once we come together in community
the<00:01:51.990> synergy<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.710> awareness<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:54.270> will<00:01:54.479> be

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the synergy of awareness that will be

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.080 
the synergy of awareness that will be

passed from one cell to the next would

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.660 
passed from one cell to the next would
be<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.420> equivalent<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:58.079> taking<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.340> single

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
be the equivalent of taking a single

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.050 
be the equivalent of taking a single
amoeba<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.810> comparing<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.799> life<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.670> that

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
so is the Internet

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.630 
so is the Internet
next<00:02:09.659> step<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.319> video<00:02:10.619> network<00:02:11.159> is<00:02:11.489> a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
next step in this video network is a

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.000 
next step in this video network is a
definite<00:02:12.180> evolutionary<00:02:12.810> leap<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.739> the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
definite evolutionary leap it is the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.460 
definite evolutionary leap it is the
equivalent<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.970> communication<00:02:15.930> system

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
equivalent of the communication system

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.470 
equivalent of the communication system
by<00:02:17.010> which<00:02:17.069> all<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.519> cells<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.909> my<00:02:18.060> body<00:02:18.269> are

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
by which all the cells of my body are

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.350 
by which all the cells of my body are
coherent<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.220> we<00:02:20.430> have<00:02:20.610> an<00:02:20.730> ability<00:02:20.940> for

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
coherent so that we have an ability for

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.289 
coherent so that we have an ability for
all<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.840> cells<00:02:22.140> in<00:02:22.379> our<00:02:22.590> new<00:02:22.860> human<00:02:23.489> body<00:02:23.760> the

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
all the cells in our new human body the

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.630 
all the cells in our new human body the
human<00:02:24.500> organization<00:02:25.500> humanity<00:02:26.129> to

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
human organization humanity to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.009 
human organization humanity to
communicate<00:02:27.150> with<00:02:27.299> each<00:02:27.420> other<00:02:27.599> and<00:02:27.780> share

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
communicate with each other and share

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.990 
communicate with each other and share
information<00:02:28.290> which<00:02:29.129> is<00:02:29.280> why<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.459> cells<00:02:29.819> came

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
information which is why the cells came

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.800 
information which is why the cells came
together<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.329> the<00:02:30.390> first<00:02:30.540> place

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
together in the first place

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.740 
together in the first place
so<00:02:31.409> where<00:02:31.620> we<00:02:31.769> go<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.510> biological<00:02:33.510> evolution

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
so where we go the biological evolution

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.759 
so where we go the biological evolution
is<00:02:34.170> fractal<00:02:35.209> meaning<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.480> has<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.019> very<00:02:37.470> basic

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
is fractal meaning it has a very basic

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.890 
is fractal meaning it has a very basic
formula<00:02:38.489> that<00:02:38.670> reiterates<00:02:39.269> itself<00:02:39.599> over<00:02:39.840> and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
formula that reiterates itself over and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.470 
formula that reiterates itself over and
over<00:02:40.019> again<00:02:40.260> give<00:02:40.530> an<00:02:40.650> example<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:42.030> cell<00:02:42.329> of

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
over again give an example the cell of

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.910 
over again give an example the cell of
the<00:02:42.599> human<00:02:42.629> the<00:02:43.109> cell<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.440> amoeba<00:02:43.709> are

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
the human the cell of amoeba are

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.589 
the human the cell of amoeba are
essentially<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.400> same<00:02:44.579> cell<00:02:44.819> same<00:02:45.120> structure

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
essentially the same cell same structure

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.569 
essentially the same cell same structure
but<00:02:46.140> then<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.590> look<00:02:46.709> at<00:02:46.829> all<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.250> diversity

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
but then you look at all the diversity

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.280 
but then you look at all the diversity
of<00:02:47.849> biology<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.569> said<00:02:48.750> but<00:02:49.049> they're<00:02:49.200> all

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
of biology and you said but they're all

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.800 
of biology and you said but they're all
basically<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.799> same<00:02:49.920> cells<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.329> fractal

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
basically the same cells so the fractal

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.280 
basically the same cells so the fractal
is<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.260> cell<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.970> chaos<00:02:54.390> creates<00:02:55.019> all

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
is the cell and the chaos creates all

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.960 
is the cell and the chaos creates all
the<00:02:55.470> different<00:02:55.739> organizations<00:02:55.829> of<00:02:56.459> cells<00:02:56.670> yet

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
the different organizations of cells yet

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.039 
the different organizations of cells yet
they're<00:02:57.150> all<00:02:57.299> still<00:02:57.569> based<00:02:57.810> on<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:57.989> same

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
they're all still based on the same

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.410 
they're all still based on the same
fundamental<00:02:58.319> unit<00:02:58.920> but<00:02:59.700> then<00:02:59.849> the<00:02:59.970> problem

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
fundamental unit but then the problem

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.289 
fundamental unit but then the problem
that<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.720> was<00:03:00.959> this<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.650> cell<00:03:02.120> when<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.209> got

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
that this was this the cell when it got

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.220 
that this was this the cell when it got
through<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.540> big<00:03:03.690> enough<00:03:03.840> community

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
through a big enough community

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.110 
through a big enough community
recapitulated<00:03:05.159> itself<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.640> community

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
recapitulated itself in a community

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.030 
recapitulated itself in a community
called<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.450> multicellular<00:03:07.230> organism<00:03:07.799> right

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
called the multicellular organism right

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.490 
called the multicellular organism right
the<00:03:08.220> human<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:10.170> cell<00:03:10.739> ok<00:03:11.959> enlarge<00:03:12.959> as<00:03:13.440> a

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
the human is a cell ok enlarge as a

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.550 
the human is a cell ok enlarge as a
community<00:03:14.010> it's<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.700> are<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:15.329> ok<00:03:16.049> when<00:03:16.349> a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
community it's we are so ok when a

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.319 
community it's we are so ok when a
community<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.160> cells<00:03:17.459> we<00:03:17.639> are<00:03:17.760> community<00:03:18.180> yeah

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
community of cells we are community yeah

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.120 
community of cells we are community yeah
but<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.630> human<00:03:19.019> then<00:03:19.200> actually<00:03:19.919> is<00:03:20.099> a

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
but the human then actually is a

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.640 
but the human then actually is a
reiteration<00:03:20.549> of<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.120> cell<00:03:21.329> ok<00:03:21.959> point<00:03:22.319> very

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
reiteration of a cell ok point very

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.369 
reiteration of a cell ok point very
simple<00:03:23.120> no<00:03:24.120> matter<00:03:24.269> how<00:03:24.480> complex<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.079> am<00:03:25.230> as<00:03:25.349> a

simple no matter how complex I am as a
human<00:03:25.440> will<00:03:26.310> all<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.730> functions<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.150> you

human will all the functions that you

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.319 
human will all the functions that you
ascribe<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.660> me<00:03:28.099> that<00:03:29.099> there<00:03:29.819> are<00:03:29.849> no<00:03:29.970> new

already present in a single cell
the<00:03:34.620> human<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.250> reiteration<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.329> cell

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
the human is a reiteration of a cell

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.780 
the human is a reiteration of a cell
everything<00:03:37.169> that<00:03:37.319> I<00:03:37.530> do<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:38.040> cell<00:03:38.280> already<00:03:38.549> does

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
everything that I do a cell already does

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.520 
everything that I do a cell already does
I<00:03:38.970> mean<00:03:39.000> it's<00:03:39.239> illogical<00:03:39.540> how<00:03:40.199> can<00:03:40.379> I<00:03:40.470> do

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
I mean it's illogical how can I do

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.460 
I mean it's illogical how can I do
something<00:03:40.919> that<00:03:40.949> a<00:03:41.040> cell<00:03:41.280> can<00:03:41.489> do<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:43.230> now<00:03:43.410> the

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
something that a cell can do so now the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.979 
something that a cell can do so now the
community<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.970> humans<00:03:45.629> are<00:03:46.489> multicellular

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
community of humans are multicellular

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.930 
community of humans are multicellular
organization<00:03:49.099> which<00:03:50.099> comes<00:03:50.430> together<00:03:50.639> and

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
organization which comes together and

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.900 
organization which comes together and
makes<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.180> wholeness<00:03:51.799> ok<00:03:52.829> now<00:03:53.190> here's<00:03:53.790> a

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
makes a wholeness ok now here's a

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.879 
makes a wholeness ok now here's a
present<00:03:54.209> port<00:03:54.419> it's<00:03:54.989> sort<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.260> like<00:03:55.410> jumps

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
present port it's sort of like jumps

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.879 
present port it's sort of like jumps
like<00:03:56.040> bootstrapping<00:03:56.790> it's<00:03:57.030> not<00:03:57.150> one<00:03:57.480> cell

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
like bootstrapping it's not one cell

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.330 
like bootstrapping it's not one cell
