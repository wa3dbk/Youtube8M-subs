00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
all right this is so this review of a

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.690 
all right this is so this review of a
pioneer<00:00:03.410> zdh<00:00:04.440> for<00:00:04.890> 1/8<00:00:07.010> this<00:00:08.010> is<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.220> quantum

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
pioneer zdh for 1/8 this is the quantum

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.330 
pioneer zdh for 1/8 this is the quantum
FX<00:00:09.290> okay<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.349> see<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.620> right<00:00:10.860> there<00:00:10.889> you

FX okay you see that right there you
can't<00:00:11.519> make<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:11.759> up<00:00:12.000> FX<00:00:12.769> 10-5<00:00:13.769> dude<00:00:14.389> alright

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
can't make this up FX 10-5 dude alright

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.210 
can't make this up FX 10-5 dude alright
so<00:00:15.719> on<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.260> what<00:00:16.350> happens<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.740> plug<00:00:17.070> in

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
so on this is what happens you plug in

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.950 
so on this is what happens you plug in
an<00:00:17.279> iPod<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.060> okay<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:18.990> here<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.560> end

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
an iPod to it okay so here is the end

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:31.630 
an iPod to it okay so here is the end
this<00:00:25.849> whatever

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.580 

okay<00:00:32.640> now<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:34.640> don't<00:00:35.640> think<00:00:36.290> it's<00:00:37.290> going<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
okay now I don't think it's going to

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:52.890 
okay now I don't think it's going to
sync<00:00:38.400> up<00:00:38.550> or<00:00:39.270> charge<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.990> matter

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:00.070 

us<00:00:53.900> being<00:00:54.140> SD<00:00:54.770> now<00:00:55.670> is<00:00:55.880> it<00:00:56.000> on<00:00:56.150> it<00:00:59.080> all

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
us being SD now is it on it all

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.660 
us being SD now is it on it all
ministers<00:01:00.530> listen<00:01:01.960> nope

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
ministers listen nope

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.220 
ministers listen nope
it<00:01:04.670> will<00:01:04.820> test<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.090> supersonic<00:01:05.600> employees<00:01:06.080> on

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
it will test the supersonic employees on

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.750 
it will test the supersonic employees on
your<00:01:06.260> yeah

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.850 

okay<00:01:13.760> so<00:01:13.820> I'm<00:01:14.270> dancing<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:15.140> question<00:01:15.650> with

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
okay so I'm dancing that question with

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.030 
okay so I'm dancing that question with
the<00:01:16.010> iPod<00:01:16.870> all<00:01:17.870> three<00:01:18.230> of<00:01:18.290> you<00:01:18.440> of<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.620> quantum

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
the iPod all three of you of the quantum

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.140 
the iPod all three of you of the quantum
all<00:01:19.940> right<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:20.420> um<00:01:20.770> here<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:21.950> your<00:01:22.250> volume<00:01:22.700> knob

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
all right so um here is your volume knob

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.920 
all right so um here is your volume knob
great<00:01:23.870> a<00:01:23.900> material<00:01:24.440> here<00:01:24.680> take<00:01:25.040> us<00:01:25.130> on<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:26.240> takes

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
great a material here take us on a takes

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.320 
great a material here take us on a takes
video<00:01:27.230> yeah<00:01:28.190> your<00:01:28.820> minds

video yeah your minds

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.500 
video yeah your minds
there's<00:01:30.320> your<00:01:30.470> volume<00:01:30.830> we<00:01:31.400> are<00:01:31.580> here<00:01:31.880> with<00:01:32.360> the

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
there's your volume we are here with the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.060 
there's your volume we are here with the
rel<00:01:32.690> was<00:01:32.960> that<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.290> take<00:01:33.440> off<00:01:33.620> the<00:01:33.710> faceplate

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
rel was that to take off the faceplate

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.800 
rel was that to take off the faceplate
in<00:01:34.340> tone<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:35.570> here<00:01:36.110> we<00:01:36.200> got<00:01:36.350> up<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:37.160> travel<00:01:37.550> and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
Wow because on pioneers we take off if

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.450 
Wow because on pioneers we take off if
you<00:02:40.110> have<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.290> put<00:02:40.440> down<00:02:40.560> at<00:02:40.740> face<00:02:40.980> plain<00:02:41.250> order

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
you have to put down at face plain order

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.520 
you have to put down at face plain order
to<00:02:41.520> put<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.730> disc<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.090> huh<00:02:42.690> all<00:02:43.200> right<00:02:43.350> now
