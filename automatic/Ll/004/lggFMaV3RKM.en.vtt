00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
strong but self-healing that's what this

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.710 
strong but self-healing that's what this
video<00:01:33.010> is<00:01:33.070> about<00:01:33.160> the<00:01:33.550> next<00:01:33.790> three<00:01:34.360> minutes<00:01:34.479> or

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
just got a huge healing nerf in this

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.940 
just got a huge healing nerf in this
last<00:01:50.500> patch<00:01:50.800> and<00:01:51.100> this<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:53.320> is<00:01:53.500> from<00:01:53.800> that

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
last patch and this is this is from that

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.900 
last patch and this is this is from that
so<00:01:54.280> it<00:01:55.210> was<00:01:55.510> better<00:01:55.840> but<00:01:56.110> 14<00:01:56.590> seconds<00:01:57.130> 13<00:01:57.520> 14

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
so it was better but 14 seconds 13 14

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.090 
so it was better but 14 seconds 13 14
seconds<00:01:58.360> I'm<00:01:58.480> not<00:01:58.720> perfect<00:01:58.990> on<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.470> stopwatch

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
seconds I'm not perfect on the stopwatch

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.750 
seconds I'm not perfect on the stopwatch
there<00:02:00.550> is<00:02:00.760> pretty<00:02:01.210> damn<00:02:01.450> good<00:02:01.750> oh<00:02:02.310> my<00:02:03.310> warlock

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
there is pretty damn good oh my warlock

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.610 
there is pretty damn good oh my warlock
was<00:02:04.030> way<00:02:04.240> down<00:02:04.480> at<00:02:04.659> like<00:02:04.780> five<00:02:05.020> percent<00:02:05.440> health

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
was way down at like five percent health

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.110 
was way down at like five percent health
so<00:02:05.800> it's<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:06.010> little<00:02:06.159> bit<00:02:06.280> unfair<00:02:06.760> but<00:02:07.000> the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
so it's a little bit unfair but the

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.840 
so it's a little bit unfair but the
drain<00:02:07.420> life<00:02:07.659> glyph<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:09.340> drain<00:02:09.610> life

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
drain life glyph and the drain life

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.400 
drain life glyph and the drain life
talent<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:11.670> really<00:02:12.670> really<00:02:13.540> strong<00:02:13.989> for<00:02:14.380> a

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
talent is really really strong for a

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.800 
talent is really really strong for a
class<00:02:14.739> that<00:02:14.769> doesn't<00:02:15.489> have<00:02:15.670> any<00:02:15.970> heels<00:02:16.480> other

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
class that doesn't have any heels other

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.320 
class that doesn't have any heels other
than<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.080> health<00:02:17.290> stone<00:02:17.670> did<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.760> see<00:02:18.940> that<00:02:19.150> I

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
than a health stone did you see that I
