00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
so I'm gonna see if the setup is real

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.850 
so I'm gonna see if the setup is real
but<00:00:11.790> what's<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.150> Torterra<00:00:12.599> going<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.049> do<00:00:13.230> that

throughout the flavor blitz and that's
going<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> hit<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> metric<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.479> damage

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
going to hit in the metric is the damage

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.609 
going to hit in the metric is the damage
going<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.250> enough<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.970> our<00:01:27.060> mana<00:01:27.390> tan<00:01:27.780> with

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
you can just go down you know that

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.179 
you can just go down you know that
sceptile<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:54.990> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.380> mega<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.040> gonna

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
sceptile is going to mega so it's gonna

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.280 
sceptile is going to mega so it's gonna
make<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.399> at<00:01:56.610> least<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.909> neutral<00:01:57.360> hit<00:01:57.509> from<00:01:58.140> that

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290

seeing you know the double-team build up

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.240 
seeing you know the double-team build up
the<00:03:54.239> iron<00:03:54.420> defense<00:03:54.750> build<00:03:55.350> up<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:56.010> iron

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
the iron defense build up the iron

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.490 
the iron defense build up the iron
defense<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:56.910> weird<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.660> me<00:03:57.690> because<00:03:57.959> like<00:03:58.110> why

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
defense is weird to me because like why

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.720 
defense is weird to me because like why
are<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.680> using<00:03:58.799> iron<00:03:59.190> defense<00:03:59.519> if<00:03:59.700> the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
are you using iron defense if the

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.400 
are you using iron defense if the
opponent<00:04:00.180> doesn't<00:04:00.450> have<00:04:00.570> any<00:04:00.810> physical<00:04:00.989> hits

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
opponent doesn't have any physical hits

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.460 
opponent doesn't have any physical hits
I<00:04:01.590> guess<00:04:01.799> it's<00:04:02.010> just<00:04:02.100> because<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:03.750> kind

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
I guess it's just because so that kind

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.630 
I guess it's just because so that kind
of<00:04:04.530> kicks<00:04:04.709> out<00:04:04.830> a<00:04:04.860> pee-pee<00:04:05.190> stall<00:04:05.430> at<00:04:05.519> this

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
of kicks out a pee-pee stall at this

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.550 
of kicks out a pee-pee stall at this
point<00:04:05.880> that<00:04:06.090> we're<00:04:06.239> just<00:04:06.360> going<00:04:06.660> for<00:04:06.720> full

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
point that we're just going for full

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.949 
point that we're just going for full
turn<00:04:07.890> usage<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.519> whatnot<00:04:08.850> so<00:04:09.360> iron<00:04:09.630> defense

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
turn usage and whatnot so iron defense

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.690 
turn usage and whatnot so iron defense
the<00:04:10.500> fins<00:04:10.709> can't<00:04:10.950> go<00:04:11.100> any<00:04:11.250> higher<00:04:11.280> at<00:04:11.549> this

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
the fins can't go any higher at this

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.610 
the fins can't go any higher at this
point<00:04:11.970> it's<00:04:12.510> kind<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.720> spamming<00:04:13.170> out<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.380> iron

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
point it's kind of spamming out the iron

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.440 
point it's kind of spamming out the iron
defense<00:04:13.860> waiting<00:04:14.430> for<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:14.970> good<00:04:15.150> opportunity

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
defense waiting for a good opportunity

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.340 
defense waiting for a good opportunity
to<00:04:15.690> rest<00:04:15.930> so

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
to rest so

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.800 
to rest so
takes<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.590> bit<00:04:16.740> more<00:04:16.770> damage<00:04:17.459> max<00:04:17.850> evasion<00:04:18.450> max

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
takes a bit more damage max evasion max

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.350 
takes a bit more damage max evasion max
defenses<00:04:19.500> max<00:04:20.100> just<00:04:20.459> dodging<00:04:21.030> everything

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
defenses max just dodging everything

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.820 
defenses max just dodging everything
right<00:04:21.660> here<00:04:21.840> that's<00:04:22.290> what<00:04:22.410> we've<00:04:22.560> asked<00:04:22.800> you

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
right here that's what we've asked you

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.440 
right here that's what we've asked you
Don<00:04:23.040> with<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.250> rest<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.670> then<00:04:24.240> my<00:04:24.390> next

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
Don with the rest and then my next

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.200 
Don with the rest and then my next
thought<00:04:24.840> was<00:04:25.070> why<00:04:26.070> is<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.490> vastly<00:04:26.760> owed<00:04:27.060> on

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
thought was why is it vastly owed on

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.720 
thought was why is it vastly owed on
attacking<00:04:27.660> because<00:04:28.650> if<00:04:28.860> you're<00:04:29.040> using<00:04:29.070> easily

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
attacking because if you're using easily

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.500 
attacking because if you're using easily
use<00:04:29.850> three<00:04:30.060> moves

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
use three moves

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.800 
use three moves

rest double-team and iron defense now

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.570 
rest double-team and iron defense now
this<00:04:34.050> is<00:04:34.200> getting<00:04:34.470> kind<00:04:34.890> of<00:04:34.950> crazy<00:04:35.160> but

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
to be and then he goes and just becomes

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.860 
to be and then he goes and just becomes
an<00:05:02.220> unkillable<00:05:02.670> threat<00:05:03.180> with<00:05:03.390> all<00:05:03.510> these<00:05:03.660> dole

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.870 
an unkillable threat with all these dole
teams<00:05:04.110> so<00:05:04.290> there<00:05:04.770> was<00:05:04.860> out<00:05:04.980> double<00:05:05.280> teams<00:05:05.490> then

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
teams so there was out double teams then

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.670 
teams so there was out double teams then

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
greatest coverage against the bastard on

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.630 
greatest coverage against the bastard on
and<00:05:25.110> it's<00:05:25.530> working<00:05:25.920> in<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.070> basket<00:05:26.400> on<00:05:26.520> its

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
favor at this point so now it's like

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.190 
favor at this point so now it's like
we're<00:05:29.580> just<00:05:29.760> going<00:05:30.060> for<00:05:30.240> that<00:05:30.330> stole<00:05:30.960> right

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
we're just going for that stole right

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.560 
we're just going for that stole right
here<00:05:31.410> so<00:05:31.860> enough<00:05:32.430> times<00:05:32.670> after<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.030> rest<00:05:33.300> you

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
here so enough times after you rest you

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.540 
here so enough times after you rest you
know<00:05:33.690> since<00:05:34.110> it<00:05:34.260> takes<00:05:34.500> a<00:05:34.590> couple<00:05:34.830> of<00:05:34.890> turns<00:05:35.100> to

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
know since it takes a couple of turns to

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.040 
know since it takes a couple of turns to
get<00:05:35.700> through<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:35.970> rest<00:05:36.150> you're<00:05:36.390> not<00:05:36.540> using<00:05:36.930> up

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
get through the rest you're not using up

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.000 
get through the rest you're not using up
any<00:05:37.260> of<00:05:37.350> your<00:05:37.530> moves

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
any of your moves

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.200 
any of your moves
so<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.580> opponent's<00:05:38.880> just<00:05:39.000> gonna<00:05:39.120> be

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
so the opponent's just gonna be

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.820 
so the opponent's just gonna be
attacking<00:05:39.600> you<00:05:39.720> for<00:05:40.020> no<00:05:40.260> reason<00:05:40.290> they're

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830

missing all these crazy things are

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.020 
missing all these crazy things are
happen<00:05:42.810> so<00:05:43.020> even<00:05:43.530> against<00:05:43.860> two<00:05:43.980> opponents<00:05:44.030> the

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
happen so even against two opponents the

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.610 
happen so even against two opponents the
odds<00:05:45.180> of<00:05:45.390> them<00:05:45.540> struggling<00:05:46.050> themselves<00:05:46.200> is

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
odds of them struggling themselves is

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.950 
odds of them struggling themselves is
getting<00:05:47.280> pretty<00:05:47.520> high<00:05:47.790> now<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:48.600> interesting

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
getting pretty high now the interesting

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.540 
getting pretty high now the interesting
thing<00:05:49.320> I<00:05:49.410> realize<00:05:49.740> about<00:05:49.860> this<00:05:50.070> battle<00:05:50.430> is

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
thing I realize about this battle is

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.520 
thing I realize about this battle is
that<00:05:50.610> with<00:05:51.240> how<00:05:51.360> long<00:05:51.630> it's<00:05:51.900> going<00:05:52.080> it's<00:05:52.380> I

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
that with how long it's going it's I

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.250 
that with how long it's going it's I
believe<00:05:52.560> like<00:05:53.400> a<00:05:53.430> 58<00:05:54.150> turn<00:05:54.390> battle<00:05:54.870> or

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
believe like a 58 turn battle or

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.530 
believe like a 58 turn battle or
something<00:05:55.950> ridiculous<00:05:56.430> like<00:05:56.580> that<00:05:56.730> almost<00:05:57.180> 60

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
something ridiculous like that almost 60

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.510 
something ridiculous like that almost 60
turns<00:05:57.780> the<00:05:58.620> opponent<00:05:59.010> could<00:05:59.100> have<00:05:59.190> easily

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
turns the opponent could have easily

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.520 
turns the opponent could have easily
timer<00:05:59.970> stalled<00:06:00.330> that<00:06:00.780> by<00:06:00.900> taking<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.320> full

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
timer stalled that by taking the full

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.710 
timer stalled that by taking the full
time<00:06:01.740> of<00:06:01.950> the<00:06:02.040> timer<00:06:02.280> eventually<00:06:03.270> not<00:06:03.420> on<00:06:03.540> time

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
time of the timer eventually not on time

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.500 
time of the timer eventually not on time
turns<00:06:04.200> would<00:06:04.380> have<00:06:04.500> to<00:06:04.680> pass<00:06:04.830> to<00:06:05.190> make<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.640> all

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
turns would have to pass to make the all

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.970 
turns would have to pass to make the all
the<00:06:06.750> PP<00:06:06.990> still<00:06:07.200> out<00:06:07.320> and<00:06:07.500> that<00:06:07.710> could<00:06:07.890> have

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
the PP still out and that could have

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.040 
the PP still out and that could have
cost<00:06:08.130> for<00:06:08.430> win<00:06:08.610> right<00:06:08.760> here<00:06:09.000> but<00:06:09.570> at<00:06:09.810> this

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
cost for win right here but at this

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.430 
cost for win right here but at this
point<00:06:10.320> it's<00:06:10.590> hard<00:06:10.680> to<00:06:10.890> see<00:06:11.190> who<00:06:11.970> has<00:06:12.300> a<00:06:12.750> better
