microphone<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:27.900> doesn't<00:01:28.259> make

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
microphone and it really doesn't make

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.429 
microphone and it really doesn't make
much<00:01:28.380> sense<00:01:28.610> not<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.640> take<00:01:30.479> full<00:01:30.810> advantage<00:01:30.960> of
