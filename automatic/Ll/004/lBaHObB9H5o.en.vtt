today<00:00:05.080> we're<00:00:05.200> going<00:00:05.230> to<00:00:05.350> talk<00:00:05.529> about<00:00:05.710> smile

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.130 
today we're going to talk about smile

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.520 
today we're going to talk about smile
design<00:00:06.370> and<00:00:06.790> designing<00:00:07.450> a<00:00:07.600> smile<00:00:07.839> I<00:00:08.139> think<00:00:08.440> is

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
design and designing a smile I think is

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.220 
design and designing a smile I think is
what<00:00:08.680> separates<00:00:09.100> a<00:00:09.370> good<00:00:10.030> artistic<00:00:10.719> dentist

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230 
what separates a good artistic dentist

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.620 
what separates a good artistic dentist
from<00:00:11.650> a<00:00:11.950> great<00:00:12.309> artistic<00:00:12.730> Dennis<00:00:13.240> and<00:00:13.389> I<00:00:13.420> think

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
from a great artistic Dennis and I think

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.329 
from a great artistic Dennis and I think
too<00:00:13.780> many<00:00:13.870> dentists<00:00:14.349> totally<00:00:14.950> ignore<00:00:15.219> the

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:15.339 
too many dentists totally ignore the

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.710 
too many dentists totally ignore the
smile<00:00:15.610> design<00:00:15.820> process<00:00:16.360> they<00:00:16.540> take

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
smile design process they take

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.659 
smile design process they take
impressions<00:00:17.040> they<00:00:18.040> sent<00:00:18.310> to<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:18.490> laboratory

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:18.669 
impressions they sent to the laboratory

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.550 
impressions they sent to the laboratory
whatever<00:00:19.360> the<00:00:19.509> laboratory<00:00:19.960> decides<00:00:20.350> to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
whatever the laboratory decides to

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.250 
whatever the laboratory decides to
fabricate<00:00:21.130> as<00:00:21.310> part<00:00:21.520> of<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:21.640> smile<00:00:21.880> design

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
fabricate as part of the smile design

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.779 
fabricate as part of the smile design
they<00:00:23.260> put<00:00:23.470> it<00:00:23.560> in<00:00:23.710> and<00:00:23.949> they<00:00:24.100> hope<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.460> patient

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
they put it in and they hope the patient

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.910 
they put it in and they hope the patient
is<00:00:24.850> happy<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.330> you<00:00:26.260> know<00:00:26.289> Denise<00:00:26.619> is<00:00:26.800> our

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
is happy and you know Denise is our

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.740 
is happy and you know Denise is our
patient<00:00:27.099> today<00:00:27.340> and<00:00:27.670> Denise's<00:00:28.060> goal<00:00:28.300> is<00:00:28.599> to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
patient today and Denise's goal is to

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.410 
patient today and Denise's goal is to
have<00:00:28.900> prep<00:00:29.679> elasaur<00:00:30.039> very<00:00:30.670> minimal<00:00:31.179> prep

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
have prep elasaur very minimal prep

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.780 
have prep elasaur very minimal prep
veneers<00:00:31.539> and<00:00:31.990> I<00:00:32.199> think<00:00:33.010> in<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:33.190> concept<00:00:33.670> of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
veneers and I think in the concept of

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.969 
veneers and I think in the concept of
minimal<00:00:34.510> or<00:00:34.629> non<00:00:34.750> prep<00:00:35.019> veneers<00:00:35.110> I<00:00:35.589> think<00:00:35.860> too

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:35.979 
minimal or non prep veneers I think too

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:38.700 
minimal or non prep veneers I think too
many<00:00:36.100> dentists<00:00:36.640> think<00:00:37.540> of<00:00:37.780> that<00:00:38.199> as<00:00:38.440> almost

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
many dentists think of that as almost

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.520 
many dentists think of that as almost
like<00:00:38.949> a<00:00:39.129> cheap<00:00:39.430> veneer<00:00:39.610> or<00:00:40.000> a<00:00:40.540> lesser<00:00:41.229> veneer

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
like a cheap veneer or a lesser veneer

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.740 
like a cheap veneer or a lesser veneer
and<00:00:41.620> I<00:00:41.680> think<00:00:41.830> that's<00:00:41.979> a<00:00:42.040> huge<00:00:42.339> mistake<00:00:42.820> and<00:00:43.089> I

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
and I think that's a huge mistake and I

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.180 
and I think that's a huge mistake and I
think<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:44.170> lot<00:00:44.440> of<00:00:44.470> dentists<00:00:44.949> when<00:00:45.070> they're

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
think a lot of dentists when they're

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.009 
think a lot of dentists when they're
doing<00:00:45.400> these<00:00:45.489> non<00:00:45.790> prep<00:00:46.120> veneers<00:00:46.299> or<00:00:46.659> minimal

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
doing these non prep veneers or minimal

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.280 
doing these non prep veneers or minimal
prep<00:00:47.229> manures<00:00:47.530> again<00:00:48.220> just<00:00:48.430> take<00:00:48.580> impressions

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
prep manures again just take impressions

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.689 
prep manures again just take impressions
sends<00:00:50.290> the<00:00:50.379> laboratory<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.129> have<00:00:51.580> the

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
sends the laboratory and have the

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.520 
sends the laboratory and have the
laboratory<00:00:52.239> or<00:00:52.330> the<00:00:52.420> ceramics<00:00:52.960> decide<00:00:53.290> what

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
laboratory or the ceramics decide what

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.380 
laboratory or the ceramics decide what
the<00:00:53.680> smile<00:00:53.920> is<00:00:54.070> going<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.220> look<00:00:54.369> like<00:00:54.400> I<00:00:54.790> think

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
the smile is going to look like I think

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.530 
the smile is going to look like I think
it's<00:00:55.510> important<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.820> make<00:00:57.820> sure<00:00:57.850> that<00:00:58.150> we<00:00:58.269> are

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
it's important to make sure that we are

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.810 
it's important to make sure that we are
part<00:00:58.989> of<00:00:59.140> this<00:00:59.290> design<00:00:59.650> process<00:01:00.190> even<00:01:00.580> with

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
part of this design process even with

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.939 
part of this design process even with
prep<00:01:01.089> list<00:01:01.299> veneers<00:01:01.629> so<00:01:01.869> that<00:01:02.080> we<00:01:02.650> can<00:01:02.769> get<00:01:02.890> a

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
prep list veneers so that we can get a

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.359 
prep list veneers so that we can get a
result<00:01:03.430> that<00:01:03.790> will<00:01:04.659> rival<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.979> we<00:01:06.159> will

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
result that will rival what we will

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.460 
result that will rival what we will
typically<00:01:06.790> get<00:01:07.150> or<00:01:07.450> at<00:01:07.570> least<00:01:07.720> come<00:01:07.930> close<00:01:07.960> to

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
typically get or at least come close to

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.200 
typically get or at least come close to
what<00:01:08.590> will<00:01:08.740> typically<00:01:09.070> get<00:01:09.340> with<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.880> prep

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
what will typically get with a prep

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.480 
what will typically get with a prep
veneer<00:01:10.570> all<00:01:11.410> right<00:01:11.560> as<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:11.920> mentioned<00:01:11.950> if<00:01:12.370> we

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
veneer all right as I mentioned if we

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.430 
veneer all right as I mentioned if we
know<00:01:12.700> where<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.270> facial<00:01:13.600> surfaces<00:01:14.080> are<00:01:14.200> going

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
know where the facial surfaces are going

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.760 
know where the facial surfaces are going
to<00:01:14.560> be<00:01:14.680> of<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:14.920> Central's<00:01:15.370> the<00:01:15.790> lab<00:01:16.030> can<00:01:16.360> then

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
to be of the Central's the lab can then

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.890 
to be of the Central's the lab can then
ideally<00:01:17.770> design<00:01:18.300> the<00:01:19.300> laterals<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:19.840> the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
ideally design the laterals and the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.780 
ideally design the laterals and the
canines<00:01:20.230> but<00:01:20.380> it's<00:01:20.500> a<00:01:20.590> buckle<00:01:20.920> corridor<00:01:21.430> that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
canines but it's a buckle corridor that

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.730 
canines but it's a buckle corridor that
often<00:01:22.210> is<00:01:22.360> insufficient<00:01:23.260> and<00:01:23.410> we'll<00:01:23.530> give

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
often is insufficient and we'll give

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.980 
often is insufficient and we'll give
that<00:01:23.770> clap<00:01:24.190> smile<00:01:24.550> looking<00:01:24.910> when<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.480> Denise's

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
that clap smile looking when a Denise's

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.380 
that clap smile looking when a Denise's
goal<00:01:26.230> was<00:01:26.500> as<00:01:26.740> we<00:01:26.860> talked<00:01:27.130> earlier<00:01:27.310> was<00:01:27.820> she

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
goal was as we talked earlier was she

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.780 
goal was as we talked earlier was she
wanted<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:28.750> broader<00:01:29.050> smile<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:29.860> so<00:01:30.640> we're

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
wanted a broader smile and so we're

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.149 
wanted a broader smile and so we're
premolars<00:01:31.330> are<00:01:31.450> actually<00:01:31.720> set<00:01:32.020> back<00:01:32.290> and<00:01:32.620> I

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
premolars are actually set back and I

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.980 
premolars are actually set back and I
can<00:01:33.340> just<00:01:33.610> show<00:01:33.970> a<00:01:34.000> photo<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.420> this<00:01:34.480> Rams<00:01:34.780> and

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
can just show a photo to this Rams and

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.810 
can just show a photo to this Rams and
say<00:01:35.170> bring<00:01:35.650> out<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:35.920> buckle<00:01:36.220> quarter<00:01:36.580> but

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
say bring out the buckle quarter but

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.730 
say bring out the buckle quarter but
what<00:01:37.300> does<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.450> really<00:01:37.600> mean<00:01:37.960> a<00:01:38.170> millimeter

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
what does that really mean a millimeter

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.310 
what does that really mean a millimeter
an<00:01:39.100> inch<00:01:39.580> a<00:01:39.940> half<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.180> millimeter<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:41.140> we're

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
an inch a half a millimeter so we're

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.980 
an inch a half a millimeter so we're
going<00:01:41.409> to<00:01:41.530> actually<00:01:41.710> try<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.130> duplicate<00:01:42.520> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
going to actually try to duplicate that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.600 
going to actually try to duplicate that
ideally<00:01:43.990> in<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.830> mouth<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:45.340> again<00:01:45.490> it

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
ideally in the mouth and again it

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.430 
ideally in the mouth and again it
doesn't<00:01:45.790> have<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.120> be<00:01:46.150> perfectly<00:01:46.810> smooth<00:01:47.260> or

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
doesn't have to be perfectly smooth or

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.980 
doesn't have to be perfectly smooth or
ideal<00:01:47.770> it's<00:01:48.040> just<00:01:48.370> a<00:01:48.490> dimension<00:01:49.150> and<00:01:49.300> then<00:01:49.900> the

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
ideal it's just a dimension and then the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.149 
ideal it's just a dimension and then the
ceramics<00:01:50.470> can<00:01:50.590> match<00:01:50.830> that<00:01:52.650> so<00:01:53.650> obviously<00:01:54.010> we

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
ceramics can match that so obviously we

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.560 
ceramics can match that so obviously we
need<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.370> bring<00:01:54.490> out<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.790> canine<00:01:55.180> but<00:01:55.450> we're

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
need to bring out the canine but we're

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.880 
need to bring out the canine but we're
going<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.720> go<00:01:55.900> ahead<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.080> do<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.320> premolar

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
going to go ahead and do it premolar

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:10.130 
going to go ahead and do it premolar
first<00:01:57.159> again<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.700> bulk<00:01:58.030> of<00:01:58.210> resin

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.170 

and<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.800> is

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and this is

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.509 
and this is
very<00:02:12.900> very<00:02:13.200> common<00:02:13.469> in<00:02:13.680> these<00:02:13.769> post<00:02:14.069> ortho

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
very very common in these post ortho

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:15.740 
very very common in these post ortho
cases<00:02:14.849> go<00:02:15.000> ahead<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.239> cure<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.510> please

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
cases go ahead and cure that please

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:30.160 
cases go ahead and cure that please
