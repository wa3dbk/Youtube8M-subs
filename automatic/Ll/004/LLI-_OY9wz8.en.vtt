00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
ordinary USB 3 thumb drive this is the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.189 
ordinary USB 3 thumb drive this is the
hyper<00:00:13.740> X<00:00:14.009> series<00:00:14.190> from<00:00:14.610> Kingston<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
hyper X series from Kingston and the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.810 
hyper X series from Kingston and the
hyper<00:00:16.529> X<00:00:16.680> series<00:00:16.830> are<00:00:17.160> supposed<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
hyper X series are supposed to be the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.810 
hyper X series are supposed to be the
fastest<00:00:18.359> rise<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:20.220> would<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.670> say

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
fastest rise and I would have to say

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.939 
fastest rise and I would have to say
this<00:00:20.970> would<00:00:21.480> be<00:00:21.630> one<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.990> fastest<00:00:22.560> USB

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
this would be one of the fastest USB

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.460 
this would be one of the fastest USB

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
to say this is insanely fast because the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.690 
to say this is insanely fast because the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
other USB 3 thumb drives that I've used

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.230 
other USB 3 thumb drives that I've used
max<00:01:24.090> out<00:01:24.330> at<00:01:24.360> about<00:01:24.560> 115<00:01:25.560> 225<00:01:26.460> MB<00:01:26.729> per<00:01:26.880> second

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.149 
max out at about 115 225 MB per second
and<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:28.259> just<00:01:28.470> give<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> comparison

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
and to just give you a comparison

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.760 
and to just give you a comparison
between<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.930> traditional<00:01:31.560> hard

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
between this and a traditional hard

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.960 
between this and a traditional hard
drive<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.189> might<00:01:32.460> use

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
drive that you might use

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.870 
drive that you might use
that's<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.270> 7200<00:01:34.020> rpm<00:01:34.320> hard<00:01:34.380> drive<00:01:34.640> can<00:01:35.640> get<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
that's a 7200 rpm hard drive can get a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.810 
that's a 7200 rpm hard drive can get a
transfer<00:01:36.509> speed<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.350> about<00:01:37.470> 120<00:01:38.430> MB<00:01:38.670> per

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
transfer speed of about 120 MB per

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.219 
transfer speed of about 120 MB per
second<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:40.490> HyperX<00:01:41.509> USB<00:01:42.509> 3<00:01:42.750> thumb<00:01:42.990> drive

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
second so this HyperX USB 3 thumb drive

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
second so this HyperX USB 3 thumb drive
is<00:01:43.500> will<00:01:43.770> be<00:01:43.890> faster<00:01:44.310> than<00:01:44.490> your<00:01:44.700> traditional

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
is will be faster than your traditional

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.270 
is will be faster than your traditional
hard<00:01:45.659> drive<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.470> say<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.829> this

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
hard drive and I have to say that this

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.870 
hard drive and I have to say that this
is<00:01:47.460> almost<00:01:47.820> as<00:01:48.060> fast<00:01:48.509> as<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.810> SATA<00:01:49.409> 2<00:01:49.799> SSD<00:01:50.610> drive

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
is almost as fast as a SATA 2 SSD drive

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.870 
is almost as fast as a SATA 2 SSD drive
and<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.509> states<00:01:51.899> here<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:53.280> drive<00:01:53.579> comes

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
and it states here that this drive comes

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.469 
and it states here that this drive comes
with<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.180> five-year<00:01:54.780> warranty<00:01:54.810> from<00:01:55.770> Kingston

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.650 
i am suspecting that my USB 3 port will
be<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.380> limiting<00:04:39.650> factor<00:04:40.100> not<00:04:40.340> this<00:04:40.610> drive<00:04:40.940> so

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
be the limiting factor not this drive so
