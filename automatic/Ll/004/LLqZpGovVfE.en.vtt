00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
there's four of them on the smallest

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.200 
there's four of them on the smallest
tower<00:00:51.190> so<00:00:52.190> now<00:00:52.309> you<00:00:52.370> can<00:00:52.520> start<00:00:52.730> adding<00:00:52.879> in<00:00:53.090> all

bricks

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.870 
bricks
I<00:01:14.330> grab<00:01:14.990> a<00:01:15.259> little<00:01:15.530> tortilla<00:01:16.070> on<00:01:16.280> blending

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
I grab a little tortilla on blending

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.359 
I grab a little tortilla on blending
stick<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:17.509> start<00:01:18.350> kind<00:01:18.649> of<00:01:18.740> blending<00:01:19.100> stuff

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
stick and start kind of blending stuff

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.680 
stick and start kind of blending stuff
together<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.970> make<00:01:20.119> it<00:01:20.240> all<00:01:20.390> mesh<00:01:22.600> then<00:01:23.600> I

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
together to make it all mesh then I

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.260 
together to make it all mesh then I
start<00:01:23.990> outlining<00:01:24.380> more<00:01:24.860> details<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.789> this

start outlining more details and this
line<00:01:26.509> that<00:01:26.690> I'm<00:01:26.780> drawing<00:01:26.810> now<00:01:27.140> there's<00:01:27.590> a

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
line that I'm drawing now there's a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.990 
line that I'm drawing now there's a
couple<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:28.039> those<00:01:28.250> just<00:01:29.410> little<00:01:30.550> half<00:01:31.550> circle

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
of the towers and the windows then I

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.550 
of the towers and the windows then I
just<00:01:37.190> start<00:01:37.570> doing<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.780> same<00:01:39.020> thing<00:01:39.289> I<00:01:39.380> did

just start doing the same thing I did
before<00:01:39.710> just<00:01:39.979> shading<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:41.020> some<00:01:42.020> areas<00:01:42.410> and

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
before just shading in some areas and

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.370

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.529 
then later on I'll go in with the little
blending<00:01:45.860> stick<00:01:46.130> again<00:01:46.459> and<00:01:46.700> smooth<00:01:47.300> it<00:01:47.450> all

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.920 

so<00:05:07.520> now<00:05:07.610> we<00:05:07.670> can<00:05:07.850> fill<00:05:08.090> them<00:05:08.210> all<00:05:08.330> in<00:05:08.510> with<00:05:08.720> the

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
so now we can fill them all in with the

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.390 
so now we can fill them all in with the
charcoal<00:05:10.330> because<00:05:11.950> of<00:05:12.950> course<00:05:13.160> all<00:05:13.280> the

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
charcoal because of course all the

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.360 
charcoal because of course all the
lights<00:05:13.580> coming<00:05:13.970> from<00:05:14.090> in<00:05:14.240> front<00:05:14.540> of<00:05:14.630> them<00:05:14.750> so

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
lights coming from in front of them so

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.420 
lights coming from in front of them so
the<00:05:16.370> shadow<00:05:16.610> is<00:05:16.730> gonna<00:05:16.880> be<00:05:17.030> behind<00:05:17.390> them<00:05:17.570> so

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
the shadow is gonna be behind them so

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.660 
the shadow is gonna be behind them so
you<00:05:19.430> can<00:05:19.580> leave<00:05:19.730> the<00:05:19.850> edges<00:05:20.150> light<00:05:20.420> but<00:05:21.670> the

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
you can leave the edges light but the

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:35.050 
you can leave the edges light but the
rest<00:05:22.850> is<00:05:23.000> all<00:05:23.210> filled<00:05:23.900> in<00:05:24.080> black<00:05:33.940> you<00:05:34.940> can

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
rest is all filled in black you can

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.820 
rest is all filled in black you can
start<00:05:35.330> on<00:05:35.390> the<00:05:35.510> fog<00:05:35.780> just<00:05:36.230> grab<00:05:36.470> a<00:05:36.500> white

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
start on the fog just grab a white

start on the fog just grab a white
charcoal<00:05:37.280> pencil<00:05:37.700> and<00:05:38.830> start<00:05:39.830> filling<00:05:40.790> in

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
charcoal pencil and start filling in

charcoal pencil and start filling in
some<00:05:42.010> some<00:05:43.010> fog<00:05:43.280> around<00:05:43.490> the<00:05:43.730> base<00:05:43.910> you<00:05:44.300> just

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
some some fog around the base you just

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.630 
some some fog around the base you just
draw<00:05:45.080> it<00:05:45.170> on<00:05:45.260> there<00:05:45.560> it's<00:05:45.890> nothing<00:05:46.070> really<00:05:46.370> to

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
draw it on there it's nothing really to

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.850 
draw it on there it's nothing really to
it<00:05:47.080> just<00:05:48.080> uh<00:05:48.370> it<00:05:49.370> always<00:05:49.490> helps<00:05:49.880> to<00:05:50.060> see<00:05:50.860> like

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
it just uh it always helps to see like

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.710 
it just uh it always helps to see like
some<00:05:52.220> pictures<00:05:52.610> of<00:05:52.790> fog<00:05:53.030> you<00:05:53.300> can<00:05:53.330> make<00:05:53.600> it

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
some pictures of fog you can make it

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.630 
some pictures of fog you can make it
look<00:05:53.840> more<00:05:53.990> natural<00:05:55.360> but<00:05:56.360> you<00:05:56.660> know<00:05:57.110> it<00:05:57.230> just

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
look more natural but you know it just

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.250 
look more natural but you know it just
kind<00:05:58.640> of<00:05:58.670> hangs<00:05:58.850> out<00:05:59.060> on<00:05:59.090> the<00:05:59.330> ground<00:05:59.600> so<00:05:59.990> you

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
kind of hangs out on the ground so you

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.690 
kind of hangs out on the ground so you
draw<00:06:00.590> it<00:06:00.650> around<00:06:00.740> the<00:06:00.950> base<00:06:01.130> of<00:06:01.430> all<00:06:01.550> the

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
draw it around the base of all the

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.920 
draw it around the base of all the
gravestones

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.850 

then<00:06:08.930> you<00:06:08.990> can<00:06:09.139> switch<00:06:09.259> to<00:06:09.409> the<00:06:09.590> little

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
then you can switch to the little

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.480 
then you can switch to the little
blending<00:06:10.250> stick<00:06:10.580> and<00:06:11.110> smooth<00:06:12.110> it<00:06:12.319> all<00:06:12.439> out

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
blending stick and smooth it all out

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.469 
blending stick and smooth it all out
makes<00:06:13.490> it<00:06:13.610> look<00:06:13.759> a<00:06:13.849> lot<00:06:13.939> better<00:06:14.120> you<00:06:14.330> don't

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
makes it look a lot better you don't

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.080 
makes it look a lot better you don't
have<00:06:14.659> to<00:06:14.810> use<00:06:14.930> the<00:06:15.050> blending<00:06:15.349> stick<00:06:15.620> I<00:06:16.430> like<00:06:16.939> to

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
have to use the blending stick I like to

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.779 
have to use the blending stick I like to
use<00:06:17.210> it<00:06:17.360> around<00:06:17.569> the<00:06:17.750> graves<00:06:18.430> just<00:06:19.430> so<00:06:19.639> that<00:06:19.759> I

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
use it around the graves just so that I

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.320 
use it around the graves just so that I
don't<00:06:19.969> mess<00:06:20.810> up<00:06:20.870> the<00:06:21.139> graves<00:06:21.819> but<00:06:22.819> when<00:06:23.270> you

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
don't mess up the graves but when you

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.640 
don't mess up the graves but when you
start<00:06:23.569> adding<00:06:23.689> the<00:06:23.900> fog<00:06:24.110> around<00:06:24.349> the<00:06:24.469> castle

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
start adding the fog around the castle

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:31.179 
start adding the fog around the castle
you<00:06:24.979> can<00:06:25.009> just<00:06:25.280> use<00:06:25.460> your<00:06:25.490> finger<00:06:29.919> you<00:06:30.919> can<00:06:31.039> see

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:31.189 
you can just use your finger you can see

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:33.640 
you can just use your finger you can see
I've<00:06:31.310> added<00:06:31.460> a<00:06:31.639> lot<00:06:31.849> more<00:06:32.090> around<00:06:32.750> some<00:06:33.500> more

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
I've added a lot more around some more

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.469 
I've added a lot more around some more
black<00:06:33.889> at<00:06:34.069> the<00:06:34.159> bottom<00:06:34.490> and<00:06:34.789> this<00:06:35.030> is<00:06:35.180> a<00:06:35.210> part

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 
black at the bottom and this is a part

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:37.119 
black at the bottom and this is a part
where<00:06:35.569> you<00:06:35.659> can<00:06:35.780> use<00:06:35.900> your<00:06:36.020> fingers<00:06:36.439> to<00:06:36.800> blend

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:37.129 
where you can use your fingers to blend

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:40.119 
where you can use your fingers to blend
it<00:06:37.599> because<00:06:38.599> it's<00:06:39.229> far<00:06:39.439> enough<00:06:39.560> away<00:06:39.770> from<00:06:39.889> the

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:40.129 
it because it's far enough away from the

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.189 
it because it's far enough away from the
gravestones<00:06:40.759> so<00:06:41.120> you<00:06:41.180> just<00:06:41.389> draw<00:06:41.689> it<00:06:41.810> on<00:06:41.900> there

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 
gravestones so you just draw it on there

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.499 
gravestones so you just draw it on there
I<00:06:42.409> have<00:06:42.800> it<00:06:43.099> coming<00:06:43.400> out<00:06:43.520> of<00:06:43.669> the<00:06:43.849> castle<00:06:44.419> I

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:44.509 
I have it coming out of the castle I

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:45.879 
I have it coming out of the castle I
thought<00:06:44.719> it<00:06:44.810> looks<00:06:44.960> pretty<00:06:45.199> cool<00:06:45.409> coming<00:06:45.770> with

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:45.889 
thought it looks pretty cool coming with

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.119 
thought it looks pretty cool coming with
a<00:06:45.949> castle<00:06:46.509> so<00:06:47.509> you<00:06:48.349> start<00:06:48.620> drawing<00:06:48.860> it<00:06:49.039> on

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:49.129 
a castle so you start drawing it on

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:52.990 
a castle so you start drawing it on
there<00:06:49.400> then<00:06:50.300> switch<00:06:50.870> and<00:06:51.340> start<00:06:52.340> blending<00:06:52.729> it

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
there then switch and start blending it

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.839 
there then switch and start blending it
all<00:06:53.120> out<00:06:53.330> making<00:06:53.659> it<00:06:53.750> nice<00:06:53.930> and<00:06:54.139> smooth<00:06:54.849> makes

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:55.849 
all out making it nice and smooth makes

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.749 
all out making it nice and smooth makes
it<00:06:56.029> much<00:06:56.120> more<00:06:56.389> realistic<00:06:56.750> and<00:06:57.490> that's<00:06:58.490> really

00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:58.759 
it much more realistic and that's really

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:12.590 
it much more realistic and that's really
all<00:06:58.939> there<00:06:59.090> is<00:06:59.120> to<00:06:59.210> it

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:12.600 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.170 

and<00:07:13.600> I<00:07:13.660> had<00:07:13.810> it<00:07:13.900> a<00:07:13.960> couple<00:07:14.139> stars<00:07:14.470> in<00:07:14.650> up<00:07:14.770> there

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 
and I had it a couple stars in up there

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.820 
and I had it a couple stars in up there
