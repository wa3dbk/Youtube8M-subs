guy's got 240 horses to 260 foot-pounds
of<00:01:03.960> torque<00:01:04.020> and<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:05.220> my<00:01:05.339> opinion<00:01:05.489> it's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
of torque and in my opinion it's

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.570 
of torque and in my opinion it's
probably<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:07.050> best<00:01:07.320> handling<00:01:07.950> vehicle<00:01:08.430> in

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
probably the best handling vehicle in

the turns
it's<00:01:24.850> basically

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.270

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
oh you can watch this lots of tires down

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.529 
oh you can watch this lots of tires down
there<00:01:32.429> to<00:01:32.490> show<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:32.909> tires<00:01:33.090> are<00:01:33.329> giving

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
there to show you what tires are giving

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.169 
there to show you what tires are giving
torque<00:01:33.920> from<00:01:34.920> North<00:01:35.460> because<00:01:35.670> basically<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
torque from North because basically the

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.609 
torque from North because basically the
way<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.450> oil<00:01:36.509> drive<00:01:36.899> system<00:01:37.259> works<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.530> this

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
way the oil drive system works in this

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.230 
way the oil drive system works in this
normal<00:01:38.009> all-wheel<00:01:38.280> drive<00:01:38.520> systems<00:01:38.939> they<00:01:39.060> help

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
normal all-wheel drive systems they help

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.749 
normal all-wheel drive systems they help
you<00:01:39.359> improve<00:01:39.719> driving<00:01:40.109> on<00:01:40.409> wet<00:01:41.250> conditions

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
you improve driving on wet conditions

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.139 
you improve driving on wet conditions
this<00:01:41.969> helps<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.420> improve<00:01:42.539> your<00:01:42.750> driving<00:01:43.079> on

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
dry conditions pickup them yeah turbo

00:01:53.819 --> 00:02:03.230 
dry conditions pickup them yeah turbo
right<00:01:53.969> oh<00:01:56.869> yeah<00:01:57.869> give<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.109> give<00:01:58.530> it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.260 

Wow<00:02:06.560> it's<00:02:07.560> super<00:02:08.220> handling<00:02:08.489> all-wheel<00:02:08.789> drive

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
Wow it's super handling all-wheel drive

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.699 
Wow it's super handling all-wheel drive
in<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.630> basically<00:02:10.020> when<00:02:10.259> you're<00:02:10.349> taking<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
in it basically when you're taking a

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.229 
in it basically when you're taking a
turn<00:02:10.890> it'll<00:02:11.130> actually<00:02:11.340> push<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.970> into<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
turn it'll actually push you into the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.510 
turn it'll actually push you into the
turn<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:13.170> although<00:02:13.410> joy<00:02:13.650> system<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.310> is

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
turn the although joy system and this is

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.630 
turn the although joy system and this is
some<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:15.780> kind<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.200> basically<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:17.040> senses<00:02:17.520> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
some it kind of basically it senses the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.089 
some it kind of basically it senses the
road<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:18.450> it'll<00:02:18.630> know<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:19.230> split-second

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
road and so it'll know a split-second

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.770 
road and so it'll know a split-second
ahead<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.400> time<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.209> front<00:02:21.480> left<00:02:21.660> tire

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
ahead of time that that front left tire

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.440 
ahead of time that that front left tire
is<00:02:22.019> going<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.260> spin<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.310> show<00:02:23.580> compensate<00:02:24.209> for

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
is going to spin and show compensate for

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.500 
is going to spin and show compensate for
it<00:02:24.890> in<00:02:25.890> backhoe<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.489> nav<00:02:28.040> hide<00:02:29.040> restaurants

that's nice the iPod adapter standard in

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.619 
that's nice the iPod adapter standard in
both<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.579> them<00:03:01.700> if<00:03:01.909> you<00:03:02.090> went<00:03:02.269> with<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.450> base

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
both of them if you went with the base

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.849 
both of them if you went with the base
you<00:03:02.840> would<00:03:02.959> lose<00:03:03.140> voice<00:03:04.040> automated<00:03:05.650> is<00:03:06.650> that
