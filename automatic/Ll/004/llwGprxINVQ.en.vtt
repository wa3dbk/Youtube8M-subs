00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
wallet being opened like that's all they

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.430 
wallet being opened like that's all they
do<00:02:36.459> in<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.940> video<00:02:37.209> they<00:02:37.390> just<00:02:37.420> show<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.870> wallet

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
do in the video they just show a wallet

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
what's more confusing is that this is

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.110 
what's more confusing is that this is
the<00:02:43.660> only<00:02:43.870> video<00:02:44.410> in<00:02:44.829> that<00:02:45.160> channel<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.880> he
