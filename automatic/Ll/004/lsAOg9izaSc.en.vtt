00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:27.949 
with things I did in the Pokemon games

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.289 
with things I did in the Pokemon games
the<00:03:28.949> first<00:03:29.099> generation<00:03:29.760> games<00:03:29.970> are<00:03:30.150> pretty

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
the first generation games are pretty

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.539 
the first generation games are pretty
short<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:30.810> back<00:03:31.139> then<00:03:31.409> it<00:03:31.620> felt<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.519> took

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
short and back then it felt like it took

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.789 
short and back then it felt like it took
me<00:03:32.760> years<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.419> finally<00:03:33.840> beat<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.290> Elite<00:03:34.470> Four

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.920 
and received the capability of entering
cerulean<00:03:37.440> cave<00:03:37.470> once<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.579> got<00:03:38.819> in<00:03:39.060> there<00:03:39.389> is<00:03:39.870> a

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
cerulean cave once you got in there is a

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.809 
cerulean cave once you got in there is a
confusing<00:03:40.620> maze<00:03:40.829> full<00:03:41.099> of<00:03:41.220> twists<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.699> turns

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
confusing maze full of twists and turns

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.670 
confusing maze full of twists and turns
and<00:03:42.269> little<00:03:42.540> old<00:03:42.599> me<00:03:42.840> could<00:03:43.079> not<00:03:43.319> for<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.590> life

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
and little old me could not for the life

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.969 
and little old me could not for the life
of<00:03:44.040> me<00:03:44.129> figure<00:03:44.159> out<00:03:44.519> how<00:03:44.909> to<00:03:44.970> get<00:03:45.329> to<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.659> end

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:45.979 
of me figure out how to get to the end

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:49.520 
of me figure out how to get to the end
but<00:03:46.979> when<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.220> finally<00:03:47.639> did<00:03:48.060> Mewtwo<00:03:49.019> was<00:03:49.260> there

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
but when I finally did Mewtwo was there

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.890 
but when I finally did Mewtwo was there
the<00:03:49.949> most<00:03:50.129> powerful<00:03:50.819> Pokemon<00:03:51.329> at<00:03:51.419> that<00:03:51.599> point

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
the most powerful Pokemon at that point

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.170 
the most powerful Pokemon at that point
in<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.199> Pokemon<00:03:52.620> lifecycle<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.609> honestly

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
in the Pokemon lifecycle I honestly

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.270 
in the Pokemon lifecycle I honestly
probably<00:03:54.720> just<00:03:55.079> threw<00:03:55.229> a<00:03:55.290> master<00:03:55.769> ball<00:03:55.949> so

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
probably just threw a master ball so

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.219 
probably just threw a master ball so
that's<00:03:56.400> where<00:03:56.669> the<00:03:56.760> epic<00:03:57.090> storytelling<00:03:57.810> ends

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
that's where the epic storytelling ends

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.619 
that's where the epic storytelling ends
but<00:03:58.739> back<00:03:58.949> then<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.459> signaled<00:03:59.939> the<00:04:00.120> end<00:04:00.299> of

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
but back then it signaled the end of

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.409 
but back then it signaled the end of
your<00:04:00.750> Pokemon<00:04:01.290> journey<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:02.129> my<00:04:02.519> lord<00:04:02.909> was<00:04:03.269> it

having one final battle to claim your
dominance<00:05:08.190> over<00:05:08.520> him<00:05:08.669> is<00:05:08.849> just<00:05:09.060> so<00:05:09.270> rewarding

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
dominance over him is just so rewarding

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.290 
dominance over him is just so rewarding
and<00:05:09.930> badass<00:05:10.430> everyone<00:05:11.430> feels<00:05:11.669> connected<00:05:12.180> to

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
and badass everyone feels connected to

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.150 
and badass everyone feels connected to
the<00:05:12.389> first<00:05:12.599> generation<00:05:13.139> with<00:05:13.530> moments<00:05:13.979> like

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
the first generation with moments like

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.900 
the first generation with moments like
this<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:14.820> it's<00:05:15.599> no<00:05:16.020> wonder<00:05:16.380> number<00:05:17.250> one

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
this and it's no wonder number one

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.520 
this and it's no wonder number one
the<00:05:18.120> final<00:05:18.509> battle<00:05:18.630> against<00:05:19.050> meds<00:05:19.289> on<00:05:19.410> the

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
the final battle against meds on the

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.260 
the final battle against meds on the
peak<00:05:19.740> of<00:05:19.889> mount<00:05:20.130> Silver<00:05:20.610> in<00:05:20.699> pokemon<00:05:21.060> gold

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.870 
and SoulSilver
I<00:05:24.449> think<00:05:25.349> this<00:05:25.470> is<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.770> cliche<00:05:26.220> choice<00:05:26.520> one

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
I think this is the cliche choice one

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.060 
I think this is the cliche choice one
that<00:05:27.030> everyone<00:05:27.780> would<00:05:27.930> pick<00:05:28.259> and<00:05:28.470> some<00:05:28.710> people

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
that everyone would pick and some people

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.439 
that everyone would pick and some people
may<00:05:29.220> get<00:05:29.370> annoyed<00:05:29.610> at<00:05:29.760> me<00:05:29.880> for<00:05:30.060> being<00:05:30.150> so

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
may get annoyed at me for being so

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.360 
may get annoyed at me for being so
predictable<00:05:31.110> and<00:05:31.349> for<00:05:31.800> not<00:05:31.979> being<00:05:32.159> more

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
predictable and for not being more

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.430 
predictable and for not being more
creative<00:05:32.520> but<00:05:33.479> this<00:05:33.630> is<00:05:33.780> one<00:05:33.930> of<00:05:34.020> the<00:05:34.080> reasons

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
creative but this is one of the reasons

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.930 
creative but this is one of the reasons
why<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.620> second<00:05:35.070> generation<00:05:35.280> games<00:05:35.729> my

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
why the second generation games my

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.360 
why the second generation games my
favorite<00:05:36.389> games<00:05:36.630> ever<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:37.650> whole<00:05:37.860> game<00:05:38.099> leads
