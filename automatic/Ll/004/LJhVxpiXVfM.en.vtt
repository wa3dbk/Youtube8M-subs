with their special moves it actually
looks<00:02:01.880> like<00:02:02.780> how<00:02:03.050> they<00:02:03.380> would<00:02:03.470> actually<00:02:03.800> do<00:02:03.950> it

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
looks like how they would actually do it

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.700 
looks like how they would actually do it
like<00:02:04.190> in<00:02:04.310> real<00:02:04.430> life<00:02:04.550> or<00:02:04.700> something<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:05.690> yeah<00:02:06.680> I

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
like in real life or something so yeah I

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.040 
like in real life or something so yeah I
like<00:02:07.340> nightcrawlers<00:02:08.149> design<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.720> best

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
like nightcrawlers design the best

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.200 
like nightcrawlers design the best
because<00:02:09.350> he<00:02:10.220> disappears<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:10.850> kind<00:02:11.000> of<00:02:11.060> does

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
because he disappears it kind of does

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.560 
because he disappears it kind of does
this<00:02:11.420> explosion<00:02:11.960> thing<00:02:12.350> which<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.570> basically

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
this explosion thing which is basically

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.870 
this explosion thing which is basically
what<00:02:14.690> Nightcrawler<00:02:15.200> does<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:16.490> yeah<00:02:16.730> that's

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
what Nightcrawler does so yeah that's

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.210 
what Nightcrawler does so yeah that's
pretty<00:02:17.000> cool<00:02:17.620> alright<00:02:18.620> one<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.010> things

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
pretty cool alright one of the things

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.800 
pretty cool alright one of the things
that<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.430> really<00:02:19.760> liked<00:02:20.060> about<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.450> game<00:02:20.660> is

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
that I really liked about this game is

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.630 
that I really liked about this game is
the<00:02:21.260> fact<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.590> who<00:02:21.920> doesn't<00:02:22.250> really<00:02:22.400> like

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
the fact that who doesn't really like

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.090 
the fact that who doesn't really like
the<00:02:22.790> idea<00:02:22.820> of<00:02:23.410> going<00:02:24.410> through<00:02:24.740> a<00:02:24.800> level

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
the idea of going through a level

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.460 
the idea of going through a level
fighting<00:02:25.460> like<00:02:25.970> everything<00:02:26.180> in<00:02:26.600> sight<00:02:26.900> with

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.630 
Wolverine I really like Nightcrawler but
inside<00:02:31.850> here<00:02:32.090> hit<00:02:32.390> on<00:02:32.600> using<00:02:33.160> his<00:02:34.160> controls

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
inside here hit on using his controls

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.180 
inside here hit on using his controls
like<00:02:34.940> take<00:02:35.210> a<00:02:35.390> long<00:02:35.690> time<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.960> get<00:02:36.170> used<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.590> but

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
in fact he can't even use do anything to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.240 
in fact he can't even use do anything to
protect<00:03:02.930> himself<00:03:03.260> he<00:03:03.440> can't<00:03:03.680> block<00:03:04.040> or

anything so they should at least make it
seem<00:03:14.420> more<00:03:14.450> like<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.989> comic<00:03:15.350> book<00:03:15.500> like<00:03:15.680> at

himself every time he gets damaged

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.360 
himself every time he gets damaged
that's<00:03:26.390> pretty<00:03:27.050> cool<00:03:27.230> right<00:03:27.290> there<00:03:27.680> but

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
that's pretty cool right there but

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.670 
that's pretty cool right there but
inside<00:03:28.730> here<00:03:29.030> he<00:03:29.180> can't<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:30.050> only<00:03:30.320> way<00:03:30.440> he<00:03:30.590> can

inside here he can't the only way he can
heal<00:03:30.890> himself<00:03:31.360> by<00:03:32.620> collecting<00:03:33.620> help<00:03:34.090> but

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
heal himself by collecting help but

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.330 
heal himself by collecting help but
scattered<00:03:35.420> around<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.870> level<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:36.470> sometimes

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
scattered around the level so sometimes

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.400 
scattered around the level so sometimes
you<00:03:37.519> won't<00:03:37.610> be<00:03:37.790> able<00:03:37.850> to<00:03:38.030> find<00:03:38.239> them<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.570> they

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
you won't be able to find them and they

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.940 
you won't be able to find them and they
blend<00:03:39.739> in<00:03:39.920> really<00:03:40.519> good<00:03:40.820> with<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.150> level<00:03:41.390> so

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
blend in really good with the level so

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.170 
blend in really good with the level so
have<00:03:42.950> fun<00:03:42.980> scavenger<00:03:43.850> hunting<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:45.970> with<00:03:46.970> that
