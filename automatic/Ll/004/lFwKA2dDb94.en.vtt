00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
Toyota Corollas apparently some of the

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.899 
Toyota Corollas apparently some of the

dead this video will show how to fix a
non-working<00:00:19.550> clock<00:00:20.029> in<00:00:20.300> a<00:00:20.359> 2005<00:00:21.140> toyota

non-working clock in a 2005 toyota
corolla<00:00:22.130> i<00:00:22.400> think<00:00:23.060> these<00:00:23.150> instructions

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
corolla i think these instructions

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.589 
corolla i think these instructions
should<00:00:23.960> also<00:00:24.080> work<00:00:24.349> for<00:00:24.560> a<00:00:24.619> 2003<00:00:25.490> to<00:00:25.759> a<00:00:25.789> 2008

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
should also work for a 2003 to a 2008

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.909 
should also work for a 2003 to a 2008
corolla<00:00:28.509> the<00:00:29.509> first<00:00:29.779> step<00:00:30.050> is<00:00:30.230> to<00:00:30.409> remove<00:00:30.589> the

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
corolla the first step is to remove the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.979 
corolla the first step is to remove the
bezel<00:00:31.099> from<00:00:31.519> around<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:31.880> shifter<00:00:32.270> i<00:00:32.449> was<00:00:32.780> able

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
bezel from around the shifter i was able

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.090 
bezel from around the shifter i was able
to<00:00:33.020> grab<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.440> edge<00:00:33.590> and<00:00:33.829> lift<00:00:34.010> it<00:00:34.129> straight<00:00:34.280> up

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
to grab the edge and lift it straight up

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.770 
to grab the edge and lift it straight up
the<00:00:37.100> next<00:00:37.399> step<00:00:37.579> is<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:37.969> remove<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:38.510> fan

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
the next step is to remove the fan

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.060 
the next step is to remove the fan
control<00:00:39.050> knob<00:00:39.500> by<00:00:39.770> pulling<00:00:40.160> it<00:00:40.280> straight<00:00:40.399> out

apparently these are the solder joints
that<00:01:31.700> go<00:01:31.820> bad<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.330> cause<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.290> clock<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.680> stop

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
that go bad and cause the clock to stop

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.000 
that go bad and cause the clock to stop
working

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010

some people are able to correct the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.480 
some people are able to correct the
problem<00:01:39.050> simply<00:01:39.530> by<00:01:39.680> touching<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:40.250> solder

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
problem simply by touching the solder

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.310 
problem simply by touching the solder
joints<00:01:40.850> on<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.060> edges<00:01:41.360> of<00:01:41.630> each<00:01:41.780> chip<00:01:42.110> with<00:01:42.290> a

joints on the edges of each chip with a
soldering<00:01:42.740> iron<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.130> refresh<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.730> joints

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
soldering iron to refresh the joints

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.600 
soldering iron to refresh the joints
I<00:01:44.330> added<00:01:44.990> some<00:01:45.290> new<00:01:45.440> solder<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.920> both<00:01:46.100> sides<00:01:46.400> of

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
I added some new solder to both sides of

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.230 
I added some new solder to both sides of
each<00:01:46.760> of<00:01:46.910> the<00:01:46.970> five<00:01:47.150> chips

each of the five chips
once<00:01:50.240> you're<00:01:50.420> done<00:01:50.570> soldering<00:01:51.050> snap<00:01:51.500> the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
once you're done soldering snap the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.860 
once you're done soldering snap the
cover<00:01:51.860> back<00:01:52.190> onto<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.490> front<00:01:52.700> of<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.880> clock
