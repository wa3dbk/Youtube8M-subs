00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and sometimes you don't this is just a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.149 
and sometimes you don't this is just a
way<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.049> keeping<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.680> garlic<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
way of keeping all the garlic and the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.410 
way of keeping all the garlic and the
bay<00:01:38.280> leaves<00:01:38.490> together<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.119> they're<00:01:39.270> not

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
bay leaves together so they're not

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.929 
bay leaves together so they're not
running<00:01:39.659> around<00:01:39.900> loose<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.979> seafood<00:01:41.490> boil

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
running around loose in the seafood boil

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.639 
running around loose in the seafood boil
so<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> good<00:01:42.990> way<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.140> doing<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.590> so

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
so this is a good way of doing that so

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.960 
so this is a good way of doing that so

potatoes into boiling hot water the

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.150 
potatoes into boiling hot water the
potato<00:02:53.150> will<00:02:53.329> seize<00:02:53.630> up<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.079> they<00:02:54.739> won't<00:02:54.950> cook

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
potato will seize up and they won't cook

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.069 
potato will seize up and they won't cook

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
right all the way through so if you do

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.050 
right all the way through so if you do
it<00:02:57.230> like<00:02:57.410> this<00:02:57.470> you'll<00:02:58.220> have<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.430> perfectly

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
bouquet garni so about 30 to 35 minutes

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.220

later I pull the potatoes up and I'm

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.050 
later I pull the potatoes up and I'm
using<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.709> fork<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.130> see<00:03:07.280> how<00:03:07.400> tender<00:03:07.670> they<00:03:07.910> are

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
using a fork to see how tender they are

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.280 
using a fork to see how tender they are
as<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.329> can<00:03:08.480> see<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.690> have<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:08.959> lot<00:03:09.260> of

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
as you can see I have a lot of

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.650 
as you can see I have a lot of
resistance<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.250> that's<00:03:10.790> where<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.030> want<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.450> now

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
resistance so that's where I want it now

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.990 
resistance so that's where I want it now
