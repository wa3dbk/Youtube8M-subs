00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.530 
to mix it on low until it all comes
together<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.950> next<00:02:18.250> step<00:02:18.519> is<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:19.000> take<00:02:19.209> our

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
together the next step is to take our

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.290 
together the next step is to take our
flour<00:02:19.930> mixture<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.560> our<00:02:21.160> milk<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:21.910> yogurt

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
flour mixture and our milk and yogurt

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.610 
flour mixture and our milk and yogurt
mixture<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.780> we're<00:02:22.900> going<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.080> alternate

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
mixture and we're going to alternate

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.800 
mixture and we're going to alternate
adding<00:02:23.980> them<00:02:24.100> into<00:02:24.430> our<00:02:24.580> batter<00:02:24.850> here<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:25.750> I'm

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
adding them into our batter here so I'm

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.270 
adding them into our batter here so I'm
going<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.019> put<00:02:26.170> about<00:02:26.260> half<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.010> flour

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
going to put about half of the flour

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.059 
going to put about half of the flour
mixture<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:28.049> you<00:02:29.049> can<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.230> be<00:02:29.470> approximate

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
mixture in you can just be approximate

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.949 
mixture in you can just be approximate
at<00:02:30.190> this<00:02:30.340> point<00:02:30.690> mix<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.900> slightly<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.910> add

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
at this point mix it slightly and add

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.830 
at this point mix it slightly and add
half<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:34.989> milk<00:02:37.650> let<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.799> stir<00:02:39.360> now<00:02:40.360> before<00:02:40.810> I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
half the milk let that stir now before I

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.660 
half the milk let that stir now before I
put<00:02:41.019> any<00:02:41.170> more<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.680> want<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.950> give<00:02:42.190> my<00:02:42.370> bowl

put any more and I want to give my bowl
a<00:02:43.060> scrape<00:02:43.900> just<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.319> make<00:02:44.470> sure<00:02:44.620> all<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.860> flour

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
a scrape just to make sure all the flour

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.190 
a scrape just to make sure all the flour
is<00:02:45.519> in<00:02:46.330> there<00:02:46.709> getting<00:02:47.709> mixed<00:02:48.100> around<00:02:48.220> and

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
is in there getting mixed around and

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.550 
is in there getting mixed around and
I'll<00:02:50.200> put<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.470> rest<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:50.950> flour<00:02:51.190> in<00:02:52.560> and

I'll put the rest of the flour in and

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.440 
I'll put the rest of the flour in and
I'm<00:02:53.830> going<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.010> turn<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.430> put<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.120> rest<00:02:55.299> of

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
I'm going to turn it on put the rest of

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.690 
I'm going to turn it on put the rest of
my<00:02:55.600> milk<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.109> then<00:02:56.500> let<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.799> mix

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.819 

so<00:03:02.700> before<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.030> put<00:03:03.299> my<00:03:03.329> sprinkles<00:03:03.989> in<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.439> want

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
so before I put my sprinkles in I want

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.009 
so before I put my sprinkles in I want
to<00:03:04.950> make<00:03:05.069> sure<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.549> my<00:03:05.790> cake<00:03:06.090> pan<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.659> greased

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
to make sure that my cake pan is greased

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.050 
to make sure that my cake pan is greased
and<00:03:07.200> ready<00:03:07.409> to<00:03:07.500> go<00:03:07.769> into<00:03:08.189> the<00:03:08.310> preheated<00:03:08.579> oven

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
and ready to go into the preheated oven

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.780 
and ready to go into the preheated oven
the<00:03:09.689> oven<00:03:09.720> needs<00:03:10.079> to<00:03:10.230> be<00:03:10.349> at<00:03:10.530> 350<00:03:11.310> degrees

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
the oven needs to be at 350 degrees

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.880 
the oven needs to be at 350 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:03:12.390> now<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.049> reason<00:03:13.379> I<00:03:13.470> do<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.860> I

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
Fahrenheit now the reason I do that I

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.559 
Fahrenheit now the reason I do that I
wait<00:03:14.610> is<00:03:14.790> because<00:03:15.000> sometimes<00:03:15.390> these

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
wait is because sometimes these

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.030 
wait is because sometimes these
sprinkles<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.140> coating<00:03:16.470> on<00:03:16.560> them<00:03:16.680> will<00:03:16.829> run

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
sprinkles the coating on them will run

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.059 
sprinkles the coating on them will run
and<00:03:17.310> will<00:03:17.760> make<00:03:18.000> your<00:03:18.239> cake<00:03:18.599> batter<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:19.859> like

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
and will make your cake batter just like

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.509 
and will make your cake batter just like
a<00:03:20.340> real<00:03:21.329> mess<00:03:21.689> really<00:03:22.049> it<00:03:22.319> won't<00:03:22.470> obtain<00:03:23.159> the

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
a real mess really it won't obtain the

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.949 
a real mess really it won't obtain the
original<00:03:23.609> colors<00:03:24.239> on<00:03:24.420> each<00:03:24.569> of<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.840> little

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
top of the first layer here just going

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.970 
top of the first layer here just going
to<00:04:04.590> spread<00:04:04.859> it<00:04:04.980> around<00:04:05.040> evenly<00:04:05.430> just<00:04:06.980> like

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
to spread it around evenly just like

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.199 
to spread it around evenly just like
that<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.400> don't<00:04:08.519> have<00:04:08.699> to<00:04:08.790> go<00:04:08.910> right<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.180> the

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
that you don't have to go right to the

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.729 
that you don't have to go right to the
edge<00:04:09.389> because<00:04:09.569> when<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.840> put<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.109> top<00:04:10.319> on<00:04:10.500> it

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
edge because when you put the top on it

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.689 
edge because when you put the top on it
will<00:04:11.310> press<00:04:11.609> out<00:04:11.879> and<00:04:13.280> what<00:04:14.280> I'm<00:04:14.370> going<00:04:14.489> to<00:04:14.579> do
