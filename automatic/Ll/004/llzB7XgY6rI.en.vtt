00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hey hey people here is his apple and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.560
 get yourself how to spot the shader 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.480
 for the minecraft 1.552 installed what 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.309
 So I can see up here as well 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.650
 do the same on the desktop pcs 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.889
 installed and hope that it is with you 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.889
 is working 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.880
 all we have to do is first 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.860
 a force update is so easy here 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.340
 log in 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.180
 whether this update and log in 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.720
 because of my I agree a bit 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:49.300
 sick chained so i was got why 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:52.690
 they all sniff so shit 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.210
 so if it is loaded here 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:01.420
 with game now we can get windows here 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.550
 click r button minecraft button 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:09.590
 just minecraft minecraft point yes 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:16.580
 can probably often with winrar 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:19.810
 First of all, that's how we did it 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.810
 whether deep 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.659
 actively a purely Russian gas 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.220
 open up because we offer first test 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.619
 May be the fine at all 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.420
 works because it is so that the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.649
 got black screen and I want 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.350
 not that they change again 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.000
 The simple reason is that is 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.119
 so a wrong installation was like 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.049
 music works with game again 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:50.710
 windows that are'm more minecraft 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:58.479
 minecraft so so what on the 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:02:01.060
 page and shaders paints for this select 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.950
 everything back to the top two points 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.619
 Of course, click on a clear and 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.590
 they pull in too 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:14.110
 can have as it is managed thinks 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.910
 Start log in and hope that 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.690
 you no blacks how do we get gold 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.220
 already looks here you can see moya and 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.549
 works and only then in the world 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.769
 go 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:27.760
 great we have the schiller times 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.680
 installed water sun and almost well 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.769
 which one is that it is the role 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.940
 play shader it my favorite separator 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:39.090
 at the moment sun flair is not like that 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.840
 exaggerated John the rc 7 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.489
 the water evaporates and runs now 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.900
 about losing the magic lounge 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.989
 can guarantee that it is guaranteed in any case 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:56.010
 works okay there is simply the 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:03:04.140
 magic lauster open setup click 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:07.690
 therefore, the more sender place desktop 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.540
 just optimally open here and the 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:17.709
 shader sword we open that made 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:20.070
 did we test if it works and 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.840
 it works too 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:28.690
 So we saw that's the shader 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:32.230
 motto for the 1.526 with all sorts of things 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.510
 commentary because going west is not 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.739
 you can immediately hack if the private 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.900
 Write a message you can in the 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.730
 Write comments 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.900
 and so on and so on, I wanted 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.690
 you are trying to help 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:48.070
 So not always video would have and yes me 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.420
