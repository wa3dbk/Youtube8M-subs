00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
some point during their high school

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.170 
some point during their high school
career<00:00:22.710> that's<00:00:22.980> kind<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.279> dystopian<00:00:23.609> story

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
career that's kind of a dystopian story

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.750 
career that's kind of a dystopian story
I<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.930> watched<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.769> trailer<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
I have watched the trailer and I have to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.970 
I have watched the trailer and I have to
say<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:26.939> wasn't<00:00:27.420> overly<00:00:28.050> impressed<00:00:28.470> with<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.769> so

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
say I wasn't overly impressed with it so

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.250 
say I wasn't overly impressed with it so
I<00:00:29.220> think<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.750> will<00:00:30.990> probably

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
I think for this one I will probably

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.010 
I think for this one I will probably
read<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.859> book<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.309> skip<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.180> movie<00:00:33.360> then<00:00:33.899> we

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
read the book and skip the movie then we

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.110 
read the book and skip the movie then we
have<00:00:34.200> If<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.590> Stay<00:00:34.620> by<00:00:34.890> Gayle<00:00:35.160> Forman<00:00:35.430> which<00:00:36.000> is

a<00:01:00.809> short<00:01:01.140> read<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.500> think<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.800> will<00:01:02.039> check<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.670> out

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
a short read I think I will check it out

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.210 
a short read I think I will check it out
and<00:01:03.120> then<00:01:03.300> possibly<00:01:04.170> also<00:01:04.320> go<00:01:04.619> see<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> movie

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
and then possibly also go see the movie

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.679 
and then possibly also go see the movie
then<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.939> Maze<00:01:06.150> Runner<00:01:06.180> by<00:01:06.659> James

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
then we have the Maze Runner by James

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.289 
then we have the Maze Runner by James
Dashner<00:01:07.200> which<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.740> featured<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.850> previous

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
Dashner which I featured in a previous

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.270 
Dashner which I featured in a previous
video<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.659> think<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.650> point<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
video I think but at that point the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.410 
video I think but at that point the
movie<00:01:11.520> was<00:01:11.640> supposed<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.000> come<00:01:12.119> out<00:01:12.180> at<00:01:12.360> the

beginning<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> year<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.200> they

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
beginning of the year and then they

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
beginning of the year and then they
switched<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> September<00:01:14.760> 19th<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.540> if<00:01:15.600> you

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
