00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.290

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
Assassin's Creed 3 which is really

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.440 
Assassin's Creed 3 which is really
exciting<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.810> see<00:01:26.760> charging<00:01:27.760> your<00:01:27.910> own<00:01:28.090> course

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.080 
exciting to see charging your own course
through<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:28.990> treacherous<00:01:29.320> world<00:01:29.860> here<00:01:30.790> we<00:01:30.910> see

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
through a treacherous world here we see

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.060 
through a treacherous world here we see
a<00:01:31.120> I<00:01:31.510> think<00:01:31.870> would<00:01:32.020> be<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.200> death<00:01:32.530> animation

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
a I think would be a death animation

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.050 
a I think would be a death animation
because<00:01:33.130> I<00:01:33.250> pretty<00:01:33.430> sure<00:01:33.580> that<00:01:33.730> Chuck<00:01:33.940> has

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
because I pretty sure that Chuck has

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.120 
because I pretty sure that Chuck has
just<00:01:34.270> killed<00:01:34.480> Edward<00:01:34.720> so<00:01:35.230> I<00:01:35.500> guess<00:01:35.890> that's

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
just killed Edward so I guess that's

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.440 
just killed Edward so I guess that's
called<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.460> showing<00:01:36.730> us<00:01:36.820> what<00:01:37.030> you<00:01:37.150> can<00:01:37.180> see

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
called the showing us what you can see

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.740 
called the showing us what you can see
when<00:01:37.660> you<00:01:37.690> die<00:01:38.020> with<00:01:38.530> Edward<00:01:39.450> where<00:01:40.450> events

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
when you die with Edward where events

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.720 
when you die with Edward where events
are<00:01:41.020> unpredictable<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:42.040> outcomes<00:01:43.030> uncertain

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
are unpredictable and outcomes uncertain

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.790 
are unpredictable and outcomes uncertain
set<00:01:45.730> sail<00:01:45.970> for<00:01:46.270> exotic<00:01:46.810> ports<00:01:47.200> here<00:01:47.530> we<00:01:47.680> have

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
experience here we see however will be

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.990 
experience here we see however will be
getting<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:51.860> the<00:04:51.980> depths<00:04:52.340> of<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.490> ocean<00:04:52.850> a

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
getting to the depths of the ocean a

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.690 
getting to the depths of the ocean a
kind<00:04:53.270> of<00:04:53.330> quick<00:04:53.570> cut<00:04:53.900> same<00:04:54.140> way<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:55.520> have<00:04:55.670> a

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
kind of quick cut same way to have a

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.510 
kind of quick cut same way to have a
weight<00:04:56.000> drop<00:04:56.390> from<00:04:56.570> your<00:04:56.720> ship<00:04:56.810> and<00:04:57.140> um<00:04:57.860> it

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
weight drop from your ship and um it

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.160 
weight drop from your ship and um it
would<00:04:58.820> just<00:04:59.000> hang<00:04:59.240> on<00:04:59.420> to<00:04:59.510> it<00:04:59.690> and<00:04:59.780> go<00:04:59.930> down

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
would just hang on to it and go down

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.780 
would just hang on to it and go down
along<00:05:00.440> with<00:05:00.650> it<00:05:00.830> there's<00:05:01.070> probably<00:05:01.340> slower

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
along with it there's probably slower

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.400 
along with it there's probably slower
way<00:05:02.060> to<00:05:02.120> when<00:05:02.570> you're<00:05:02.690> not<00:05:02.780> with<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.050> ship<00:05:03.260> but

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
way to when you're not with the ship but

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.110 
way to when you're not with the ship but
that's<00:05:03.620> I<00:05:03.860> guess<00:05:03.950> the<00:05:04.220> quickest<00:05:04.550> way<00:05:04.580> to<00:05:04.790> get

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
that's I guess the quickest way to get

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.300 
that's I guess the quickest way to get
to<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:05.360> bottom<00:05:05.510> challenges<00:05:06.380> you<00:05:06.500> to<00:05:06.890> learn

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
adapt prevent here we see how it would

Ezio<00:07:16.099> but<00:07:16.729> he's<00:07:16.849> a<00:07:16.879> little<00:07:16.939> more<00:07:17.150> selfish<00:07:17.689> and

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:18.529 
Ezio but he's a little more selfish and

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:20.589 
Ezio but he's a little more selfish and
