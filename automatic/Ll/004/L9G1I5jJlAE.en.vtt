00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
directed five anime and think about the

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.490 
directed five anime and think about the
kind<00:06:08.830> of<00:06:08.980> profound<00:06:09.660> global<00:06:10.660> impact<00:06:11.050> he<00:06:11.260> had<00:06:11.470> on

kind of profound global impact he had on
an<00:06:12.100> amazing<00:06:12.310> film<00:06:12.940> in<00:06:13.300> general<00:06:13.750> he<00:06:14.470> later<00:06:14.650> up

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
an amazing film in general he later up

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.100 
an amazing film in general he later up
to<00:06:14.860> five<00:06:15.160> anime<00:06:15.520> for<00:06:15.940> phones<00:06:16.180> and<00:06:16.570> a<00:06:16.690> TV<00:06:16.840> series

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.950 
to five anime for phones and a TV series
so<00:06:17.530> I<00:06:17.560> think<00:06:17.740> that's<00:06:17.980> impressive<00:06:18.720> the<00:06:19.720> only

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
so I think that's impressive the only

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.720 
so I think that's impressive the only
other<00:06:19.990> director<00:06:20.620> that<00:06:20.860> I<00:06:20.890> would<00:06:21.040> even<00:06:21.160> put<00:06:21.490> a

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.730
