00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:09.680
 This method Sakai in the betting ticket from everyone Hello 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:13.580
 Well there may be a little there is a point Kikigurushii you have been done throat, but please forgive me 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:17.480
 Then I think that I would like to forecast of the Steers' Stakes on Saturday 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.810
 Mateyers Stakes takes place at 3600 meters of turf 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.140
 It's very special conditions but is a column 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.430
 Though special conditions have been done so many times 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.670
 Distinctly different both generally race Well e.g. exclusive and crab 1,000 meters takes place 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.280
 Aptitude is required 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:41.309
 And the self-study distance is more appropriate The factor is very large has been a story many times before 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:45.060
 , But because a little old it a story of what it is is because I also this time Oh anymore its suitability 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.660
 I would like to write a little more in the column of the forecast column 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:53.790
 I hope you read it once by all means . 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.100
 Generally speaking, most people dance on horse racing and have a problem with the ability to say that videos are strong last year 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:01.560
 I think, but not only that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:05.050
 A stance that says which teeth are good on which stage , and in which time 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.460
 It is good to enjoy horse racing from a different angle even if you say that you expect 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.960
 I Nde I think that good always 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:15.369
 When I remember the idea of a fair became an opportunity to addictive horse racing until my cat to say write 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.569
 Oh, I guess I 'm sure I 'm only expecting what stance is stronger so far 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:22.000
 Splashed in no was form 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:25.000
 You may also find another way of forecasting this by all means in the site 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.870
 Well I think I would like you to read as a course leader 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Though it is point of special condition of chademosutakusu stakes 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.870
 In short, you should look for having a different ability than the one required in general conditions 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.270
 That's why 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.840
 What is the point Iran? 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:47.659
 I think this person is also roughly divided into these three points 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.200
 First of all, the horse whose birth is delayed is not suitable for the condition to be performed to panties. 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.880
 From 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:57.380
 Well I can not win quite well, I'm Akatsu to cutlet but I did not bend in the next 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.260
 It's a lot like you can't easily get up as a result of repeated bending 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.330
 These are 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:06.590
 Now that there is no aptitude for general conditions, that is, there is a possibility of increasing performance under special conditions. 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:12.050
 It is why it can be said that there until leaving 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:15.379
 The horse with the next slowest horse speed Generally, Japanese horse racing today is based on speed and flash power 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:20.810
 Such speed does not correspond to the horse race which it publishes 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:24.420
 It i.e. no general conditions suitability of horse that may have aptitude special conditions 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.950
 I wonder not even go out unexpectedly to say these legs is slow horse to you so be it 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.030
 Attoka stamina overemphasis in Well this was had from the pedigree surface in the It is the bottom Well heavy pedigree 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.650
 It is a pedigree of 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.640
 Such a horse is a basic condition and it is not easy to lose speed 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.349
 Because it will increase 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:45.220
 On the other hand, on the stage where the aptitude is required different from the general condition that the speed factor is not included 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:48.660
 The point is that there is a possibility that the performance will go up and down . 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.660
 In speaking at this year's live bar 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:57.940
 I think it is something like this neo black diamond Well I just bought it all at once 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.989
 It's me anyway members this year much would from beginning to end is turned to out to the person who is weak 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.910
 Well so-called 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.720
 I think that it will be quite difficult this year to convey the element of thinking that that horse is strong 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.440
 but 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:13.130
 Well from the aptitude theory where the place is perfect Well just after having won the condition just now 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.450
 Type, such as taking a long time of not Kachinuka it only conditions warfare I was 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:21.530
 That is the ability did not win because they shift aptitude but I have a decent ie 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:26.480
 It will be a horse that has the potential to boost performance under special conditions 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:29.430
 In terms of pedigree, it is often said that Zen Noro Brogy pieces are before Robroy's pieces are long distances high 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.090
 Though I have talked about this in the expectation column 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:38.040
 Anyway , it is the feature of the Zen Noro Broglyphs that is strong in the long distance heavy prize 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:43.409
 In this sense, it is a pedigree that decides the possibility that the distance will be extended and the running will be better. 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.629
 In this case super funny this year it if you include Ramono process also it is why you can also view called Mamada 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:49.420
 I think it seems like it's not 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:51.940
 Otsu is instead I Nde likely swelling in the county how to construct the feeling that a little How about the 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.790
 I personally have a great deal of victory over it, though 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:00.599
 I'm thinking of focusing only on recurs 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.599
 I think that I would like to see more details on the site 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:10.970
 Then it 's Chukyo Horse Racing that starts from this week because it 's an extra person 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:15.680
 I would like to raise from here, Chukyo has not held too much since it is true 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:21.120
 Nde I there is a possibility to go fluorescence rapidly changed from this, but the last time at least before last 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:25.860
 And as long as they see the holding of that very pedigree to out significant trend in 1006 from the Sima Qian 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.680
 I think so from this week there are a lot of things I want to buy quite interesting but in my Chukyo 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:33.720
 I would like to take up the first rapport 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:37.740
 Sima regarding shaking of turf warfare, but is race Chukyo performed in Qian 6 in the King Kamehameha and capital 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:42.539
 There is a tendency that 2 systems are strong anyway 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.199
 This is a jungle pocket that draws the blood of Tony Bin . 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.340
 Existence 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.670
 Well before the end of the week and the opening week but learning to show the ability 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.090
 Another popular in the divorced woman field 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.090
 I think that I Te I think is that it is the timing of the great buying in pedigree basis 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.680
 It is what about uh would like to end with this and the dog of miso
