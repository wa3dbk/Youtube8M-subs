actually<00:02:38.650> makes<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.099> taste<00:02:39.340> better<00:02:39.430> but<00:02:39.700> you

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
actually makes it taste better but you

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.500 
actually makes it taste better but you
get<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.180> chance<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.810> taste<00:02:40.989> at<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.230> end<00:02:45.510> and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
get a chance to taste at the end and

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.430 
get a chance to taste at the end and
then<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.319> add<00:02:47.530> some<00:02:47.920> skim<00:02:48.430> milk<00:02:52.110> just<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.230> little

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
then I add some skim milk just a little

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.940 
then I add some skim milk just a little
skim<00:02:53.830> milk<00:02:54.040> i<00:02:54.930> recommend<00:02:55.930> skim<00:02:56.290> milk<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:56.769> that

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
skim milk i recommend skim milk so that

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.280 
skim milk i recommend skim milk so that
you<00:02:57.069> don't<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:58.209> that<00:02:58.239> you<00:02:58.510> minimize<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
you don't so that you minimize the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:10.020 
you don't so that you minimize the

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.490 

and<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:26.519> reason<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:27.030> recommend<00:03:27.840> adding<00:03:28.109> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
and the reason I recommend adding the
