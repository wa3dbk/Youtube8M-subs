00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.639

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.250
 the playstation expansion speed 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:18.520
 4 is very encouraging has been 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.950
 gathering in a meeting with the 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.289
 Investors of the company and announced 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.270
 the changes and new plans to improve 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.940
 the situation in the computer division 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.130
 and television as commented by the ceo 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.710
 given the challenges of the moment of 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.720
 electronic business environment 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.450
 we anticipate that the goal of returning 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.850
 PC and TV business to the field 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.579
 positive will be difficult to achieve in 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.620
 this fiscal year is why they are going to 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.960
 radically reform the 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.660
 facilities and optimize the divisions 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.030
 of playstation sales order 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.850
 admission to each redundancy 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.250
 on the new playstation 4 console the 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.440
 manager has commented that they are 150 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.269
 million playstation users 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.370
 network and that the number of subscriptions 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.830
 of playstation plus increases in a 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.229
 fast as we said in a news are 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.509
 tripling their subscriptions thanks to 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.479
 new system of play station 4 that you 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:17.170
 makes playstation mandatory 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.030
 plus but it is also mandatory but that 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.740
 you have many advantages first that 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.690
 to play online you need it 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.080
 but it is also that every month they give you 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.350
 three games is awesome 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.869
 that at the moment the first one what what 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.420
 boosted was sony playstation plus when 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.130
 they took us out on playstation3 good 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.990
 expects the game division to continue 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.030
 giving benefits and that waiting for 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.330
 operating expectations towards the end 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.890
 of the current fiscal year saying that the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.830
 speed of my fair broadcasting 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.770
 playstation 4 is quite encouraging to 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.080
 root of this news is true we are 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.020
 in a new generation of consoles and yes 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.980
 it 's true that sales are a lot 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.870
 older but 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.600
 what is difference below the point of 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.710
 sight that differentiates this generation 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.630
 playstation 4 with playstation 3 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.850
 playstation 4 and 1 I think so much 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.350
 playstation 4 as xbox go from center to 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.630
 playstation 4 because we're talking about 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.880
 that or the advertising that has been 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.030
 much more invasive but not in 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.720
 television but in question for example 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.220
 from youtube all over the world I think that 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.340
 everyone who likes 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.660
 videogames that plays any game 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.610
 or who is interested in any 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.570
 console 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.610
 have ever had to put in 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.530
 youtube has ever had to do 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.360
 something on youtube and sometimes it 's had 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.420
 to see some opinion of the console 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.310
 watching a gameplay video game that's what 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.630
 what is advertising I think is the 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.970
 more valuable that kind of advertising 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.020
 advertising that is not done without any 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.330
 encouragement of any benefit not 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.790
 simply the most personal opinion 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.620
 about this game on that console 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.599
 while you are playing the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.690
 and you are your own beta tester 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.989
 channel and you're promoting a console 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.599
 giving your opinion I think that youtube 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.519
 has been the best window for the sale of 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.110
 these new generation consoles more 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.590
 that television is not that networks 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.870
 social a lot more than all that and it's for 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.090
 it's normal that the speed of 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.360
 playstation 4 sales and also from 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.340
 xbox one are very encouraging because in 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.200
 part of us have had a little bit of guilt 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.500
 the youtubers specialized in 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.680
 video games that we have given that news 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.769
 those that simple and we have been giving 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.260
 good commenting on the conferences 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.299
 watching each dot of that console 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.220
 gutting the power that people are 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.840
 will learn a little more of what it is for 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.030
 it and I think we also have a part 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.280
 of guilt for that is how I have commented on 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.129
 sales what we will do here to do 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.720
 but I think the comments 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.310
 I want you to tell me if I really have 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.400
 reason that youtube has been a little bit 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.290
 invasive with the youtubers of all the 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.590
 world gamers who have been giving their 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.670
 opinion they have been testing 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.860
 in this conference and that as they have 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.860
 participated much more in the opinion of 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.269
 the fans so nothing guys I hope that 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.819
 you are interested in the news 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.530
 a little kiss all and see you in the channel 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.729
 secondary waiting for your passes out there 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.729
 until the next
