in them yeah is it too hot I wouldn't
sentence<00:03:54.790> games<00:03:55.180> incredibly<00:03:55.870> easy<00:03:56.110> but<00:03:57.100> it's

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
sentence games incredibly easy but it's

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.800 
sentence games incredibly easy but it's
definitely<00:03:57.670> easier<00:03:58.210> than<00:03:58.420> Crash<00:03:58.630> Bandicoot

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
definitely easier than Crash Bandicoot

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.260 
definitely easier than Crash Bandicoot
I'm<00:03:59.650> somebody<00:04:00.340> person<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.760> comment<00:04:01.090> saying

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
I'm somebody person a comment saying

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.080 
I'm somebody person a comment saying
that<00:04:01.360> this<00:04:01.540> game<00:04:01.780> is<00:04:02.340> quite<00:04:03.340> difficult<00:04:03.730> to

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
that this game is quite difficult to

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.720 
that this game is quite difficult to
complete<00:04:04.600> 100%<00:04:04.960> and<00:04:05.500> as<00:04:06.100> you<00:04:06.250> saw<00:04:06.400> there<00:04:06.700> I

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
complete 100% and as you saw there I

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.699 
complete 100% and as you saw there I
accidentally<00:04:07.480> exploded<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:08.080> 10<00:04:08.260> team<00:04:08.500> about

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
accidentally exploded that 10 team about

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.150 
accidentally exploded that 10 team about
jumping<00:04:09.100> on<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.280> crates<00:04:09.550> which<00:04:09.820> means<00:04:11.130> then<00:04:12.130> I

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
jumping on the crates which means then I

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.870 
jumping on the crates which means then I
can't<00:04:12.520> actually<00:04:12.790> get<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.330> movie<00:04:14.080> token

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
can't actually get that movie token

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.430 
can't actually get that movie token
without<00:04:15.880> reciting<00:04:16.570> this<00:04:16.750> level<00:04:17.080> but<00:04:17.290> I'll

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
without reciting this level but I'll

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.080 
without reciting this level but I'll
probably<00:04:17.830> do<00:04:18.070> that<00:04:18.190> off<00:04:18.310> camera<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:18.820> you<00:04:18.910> don't

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
probably do that off camera so you don't

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.620 
probably do that off camera so you don't
have<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.269> worry<00:04:19.480> but<00:04:21.270> somebody<00:04:22.270> said<00:04:22.480> that

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
have to worry but somebody said that

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.880 
have to worry but somebody said that
this<00:04:22.720> game<00:04:22.960> is<00:04:23.140> pretty<00:04:23.290> hard<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.650> complete

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
this game is pretty hard to complete

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.210 
this game is pretty hard to complete
100%<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:24.640> that's<00:04:24.730> true<00:04:25.470> but<00:04:26.470> so<00:04:26.680> get<00:04:27.100> then

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
100% and that's true but so get then

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.280 
100% and that's true but so get then
again<00:04:27.490> so<00:04:27.730> is<00:04:27.760> crash<00:04:28.030> bandicoot<00:04:28.630> so<00:04:29.260> I

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
again so is crash bandicoot so I

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.290 
again so is crash bandicoot so I
wouldn't<00:04:29.650> call<00:04:29.830> this<00:04:29.980> game<00:04:30.220> majorly<00:04:30.669> hard<00:04:31.000> but

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
wouldn't call this game majorly hard but

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.850 
wouldn't call this game majorly hard but
this<00:04:31.450> but<00:04:31.900> I<00:04:32.200> mean<00:04:32.950> if<00:04:33.250> you<00:04:33.700> miss<00:04:33.910> one<00:04:33.940> thing

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
this but I mean if you miss one thing

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.150 
this but I mean if you miss one thing
you<00:04:35.860> have<00:04:35.980> to<00:04:36.040> restart<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:38.770> whole<00:04:38.950> level

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
you have to restart the the whole level

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.620 
you have to restart the the whole level
I<00:04:39.340> guess<00:04:39.669> it's<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.060> same<00:04:40.090> for<00:04:40.480> crash

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
I guess it's the same for crash

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.980 
I guess it's the same for crash
bandicoot<00:04:41.020> 1<00:04:41.200> as<00:04:41.350> well<00:04:41.530> but<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:43.630> complete<00:04:43.900> this

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
bandicoot 1 as well but to complete this

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.680 
bandicoot 1 as well but to complete this
game<00:04:44.080> non<00:04:44.440> 100%<00:04:45.130> this<00:04:45.310> games<00:04:45.520> as<00:04:45.820> much<00:04:46.180> easier

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
game non 100% this games as much easier

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.330 
game non 100% this games as much easier
to<00:04:47.050> create<00:04:47.169> a<00:04:47.260> hundred<00:04:47.560> percent<00:04:47.650> I'd<00:04:48.010> say<00:04:48.160> it's

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
to create a hundred percent I'd say it's

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.830 
to create a hundred percent I'd say it's
around<00:04:48.490> it's<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:48.970> bit<00:04:49.120> easier<00:04:49.480> than<00:04:49.600> crash

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
around it's a bit easier than crash

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.120 
around it's a bit easier than crash
bandicoot<00:04:50.290> as<00:04:50.410> well<00:04:50.590> so<00:04:51.270> yeah<00:04:52.270> it's<00:04:53.229> anyone

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
bandicoot as well so yeah it's anyone

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.830 
bandicoot as well so yeah it's anyone

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
talk about a knife it took this green

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.870

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
not oh yeah and also oh yeah

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.640 
not oh yeah and also oh yeah
it's<00:04:58.150> a<00:04:58.210> little<00:04:58.419> bit<00:04:58.510> I<00:04:58.540> put<00:04:58.750> to<00:04:58.870> tell<00:04:59.050> you<00:04:59.200> I

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
it's a little bit I put to tell you I

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.000 
it's a little bit I put to tell you I
think<00:04:59.830> lilo<00:05:00.820> and<00:05:01.060> stitch<00:05:01.510> both<00:05:02.290> have<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.680> bomb

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
think lilo and stitch both have the bomb

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.590 
think lilo and stitch both have the bomb
bounce<00:05:03.250> ability<00:05:03.700> the<00:05:03.790> same<00:05:03.970> ability<00:05:04.360> that<00:05:04.570> you

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
bounce ability the same ability that you

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.050 
bounce ability the same ability that you
are<00:05:04.930> they<00:05:05.140> that<00:05:05.440> you<00:05:05.590> see<00:05:05.770> Mario<00:05:06.460> has<00:05:06.640> an<00:05:06.820> Olmec

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
are they that you see Mario has an Olmec

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.560 
are they that you see Mario has an Olmec
but<00:05:07.930> it's<00:05:08.080> pretty<00:05:08.530> useless<00:05:08.919> so

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.240 

you<00:05:12.080> know<00:05:12.200> you<00:05:12.380> won't<00:05:12.500> want<00:05:12.710> to<00:05:12.740> use<00:05:12.920> it<00:05:13.070> down

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
you know you won't want to use it down

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.850 
you know you won't want to use it down
that<00:05:13.460> much<00:05:14.110> it's<00:05:15.110> good<00:05:15.260> it's<00:05:15.470> good<00:05:15.620> for<00:05:15.770> going

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
that much it's good it's good for going

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.410 
that much it's good it's good for going
faster<00:05:16.310> though<00:05:16.400> so<00:05:16.670> gonna<00:05:16.910> do<00:05:17.060> a<00:05:17.090> speed<00:05:17.330> run

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
faster though so gonna do a speed run

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.150 
faster though so gonna do a speed run
anyway

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
anyway

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.990 
anyway
boom<00:05:19.820> okay<00:05:20.180> but<00:05:20.960> I'm<00:05:21.080> but<00:05:21.740> as<00:05:22.370> you<00:05:22.550> can<00:05:22.730> see<00:05:22.970> I

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
boom okay but I'm but as you can see I

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.610 
boom okay but I'm but as you can see I
try<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.330> using<00:05:23.600> the<00:05:23.660> Piranha<00:05:23.960> for<00:05:24.170> a<00:05:24.200> back<00:05:24.440> way

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
try the using the Piranha for a back way

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.200 
try the using the Piranha for a back way
and<00:05:24.650> it<00:05:24.890> didn't<00:05:25.160> really<00:05:25.280> work<00:05:25.400> out<00:05:25.790> very<00:05:25.850> well

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
and it didn't really work out very well

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.030 
and it didn't really work out very well
I<00:05:26.660> probably<00:05:27.230> should<00:05:27.440> have<00:05:27.470> picked<00:05:27.680> up<00:05:27.800> a<00:05:27.890> tan

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
I probably should have picked up a tan

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.310 
I probably should have picked up a tan
team<00:05:28.250> for<00:05:28.370> this<00:05:28.460> one<00:05:28.670> but<00:05:29.270> way<00:05:29.960> to<00:05:30.020> avoid

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
team for this one but way to avoid

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.170
