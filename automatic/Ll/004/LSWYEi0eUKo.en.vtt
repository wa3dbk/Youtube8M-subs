 Hi, everyone, how are you? 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.320
 very well from the microphone he talks to them about 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.320
 60 better known as predator 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.710
 this new let's play called 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.629
 castlevania for nintendo between denim 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.129
 exist because to say castlevania one is 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:41.239
 very mainstream and today hipster 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.030
 but well let's start a good 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.879
 you see that it is and we go on the screen of the 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.270
 dracula castle with six back but 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.350

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.350
 Simon Belmonte 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.620
 our friend Simon Belmont the case of the 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.840
 vampire should look for the porn of the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.910
 family because dragon is like that 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.870
 I say if they mess with my way of 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.970
 act the same yes and how am I back 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.410
 Simon Belmonte is the youngest and 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.410
 smallest always send it to all 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.320
 because that never happens 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:21.040
 and there was never any back 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.040
 do not make me 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.100
 I do not want to lose 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.860
 and you will not do anything to me because I do not 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.840
 if this is the season play 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.620
 because if we are in October it is 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.620
 Halloween 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.670
 run run run run run 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.370
 it is correct 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.620
 I did not want to be beaten so I was 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.120
 forgot that those ghosts in me in this 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:00.810

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.190
 paralyzes we have to go above 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.040

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.380

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.460
 if you are the esplai who decides to do 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.740
 seasonal 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.270
 I hope youtube does not move me with the 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.730
 copyright because you already know that this game 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.430
 of konami 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.280
 and well the copyright know that it is a 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.630
 bitch and more with castlevania than her boy 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.670
 his work 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.930
 yes so good I hope do not fuck me 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.870
 because I want to upload this youtube or 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.430
 but I will have to upload it because it will be 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.440
 horrible and I do not want to raise the truth not 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.390
 I have no account and I would have to do 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.390
 one and blah blah blah 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.040
 I'm going to do 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.659
 one stage per chapter like this is the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.330
 elevator all month because they are going to be 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.129
 two chapters a week because if bad 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.769
 I do not remember this game has eight 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.019
 stages so it's going to be two 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.650
 chapters per week and they are four 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.700
 weeks the month then yes and if I 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.690
 backwardness 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.620
 had a chapter more I do not know what but it is 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.620
 so that it lasts all day 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.380
 let's adjust the microphone a bit 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.420
 half-ass fucked and true I'm 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.170
 recording from my wii and the answer with 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.660
 the quality and all that is not the same with 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.580
 the one that when recorded from the computer 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.580
 fucking not ladder daughter of 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.570
 and always 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.319
 If I'm big water and because it's 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.640
 easier since I play with a control 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.170
 with dívar and in 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.700
 and have computed had to play with 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.450
 diagonal which he developed for these 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.340
 games 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.530
 Jones the first enemy 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.209
 and prepare to listen to the sound more 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.209
 annoying of the world of hearts 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.049
 It hurts 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.150
 and a lot 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.910
 there's the map of dracula's castle 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.910
 and we go to the next the next stage 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.549
 because this is going to be the first 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.940
