that I like to fish you know early in
the<00:00:16.439> spring<00:00:16.800> when<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.670> midges<00:00:18.029> are<00:00:18.119> coming

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420

the spring when the midges are coming
out<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:19.950> just<00:00:20.009> a<00:00:20.220> little<00:00:20.400> midge<00:00:20.669> Koopa

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
out and it's just a little midge Koopa

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.210 
out and it's just a little midge Koopa
and<00:00:21.419> I'm<00:00:21.660> actually<00:00:21.869> it's<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.259> I'll<00:00:22.860> put<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.099> back

and I'm actually it's a I'll put it back
in<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.430> vise<00:00:23.610> this<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.450> a<00:00:24.480> daiichi<00:00:24.800> 1150<00:00:25.800> size

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
in the vise this is a daiichi 1150 size

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.689 
in the vise this is a daiichi 1150 size
16<00:00:26.700> and<00:00:27.349> I<00:00:28.349> usually<00:00:28.740> take<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.070> out<00:00:29.430> and<00:00:29.460> put

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
16 and I usually take this out and put

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.009 
16 and I usually take this out and put
it<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.529> fuse<00:00:31.529> clip<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.550> nice<00:00:33.390> little<00:00:33.629> holder

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:34.019 
it on a fuse clip a nice little holder

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.619 
it on a fuse clip a nice little holder
what's<00:00:35.010> nice<00:00:35.250> about<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.480> take

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
what's nice about that is is I can take

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.470 
what's nice about that is is I can take
and<00:00:36.840> stick<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.230> down<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.650> there<00:00:38.120> inside<00:00:39.120> this

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
and stick this down in there inside this

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.119 
and stick this down in there inside this
and<00:00:40.220> grab<00:00:41.220> a<00:00:41.250> bead<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.440> comes<00:00:43.650> off<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
and grab a bead and it comes off and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.729 
and grab a bead and it comes off and
there's<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.430> bead<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.199> little<00:00:46.199> easy<00:00:46.500> way

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
there's one bead on it a little easy way

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.130 
there's one bead on it a little easy way
to<00:00:46.799> do<00:00:47.040> it<00:00:47.089> then<00:00:48.089> I<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.540> simply<00:00:48.720> line<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
to do it then I can just simply line it

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.530 
to do it then I can just simply line it
up<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.589> vise<00:00:49.890> put<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.580> in<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.760> vise<00:00:50.970> let<00:00:51.330> go

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
up with a vise put it in a vise let go

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.479 
up with a vise put it in a vise let go
of<00:00:51.659> it<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.930> there<00:00:52.049> it<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.229> it's<00:00:53.040> right<00:00:53.220> on<00:00:53.369> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
of it and there it is it's right on the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.920 
of it and there it is it's right on the
device<00:00:54.059> when<00:00:54.269> I'm<00:00:54.390> working<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:54.809> these

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
device when I'm working with these

yourself a half hitch and what we're
going<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> use<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> real<00:01:40.950> tiny<00:01:41.399> piece<00:01:41.850> of

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
going to use is a real tiny piece of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.219 
going to use is a real tiny piece of
lazer<00:01:42.869> wrap<00:01:43.640> really<00:01:44.640> unique<00:01:45.119> material<00:01:45.840> very

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
lazer wrap really unique material very

lazer wrap really unique material very
flexible<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.890> comes<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.429> size<00:01:47.700> right

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969

flexible it comes in this size right
here<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.929> can<00:01:49.079> see<00:01:49.289> that<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> edge<00:01:49.829> itself

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
here you can see that the edge itself

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.450 
here you can see that the edge itself
just<00:01:50.969> glows<00:01:51.560> that's<00:01:52.560> why<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.920> call<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.249> it's

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
just glows that's why we call it it's

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.230 
just glows that's why we call it it's
called<00:01:53.700> laser<00:01:53.939> out<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.389> this<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.630> laser<00:01:54.869> midge

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
called laser out and this is laser midge

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.120 
called laser out and this is laser midge
what<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.509> found<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.590> lights<00:01:58.950> are

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
what I have found is is as lights are

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.340 
what I have found is is as lights are
changing<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.819> the<00:01:59.850> water<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.929> the<00:02:00.990> lights<00:02:01.229> are

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
changing on the water and the lights are

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.249 
changing on the water and the lights are
down<00:02:02.219> through<00:02:02.549> there<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.600> thing<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.139> is

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
down through there this thing just is

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.459 
down through there this thing just is
like<00:02:04.289> turning<00:02:04.679> on<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> light<00:02:05.069> switch<00:02:06.319> turning<00:02:07.319> a

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
like turning on a light switch turning a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.199 
like turning on a light switch turning a
light<00:02:07.619> switch<00:02:07.859> on<00:02:08.130> turning<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.789> light<00:02:08.940> switch

light switch on turning a light switch

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.990 
light switch on turning a light switch
off<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:10.979> really<00:02:11.370> interesting<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:11.940> I

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
off and it's really interesting but I

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.090 
off and it's really interesting but I
know<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.540> fish<00:02:12.750> just<00:02:13.170> absolutely<00:02:13.800> love

there's no excuse me
the<00:02:17.819> other<00:02:17.970> thing<00:02:18.240> about<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:19.050> pattern<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.590> is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
the other thing about this pattern is is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:29.680 
the other thing about this pattern is is
is<00:02:19.920> very<00:02:20.220> very<00:02:20.610> durable

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.059 

now<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.870> I've<00:02:30.990> tied<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.650> I've<00:02:31.830> brought

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
now that I've tied this in I've brought

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.660 
now that I've tied this in I've brought
that<00:02:32.310> thread<00:02:32.580> back<00:02:32.819> forward<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.540> bead<00:02:33.780> and

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
that thread back forward to the bead and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.840 
that thread back forward to the bead and
I<00:02:35.670> grab<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:35.910> little<00:02:36.209> hackle<00:02:36.990> plier<00:02:37.230> here<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.040> I

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
I grab a little hackle plier here and I

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.300 
I grab a little hackle plier here and I
simply<00:02:39.300> start<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.780> wrap<00:02:40.050> this<00:02:41.239> forward<00:02:43.310> what

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
simply start to wrap this forward what

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.280 
simply start to wrap this forward what
it<00:02:44.430> does<00:02:44.640> is<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.000> buries<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.480> little<00:02:46.110> bright

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
it does is it buries that little bright

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.830 
it does is it buries that little bright
edge<00:02:46.590> down<00:02:46.980> inside<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.000> actually<00:02:48.209> creates

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
edge down inside and it actually creates

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.680 
edge down inside and it actually creates
a<00:02:49.020> rib

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.509 

what's<00:02:54.690> amazing<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.620> when<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.010> light<00:02:56.190> hits

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
what's amazing is is when the light hits

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:07.630 
what's amazing is is when the light hits
it<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:57.000> just<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.600> just<00:02:58.170> glows

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.900 

and<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.540> bring<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.810> up<00:03:08.990> behind<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.620> bead

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.460 

bring<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.030> thread<00:03:14.270> up<00:03:14.420> around<00:03:14.660> behind<00:03:15.050> it

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
bring the thread up around behind it

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.640 
bring the thread up around behind it
Snug<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.130> down<00:03:16.280> into<00:03:16.730> place<00:03:17.140> put<00:03:18.140> three<00:03:18.440> good

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
Snug it down into place put three good

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.710 
Snug it down into place put three good
wraps<00:03:18.920> or<00:03:19.220> four<00:03:19.460> good<00:03:19.610> wraps<00:03:19.880> on<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.300> and

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
wraps or four good wraps on it and

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.080 
wraps or four good wraps on it and
simply<00:03:21.560> cut<00:03:22.460> it<00:03:22.520> off

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
simply cut it off

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.460 
simply cut it off
now<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:24.200> could<00:03:24.380> fish<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.980> as<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:26.230> just<00:03:27.230> like

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
now you could fish this as is just like

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.850 
now you could fish this as is just like
it<00:03:27.650> is<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:29.390> fly<00:03:29.630> would<00:03:29.690> be<00:03:29.930> complete<00:03:30.320> it's

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
it is and the fly would be complete it's

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.449 
it is and the fly would be complete it's
fairly<00:03:31.100> fairly<00:03:32.090> quick<00:03:32.860> but<00:03:33.860> what<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.040> like<00:03:34.310> to
