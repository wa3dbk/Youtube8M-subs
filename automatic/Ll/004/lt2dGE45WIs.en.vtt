00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.780
 hi everyone and we end up 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.400
 for my first video that will be how 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.150
 to taste an xperia 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.830
 m so happy it's pretty simple well 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.480
 it's easier but it's simple 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.400
 for this mode for this model I have 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.460
 says for this model because it works 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.150
 maybe on other models sony but 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.989
 I do not have the experience so if you 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:43.650
 have another model ben look rather 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:48.250
 a video for so your model then 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:51.070
 so for the xperia so loves them that he 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.700
 will have to download fram a rod true ma 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.090
 road as you want so I have the 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.330
 version 1.5 points 3 after I do not know 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.280
 if the higher versions can 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.439
 to work anyway with that one 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.020
 I worked so if it works 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.390
 no I try you basic and if there is 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.220
 no higher versions 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:18.120
 then you download it i'm going to put 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:24.090
 the link in the descriptions then 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:28.120
 so had it on and there you'll 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.979
 super installed is it in it makes us 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.170
 install super received and you 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.080
 choose the great method for life so 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.360
 I will not do it because that's okay 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.690
 knew nothing for me he explains to us 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.310
 so you choose gandalf and so 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.350
 so after a few seconds the 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.140
 Defending he will tell you that it will take 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:55.540
 restart your phone is so there 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:57.100
 Leaving restarted on so I know 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.710
 not if it's for me that it did 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.590
 would be for me but when I read 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.890
 that actually start so already not me 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.879
 asked for an update and if you 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:14.500
 so ask the party for updates 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:19.560
 and so if it makes you like me it's 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.290
 ie you is on and their 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.420
 in fact 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.549
 10 because my level they light up 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.140
 so you unlock any case 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.640
 automatically claim 10 seconds 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.400
 after that and I do not know if it's 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.659
 normal but I do not think so and in fact 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.090
 it's going to do this in a loop that's going to 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.519
 turn on again will be him set this pace 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.459
 so what did I do to solve 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.189
 the problem is that places remove 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.739
 the battery and put it back and after the 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:49.549
 so you see it works and where they do not 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.900
 were more and well after you will see 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.900
 that there will have been perceived that he was suffering 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.470
 installed and so that's where your 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:05.020
 phone will be road and 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:06.430
 and so with super was able to open so there 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.060
 we will see who has a whole series 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.890
 applications 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.770
 these are all applications that 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:17.730
 will need to have sold rod from 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.080
 road Thursday road 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.810
 so when you open a 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.380
 road application for the first time 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.030
 they will ask you super su you 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.500
 request permission machine 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.590
 after which you are allowed 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.370
 this is your TV application 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.810
 can work normally 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.120
 and so I will make you one more 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.700
 little video later about the functions 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.060
 the road but it will be to others 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.390

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.500
