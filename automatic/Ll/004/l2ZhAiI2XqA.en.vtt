00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.710
 theoretical modules also that we them 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.730
 ask that they are but development 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.770
 child's psychological 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.320
 psychoanalysis and psychopathology 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.450
 of the adult these are homework by 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.230
 correspondence so that I corrects 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.660
 either homework at my office we 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.210

 the whole France so that's what 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.520
 was going great worked 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.690
 art therapy therefore does not use 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.170
 body language 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.290
 we use the theater we use the voice 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.370
 the song we use the drawing the 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.020
 painting the modeling writing here 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.000
 it's about you as the clown 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.350
 professional one can imagine the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.110
 liberal of course we can settle down 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.149
 in a room and receive any kind of 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.220
 patients intervene in crÃ¨ches 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.170
 we can intervene in associations 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.210
 we can intervene in schools in 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.190
 ventilated centers in hospitals 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.290
 also we can intervene in 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.820
 retirement homes is very 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.200
 valuing for the elderly that 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.560
 works very very well is very 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.020
 powerful 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.490
 kaeppelin we will take the example 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.580
 maybe from a student from last year 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.770
 to ventriloquist who today is going to do 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.780
 workshops with his puppet who has 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.060
 do a great memory precisely 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.120
 on it the power of the puppet 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.820
 and who exactly is going in the 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.500
 institutions in hospitals and who 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.170
 really develops this so this medium of 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.150
 the bride 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.220
 she and her fabulous is fabulous for 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.450
 children because because that's their 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.970
 gives confidence in many others 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.890
 examples of workshops of people who 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.149
 have created their workshop too which 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.299
 work with adults 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.850
 another who is who is in the hospital 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.640
 also with cancer oncologists 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.380
 dancers there are sculptors there are some 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.420
 doubts of people who come from 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.619
 theater there really is a loan of 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.470
 people who are educators 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.659

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.890
 social workers that's really all 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.200
 to mix and that's what exactly 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.280
 a wealth of all these mixtures of 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.860
 all these courses of all these 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.510
 table experiences I had a career
