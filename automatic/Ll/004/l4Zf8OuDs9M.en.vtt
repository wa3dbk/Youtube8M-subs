00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.530 
really into and I had a lot of people
left<00:02:59.310> comments<00:02:59.550> on<00:02:59.850> me<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.180> know<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.420> were

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
left comments on me you know that were

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.880 
left comments on me you know that were
really<00:03:00.780> annoyed<00:03:01.050> with<00:03:01.230> what<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.410> had<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.710> say

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
really annoyed with what I had to say

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.130 
really annoyed with what I had to say
about<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.280> mayor<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:03.150> cleared<00:03:03.360> up<00:03:03.540> it

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
about this mayor and it cleared up it

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.540 
about this mayor and it cleared up it
this<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.500> not<00:03:04.650> what<00:03:04.770> I<00:03:04.800> think<00:03:05.010> about<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.280> work<00:03:05.400> I

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
this is not what I think about it work I

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.860 
this is not what I think about it work I
actually<00:03:05.700> think<00:03:06.000> she<00:03:06.180> took<00:03:06.360> some<00:03:06.540> wonderful

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
actually think she took some wonderful

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.470 
actually think she took some wonderful
pictures<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.920> have<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.640> bigger<00:03:08.940> problem<00:03:09.210> with

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
pictures I have a bigger problem with

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.320 
pictures I have a bigger problem with
how<00:03:09.600> she's<00:03:09.810> being<00:03:09.990> presented<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:12.000> know<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.150> lot

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
how she's being presented you know a lot

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.520 
how she's being presented you know a lot
of<00:03:12.360> these<00:03:12.540> tags<00:03:12.810> as<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.200> greatest

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
of these tags as the greatest

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.350 
of these tags as the greatest
photographer<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.130> all<00:03:14.280> time<00:03:14.490> redefining<00:03:15.180> the

photographer of all time redefining the
history<00:03:15.660> photography<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.320> sort<00:03:16.620> of

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
history photography and that sort of

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.320 
history photography and that sort of
thing<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.610> find<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:17.970> lawsuit

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
thing and I find the lawsuit

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.610 
thing and I find the lawsuit
particularly<00:03:18.750> interesting<00:03:19.050> because<00:03:19.080> what

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
particularly interesting because what

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.560 
particularly interesting because what
happens<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.190> lot<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.640> this<00:03:20.850> is<00:03:21.000> fabricated

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
happens is a lot of this is fabricated

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.240 
happens is a lot of this is fabricated
by<00:03:21.690> these<00:03:21.840> three<00:03:22.080> collectors<00:03:22.500> mainly<00:03:22.920> Maloof

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
by these three collectors mainly Maloof

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.240 
by these three collectors mainly Maloof
who<00:03:23.870> got<00:03:24.870> into<00:03:25.170> her<00:03:25.260> work<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.770> decided<00:03:26.190> they

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
who got into her work and decided they

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.380 
who got into her work and decided they
were<00:03:26.340> gonna<00:03:26.430> start<00:03:26.550> making<00:03:26.790> prints<00:03:27.180> from<00:03:27.300> that

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
were gonna start making prints from that

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.050 
were gonna start making prints from that
and<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.870> is<00:03:27.990> very<00:03:28.200> dangerous<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.890> do

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
and this is very dangerous to do

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.840 
and this is very dangerous to do
particularly<00:03:30.060> with<00:03:30.270> copyright<00:03:31.070> if<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.550> do

there<00:03:47.670> is<00:03:47.820> money<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.240> be<00:03:48.270> made<00:03:48.510> with<00:03:48.750> something

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
there is money to be made with something

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.200 
there is money to be made with something
like<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.260> what<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.100> also<00:03:50.370> interesting<00:03:50.580> about

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
like that what is also interesting about

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.970 
like that what is also interesting about
all<00:03:51.270> this<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.230> New<00:03:52.350> York<00:03:52.500> Times<00:03:52.530> didn't

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
all this and the New York Times didn't

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.300 
all this and the New York Times didn't
go<00:03:53.100> into<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.430> much<00:03:53.730> but<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:55.470> possible<00:03:56.070> too

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
go into this much but it is possible too

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.610 
go into this much but it is possible too
that<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:57.300> state<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.570> Illinois<00:03:57.720> could<00:03:58.230> step<00:03:58.440> in

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
that the state of Illinois could step in

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.380 
that the state of Illinois could step in
because<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:58.950> believe<00:03:59.340> on<00:03:59.490> a<00:03:59.520> state<00:03:59.820> level<00:04:00.150> there

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
because I believe on a state level there

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.000 
because I believe on a state level there
is<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.540> law<00:04:00.810> saying<00:04:01.110> basically<00:04:01.650> if<00:04:01.710> somebody

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
is a law saying basically if somebody

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.180 
is a law saying basically if somebody
dies<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.250> leaves<00:04:02.610> their<00:04:02.940> estate<00:04:03.800> to<00:04:04.800> no<00:04:04.950> one

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
dies and leaves their estate to no one

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.580 
dies and leaves their estate to no one
that<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.850> is<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:06.150> property<00:04:06.570> indeed<00:04:07.080> of<00:04:07.260> the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
that it is the property indeed of the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.320 
that it is the property indeed of the
state<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:08.100> so<00:04:08.370> it<00:04:08.520> is<00:04:08.670> possible<00:04:09.210> of<00:04:09.300> course

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
state and so it is possible of course

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.820 
state and so it is possible of course
the<00:04:09.570> state<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.840> Illinois<00:04:10.080> has<00:04:10.110> not<00:04:10.410> jumped<00:04:10.710> in

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
the state of Illinois has not jumped in

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.620 
the state of Illinois has not jumped in
this<00:04:10.950> is<00:04:11.070> all<00:04:11.190> hypothetical<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:12.360> this<00:04:12.510> is

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
this is all hypothetical and this is

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.630 
this is all hypothetical and this is
just<00:04:12.750> another<00:04:12.900> possibility<00:04:13.500> but<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.490> is

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
just another possibility but it is

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.070 
just another possibility but it is
interesting<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.180> follow<00:04:15.480> this<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.690> see<00:04:15.960> what

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
interesting to follow this and see what

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.450 
interesting to follow this and see what
starts<00:04:16.380> happening<00:04:16.560> when<00:04:16.950> all<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.190> sudden

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:17.460 
starts happening when all of a sudden

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.979 
starts happening when all of a sudden
there<00:04:17.609> is<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:18.090> buck<00:04:18.270> to<00:04:18.390> be<00:04:18.420> made<00:04:18.540> off<00:04:18.840> of

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
there is a buck to be made off of

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.260 
there is a buck to be made off of
something<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.500> I<00:04:19.890> think<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.820> bottom<00:04:20.970> line

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
something and I think the bottom line

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.740 
something and I think the bottom line
for<00:04:21.540> me<00:04:21.600> if<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:21.989> can<00:04:22.049> insert<00:04:22.590> my<00:04:22.740> two<00:04:22.800> cents<00:04:23.190> here

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
for me if I can insert my two cents here

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.570 
for me if I can insert my two cents here
you<00:04:24.750> know<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:24.900> think<00:04:25.110> Vivian<00:04:25.530> Mayer

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
you know I think Vivian Mayer

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.879 
you know I think Vivian Mayer
was<00:04:26.759> very<00:04:26.970> capable<00:04:27.449> I<00:04:27.629> should<00:04:27.840> do<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.319> review<00:04:28.800> of

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
was very capable I should do a review of

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.529 
was very capable I should do a review of
her<00:04:29.009> film<00:04:29.280> as<00:04:29.580> well<00:04:29.789> because<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.240> think<00:04:30.270> the

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
her film as well because I think the

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.420 
her film as well because I think the
film<00:04:30.750> was<00:04:30.900> actually<00:04:31.110> impressively<00:04:31.889> well<00:04:32.190> done

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
film was actually impressively well done

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.730 
film was actually impressively well done
I<00:04:32.669> did<00:04:33.030> not<00:04:33.180> expect<00:04:33.599> to<00:04:33.690> like<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.169> actually

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
I did not expect to like it and actually

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.350 
I did not expect to like it and actually
did<00:04:35.069> I<00:04:35.099> think<00:04:35.400> Maloof<00:04:35.639> did<00:04:35.849> a<00:04:35.879> wonderful<00:04:36.120> job

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
did I think Maloof did a wonderful job

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.330 
did I think Maloof did a wonderful job
considering<00:04:37.080> he's<00:04:37.259> not<00:04:37.409> really<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.830> filmmaker

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
considering he's not really a filmmaker

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.700 
considering he's not really a filmmaker
I<00:04:39.120> thought<00:04:39.509> it<00:04:39.629> was<00:04:39.750> interesting<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.440> entire

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
I thought it was interesting the entire

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.860 
I thought it was interesting the entire
time<00:04:40.949> and<00:04:41.159> I<00:04:41.250> think<00:04:41.340> it<00:04:41.610> was<00:04:41.729> also<00:04:41.940> very<00:04:42.330> honest

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
time and I think it was also very honest

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.350 
time and I think it was also very honest
about<00:04:43.280> her<00:04:44.280> place<00:04:44.580> in<00:04:44.879> the<00:04:45.030> history<00:04:45.150> of

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
about her place in the history of

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.390 
about her place in the history of
photography<00:04:45.479> where<00:04:46.259> you<00:04:46.409> have<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.650> nanny<00:04:46.949> who

coming<00:05:35.520> famous<00:05:36.060> as<00:05:36.210> a<00:05:36.240> photographer<00:05:36.900> would

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
coming famous as a photographer would

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.600

and anyway it's never really about

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.010 
and anyway it's never really about
somebody<00:05:41.759> once<00:05:41.969> they<00:05:42.150> die<00:05:42.330> it's<00:05:42.630> about<00:05:42.840> the

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
somebody once they die it's about the

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.480 
somebody once they die it's about the
mess<00:05:43.169> they<00:05:43.289> leave<00:05:43.469> behind<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:44.009> how<00:05:44.130> much<00:05:44.310> it's

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
mess they leave behind and how much it's

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.559 
mess they leave behind and how much it's
worth<00:05:44.550> and<00:05:44.940> I<00:05:45.060> think<00:05:45.240> that's<00:05:45.360> what<00:05:45.449> we're

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569 
worth and I think that's what we're

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:46.969
