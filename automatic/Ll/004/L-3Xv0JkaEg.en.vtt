00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
the aesthetics from big things like a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.700 
the aesthetics from big things like a

the smallest ohta y aesthetic touches

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.090 
the smallest ohta y aesthetic touches
like<00:01:21.210> his<00:01:21.450> little<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:22.409> air<00:01:22.530> vents<00:01:22.830> which<00:01:23.009> I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
like his little little air vents which I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.260 
like his little little air vents which I
don't<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.369> actually<00:01:23.520> show<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:24.030> but

don't think actually show but but

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.390 
don't think actually show but but
they're<00:01:24.420> their<00:01:24.650> input<00:01:25.650> aesthetics<00:01:26.100> aside

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
they're their input aesthetics aside

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.219 
they're their input aesthetics aside
let's<00:01:26.670> talk<00:01:26.790> about<00:01:27.060> power<00:01:27.210> weapons<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.869> basic

three weapons are drops wand now let's
see<00:01:55.049> if<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.259> explain<00:01:55.590> draft<00:01:55.920> bonding<00:01:56.159> for

definitely comes in handy now the only

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.290 
definitely comes in handy now the only
strange<00:02:38.100> thing<00:02:38.190> about<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.970> the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
strange thing about this is that the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.060 
strange thing about this is that the
timer's<00:02:39.600> actually<00:02:39.989> start<00:02:40.320> in<00:02:40.650> Texas<00:02:40.950> before

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
timer's actually start in Texas before

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.040 
timer's actually start in Texas before
the<00:02:41.340> match<00:02:41.489> begins<00:02:41.820> so<00:02:42.660> let's<00:02:42.810> look<00:02:42.870> at<00:02:42.989> the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
the match begins so let's look at the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.690 
the match begins so let's look at the
sniper<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.470> example<00:02:43.890> even<00:02:44.280> though<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.580> game

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
sniper for example even though the game

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.850 
sniper for example even though the game
started<00:02:45.030> at<00:02:45.120> 15<00:02:45.390> minutes<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:46.230> weapon<00:02:46.590> timers

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
started at 15 minutes the weapon timers

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.130 
started at 15 minutes the weapon timers
started<00:02:47.190> at<00:02:47.340> 15<00:02:47.730> minutes<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.060> 10<00:02:48.180> seconds<00:02:48.510> so

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
started at 15 minutes and 10 seconds so

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.510 
started at 15 minutes and 10 seconds so
that<00:02:49.290> means<00:02:49.440> with<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.680> 90-second<00:02:50.280> Reese<00:02:50.400> one

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
that means with a 90-second Reese one

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.100 
that means with a 90-second Reese one
time<00:02:50.670> where<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.970> weapon<00:02:51.239> will<00:02:51.390> respond<00:02:51.750> at<00:02:51.900> 30

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
time where the weapon will respond at 30

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.190 
time where the weapon will respond at 30
minutes<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.590> 40<00:02:52.950> seconds<00:02:53.280> not<00:02:53.760> 30<00:02:53.970> seconds<00:02:54.360> so

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
minutes and 40 seconds not 30 seconds so

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.140 
minutes and 40 seconds not 30 seconds so
like<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:55.410> said<00:02:55.470> being<00:02:56.190> able<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.550> keep<00:02:56.910> track<00:02:56.970> of

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
like I said being able to keep track of

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.490 
like I said being able to keep track of
your<00:02:57.300> respond<00:02:57.690> times<00:02:57.870> for<00:02:58.080> all<00:02:58.170> your<00:02:58.320> power

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
your respond times for all your power

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.960 
your respond times for all your power
weapons<00:02:58.800> will<00:02:58.950> definitely<00:02:59.400> give<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.550> an<00:02:59.790> edge

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
weapons will definitely give you an edge

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.970 
weapons will definitely give you an edge
over<00:03:00.209> your<00:03:00.390> opponent<00:03:00.780> now<00:03:01.440> another<00:03:01.680> thing<00:03:01.769> to

over your opponent now another thing to
keep<00:03:02.070> in<00:03:02.160> mind<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:02.640> grenades<00:03:02.970> they<00:03:03.510> can

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
keep in mind it's grenades they can

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.120 
keep in mind it's grenades they can
definitely<00:03:04.050> play<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.290> huge<00:03:04.590> factor<00:03:04.800> in<00:03:04.980> this

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
definitely play a huge factor in this

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.070 
definitely play a huge factor in this
map<00:03:05.370> especially<00:03:06.300> with<00:03:06.390> all<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.540> 45<00:03:06.989> degree

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
map especially with all the 45 degree

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.540 
map especially with all the 45 degree
angles<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.590> can<00:03:07.680> be<00:03:07.800> really<00:03:08.010> effective<00:03:08.190> just

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
angles it can be really effective just

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.800 
angles it can be really effective just
