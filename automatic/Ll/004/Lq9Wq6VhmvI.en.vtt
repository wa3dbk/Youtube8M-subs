will speak slowly and I think that this

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.260 
will speak slowly and I think that this
will<00:00:59.969> help<00:01:00.120> kids<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.289> best<00:01:02.180> experiment<00:01:03.180> with

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
will help kids the best experiment with

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.369 
will help kids the best experiment with
that<00:01:03.359> how<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.510> want<00:01:03.750> maybe<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.989> want<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.229> turn

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
that how you want maybe you want to turn

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.780 
that how you want maybe you want to turn
it<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.650> little<00:01:04.769> bit<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.220> once<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.549> speech

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
