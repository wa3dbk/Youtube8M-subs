predictive hardware accelerated work

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.650 
predictive hardware accelerated work
then<00:01:00.950> you<00:01:01.040> can<00:01:01.160> actually<00:01:01.430> just<00:01:01.610> use<00:01:01.730> WebGL<00:01:02.090> and

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
then you can actually just use WebGL and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.840 
then you can actually just use WebGL and
