everyone can connect with everyone at
the<00:01:52.580> same<00:01:52.760> time<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.360> I<00:01:53.660> figured<00:01:54.140> this<00:01:54.290> would<00:01:54.380> be

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
the same time so I figured this would be

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.590 
the same time so I figured this would be
a<00:01:54.530> good<00:01:54.740> idea<00:01:54.800> to<00:01:55.190> help<00:01:55.730> get<00:01:55.970> everyone's<00:01:56.360> name

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
a good idea to help get everyone's name

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.060 
a good idea to help get everyone's name
out<00:01:56.750> there<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.140> kind<00:01:57.320> of<00:01:57.380> make<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:57.950> little

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
out there to kind of make it a little

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.280 
out there to kind of make it a little
bit<00:01:58.220> more<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:59.030> know<00:01:59.060> known<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.900> little<00:02:00.170> bit

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
bit more you know known and a little bit

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.970 
bit more you know known and a little bit
more<00:02:00.850> together<00:02:01.850> if<00:02:02.090> you<00:02:02.210> will<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:02.720> that's<00:02:03.380> one

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
more together if you will so that's one

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.960
