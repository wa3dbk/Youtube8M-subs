00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.750
 the girls then I wanted to make a name 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.040
 I say a bit special because I did it 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.660
 using a rather rare nail polish than in 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.600
 sale if I'm not mistaken only in 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.960
 france is here in the netherlands and is a glaze 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.570
 opi ai we say is similar to ai 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.699
 those cracked effect glazes just that 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.440
 this makes a bubble-like effect then 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.450
 it is indeed very particular it is not mine 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.610
 this of a friend of mine but as soon as I have 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.309
 knowing that he had just taken it ho 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.559
 wanted paper to lend to make 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.630
 test experiments as on unity 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.850
 He is now getting used to these mine 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.390
 experiments and I must say that the result 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.969
 I really like it very much because it is 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.280
 very particular and then I wanted 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.199
 accentuate this black bubble effect 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.960
 with very very colored enamels 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.539
 therefore, as a base you will need 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.530
 of some colored enamels 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:16.590
 I used them 5 you can use 6 or 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.110
 more even less can you cleric dori 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.220
 so important that if you want a 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.590
 similar market just take it 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.330
 some colored and then of course first 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.130
 to apply to colored enamels 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.110
 then complicated at the white base 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.940
 that is all you will have 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.220
 obviously need you need too 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.840
 of the transparent base that protects 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.119
 the nail before applying the base 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.700
 white for all colored glazes and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.670
 of course you need the polish 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.349
 opi to the spots and it is precisely this glaze 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.200
 very particular that creates this 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:49.830
 effect is no girls I leave the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.479
 tutorial 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.729
 I hope you like it and let me know 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.340
 what do you think of this new smart by 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.950
 this new effect no boys 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.510
 I leave you the kiss-like tutorial 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.250
 see my white base already applied 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.770
 which serves precisely to bring out of 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.090
 more colors just like when 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.520
 we put the white base under the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.350
 eye shadows to make them stand out below 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.390
 of course I also laid the base that 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.870
 protects the nail from colored enamels 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.600
 and now I'm going to get my glazes 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.720
 super super colorful and colorful 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.450
 I turn on and go to form the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.270
 speckles of color on the nails 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.670
 let's start with the three- inch thumb 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:36.240
 strip of color with blue and 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.240
 it continues like this with all the nails 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.549
 ok now that the polish or better all 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.730
 enamels have dried I can pass 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:38.370
 with my magical top coat dressing one 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.370
 very very thin layer on the nail 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.900
 and here is this is the result 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:52.659
 But I like it very much 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:55.019
 I have to say a lot about everything 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.019
 nails 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.060
 evola this is the end result is 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.310
 very particular but I repeat second 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.890
 it's really nice I really like it 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.810
 much and especially with enamels 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.200
 colored underneath and no kids this is 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.909
 all 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.200
 I'll send you a mega kiss we 'll see 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.200
