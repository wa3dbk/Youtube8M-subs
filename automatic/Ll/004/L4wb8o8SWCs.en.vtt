that 10x optical zoom it's gonna make a

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.680 
that 10x optical zoom it's gonna make a
real<00:02:17.950> big<00:02:17.980> difference<00:02:18.370> getting<00:02:19.300> out<00:02:19.450> there

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
real big difference getting out there

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.280 
real big difference getting out there
and<00:02:20.160> hitting<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.490> know<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.700> far<00:02:21.910> shots<00:02:22.290> it

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
and hitting you know the far shots it

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.900 
and hitting you know the far shots it
just<00:02:23.500> makes<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.770> biggest<00:02:23.950> difference<00:02:24.220> with

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
just makes the biggest difference with

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.970 
just makes the biggest difference with
the<00:02:25.030> 16<00:02:25.420> megapixels<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.230> can<00:02:26.440> go<00:02:26.560> ahead<00:02:26.650> and

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
the 16 megapixels you can go ahead and

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.860 
the 16 megapixels you can go ahead and
put<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.160> on<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.400> computer<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:28.000> then<00:02:28.450> zoom<00:02:28.720> it

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
put it on the computer and then zoom it

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.960 
put it on the computer and then zoom it
in<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.990> little<00:02:29.320> bit<00:02:29.440> more<00:02:29.710> so<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.250> make<00:02:30.640> more<00:02:30.850> of

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
in a little bit more so to make more of

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.150 
in a little bit more so to make more of
a<00:02:31.060> difference<00:02:31.090> with<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.020> 16<00:02:32.560> megapixel

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
a difference with that 16 megapixel

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.750 
a difference with that 16 megapixel

out the battery to throw it on the
charger<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:37.950> then<00:04:38.490> just<00:04:38.700> pull<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.090> out<00:04:39.210> and

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.380 
know they tend to get bent or messed up
and<00:05:07.410> stuff<00:05:07.680> because<00:05:07.830> they<00:05:08.070> stick<00:05:08.310> out<00:05:08.460> you

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390
