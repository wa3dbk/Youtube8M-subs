00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:18.000
 old such stone houses i 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.400
 decided to change let's say the qualification and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.330
 go a little bit the other way and 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.560

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.300
 I hope that you appreciate the work done, but also 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.100
 labor I spent a lot of time for 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.829
 in order to 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.309
 what was spinning in my head became 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.559

 we have guys home to survive in 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:51.989
 the form of such a model is a media in the form of talking 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.149
 modernist style let's say at least 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.010
 I think this is modern style 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.339
 several types are used here 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.229
 blocks let's fly around this 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:05.909

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.899
 there are wishes about this style 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.330
 is it worth it to bump into this style and 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.360

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.819

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.110

 I don't know grace 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.120
 words to describe it go go 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.769
 in the middle we open the door and close 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.489
 again here 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.820
 carpet under some rugs 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.160
 the ground is thick and therefore it is lightened and 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.670
 all rooms that is lighted up lit 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.560
 and no torch on the walls do not need 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.079
 if the walls are so dark here it is 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.120
 doesn't mean mobs will spawn here 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:44.380
 there is such a small room with 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.270
 transparent fully transparent wall 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.880
 and from here a very cool look can 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.470
 you can put some sofa 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.270
 placed on it in general 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.790
 arrangement again will 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.670
 engage you have a little wanting 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.310
 The room I did not remove the torch there is a small 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.290
 living room here is also possible steam 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.750
 leave a bunch of all sorts of you need 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.170

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.480
 will play with friends on the server well 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.730
 or you have a common there with friends small 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.040

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.930
 the building there gash and dwell in 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.560
 this house has only rooms here 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.540
 enough to stay as we pass 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.380
 large room through which you can 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.660
 get into such an image of space 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.670
 the premises are not even premises 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:37.270
 just going under cover here shelters not 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.100

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.690

 transparent roof let's say so sunny 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.170
 the light does illuminate this room well 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.660
 it â€™s still worth working on 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.390
 lighting and you have this task 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.750
 so that you could not spawn here 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.870
