00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
moving on with another image here and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.210 
moving on with another image here and
there<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.600> top<00:01:22.259> corridor<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.130> I

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
there is of the top corridor if I

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.580 
there is of the top corridor if I
remember<00:01:23.549> by<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> entrance<00:01:24.570> or<00:01:24.990> what<00:01:25.500> we

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
remember by the entrance or what we

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.740 
remember by the entrance or what we
assume<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:26.009> entrance<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> camera<00:01:26.970> 9<00:01:27.330> I

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
assume to be entrance is a camera 9 I

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.270 
assume to be entrance is a camera 9 I
think<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.470> there<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.680> think<00:01:28.799> that's<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
think so and there I think that's the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.730 
think so and there I think that's the
vent<00:01:29.490> there<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.329> an<00:01:30.540> spring-trap<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.619> go

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
vent there that an spring-trap can go

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.990 
vent there that an spring-trap can go
through<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.009> don't<00:01:32.280> know<00:01:32.340> how<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> go<00:01:32.820> through

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
through I don't know how to go through

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.120 
through I don't know how to go through
that<00:01:33.150> thing<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:34.079> awfully<00:01:34.380> small<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:35.009> either

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
that thing it's awfully small but either

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.620 
that thing it's awfully small but either
way<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.369> looks<00:01:35.520> pretty<00:01:35.700> damn<00:01:35.850> good<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.240> mean

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.530 
pretty good but there's a bear shot of a
vent<00:03:12.500> that's<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:13.069> good<00:03:13.310> vent<00:03:13.699> for<00:03:13.910> you<00:03:14.000> to<00:03:14.209> see

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
vent that's a good vent for you to see

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.659 
vent that's a good vent for you to see
look<00:03:15.410> at<00:03:15.560> that<00:03:15.620> one<00:03:15.980> there<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.340> mean

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
look at that one there I mean

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.490 
look at that one there I mean
spring-trap<00:03:17.510> could<00:03:17.720> fit<00:03:17.930> through<00:03:18.139> that<00:03:18.169> one

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
spring-trap could fit through that one

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.650 
spring-trap could fit through that one
there<00:03:18.680> clearly<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.190> always<00:03:19.819> hated<00:03:20.030> this<00:03:20.359> shot

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
there clearly I always hated this shot

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.659 
there clearly I always hated this shot
because<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:21.049> always<00:03:21.199> seems<00:03:21.349> so<00:03:21.680> fuzzy<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:22.400> could

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
because it always seems so fuzzy I could

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.879 
because it always seems so fuzzy I could
never<00:03:22.940> see<00:03:23.299> where<00:03:23.480> spring-trap<00:03:24.019> was<00:03:24.290> on<00:03:24.500> it<00:03:24.620> I

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
never see where spring-trap was on it I

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.500 
never see where spring-trap was on it I
knew<00:03:25.129> he<00:03:25.250> was<00:03:25.430> there<00:03:25.639> I<00:03:25.849> could<00:03:26.150> feel<00:03:26.329> his

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
knew he was there I could feel his

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.479 
knew he was there I could feel his
presence<00:03:26.629> but<00:03:27.319> I<00:03:27.349> could<00:03:27.500> never<00:03:27.650> find<00:03:27.799> him<00:03:28.280> and

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
presence but I could never find him and

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:29.800 
presence but I could never find him and
it<00:03:28.609> really<00:03:28.910> annoyed<00:03:29.180> me<00:03:29.209> but<00:03:29.540> there<00:03:29.660> we<00:03:29.720> go

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
it really annoyed me but there we go

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.180 
it really annoyed me but there we go
Freddy's<00:03:30.290> head<00:03:30.319> up<00:03:30.590> there<00:03:30.739> as<00:03:30.889> well<00:03:31.040> which

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
Freddy's head up there as well which

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.009 
Freddy's head up there as well which
looks<00:03:31.340> good<00:03:31.609> so<00:03:32.000> I'm<00:03:32.090> wondering<00:03:32.299> if<00:03:32.569> there<00:03:32.629> is

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
looks good so I'm wondering if there is

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.839 
looks good so I'm wondering if there is
a<00:03:33.049> arcade<00:03:33.859> machine<00:03:34.129> for<00:03:34.250> each<00:03:34.400> one<00:03:34.639> of<00:03:34.760> them

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
a arcade machine for each one of them

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.119 
a arcade machine for each one of them
maybe<00:03:35.329> I<00:03:35.540> think<00:03:35.900> that's<00:03:36.260> Bonnie<00:03:36.560> there<00:03:36.799> again

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
maybe I think that's Bonnie there again

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.309 
maybe I think that's Bonnie there again
it's<00:03:37.310> looking<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:37.609> little<00:03:37.730> bit<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.150> Glary<00:03:38.930> over

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
it's looking a little bit a Glary over

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.259 
it's looking a little bit a Glary over
there<00:03:39.440> I<00:03:39.470> can't<00:03:39.680> quite<00:03:40.129> see<00:03:40.549> but<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:40.879> doesn't

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
there I can't quite see but it doesn't

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.379 
there I can't quite see but it doesn't
look<00:03:41.389> like<00:03:41.419> maybe<00:03:41.810> foxy<00:03:42.650> might<00:03:43.549> be<00:03:43.699> foxy<00:03:44.239> with

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
look like maybe foxy might be foxy with

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:45.729 
look like maybe foxy might be foxy with
the<00:03:44.480> teeth<00:03:44.720> but<00:03:44.930> I'm<00:03:45.049> not<00:03:45.139> hundreds<00:03:45.620> in

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
the teeth but I'm not hundreds in

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.800 
the teeth but I'm not hundreds in
certain<00:03:46.250> next<00:03:46.760> up<00:03:46.879> we've<00:03:47.030> got<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.359> final

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810
