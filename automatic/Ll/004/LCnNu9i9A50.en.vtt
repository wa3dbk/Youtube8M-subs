00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
life's like your toy lone hill which is

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.640 
life's like your toy lone hill which is
probably<00:02:04.479> are<00:02:04.630> going<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.810> be<00:02:04.869> your<00:02:04.990> own<00:02:05.200> excuse

probably are going to be your own excuse
but<00:02:06.250> down<00:02:06.490> more<00:02:06.700> controller<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.479> quit<00:02:07.780> the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
but down more controller and quit the

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.410 
but down more controller and quit the
game<00:02:08.350> because<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.190> game

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
game because this game

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.870 
game because this game
is<00:02:10.569> so<00:02:10.929> easy<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.950> cannot<00:02:12.190> possibly<00:02:12.459> die

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
is so easy that you cannot possibly die

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.260 
is so easy that you cannot possibly die
from<00:02:13.150> this<00:02:13.300> unless<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.750> are<00:02:13.900> low<00:02:14.410> on<00:02:14.440> hill<00:02:16.319> so

look how slow that sand is anyway when
you<00:02:27.310> get<00:02:28.830> around<00:02:29.830> right<00:02:30.750> okay<00:02:31.750> ignore<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.739> go

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
you get around right okay ignore the go

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.170 
you get around right okay ignore the go
order<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.370> can<00:02:33.489> if<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.760> have<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.880> rockabilly

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
order you can if you have a rockabilly

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.850 
order you can if you have a rockabilly
pretty<00:02:34.630> much<00:02:34.750> this<00:02:34.870> role<00:02:35.200> throughout<00:02:35.739> this

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
pretty much this role throughout this

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.020 
pretty much this role throughout this
entire<00:02:36.040> area

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.240 

so<00:02:40.030> what's<00:02:40.930> funny<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.290> after<00:02:41.740> that<00:02:41.860> sandwich

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
so what's funny is after that sandwich

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.670 
so what's funny is after that sandwich
is<00:02:42.460> at<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.700> top<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.150> will<00:02:43.540> not<00:02:43.690> go<00:02:43.900> back<00:02:43.930> it

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
is at the top it will not go back it

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.200 
is at the top it will not go back it
will<00:02:44.950> not<00:02:45.100> keep<00:02:45.340> going<00:02:45.640> up<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.910> will<00:02:46.000> stay

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
will not keep going up it will stay

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.800 
will not keep going up it will stay
right<00:02:46.480> there<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:47.940> wallaby<00:02:48.940> will<00:02:49.270> come<00:02:49.630> out

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
right there and wallaby will come out

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.200 
right there and wallaby will come out
and<00:02:49.990> one<00:02:50.140> here<00:02:50.320> in<00:02:50.350> this<00:02:50.470> demo<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:51.070> do<00:02:51.370> like<00:02:51.640> my

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
and one here in this demo I do like my

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.680 
and one here in this demo I do like my
lip<00:02:52.420> honey<00:02:53.020> I<00:02:53.370> thought<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:54.700> some

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
lip honey I thought it some

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.160 
lip honey I thought it some
so<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:58.790> jump<00:02:59.180> down<00:02:59.210> there's<00:02:59.570> no<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.780> crystal

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
so you jump down there's no the crystal

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.080 
so you jump down there's no the crystal
is<00:03:00.460> pretty<00:03:01.460> much<00:03:01.580> you<00:03:01.730> got<00:03:01.820> to<00:03:01.940> keep<00:03:02.030> going

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
is pretty much you got to keep going

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.610 
is pretty much you got to keep going
this<00:03:02.420> way<00:03:02.570> I'm<00:03:02.720> not<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:03.230> what<00:03:03.350> those<00:03:03.470> things

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
this way I'm not it what those things

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.480 
this way I'm not it what those things
are<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.610> forget<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.210> name<00:03:05.330> of<00:03:05.480> those<00:03:06.490> things

reminds<00:03:11.630> me<00:03:14.230> there's<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.440> electric<00:03:15.770> the

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
reminds me there's the electric the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.250 
reminds me there's the electric the
building<00:03:16.220> now<00:03:16.760> how<00:03:16.970> do<00:03:17.030> we<00:03:17.110> passing<00:03:18.110> light

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
building now how do we passing light

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.580 
building now how do we passing light
because<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:18.710> know<00:03:18.800> we're<00:03:19.040> lost<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.430> ability

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
because you know we're lost the ability

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.830 
because you know we're lost the ability
so<00:03:21.670> now<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.000> have<00:03:23.030> rock<00:03:23.630> and

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
so now that you have rock and

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.110 
so now that you have rock and
electricity<00:03:24.470> it's<00:03:25.460> going<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.700> pretty<00:03:25.850> much<00:03:25.940> be

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
electricity it's going to pretty much be

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.290 
electricity it's going to pretty much be
like<00:03:26.270> a<00:03:26.300> I<00:03:27.100> don't<00:03:28.100> know<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.700> guys<00:03:28.850> didn't

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
like a I don't know you guys didn't

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.820 
like a I don't know you guys didn't

to explain but it just does a and then
there's<00:03:36.140> your<00:03:36.290> third<00:03:36.500> crystal<00:03:36.770> and<00:03:37.160> now<00:03:37.340> you

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
there's your third crystal and now you

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.370 
there's your third crystal and now you
got<00:03:37.580> every<00:03:37.820> crystal<00:03:38.090> on<00:03:38.210> this<00:03:38.390> level<00:03:38.630> now<00:03:39.290> all

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
got every crystal on this level now all

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.680 
got every crystal on this level now all
you<00:03:39.440> have<00:03:39.470> to<00:03:39.590> do<00:03:39.740> is<00:03:39.890> keep<00:03:40.070> walking<00:03:40.690> right
