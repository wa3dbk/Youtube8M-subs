00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.809

 do not include guitar these video courses 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.380
 they 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.300
 remained independent units 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.090

 extracting sound on guitar 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.760
 accompaniment not to mention just 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.890
 chips themselves open strings 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.770
 The accompaniment and variety of prims on 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.990
 outdoor pants closed strings the same 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.750
 the very combination here is very much 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.400
 technical nuances with which 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.500
 the hand is capable of doing everything 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.870
 asked new new courses new and 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.720

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.440
 learning mastering guitar opportunity 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.209
 when does the number of courses go off scale 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.520
 12 I stopped giving numbers 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.830
 I just gave the name of the name on 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.720
 that moment was already 20 but not to 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.760
 scare students i just make a name 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.130
 These additions in the end they were attached 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.920
 already as a gift to the tutors 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.250
 four now when it is stated that 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.550
 guitar courses 3 of course and should 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.670
 explain what's the matter of 3 voluminous courses 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:10.060
 consisting of several inside courses then 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.180
 there are parts of what was never called 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.690
 the course is now called part for example 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.250
 1 video course called how fast and 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.670

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.830
 it consists of two parts of two 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.540
 the main parts the first part is learn 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.540
 play sing ie it once was 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.150
 just 1 goat and the second part is the guitar for 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.450
 each, that is, it was a recaro course for 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.519
 each course had their own cost and 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.890
 were self units now they 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.769
 merged now this 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.230
 parts sing two parts represents the first 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.150
 course as I said for more 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.540
 effective learning 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.810
 course bonus bonuses are attached and which 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.510
 also had and have their cost 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.940

 parsing songs simulators 21 video analysis 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.140
 stagnant songs songs dismantled 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.940
 simple tricks i combine i 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.310
 showing 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.410
 how interesting can be different options 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.450
 play a song simple songs but very 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.269
 nice options how you can complicate it 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.880
 on the far sight also attach a block 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.770
 Video footage from movie 24 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.950
 the songs here are a little more complicated 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.240
 accepting a weapon is enough 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.520
 interesting and diverse 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.050
 but the fourth bonus is the first part 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.420
 course guitar chips that we go through 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.980
 the origin of the fish is like them 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.450
 coming up with it yourself is very entertaining 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.480
 process and how important 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.520
 guitar chips are these baubles 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.860
 hotties in the song true and not worth it 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.310
 explain this is what attracts our hearing 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.440
 our eye when the guitarist performs the song 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.630
 decorate the accompaniment here of this jewelry 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.050
 already in the first part of the course 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.730
 masters the bar and nothing to wait for 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.510

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.390
 play right away 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.550
 this is me guaranteeing and in this also 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.770
 Make sure you take in the beginning here 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.170
 such a voluminous multi-volume turned out 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.610
 first course in total in this 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.120
 video course you will own 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.610

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.840
 repertoire 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.760
 the second course also consists of two parts 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.900
 this is the last third course video 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.360

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.480
 of course 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.210
 but fight without rules and kamasutra on strings 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.830
 the names speak for themselves there just 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.810
 fly away in total also 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.090
 presented in detail disassembled for more 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.830
 40 methods of playing the guitar in different styles 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.210
 and genres 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.160
 temperament rates are also attached 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.720
 interesting bonuses about this in detail can 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.910
 learn in the course description here for me 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.910
 I wanted to explain about the process 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.820
 combining why there were 12 more and became 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.070
 3 Now it will be clear that this is three 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.800
 the volume of the lower student course is more convenient 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.290
 it is more convenient to navigate 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.090
 I quickly learn to play the guitar 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.400
 strangely suspicious nothing strange 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.070
 of course you can if you know how it is 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.790
 do for this there is a mass of secret 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.890
 ways most importantly start correctly 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.930
 but also to continue me as a person 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.970
 committed to their work to madness 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.030
 lovers guitars as the author of the video 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.430
 programs in turn 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:34.810
 I guarantee everyone who wishes to do 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.730
 in my development already wants to master 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:41.330
 secrets of experience not one 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:43.520
 a dozen years having passed my courses my game 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.410
 student his skill and possession of the guitar 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.870
 will compare favorably with many and 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.030
 I am sure of that for many of them and it is 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.350
 I checked well everyone knows 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.120
 facing novice 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.920
 why can't the first steps 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.350
 why give up 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.390
 If you have questions about orders, you can 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.890
 I need to write to my liter which 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.170
 There is a description on the pages of all 

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.090
 explained in detail what and how 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.550
 below you will learn about the options 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.900
 ordering then there are one two or three courses you 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.030
 come wish for this 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.920
 fixed fixed shares here 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.770
 all I wanted to say that there is 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.410
 more or less clear that the name of the course 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.860
 it is now the name of the parts of the whole 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.850
 kind 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.850
 Victoria can be seen
