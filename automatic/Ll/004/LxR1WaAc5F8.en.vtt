other<00:00:40.079> experts<00:00:40.170> now<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.920> wrote<00:00:41.340> an<00:00:41.520> article<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
other experts now I wrote an article a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.750 
other experts now I wrote an article a
couple<00:00:42.210> years<00:00:42.750> ago<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:43.320> which<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.129> argued<00:00:44.610> that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
couple years ago in which I argued that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.760 
couple years ago in which I argued that
before<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> end<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.660> decade<00:00:45.899> China

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
before the end of this decade China

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.040 
before the end of this decade China
would<00:00:47.039> overtake<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.270> US<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.930> world's

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
would overtake the US as the world's

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.069 
would overtake the US as the world's
largest<00:00:49.410> economy<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.280> now<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.329> IMF<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
largest economy and now the IMF is

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.330 
largest economy and now the IMF is
pretty<00:00:52.320> much<00:00:52.500> coming<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.100> same

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
pretty much coming to that same

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.299 
pretty much coming to that same
conclusion<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:54.079> for<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> same<00:00:55.410> reason<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
conclusion and for the same reason you

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.599 
conclusion and for the same reason you
see<00:00:56.520> what<00:00:56.670> other<00:00:56.910> nations<00:00:57.899> or<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.500> other

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
see what other nations or what other

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.979 
see what other nations or what other
economists<00:00:59.609> fail<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.059> look<00:01:00.239> at<00:01:00.449> or<00:01:00.719> fail<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
economists fail to look at or fail to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.349 
economists fail to look at or fail to
factor<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.829> exchange<00:01:02.579> rates<00:01:02.820> they've

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
factor in is exchange rates they've

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.270 
factor in is exchange rates they've
assumed<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> R&amp;B<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> dollar<00:01:04.949> will

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
assumed that the R&amp;B and the dollar will

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.160 
assumed that the R&amp;B and the dollar will
stay<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.760> same<00:01:06.270> rate<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.780> they<00:01:06.960> are

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
stay at the same rate that they are

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.830 
stay at the same rate that they are
today<00:01:07.439> well<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> believe<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.909> sometime<00:01:09.570> over

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
today well I believe that sometime over

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.300 
today well I believe that sometime over
the<00:01:09.900> next<00:01:09.960> several<00:01:10.380> years<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.950> will<00:01:11.070> see<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the next several years you will see a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.179 
the next several years you will see a
substantial<00:01:12.140> revaluation<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.830> Chinese

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
substantial revaluation of the Chinese

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.950 
substantial revaluation of the Chinese
R&amp;B<00:01:14.580> where<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> Chinese<00:01:15.240> currency<00:01:15.450> will<00:01:15.810> rise

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
R&amp;B where the Chinese currency will rise

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.109 
R&amp;B where the Chinese currency will rise
sharply<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.799> when<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.400> happens<00:01:17.430> that

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
sharply and when that happens that

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.160 
sharply and when that happens that
changes<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:19.170> way<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.070> measure<00:01:20.430> GDP<00:01:21.090> if<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
changes the way you measure GDP if the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.109 
changes the way you measure GDP if the
Chinese<00:01:22.409> currency<00:01:22.770> doubles<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.759> value

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
Chinese currency doubles in value

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.170 
Chinese currency doubles in value
against<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> dollar<00:01:24.780> then<00:01:25.439> China's<00:01:25.920> GDP

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
against the dollar then China's GDP

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.420 
against the dollar then China's GDP
doubles<00:01:27.180> against<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> US<00:01:28.320> gdp<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.159> when<00:01:29.310> you

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
doubles against the US gdp so when you

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.490 
doubles against the US gdp so when you
factor<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:30.090> likely<00:01:30.659> exchange<00:01:31.290> rate

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
factor in likely exchange rate

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.249 
factor in likely exchange rate
appreciation<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.790> IMF<00:01:33.060> may<00:01:33.630> well<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:34.020> correct

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
appreciation the IMF may well be correct

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.270 
appreciation the IMF may well be correct
in<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.799> China<00:01:35.100> surpasses<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> u.s.<00:01:36.180> even<00:01:36.780> by

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
in that China surpasses the u.s. even by

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.560 
in that China surpasses the u.s. even by
2016<00:01:38.280> which<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.700> even<00:01:38.970> quicker<00:01:39.180> than<00:01:39.420> I

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
2016 which is even quicker than I

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.969 
2016 which is even quicker than I
thought<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.990> thought<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.409> know<00:01:40.500> by<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> end<00:01:40.799> of

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
thought I thought you know by the end of

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.760 
thought I thought you know by the end of
the<00:01:41.070> decade<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.579> certainly<00:01:42.290> 2016<00:01:43.290> would<00:01:43.470> meet

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the decade but certainly 2016 would meet

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.649 
the decade but certainly 2016 would meet
that<00:01:43.979> time<00:01:44.220> frame<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:44.939> one<00:01:45.210> thing<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.479> I

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that time frame but one thing that I

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.009 
politically expedient but the bottom
line<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.380> we<00:03:32.220> are<00:03:32.549> losing<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.299> China<00:03:33.600> because

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
line is we are losing to China because

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.620 
line is we are losing to China because
we<00:03:34.620> are<00:03:34.769> not<00:03:34.980> free<00:03:35.370> because<00:03:35.940> we<00:03:36.239> don't<00:03:36.420> have<00:03:36.510> a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
we are not free because we don't have a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.720 
we are not free because we don't have a
capitalist<00:03:37.200> economy<00:03:37.620> if<00:03:37.769> we<00:03:37.950> did<00:03:38.220> then<00:03:38.549> this

capitalist economy if we did then this

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.400 
capitalist economy if we did then this
wouldn't<00:03:38.940> be<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.090> case<00:03:39.359> and<00:03:39.660> of<00:03:40.049> course<00:03:40.260> we

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
wouldn't be the case and of course we

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.530 
wouldn't be the case and of course we
also<00:03:40.590> have<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.280> government<00:03:41.910> money<00:03:42.209> we<00:03:42.420> don't

money we have interest rates that are

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.410 
money we have interest rates that are
much<00:03:46.799> too<00:03:47.010> low<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.639> have<00:03:47.760> been<00:03:47.880> distorting

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
much too low that have been distorting

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.270 
much too low that have been distorting

government<00:03:50.459> rules<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.940> regulation<00:03:51.450> so<00:03:51.630> we

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
government rules of regulation so we

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.509 
government rules of regulation so we
have<00:03:52.200> anything<00:03:52.440> but<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:52.799> free<00:03:53.069> market<00:03:53.280> economy

have anything but a free market economy

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.759 
have anything but a free market economy
and<00:03:54.000> it's<00:03:54.120> because<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.569> all<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.410> government

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
and it's because of all the government

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.430 
and it's because of all the government
interference<00:03:56.370> in<00:03:56.579> our<00:03:57.120> economy<00:03:57.450> that's<00:03:58.170> why

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
interference in our economy that's why

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.990 
interference in our economy that's why
we're<00:03:58.680> losing<00:03:59.010> ground<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.700> reason<00:03:59.970> that

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
we're losing ground and the reason that

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.240 
we're losing ground and the reason that
that<00:04:00.090> shot<00:04:00.420> China<00:04:00.780> is<00:04:01.049> gaining<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.920> because

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
that shot China is gaining is because

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.190 
that shot China is gaining is because
they<00:04:02.400> have<00:04:02.430> less<00:04:02.579> I'm<00:04:03.150> not<00:04:03.420> saying<00:04:03.660> China<00:04:03.959> is

perfect far from it they have too much
government<00:04:06.329> in<00:04:06.569> China<00:04:06.810> it's<00:04:07.230> just<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.530> they
