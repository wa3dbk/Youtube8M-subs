00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 this is the sony xperia tablet z 2 it 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.120
 stylish top model under the tablet of 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.040
 sony 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.750
 he looks like his predecessor but he is 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.730
 actually improved on all fronts 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.740
 of course we see similarities this way 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.929
 the design is very recognizable and complete 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.550
 in the style of the last xperia 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.650
 and that therefore looks very tight and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.050
 stylish from the materials used 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.300
 feel good at the edges 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.740
 we see metal and at the rear 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.199
 we that that of and stiff rubbery 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.420
 plastic is made at the back 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.910
 we also find the 8 megapixel camera 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.860
 and that makes for tablet concepts best 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.090
 We also find good pictures here 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.219
 under the camera 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.870
 The NFC chip that causes it 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.649
 easily connect with other devices 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.120
 and the z2 tablet is really super slim 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.710
 it is only 6.4 mm thick and with its 426 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.510
 grammes he also feels very light 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.980
 so you can keep it in your hands for a long time 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.469
 for example when you are traveling 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.480
 or watching a movie and sony 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.340
 has the techniques of his TVs too 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.949
 applied in the 10.1 inch screen 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.719
 And that is not only noticeable 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.700
 everything sharp through the resolution of one 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.439
 nineteen twenty times twelve hundred 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.689
 but also the color rendering and the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.820
 brightness are fine by the use 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.080
 from the bravia engine and the triluminos 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.330
 technology 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.070
 the sound of the stereo speakers that are in 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.080
 the side of the border on the left and here 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.600
 sitting on the right is also very clear 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.490
 and very lively and and just like others 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.689
 he runs high-end models on a quad 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.939
 core processor 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.460
 in this case that is a 800 snapdragon 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.650
 and android 4 point 4 where we have the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.750
 latest version of android peel back 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.460
 and that in itself is not good 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.040
 lots of news navigating through the menu 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.860
 goes very smoothly and there is the standard 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.630
 already a good load of apps on this tablet 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.189
 really has the oh wow factor 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.720
 well then maybe soon 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.130
 fingerprints on the glass 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.170
 but that is not a problem because even if 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.369
 you could throw food over it then you can 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.460
 just put it under the tap for a moment 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.710
 keep this in mind 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.829
 you closed all the covers 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.909
 but you can even hold the tablet 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.799
 leave water 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.780
 do you want to know more about this or do you want 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.680
 order it then go to 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.969
 tabletcenter.nl or at a 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.119
 or drop into one of our 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.119
 stores
