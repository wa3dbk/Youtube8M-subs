00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.450 

in<00:00:00.510> this<00:00:01.290> video<00:00:01.589> I<00:00:01.800> want<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.070> talk<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.220> little

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
in this video I want to talk a little

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.220 
in this video I want to talk a little
bit<00:00:02.610> about<00:00:02.639> DNA<00:00:03.270> packaging<00:00:03.810> which<00:00:04.200> is

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
bit about DNA packaging which is

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.559 
bit about DNA packaging which is
basically<00:00:04.620> how<00:00:04.950> DNA<00:00:05.790> is<00:00:05.940> packed<00:00:06.270> in

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
basically how DNA is packed in

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.320 
basically how DNA is packed in
eukaryotes<00:00:07.460> so<00:00:08.460> I'm<00:00:08.760> going<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:08.940> use<00:00:09.030> human

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
eukaryotes so I'm going to use human

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.540 
eukaryotes so I'm going to use human
specifically<00:00:09.840> as<00:00:09.929> an<00:00:10.050> example<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:11.280> human

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
specifically as an example the human

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.079 
specifically as an example the human
genome<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.120> about<00:00:12.450> 3<00:00:13.070> billion<00:00:14.070> base<00:00:14.730> pairs

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
genome is about 3 billion base pairs

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.740 
genome is about 3 billion base pairs
long

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
long

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.000 
long
so<00:00:16.410> each<00:00:17.160> chromosome<00:00:17.730> has<00:00:18.320> millions<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.710> base

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
so each chromosome has millions of base

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.220 
so each chromosome has millions of base
pairs<00:00:20.340> now<00:00:21.090> each<00:00:21.420> bit<00:00:21.660> each<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.930> these<00:00:22.020> base

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
pairs now each bit each of these base

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.099 
pairs now each bit each of these base
pairs<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:23.330> nanometers<00:00:24.330> short<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.930> it's

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
pairs is like nanometers short like it's

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.480 
pairs is like nanometers short like it's
not<00:00:25.199> very<00:00:25.380> long<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:25.920> if<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.220> think<00:00:26.400> about

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
not very long but if you think about

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.939 
not very long but if you think about
millions<00:00:27.060> or<00:00:27.210> even<00:00:27.240> billions<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:28.349> them<00:00:28.590> if<00:00:28.859> you

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
millions or even billions of them if you

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.310 
millions or even billions of them if you
took<00:00:29.070> our<00:00:29.220> entire<00:00:29.400> genome<00:00:30.119> actually<00:00:30.420> recently

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
took our entire genome actually recently

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.700 
took our entire genome actually recently
read<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:32.369> paper<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:33.480> said<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.079> if

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
read this this paper that said that if

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.200 
read this this paper that said that if
you<00:00:34.890> stretch<00:00:35.160> out<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> entire<00:00:35.790> human<00:00:36.149> genome

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
you stretch out the entire human genome

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.410 
you stretch out the entire human genome
you<00:00:37.110> would<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.940> would<00:00:39.059> be<00:00:39.090> long

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
you would have and like it would be long

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.200 
you would have and like it would be long
enough<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:40.050> go<00:00:40.260> from<00:00:40.890> here<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.610> Sun<00:00:41.879> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
enough to go from here to the Sun and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.209 
enough to go from here to the Sun and
back<00:00:42.739> 300<00:00:43.739> times

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
back 300 times

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.860 
back 300 times
that's<00:00:45.090> insane<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.320> extremely<00:00:46.500> wrong<00:00:46.890> ok

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
that's insane so it's extremely wrong ok

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.750 
that's insane so it's extremely wrong ok
think<00:00:48.870> about<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.430> stuff<00:00:50.610> is

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
think about that all this stuff is

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.010 
think about that all this stuff is
packed<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.180> our<00:00:51.270> tiny<00:00:51.480> cells<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:51.899> have

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
packed in our tiny cells we have

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020 
packed in our tiny cells we have
trillions<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.710> cells<00:00:52.890> hundreds<00:00:53.370> 100<00:00:53.820> trillion

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
trillions of cells hundreds 100 trillion

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.950 
trillions of cells hundreds 100 trillion
cells<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.690> that's<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.530> lot<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.739> cells<00:00:55.920> now

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
cells or so that's a lot of cells now

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.220 
cells or so that's a lot of cells now
these<00:00:58.609> these<00:00:59.609> DNA<00:01:00.059> strands<00:01:00.420> right<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.930> if

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
these these DNA strands right and if

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.560 
these these DNA strands right and if
they<00:01:01.410> were<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.399> know<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.570> long

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
they were just like you know just long

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.539 
they were just like you know just long
strings<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.320> chillin<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.710> our<00:01:04.920> cells<00:01:05.189> that

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
strings just chillin in our cells that

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.420 
strings just chillin in our cells that
would<00:01:05.670> take<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.030> lot<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.210> space<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.430> instead

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
would take up a lot of space so instead

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.770 
would take up a lot of space so instead
of<00:01:08.490> having<00:01:08.640> them<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.090> hanging<00:01:09.510> out<00:01:09.600> as

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
of having them just hanging out as

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.630 
of having them just hanging out as
strings<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.409> what's<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.430> they're

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
strings with what's going on is they're

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.649 
strings with what's going on is they're
packed<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.920> into<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> little<00:01:14.130> compact<00:01:14.729> sort<00:01:15.180> of

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.010 

well<00:01:18.659> I'll<00:01:18.810> get<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.229> just<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> second<00:01:19.770> so

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
well I'll get to it in just a second so

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
well I'll get to it in just a second so
something<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> keep<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.320> mind<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.590> human<00:01:22.830> DNA

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
something to keep in mind is a human DNA

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.710 
something to keep in mind is a human DNA
of<00:01:23.130> course<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.490> linear<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.509> would<00:01:24.600> be

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
of course is linear so it would be

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.440 
of course is linear so it would be
really<00:01:24.930> really<00:01:24.960> long<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.939> DNA<00:01:27.270> take

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
really really long so with this DNA take

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.149 
really really long so with this DNA take
up<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.659> bunch<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.900> space<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> cell<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.890> answer

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
up a bunch of space in a cell the answer

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.980 
up a bunch of space in a cell the answer
is<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.430> course<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:33.299> must<00:01:33.600> solve<00:01:33.840> that

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
is of course so we must solve that

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.190 
is of course so we must solve that
problem<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.520> done<00:01:38.729> by<00:01:39.600> packaging

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
problem and that is done by packaging

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.749 
problem and that is done by packaging
the<00:01:40.770> DNA<00:01:41.299> ok<00:01:42.299> now<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:44.189> do<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.340> want<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.640> think

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the DNA ok now what do we want to think

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.340 
the DNA ok now what do we want to think
about<00:01:44.909> what<00:01:45.390> we're<00:01:45.540> going<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.720> think<00:01:45.930> about<00:01:45.990> is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
about what we're going to think about is

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.780 
about what we're going to think about is
that<00:01:46.820> this<00:01:48.770> pink<00:01:49.770> line<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.399> I've<00:01:50.520> drawn<00:01:50.759> here

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that this pink line that I've drawn here

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.440 
that this pink line that I've drawn here
is<00:01:51.299> DNA<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.340> DNA<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.890> wound<00:01:56.030> around<00:01:57.030> these

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
is DNA so this DNA is wound around these

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.330 
is DNA so this DNA is wound around these
little<00:01:57.719> brown<00:01:58.229> circles<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.040> I've<00:01:59.130> drawn

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
little brown circles that I've drawn

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.609 
little brown circles that I've drawn
here<00:01:59.549> these<00:01:59.729> brown<00:01:59.969> circles<00:02:00.509> what<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.409> call

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
here these brown circles what we call

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.340 
here these brown circles what we call
histones<00:02:02.689> now<00:02:03.689> we'll<00:02:03.930> talk<00:02:04.140> more<00:02:04.290> about

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
histones now we'll talk more about

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.839 
histones now we'll talk more about
histones<00:02:04.890> later<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.369> histones<00:02:05.790> are<00:02:07.849> little

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
histones later but histones are little

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.450 
histones later but histones are little
proteins<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:10.160> basically

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
proteins that basically

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.750 
proteins that basically
their<00:02:11.940> purposes<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:13.260> help<00:02:13.500> pack<00:02:14.370> DNA<00:02:14.970> so

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
their purposes is to help pack DNA so

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.850 
their purposes is to help pack DNA so
the<00:02:17.760> DNA<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.510> wound<00:02:18.840> around<00:02:19.020> these<00:02:19.350> histones

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
the DNA is wound around these histones

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.350 
the DNA is wound around these histones
and<00:02:20.130> continually<00:02:20.670> wound<00:02:20.850> in<00:02:21.060> one<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.270> the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
and continually wound in one of the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.410 
and continually wound in one of the
background<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.590> as<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:23.610> wound<00:02:23.820> these

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
background and as it's wound these

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.210 
background and as it's wound these
little<00:02:24.660> they<00:02:24.810> look<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:25.080> beads<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.130> string

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
little they look like beads on a string

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.160 
little they look like beads on a string
if<00:02:26.580> you've<00:02:26.700> ever<00:02:26.850> back<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.330> elementary<00:02:27.870> school

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
if you've ever back in elementary school

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.770 
if you've ever back in elementary school
had<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> little<00:02:29.310> string<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.940> maybe<00:02:30.240> in<00:02:30.420> arts

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
had a little string and maybe in arts

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.270 
had a little string and maybe in arts
and<00:02:30.870> crafts<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.320> put<00:02:31.560> beads<00:02:31.770> on<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.010> string

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
and crafts you put beads on the string

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.890 
and crafts you put beads on the string
and<00:02:32.520> then<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.970> get<00:02:33.120> made<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.390> necklace<00:02:33.720> or

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
and then you get made of necklace or

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.990 
and then you get made of necklace or
something<00:02:34.230> kind<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:34.980> what's<00:02:35.160> going<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.490> here

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
something kind of what's going on here

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.430 
something kind of what's going on here
looks<00:02:36.390> like<00:02:36.540> beads<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.900> string<00:02:36.990> and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
looks like beads on a string and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.020 
looks like beads on a string and
eventually<00:02:38.280> they're<00:02:38.400> packed<00:02:38.640> into<00:02:38.820> these

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
eventually they're packed into these

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.410 
eventually they're packed into these
little<00:02:39.800> groups<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.980> eight<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:42.210> little

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
little groups of eight and that little

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.320 
little groups of eight and that little
group<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.810> eight<00:02:42.960> is<00:02:43.110> called<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.470> nucleosome<00:02:44.330> so

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
group of eight is called a nucleosome so

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.110 
group of eight is called a nucleosome so
basically<00:02:45.630> once<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:45.930> have<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:49.950> group<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.940> eight

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
basically once you have a group of eight

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.030 
basically once you have a group of eight
histones<00:02:51.600> they<00:02:51.930> form<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.770> little

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
histones they form in this little

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.880 
histones they form in this little
complex<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:54.020> that's<00:02:55.020> called<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.320> nucleosome

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
complex and that's called a nucleosome

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.650 
complex and that's called a nucleosome
and<00:02:56.250> it's<00:02:56.550> got<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> package<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.180> package<00:02:57.510> and

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
and it's got a package and package and

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.430 
and it's got a package and package and
package<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.080> package<00:02:58.440> and<00:03:00.440> eventually

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
package and package and eventually

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.190 
package and package and eventually
eventually<00:03:02.720> we<00:03:03.720> get<00:03:03.870> these<00:03:04.020> little

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
eventually we get these little

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.360 
eventually we get these little
structures<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:04.950> probably<00:03:05.250> already

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
structures and you probably already

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.950 
structures and you probably already
familiar<00:03:05.730> with<00:03:05.910> these<00:03:06.060> these<00:03:06.540> are<00:03:06.690> called

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
familiar with these these are called

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.510 
familiar with these these are called
chromosomes<00:03:11.270> okay<00:03:12.270> so<00:03:12.860> long<00:03:13.860> strings<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.400> DNA

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
chromosomes okay so long strings of DNA

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.220 
chromosomes okay so long strings of DNA
are<00:03:14.850> packaged<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:15.390> coiled<00:03:15.750> around<00:03:16.020> these

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
are packaged and coiled around these

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.110 
are packaged and coiled around these
these<00:03:16.800> proteins<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.490> eventually<00:03:17.940> they're

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
these proteins and eventually they're

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.760 
these proteins and eventually they're
packaged<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.630> package<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.960> package<00:03:19.080> more

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
packaged in package a package more

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.560 
packaged in package a package more
condensed<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.340> condensing<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:20.940> thence<00:03:21.150> more

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
condensed and condensing and thence more

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.030 
condensed and condensing and thence more
and<00:03:21.690> more<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:21.930> more<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.200> more<00:03:22.380> until<00:03:22.950> we

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
and more and more and more until we

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.860 
and more and more and more until we
eventually<00:03:23.130> make<00:03:23.520> these<00:03:23.670> chromosomes<00:03:24.180> now

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
eventually make these chromosomes now

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.240 
eventually make these chromosomes now
why<00:03:25.050> am<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.230> talking<00:03:25.290> about<00:03:25.620> this<00:03:25.860> why<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.100> is

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
why am I talking about this why is is

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.880 
why am I talking about this why is is
important<00:03:26.790> at<00:03:26.910> all<00:03:27.320> this<00:03:28.320> is<00:03:28.440> important

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
important at all this is important

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.430 
important at all this is important
because<00:03:28.980> in<00:03:29.490> order<00:03:29.670> for<00:03:29.930> replication<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.200> for

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
because in order for replication and for

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.830 
because in order for replication and for
transcription<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.160> occur<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.880> this<00:03:33.330> DNA<00:03:33.660> this

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
transcription to occur of this DNA this

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.980 
transcription to occur of this DNA this
DNA<00:03:34.170> can't<00:03:34.440> be<00:03:34.560> wound<00:03:34.910> around<00:03:35.910> these<00:03:36.480> around

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
DNA can't be wound around these around

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.810 
DNA can't be wound around these around
these<00:03:37.170> histones<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:37.920> can't<00:03:38.100> be<00:03:38.190> bound<00:03:38.370> like<00:03:38.640> it

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
these histones it can't be bound like it

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.460 
these histones it can't be bound like it
I'll<00:03:39.120> condense<00:03:39.570> like<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.050> needs<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.260> be

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
I'll condense like this and needs to be

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.270 
I'll condense like this and needs to be
out<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.890> accessible<00:03:41.760> for<00:03:41.940> certain<00:03:42.240> enzymes

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
out and accessible for certain enzymes

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.790 
out and accessible for certain enzymes
so<00:03:44.280> we<00:03:44.760> will<00:03:44.910> need<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.360> unpack<00:03:45.870> DNA<00:03:46.410> in<00:03:46.650> order

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
so we will need to unpack DNA in order

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.780 
so we will need to unpack DNA in order
to<00:03:47.070> do<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:48.030> have<00:03:48.360> DNA<00:03:48.870> replication<00:03:49.580> occur<00:03:50.580> as

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
to do to have DNA replication occur as

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
to do to have DNA replication occur as
well<00:03:51.480> as<00:03:52.790> transcription<00:03:53.790> which<00:03:54.360> is<00:03:54.510> actually

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
well as transcription which is actually

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.180 
well as transcription which is actually
something<00:03:54.990> we'll<00:03:55.230> talk<00:03:55.380> about<00:03:55.650> specifically

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
something we'll talk about specifically

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.030 
something we'll talk about specifically
later<00:03:56.960> one<00:03:57.960> thing<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:58.170> do<00:03:58.230> want<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.500> hint<00:03:58.680> at<00:03:58.860> is

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
later one thing I do want to hint at is

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.640 
later one thing I do want to hint at is
that<00:03:59.250> if<00:03:59.550> DNA<00:04:00.510> is<00:04:01.520> charged<00:04:02.520> right<00:04:02.760> it<00:04:03.000> has<00:04:03.210> a

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
that if DNA is charged right it has a

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.820 
that if DNA is charged right it has a
negative<00:04:04.650> charge

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
negative charge

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.170 
negative charge
what<00:04:07.830> kind<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.130> charge<00:04:08.370> would<00:04:08.580> you<00:04:08.670> expect<00:04:09.000> the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
what kind of charge would you expect the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.120 
what kind of charge would you expect the
histones<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.690> have<00:04:09.870> while<00:04:10.320> opposite<00:04:10.830> charges

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
histones to have while opposite charges

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.010 
histones to have while opposite charges
attract<00:04:11.520> right<00:04:11.790> they<00:04:12.300> should<00:04:12.450> have<00:04:12.570> positive

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
attract right they should have positive

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.280 
attract right they should have positive
charges<00:04:13.350> now<00:04:13.950> if<00:04:14.100> there<00:04:14.250> are<00:04:14.280> amino<00:04:14.460> acids<00:04:15.290> to

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.680 
charges now if there are amino acids to
me<00:04:16.440> if<00:04:16.560> histones<00:04:16.980> are<00:04:17.280> proteins<00:04:17.730> and<00:04:18.330> proteins

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
me if histones are proteins and proteins

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.930 
me if histones are proteins and proteins
are<00:04:18.810> made<00:04:18.900> up<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.170> amino<00:04:19.320> acids<00:04:19.980> what<00:04:20.640> type<00:04:20.790> of

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
are made up of amino acids what type of

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.060 
are made up of amino acids what type of
amino<00:04:21.180> acid<00:04:21.630> would<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.870> expect<00:04:22.169> it<00:04:22.380> sort<00:04:23.040> of

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
amino acid would you expect it sort of

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.690 
amino acid would you expect it sort of
exists<00:04:23.460> on<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.730> surface<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.210> histone

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
exists on the surface of histone

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.950 
exists on the surface of histone
especially<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.120> portions<00:04:25.510> in<00:04:25.660> which<00:04:25.780> are

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
especially the portions in which are

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.920 
especially the portions in which are
interacting<00:04:26.620> with<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.430> DNA<00:04:27.760> it<00:04:28.420> would<00:04:28.570> expect

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
interacting with a DNA it would expect

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.170 
interacting with a DNA it would expect
them<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.140> be<00:04:29.290> basic<00:04:30.010> amino<00:04:30.310> acids<00:04:30.730> things<00:04:30.970> that

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
them to be basic amino acids things that

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.180 
them to be basic amino acids things that
have<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.510> positive<00:04:31.900> charge<00:04:32.170> so<00:04:32.800> things<00:04:33.040> like

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
have the positive charge so things like

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.490 
have the positive charge so things like
histidine<00:04:33.670> arginine<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.210> lysine<00:04:34.380> matter<00:04:35.380> of

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
histidine arginine and lysine matter of

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.990 
histidine arginine and lysine matter of
fact<00:04:35.770> histones<00:04:36.670> have<00:04:37.030> lots<00:04:37.450> of<00:04:39.000> lysine

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
fact histones have lots of lysine

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.510 
fact histones have lots of lysine
residues<00:04:40.540> so<00:04:40.960> lysine<00:04:41.620> residues<00:04:42.100> that<00:04:42.370> have

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
residues so lysine residues that have

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.360 
residues so lysine residues that have
that<00:04:42.780> positive<00:04:43.780> charge<00:04:44.320> and<00:04:44.920> we'll<00:04:45.070> talk<00:04:45.220> more

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
that positive charge and we'll talk more

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.280 
that positive charge and we'll talk more
about<00:04:45.430> that<00:04:45.760> later<00:04:45.820> I<00:04:46.300> hope<00:04:46.780> that<00:04:46.960> video<00:04:47.170> was

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
about that later I hope that video was

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.080 
about that later I hope that video was
helpful<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:48.100> sort<00:04:48.310> of<00:04:48.370> get<00:04:48.520> an<00:04:48.610> idea<00:04:48.670> of<00:04:48.940> what's

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
helpful to sort of get an idea of what's

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.250 
helpful to sort of get an idea of what's
going<00:04:49.150> on<00:04:49.420> and<00:04:49.540> hope<00:04:49.690> it<00:04:49.780> kind<00:04:49.930> of<00:04:49.990> blew<00:04:50.140> your

going on and hope it kind of blew your

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.570 
going on and hope it kind of blew your
