00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.000
 high body temperature quail 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.579

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.619
 never hurts salmonella exactly 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.810
 so they can be eaten raw 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.659
 need to be attentive contagion can 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.950

 children either for unusual coloring 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.130
