00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:39.620

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.729
 she is not opening now April 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:47.579
 But I did not open it first, I have to 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:51.180
 force opens with it closed that does not look 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:57.180
 this would be the coop where the pin does not 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:04.409
 Do not lower that lock with that here. 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:09.479
 caught in the locked lock and I'm going to work 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.760
 and to know she opened the door open 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.430
 it should lock and it will not lock in 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.900
 pin will show that not lock 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.360
 My lock on this one is yours. 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.160
 This is mine that's broken here. 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:30.690
 what is making the door do not lock 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:34.330
 right back to me I'll catch 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.650
 first to do nothing else 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.840

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.040

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.930
 What I bought with you are not 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.800
 it's working 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.760

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:59.740

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.440
 locked in Madrid where it hangs on the pin 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.870
 she will open it first, I will not 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.150
 I had to do neither force nor several 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.580
 times of first lock in this 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.400

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.350
 for me april the friend lock for me 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.490
 the door lock on the inside would 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:28.720
 with this one 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:30.880
 there opened the aftertaste again 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.030
 Grandpa opened the door from the inside. 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.660
 madrid lock opened soon 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.040
 This lock would open here. 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.990
 to be able to open the key 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.040
 mine is working normal she goes 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:48.640
 and back we usually use you here 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.560

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.440

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.930
 I can not close my lock 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.560
 using the key 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.050
 This is where this is where the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.490
 key to open the white lacquer handle 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.680
 and you know that if I want to lock and 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.709
 unlock or not it works 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.510
 correct form this good appearance until 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:17.260
 Because I love you in a pot now, but it's 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:19.950
 a dwarf the difference to catch me the 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.950
 two caught 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:30.030
 the two are locked mine will open 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:35.190
 first but my work here right? 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:39.120
 otherwise it will lock open even now 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:44.340
 My April where you will not catch 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:46.710
 My new one to see me is that I 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:53.760
 I bought you there with you here 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:57.020
 Do not open the top of the table, I'm filming. 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.020
 And you can be silent, please. 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.290
 May my April not touch 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.300
 then these are the various problems that 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.790
 I found this knob unfortunately it is 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:14.340

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:18.140

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.140
