00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.879
 hello girls today I you 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.969
 shows how I clean but not in 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.969
 below 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.540
 it's a time-consuming process 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.230
 so relaxed plays and do not do it so 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.230
 you are in a hurry 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.610
 do not bother buying products 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.860
 expensive to clean your brushes me I 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.320
 do it with baby shampoo while 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.570
 it just works with 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.300
 pure marseille soap the pure 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.000
 obviously I also tried with 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.040
 oil mixed with soap for 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.449
 dishes but it a little damaged me 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.610
 brushes so I do not recommend 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.040
 we will start with the big brush 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:09.390
 so first we wet the brush 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:12.090
 gently we take a small 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.770
 hazelnut product we moisten our 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.290
 hand and we go by small movements 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.210
 circular begins between the brush 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.060
 little by little we will see that the foam 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.160
 will become colorful as the brush 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.860
 it's not logical and then we 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.140
 will squeak our hand is rinsed on 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.090
 brush always making small 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.550
 circular motions that will help to 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.740
 eliminate the product more easily and 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.220
 then I want to pinch the brush for 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.229
 see if the water coming out is clean or 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.569
 no, then he does not want to wet 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.429
 the handle of your brush and especially 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.500
 no new brush head water 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:50.429
 always upside down it's very 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.229
 important I'm showing you with a 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.060
 second hot spot and then I want 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.649
 pass the others so that it goes more 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.030
 quick 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.099
 know also that it takes daily 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.050
 disinfect your brushes using a 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:02.340
 disinfectant spray you will find 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.660
 easily in specialty stores 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.660
 in aesthetics 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.960
 always check well by pinching the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.660
 brush that there is no more foam 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:24.480
 because often we do not see it if it's 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:26.460
 the case we continue to rinse well if 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.770
 you want you can use a glove 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.420
 who may be able to help you 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.420
 for me it does not help me 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.070
 especially here is sigma we took out 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.840
 one but hey it's not worth it 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.830
 buy an I do not know how many euros if 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.410
 you want 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.990
 take a very stupid household and that 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.360
 will do it is true that the aspect 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.440
 rough glove may be a small 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.440
 little but that's it 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.970
 for small brushes personally 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.970
 I do it by two it goes faster 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.860
 then I will lend a towel or 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:32.270
 most used paper wipes just like 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.819
 you want and I'm going fast enough 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:46.250
 wipe one by one to absorb the 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:48.050
 excess water to dry 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.660
 I usually put my little brushes 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.370
 at the edge of a table and it dries very 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.989
 good but for the big ones the drying is 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.100
 a little more irregular is enough 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.220
 hassle 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.620
 so you have lady revolution here is a 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.440
 drying table is really practical 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.390
 you can have a two or even 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.890
 three brushes per section if they are 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.450
 big and 5 6 or 7 6 are small and I 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.160
 obviously leaves you all the links 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.160
 to get it at the bar of a show 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.540
 do not forget lay people and the video 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.290
 girls we find ourselves very quickly 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.290
 kisses kisses
