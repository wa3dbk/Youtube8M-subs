drying up some pictures and these 50 or

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.870 
drying up some pictures and these 50 or
so<00:04:15.750> drawings<00:04:16.139> are<00:04:16.229> probably<00:04:16.470> about<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:17.099> half<00:04:17.820> a

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
so drawings are probably about a half a

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.089 
so drawings are probably about a half a
day<00:04:18.000> worth<00:04:18.180> of<00:04:18.329> his<00:04:18.479> work<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:19.410> it's<00:04:19.560> insanely

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
fast I don't maybe not half a day but

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.140 
fast I don't maybe not half a day but
increasingly<00:04:22.109> fast<00:04:23.039> here<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.250> can<00:04:23.370> see<00:04:23.580> which
