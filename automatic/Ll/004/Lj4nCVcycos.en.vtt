protein<00:00:40.850> one<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> things<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.450> think

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
protein one of the things that I think

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.220 
protein one of the things that I think
is<00:00:42.899> very<00:00:42.989> helpful<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:43.710> both<00:00:43.770> these<00:00:44.160> groups<00:00:44.550> is

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
is very helpful for both these groups is

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.560 
is very helpful for both these groups is
a<00:00:46.230> super<00:00:46.739> green<00:00:46.950> food<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:48.120> sounds<00:00:48.420> odd

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
a super green food and that sounds odd

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.020 
a super green food and that sounds odd
because<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.620> don't<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:50.100> dogs<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.910> know

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
because you don't see dogs you know

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.209 
because you don't see dogs you know
generally<00:00:51.570> showing<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.410> grass<00:00:52.710> well<00:00:53.039> actually

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
generally showing on grass well actually

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.189 
generally showing on grass well actually
you<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> time<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> super<00:00:54.989> green

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the super green food has very high

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.719 
the super green food has very high
levels<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.300> digestible<00:01:04.019> protein<00:01:04.729> minerals
