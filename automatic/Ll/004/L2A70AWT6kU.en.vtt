sorensen<00:02:16.909> Sorensen<00:02:17.909> this<00:02:18.629> is<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.840> original

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
sorensen Sorensen this is the original

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.410 
sorensen Sorensen this is the original
series<00:02:19.680> or<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.310> first<00:02:20.849> book<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.359> series

series or the first book in this series

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.569 
series or the first book in this series
but<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.049> like<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.200> companion<00:02:22.799> series<00:02:23.189> the

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579

but it's like a companion series the
coincidence<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.299> Callie<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.049> Caden<00:02:25.739> I<00:02:25.950> think

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
coincidence of Callie and Caden I think

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.000 
coincidence of Callie and Caden I think
this<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.849> young<00:02:27.390> adult<00:02:27.689> it<00:02:28.590> might<00:02:28.769> be<00:02:28.890> new

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
this is young adult it might be new

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.369 
this is young adult it might be new
adult<00:02:29.250> one<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.819> those<00:02:29.939> but<00:02:30.870> it's<00:02:30.959> like<00:02:31.170> that

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
adult one of those but it's like that

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.259 
adult one of those but it's like that
kind<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.650> feel<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.430> i<00:02:32.819> picked<00:02:33.030> up<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
kind of feel so i picked up the

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.089 
kind of feel so i picked up the
companion<00:02:34.019> even<00:02:34.379> though<00:02:34.470> i<00:02:34.500> didn't<00:02:34.859> read<00:02:34.950> this

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
companion even though i didn't read this

companion even though i didn't read this
one<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.340> heard<00:02:35.549> it<00:02:35.639> was<00:02:35.670> really<00:02:35.790> good<00:02:36.060> but<00:02:36.269> this

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
one I heard it was really good but this

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.119 
one I heard it was really good but this
is<00:02:36.569> only<00:02:36.659> three<00:02:36.989> dollars<00:02:37.379> on<00:02:37.590> books-a-million

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
one it sounds so so so good I was just

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.420 
one it sounds so so so good I was just
like<00:03:45.150> drooling<00:03:45.659> over<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.319> audio<00:03:46.650> sample<00:03:47.129> this

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
like drooling over the audio sample this

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.219 
like drooling over the audio sample this
is<00:03:47.549> a<00:03:47.609> trilogy<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.269> third<00:03:48.449> one<00:03:48.599> just<00:03:48.629> came<00:03:48.959> out

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229 
is a trilogy the third one just came out

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.740 
is a trilogy the third one just came out
but<00:03:49.680> it's<00:03:49.949> kind<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.250> like<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.459> companion<00:03:51.180> series

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
but it's kind of like a companion series

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.679 
but it's kind of like a companion series
i<00:03:51.989> believe<00:03:52.379> so<00:03:52.919> this<00:03:53.159> book<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.639> about<00:03:53.970> girl<00:03:54.389> and

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
i believe so this book is about girl and

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.069 
i believe so this book is about girl and
she<00:03:54.870> goes<00:03:55.019> into<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.379> convent<00:03:55.949> and<00:03:56.569> they're<00:03:57.569> the

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
she goes into a convent and they're the

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.429 
she goes into a convent and they're the
people<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.129> convent<00:03:59.579> they<00:03:59.819> serve<00:04:00.540> death<00:04:01.139> I

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
people of the convent they serve death I

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.640 
people of the convent they serve death I
think<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:02.010> god<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.250> death<00:04:02.689> so<00:04:03.689> death<00:04:04.109> blesses

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
think the god of death so death blesses

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.619 
think the god of death so death blesses
them<00:04:04.799> with<00:04:05.010> dangerous<00:04:05.519> gifts<00:04:05.909> and<00:04:06.060> so<00:04:06.389> they're

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
them with dangerous gifts and so they're

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.110 
them with dangerous gifts and so they're
kind<00:04:06.900> of<00:04:07.019> like<00:04:07.199> assassins<00:04:07.949> uh<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:09.030> they

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
kind of like assassins uh but they

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.080 
kind of like assassins uh but they
weren't<00:04:09.299> for<00:04:09.629> death<00:04:09.989> itself<00:04:10.409> himself<00:04:11.159> so<00:04:11.729> it

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
weren't for death itself himself so it

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.809 
weren't for death itself himself so it
sounds<00:04:12.239> super<00:04:12.720> super<00:04:13.650> good<00:04:13.799> so<00:04:14.189> yeah<00:04:14.400> that<00:04:14.699> is

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
sounds super super good so yeah that is

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.039 
sounds super super good so yeah that is
