00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
cold water and we have the temperature

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.399 
cold water and we have the temperature
right<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.189> then<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.390> mix<00:01:15.780> will<00:01:16.170> run

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
right and then that that mix will run

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.010 
right and then that that mix will run
through<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> hose<00:01:17.159> downhill<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> shower<00:01:18.420> my

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
through a hose downhill to the shower my

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
through a hose downhill to the shower my
rule<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.830> won't<00:01:20.100> shower<00:01:20.430> at<00:01:20.759> anything

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
rule is that I won't shower at anything

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.149 
rule is that I won't shower at anything
less<00:01:21.299> than<00:01:21.479> 20<00:01:21.810> degrees<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.740> something<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
less than 20 degrees it's something that

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.649 
less than 20 degrees it's something that
I<00:01:23.220> thought<00:01:23.460> would<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.850> disadvantage<00:01:24.180> but

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
I thought would be a disadvantage but

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.109 
I thought would be a disadvantage but
actually<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.140> very<00:01:25.320> enjoyable<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:26.729> wasn't

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
actually it's very enjoyable it wasn't

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.760 
actually it's very enjoyable it wasn't
until<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.630> wintertime<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.560> met

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
until the wintertime that we met

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.410 
until the wintertime that we met
challenges<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.549> really<00:01:29.909> weren't<00:01:30.210> able

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
challenges that we really weren't able

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.429 
challenges that we really weren't able
to<00:01:31.430> surmount<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.820> had<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:33.390> been<00:01:33.630> prepared<00:01:34.200> for
