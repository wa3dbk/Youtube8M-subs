00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
about it was packaging I thought it was

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.330 
about it was packaging I thought it was
really<00:00:38.579> crap<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.410> other<00:00:40.530> day<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.739> thought<00:00:40.950> I

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
really crap so the other day I thought I

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.610 
really crap so the other day I thought I
would<00:00:41.520> go<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.790> buy<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> backup<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.440> was

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
would go and buy a backup and this was

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.810 
would go and buy a backup and this was
from<00:00:43.829> boots<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.399> I've<00:00:44.489> seen<00:00:44.640> them<00:00:44.760> in

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
from boots and I've seen them in

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.020 
from boots and I've seen them in
superdrug<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.420> an<00:00:46.200> um<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.950> thought<00:00:47.550> all<00:00:47.820> they've

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
superdrug to an um I thought all they've

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.340 
superdrug to an um I thought all they've
changed<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.480> packaging<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.200> really

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
on the outside that you have to kind of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.790 
on the outside that you have to kind of
pull<00:00:54.390> off<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.750> little<00:00:54.870> bit<00:00:55.079> more<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.530> we

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
pull off the little bit more so that we

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.889 
pull off the little bit more so that we
stick<00:00:56.160> better<00:00:56.370> which<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> brilliant<00:00:57.600> idea

the rim or crown I've kind of faded it a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.020 
the rim or crown I've kind of faded it a
bit<00:01:07.860> because<00:01:08.040> I've<00:01:08.250> been<00:01:08.280> watching<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
bit because I've been watching it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.840 
bit because I've been watching it
because<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.600> hate<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.260> now<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.850> but
