go to actually little girls were cube
when<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.870> was<00:02:22.019> cube<00:02:22.290> right<00:02:22.590> cube<00:02:23.010> left<00:02:23.300> cube

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
when I was cube right cube left cube

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.830 
when I was cube right cube left cube
from<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.630> bottom<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.590> has<00:02:25.830> pushed<00:02:26.220> left<00:02:26.840> and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
from the bottom it has pushed left and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.780 
from the bottom it has pushed left and
you<00:02:28.019> can<00:02:28.200> guess<00:02:28.410> what<00:02:28.560> push<00:02:28.830> right<00:02:29.130> does<00:02:29.459> are

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
you can guess what push right does are

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.009 
you can guess what push right does are
move<00:02:30.230> left<00:02:31.230> or<00:02:31.500> right

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
move left or right

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:40.580 
move left or right
