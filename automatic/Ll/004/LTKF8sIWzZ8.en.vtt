you've you've seen that we're going to
look<00:00:09.630> at<00:00:09.780> lessons<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.440> creating<00:00:11.040> lessons<00:00:11.840> so

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
look at lessons and creating lessons so

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.379 
look at lessons and creating lessons so
as<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.650> mentioned<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.519> lessons<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.210> see

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
as I mentioned the lessons that you see

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.090 
as I mentioned the lessons that you see
here<00:00:15.750> are<00:00:15.809> included<00:00:16.470> with<00:00:16.619> some<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.980> app

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
here are included with some of the app

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.470 
here are included with some of the app
with<00:00:17.369> with<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.730> libraries<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.240> will<00:00:18.330> have

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
with with the libraries you will have

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.859 
with with the libraries you will have
lessons<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.619> cannot<00:00:20.189> edit<00:00:20.460> these<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.720> what

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
lessons you cannot edit these but what

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.870 
lessons you cannot edit these but what
you<00:00:21.990> can<00:00:22.230> do<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.560> copy<00:00:22.800> them<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.250> create

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
you can do is copy them and create

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.370 
you can do is copy them and create
copies<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.390> then<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.720> edit<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.990> copies

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
copies and then you can edit the copies

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.050 
copies and then you can edit the copies

do is first we're going to add some

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.940 
do is first we're going to add some
cards<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.250> lesson<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.000> exercise

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
cards to this lesson to this exercise

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.289 
cards to this lesson to this exercise
what<00:01:07.950> you'll<00:01:08.070> see<00:01:08.280> here<00:01:08.310> are<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> libraries

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
what you'll see here are the libraries

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.670 
what you'll see here are the libraries
that<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.659> available<00:01:09.780> that's<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
that you have available that's the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.500 
that you have available that's the
starter<00:01:11.010> library<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.850> vegetables<00:01:12.000> which

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
starter library and the vegetables which

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.450 
starter library and the vegetables which
we<00:01:12.659> purchased<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.560> an<00:01:13.650> earlier<00:01:13.950> video<00:01:14.100> and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
we purchased it in an earlier video and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.550 
we purchased it in an earlier video and
then<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.150> rest<00:01:15.330> here<00:01:15.630> are<00:01:15.780> other<00:01:15.990> libraries

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
then the rest here are other libraries

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.200 
then the rest here are other libraries
that<00:01:16.710> are<00:01:16.770> available<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.580> purchase<00:01:17.850> and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that are available for purchase and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.820 
that are available for purchase and
we'll<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:18.540> into<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.960> little<00:01:19.200> bit<00:01:19.380> later<00:01:19.590> on

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
we'll go into that a little bit later on

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.469 
we'll go into that a little bit later on
in<00:01:20.490> another<00:01:20.759> video<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.090> talks<00:01:21.330> about

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
in another video that talks about

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.510 
in another video that talks about
libraries<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.650> right<00:01:22.860> now<00:01:23.009> we'll<00:01:23.189> just<00:01:23.400> stick

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
libraries but right now we'll just stick

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.980 
libraries but right now we'll just stick
with<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> libraries<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:24.420> have<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.810> let's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
with the libraries that we have so let's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.830 
with the libraries that we have so let's
start<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.979> starter<00:01:26.310> library<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.630> let's

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
start with the starter library and let's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.120 
start with the starter library and let's
let's<00:01:28.470> focus<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:30.000> foods<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.710> can

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
let's focus on on foods so you can

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.010 
let's focus on on foods so you can
select<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.790> cards<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.570> you'd<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:33.810> to

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
select the cards that you'd like to

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.520 
select the cards that you'd like to
include<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.700> light<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> exercise<00:01:36.659> you

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530

now is for cards that I've selected and
I<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.420> create<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:04.049> prompt<00:02:05.009> based<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.520> any<00:02:05.790> of

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
I can create a prompt based on any of

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.459 
I can create a prompt based on any of
these<00:02:06.090> four<00:02:06.360> inputs<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:06.869> I'll<00:02:07.170> show<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.439> a

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
these four inputs so I'll show you a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.109 
these four inputs so I'll show you a
simple<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:07.950> right<00:02:08.160> now<00:02:08.340> we're<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:08.849> going<00:02:08.970> to

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
simple one right now we're just going to

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.330 
simple one right now we're just going to
call<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.450> one<00:02:09.509> touch<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.020> Apple<00:02:10.730> okay

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
call this one touch the Apple okay

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.530 
call this one touch the Apple okay
and<00:02:12.640> then<00:02:12.910> we<00:02:13.750> need<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.989> tell<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:16.330> sea

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
and then we need to tell the the the sea

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.270 
and then we need to tell the the the sea
touch<00:02:16.720> learning<00:02:17.019> application<00:02:17.530> which<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:17.860> the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
touch learning application which is the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.470 
touch learning application which is the
correct<00:02:18.430> answer<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.150> see<00:02:19.269> all<00:02:19.390> these

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
correct answer so you see all these

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.119 
correct answer so you see all these
great<00:02:19.720> out<00:02:19.900> check<00:02:20.170> marks<00:02:20.470> on<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.680> side<00:02:20.860> if<00:02:21.040> you

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
great out check marks on the side if you

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.040 
great out check marks on the side if you
click<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.370> now<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.120> can<00:02:22.360> see<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:22.870> one

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
click that now you can see that that one

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.160 
click that now you can see that that one
is<00:02:23.080> red<00:02:23.410> we've<00:02:23.950> told<00:02:24.360> see<00:02:25.360> touch<00:02:25.569> learn<00:02:25.840> that

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
is red we've told see touch learn that

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.140 
is red we've told see touch learn that
the<00:02:26.349> red<00:02:26.650> apple<00:02:27.099> or<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.489> Apple<00:02:27.849> is<00:02:28.000> the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
the red apple or the Apple is the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.660 
the red apple or the Apple is the
correct<00:02:28.450> answer<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:30.040> was<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.400> first

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
correct answer so that was the first

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.770 
correct answer so that was the first
exercise<00:02:30.970> we're<00:02:31.330> going<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.540> add<00:02:31.660> another

we've<00:02:52.150> created<00:02:52.420> this<00:02:52.660> application<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.680> it's

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
we've created this application so it's

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.100 
we've created this application so it's
very<00:02:54.040> flexible<00:02:54.280> if<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.819> click<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.480> blank<00:02:55.780> box

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
click on that you can see exercise 1 it

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.500 
click on that you can see exercise 1 it
tells<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.520> prompt<00:05:20.760> touch<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.210> Apple

tells you the prompt touch the Apple
which<00:05:21.630> one<00:05:21.840> is<00:05:21.960> red<00:05:22.140> and<00:05:22.530> we're<00:05:22.680> going<00:05:22.800> to<00:05:22.860> jump

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
which one is red and we're going to jump

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.800 
which one is red and we're going to jump
to<00:05:23.160> exercise<00:05:23.640> 3<00:05:23.970> which<00:05:24.150> is<00:05:24.180> touch<00:05:24.480> the<00:05:24.660> animals

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
to exercise 3 which is touch the animals

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.680 
to exercise 3 which is touch the animals
so<00:05:25.680> now<00:05:25.800> that<00:05:25.980> we're<00:05:26.070> on<00:05:26.130> that<00:05:26.370> screen<00:05:26.730> if<00:05:27.510> you

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
so now that we're on that screen if you

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.170 
so now that we're on that screen if you
touch<00:05:27.960> and<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:29.070> incorrect<00:05:29.400> answer<00:05:29.790> that

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
touch and the incorrect answer that

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.970 
touch and the incorrect answer that
works<00:05:30.450> to<00:05:30.600> say<00:05:30.750> but<00:05:30.930> if<00:05:31.050> you<00:05:31.140> touch<00:05:31.350> the<00:05:31.560> animal

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
works to say but if you touch the animal

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.280 
works to say but if you touch the animal
any<00:05:32.220> of<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.460> animals<00:05:32.610> you<00:05:33.540> can<00:05:33.660> see<00:05:33.900> it's

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
any of the animals you can see it's

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.990 
any of the animals you can see it's
selected<00:05:34.830> it<00:05:34.920> is<00:05:35.040> correct<00:05:35.280> but<00:05:35.490> it<00:05:35.610> hasn't

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
selected it is correct but it hasn't

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.790 
selected it is correct but it hasn't
given<00:05:36.390> you<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.840> indication<00:05:37.110> that<00:05:37.590> the

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
given you the indication that the

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.680 
given you the indication that the
exercise<00:05:38.550> is<00:05:38.760> done<00:05:38.970> so<00:05:39.180> you<00:05:39.240> know<00:05:39.480> that

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
exercise is done so you know that

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.570 
exercise is done so you know that
something<00:05:40.050> else<00:05:40.200> is<00:05:40.350> still<00:05:40.560> required<00:05:40.830> but

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
something else is still required but

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.920 
something else is still required but
when<00:05:41.760> you<00:05:41.850> collect<00:05:42.090> select<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:42.600> second

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
when you collect select the second

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.650 
when you collect select the second
animal<00:05:43.280> it<00:05:44.280> fills<00:05:44.610> the<00:05:44.760> screen<00:05:44.910> drops<00:05:45.330> off<00:05:45.540> the

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
animal it fills the screen drops off the

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.610 
animal it fills the screen drops off the
incorrect<00:05:45.990> answers<00:05:46.440> so<00:05:46.860> you<00:05:46.980> know<00:05:47.280> that<00:05:47.550> the

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
incorrect answers so you know that the

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.260 
incorrect answers so you know that the
the<00:05:49.620> exercise<00:05:50.220> is<00:05:50.430> finished<00:05:50.730> it's<00:05:50.970> time<00:05:51.000> to

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
the exercise is finished it's time to

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.540 
the exercise is finished it's time to
move<00:05:51.390> on<00:05:51.540> you<00:05:52.530> see<00:05:52.710> these<00:05:52.830> prompts<00:05:53.250> across

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
move on you see these prompts across

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.700 
move on you see these prompts across
these<00:05:53.880> buttons<00:05:54.330> across<00:05:54.450> the<00:05:54.780> bottom<00:05:54.930> these

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
these buttons across the bottom these

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.620 
these buttons across the bottom these
are<00:05:55.830> the<00:05:55.920> navigation<00:05:56.520> controls<00:05:56.970> and<00:05:57.210> back<00:05:57.450> in

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
are the navigation controls and back in

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.740 
are the navigation controls and back in
the<00:05:57.720> settings<00:05:58.170> screen<00:05:58.380> it<00:05:58.860> allowed<00:05:59.190> you<00:05:59.460> to<00:05:59.750> to

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
the settings screen it allowed you to to

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.170 
the settings screen it allowed you to to
to<00:06:01.260> have<00:06:01.650> those<00:06:01.830> visible<00:06:02.190> or<00:06:02.490> not<00:06:02.520> visible

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
to have those visible or not visible

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.000 
to have those visible or not visible
there's<00:06:03.720> also<00:06:03.840> another<00:06:04.050> option<00:06:04.650> which<00:06:04.800> is<00:06:04.980> a

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
there's also another option which is a

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.910 
there's also another option which is a
double<00:06:05.550> swipe<00:06:06.540> if<00:06:06.810> you<00:06:07.080> touch<00:06:07.440> with<00:06:07.710> two

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
double swipe if you touch with two

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.070 
double swipe if you touch with two
fingers<00:06:08.130> and<00:06:08.490> swipe<00:06:09.090> downward<00:06:09.690> they'll<00:06:09.960> be

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
fingers and swipe downward they'll be

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.630 
fingers and swipe downward they'll be
hidden<00:06:10.500> if<00:06:10.830> you<00:06:10.980> touch<00:06:11.130> with<00:06:11.340> those<00:06:11.460> two

hidden if you touch with those two

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.310 
hidden if you touch with those two
fingers<00:06:12.000> and<00:06:12.030> move<00:06:12.300> upwards<00:06:12.690> they<00:06:13.200> will

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
fingers and move upwards they will

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.320 
fingers and move upwards they will
appear<00:06:13.680> again<00:06:13.800> so<00:06:14.370> that's<00:06:14.550> kind<00:06:14.820> of<00:06:14.880> handy<00:06:15.240> to

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
appear again so that's kind of handy to

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.610 
appear again so that's kind of handy to
have<00:06:15.360> if<00:06:15.660> you<00:06:15.750> want<00:06:15.930> to<00:06:15.990> turn<00:06:16.110> them<00:06:16.320> off<00:06:16.470> or

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
turn them back on during a particular

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.420 
turn them back on during a particular
lesson<00:06:18.800> it's<00:06:19.800> important<00:06:20.190> to<00:06:20.250> note<00:06:20.400> that

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
lesson it's important to note that

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.860 
lesson it's important to note that
because<00:06:20.700> if<00:06:20.910> we<00:06:20.970> do<00:06:21.090> that<00:06:21.120> by<00:06:21.390> accident<00:06:21.540> you

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
because if we do that by accident you

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.270 
because if we do that by accident you
may<00:06:22.020> be<00:06:22.080> confused<00:06:22.320> about<00:06:22.710> what<00:06:23.010> to<00:06:23.040> do<00:06:23.250> next

may be confused about what to do next

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.160 
may be confused about what to do next
and<00:06:23.850> all<00:06:23.970> you<00:06:24.120> need<00:06:24.240> to<00:06:24.330> do<00:06:24.450> is<00:06:24.600> use<00:06:24.990> two

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.170 
and all you need to do is use two

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.190 
and all you need to do is use two
fingers<00:06:25.530> swipe<00:06:26.220> back<00:06:26.430> up<00:06:26.720> and<00:06:27.720> it<00:06:27.900> will<00:06:28.020> be

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.310 
fingers swipe back up and it will be
restored<00:06:29.600> so<00:06:30.600> that's<00:06:30.780> the<00:06:30.930> basic

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
restored so that's the basic

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.100

a little a little more advanced here
let's<00:06:37.890> say<00:06:38.040> for<00:06:38.220> example<00:06:38.250> you<00:06:38.610> wanted<00:06:38.940> to<00:06:39.030> take

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
let's say for example you wanted to take

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.170 
let's say for example you wanted to take
this<00:06:39.770> exercise<00:06:40.770> or<00:06:41.130> this<00:06:41.310> lesson<00:06:41.670> and<00:06:41.910> you
