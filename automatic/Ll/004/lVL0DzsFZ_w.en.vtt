going like this and just doing it all in
a<00:00:49.469> slow<00:00:50.460> motion<00:00:50.850> he<00:00:50.940> wasn't<00:00:51.239> explaining<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.840> so

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
a slow motion he wasn't explaining it so

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.660 
a slow motion he wasn't explaining it so
what<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.649> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.860> doing<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.340> video

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
what I'm going to be doing in this video

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.319 
what I'm going to be doing in this video
I<00:00:53.969> stop<00:00:54.570> talking<00:00:54.780> soon<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.680> start<00:00:56.329> explaining

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
I stop talking soon and start explaining

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.689 
I stop talking soon and start explaining
it<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.600> how<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.920> two<00:00:59.670> different

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it and how to do it in two different

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.740 
it and how to do it in two different
methods<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.449> how<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> unsel<00:01:01.079> or<00:01:01.350> unsalted

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
methods and how to unsel or unsalted

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.170 
methods and how to unsel or unsalted
because<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.589> videos<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> saw<00:01:05.339> they<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.939> said

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
because the videos I saw they just said

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.969 
because the videos I saw they just said
now<00:01:06.689> unsolved<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.500> then<00:01:07.590> they<00:01:07.710> did<00:01:07.860> all

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
now unsolved it and then they did all

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.170 
now unsolved it and then they did all
these<00:01:08.070> turns<00:01:08.340> class<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.350> how<00:01:10.350> um

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
these turns class and it's like how um

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.130 
these turns class and it's like how um
for<00:01:12.180> some<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.510> may<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.840> really

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
for some of you that may be really

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.070 
for some of you that may be really
obvious<00:01:13.290> hunter<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.100> backwards<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.930> me<00:01:16.049> I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
obvious hunter it backwards but for me I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.219 
obvious hunter it backwards but for me I
was<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.470> I'd<00:01:16.680> rather<00:01:16.860> no<00:01:17.100> way<00:01:17.340> my<00:01:17.939> method<00:01:18.659> for

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
was like I'd rather no way my method for

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.580 
was like I'd rather no way my method for
unsalted<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.850> slower<00:01:21.270> but<00:01:22.140> that's<00:01:22.470> just

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
unsalted is slower but that's just

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.570 
unsalted is slower but that's just
because<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.250> um<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.960> don't<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.340> need<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.490> to

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
because I um I don't really need it to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.219 
because I um I don't really need it to
be<00:01:26.700> fast<00:01:26.880> cuz<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.240> don't<00:01:27.299> play<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.049> that

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
be fast cuz I don't play with this that

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.219 
be fast cuz I don't play with this that
much<00:01:28.460> so<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.840> magic

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
much so this is just going to be a magic

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.200 
much so this is just going to be a magic
any<00:01:31.409> magic<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.040> believe<00:01:32.520> if<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.939> Rubik's

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
any magic I believe if it's a Rubik's

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.660 
any magic I believe if it's a Rubik's
brand<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.630> should<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.869> up<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:35.400> ghost

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
brand it should be up here and a ghost

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.510 
brand it should be up here and a ghost
hand<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.090> mine<00:01:36.329> should<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.630> down<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:36.869> and

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
hand like mine should be down here and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.890 
hand like mine should be down here and
what<00:01:38.520> you're<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:38.970> first<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.540> all<00:01:39.630> is

what you're going to do first of all is
you're<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> hold<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.040> like

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
you're going to hold it you know like

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.440 
you're going to hold it you know like
this<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> three<00:01:41.880> rings<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.210> front

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
this with the three rings in front

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.359 
this with the three rings in front
you're<00:01:43.110> going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> put<00:01:43.409> your<00:01:43.439> thumbs<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.189> these

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
you're going to put your thumbs on these

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.230 
you're going to put your thumbs on these
top<00:01:44.930> tiles<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.820> part<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.180> your

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
top tiles and then the is part of your

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.429 
top tiles and then the is part of your
hand<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:50.790> bottom<00:01:51.149> one<00:01:51.329> just<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.170> this

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
hand on the bottom one just like this

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.440 
hand on the bottom one just like this
and<00:01:52.740> then<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> back<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.939> know<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.270> cover

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and then on the back you know just cover

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.020 
and then on the back you know just cover
these<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.170> that's<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.920> doesn't<00:01:56.030> Bend

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
these and that's just so it doesn't Bend

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.030 
these and that's just so it doesn't Bend
because<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.869> that's<00:01:58.079> how<00:01:58.229> your<00:01:58.469> magic

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
because this is that's how your magic

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.920 
because this is that's how your magic
think<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.369> messed<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.540> want<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> do

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
think it messed up so you want to do

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.539 
think it messed up so you want to do
let's<00:02:01.530> do<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.100> make<00:02:02.250> sure<00:02:02.280> not<00:02:02.490> to

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
let's do like this so make sure not to

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.580 
let's do like this so make sure not to
be<00:02:02.700> holding<00:02:02.850> too<00:02:03.119> tough<00:02:03.630> because<00:02:04.200> trust<00:02:04.500> me

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
be holding too tough because trust me

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.809 
be holding too tough because trust me
you<00:02:05.219> don't<00:02:05.310> have<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:06.500> like<00:02:07.500> forcing<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.099> so

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
you don't have to be like forcing it so

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.150 
you don't have to be like forcing it so
this<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> part<00:02:09.390> where<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.869> really

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
this is the part where it's really

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.589 
this is the part where it's really
tricky<00:02:11.160> because<00:02:11.489> if<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.910> mess<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.270> up<00:02:12.420> you

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
tricky because if you mess this up you

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.640 
tricky because if you mess this up you
may<00:02:12.720> break<00:02:12.959> your<00:02:13.110> magic<00:02:13.440> so

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
may break your magic so

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.280 
may break your magic so
be<00:02:13.709> careful<00:02:14.129> um<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:15.720> what<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:15.900> want<00:02:16.049> to<00:02:16.110> do<00:02:16.170> is

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
be careful um so what you want to do is

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.390 
be careful um so what you want to do is
you<00:02:16.349> want<00:02:16.409> to<00:02:16.560> put<00:02:16.709> them<00:02:16.769> together<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.340> you

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
you want to put them together and you

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.190 
you want to put them together and you
want<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.209> try<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.420> twist<00:02:18.659> it<00:02:18.840> now<00:02:18.989> if<00:02:19.110> it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
want to try to twist it now if it

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.470 
want to try to twist it now if it
doesn't<00:02:19.470> work<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.739> mine<00:02:19.980> isn't<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:21.269> can

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
doesn't work like mine isn't you can

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.270 
doesn't work like mine isn't you can
move<00:02:21.659> this<00:02:21.870> bottom<00:02:22.319> one<00:02:22.349> over<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.829> left<00:02:22.860> and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
move this bottom one over the left and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.420 
move this bottom one over the left and
this<00:02:23.340> one<00:02:23.519> over<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.939> right<00:02:24.120> more<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:25.430> what

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
you're basically doing is on this one

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.729 
you're basically doing is on this one
little<00:02:29.189> point<00:02:29.599> you're<00:02:30.599> rotating<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.470> piece

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
little point you're rotating this piece

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.039 
little point you're rotating this piece
and<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.939> have<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.209> like<00:02:33.329> this<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.870> just

and you have it like this and you just
want<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.290> flip<00:02:34.829> both<00:02:35.069> of<00:02:35.280> those<00:02:35.370> over<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.480> now

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
want to flip both of those over so now

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.179 
want to flip both of those over so now
you<00:02:36.689> should<00:02:36.900> be<00:02:36.930> able<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.290> open<00:02:37.409> it<00:02:37.650> up<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:37.920> it

you're<00:03:20.819> going<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.030> put<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.269> like<00:03:21.389> so<00:03:22.079> from<00:03:22.290> here

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
you're going to put it like so from here

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.039 
you're going to put it like so from here
you're<00:03:22.620> going<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.799> turn<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.099> like<00:03:23.190> this<00:03:24.049> put

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
you're going to turn it like this put

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.379 
you're going to turn it like this put
those<00:03:25.230> two<00:03:25.440> together<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:26.040> what<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.760> usually<00:03:27.000> do

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
those two together and what I usually do

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.659 
those two together and what I usually do
is<00:03:27.599> I<00:03:27.959> use<00:03:27.989> my<00:03:28.290> thumbs<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.859> I<00:03:28.980> push<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.400> top

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
is I use my thumbs and I push this top

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.210 
is I use my thumbs and I push this top
one<00:03:29.699> over<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.569> to<00:03:31.049> my<00:03:31.169> right<00:03:31.409> and<00:03:31.590> this

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
one over to the to my right and this

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.920 
one over to the to my right and this
bottom<00:03:32.549> one<00:03:32.579> over<00:03:32.819> to<00:03:32.909> my<00:03:33.000> left<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.510> then<00:03:33.750> just

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
bottom one over to my left and then just

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.210 
bottom one over to my left and then just
fold<00:03:34.139> it<00:03:34.349> over<00:03:34.470> like<00:03:35.030> this<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.470> then<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.500> turn

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
fold it over like this and then I turn

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.039 
fold it over like this and then I turn
it<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.459> side<00:03:38.549> open<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.329> up<00:03:39.829> flatten<00:03:40.829> it<00:03:41.010> out

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
it to the side open it up flatten it out

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.800 
it to the side open it up flatten it out
open<00:03:43.049> it<00:03:43.400> put<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.489> two<00:03:44.639> sides<00:03:44.879> in<00:03:45.090> flip<00:03:45.690> the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
open it put the two sides in flip the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.740 
open it put the two sides in flip the
top<00:03:45.989> over<00:03:46.319> when<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.099> open<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:48.359> will<00:03:48.599> be

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
top over when you open it it will be

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.069 
top over when you open it it will be
solved<00:03:49.139> so<00:03:49.919> that's<00:03:50.639> the<00:03:50.849> first<00:03:51.030> method<00:03:51.299> it's

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
solved so that's the first method it's

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.960 
solved so that's the first method it's
not<00:03:52.229> that<00:03:52.290> fast<00:03:52.590> but<00:03:53.280> it's<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.519> first<00:03:53.729> one<00:03:53.879> I

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
not that fast but it's the first one I

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.180 
not that fast but it's the first one I
use<00:03:54.229> for<00:03:55.229> my<00:03:55.290> second<00:03:55.680> one<00:03:55.769> you're<00:03:55.949> going<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.099> do

use for my second one you're going to do

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.689 
use for my second one you're going to do
that<00:03:56.310> same<00:03:56.370> move<00:03:56.819> so<00:03:57.530> like<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:58.769> sorry<00:03:59.459> if<00:03:59.579> you

guys just my skype you want to flick
this<00:04:02.699> over<00:04:03.000> again<00:04:03.269> but<00:04:03.659> now<00:04:03.840> this<00:04:04.019> is<00:04:04.169> where

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
this over again but now this is where

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.199 
this over again but now this is where
it's<00:04:04.440> different<00:04:04.829> I<00:04:05.069> want<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.430> flip<00:04:05.849> these<00:04:06.000> two

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
it's different I want to flip these two

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.559 
it's different I want to flip these two
over<00:04:06.389> this<00:04:06.989> one<00:04:07.290> over<00:04:07.709> then<00:04:08.699> flip<00:04:09.060> these<00:04:09.209> all

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
over this one over then flip these all

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.020 
over this one over then flip these all
the<00:04:09.900> way<00:04:10.019> over<00:04:10.379> till<00:04:10.919> it's<00:04:11.069> on<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.400> back<00:04:11.669> and

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
the way over till it's on the back and

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.069 
the way over till it's on the back and
this<00:04:12.599> should<00:04:12.750> pop<00:04:12.959> up<00:04:13.879> now<00:04:14.879> these<00:04:15.090> two<00:04:15.419> tiles

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
this should pop up now these two tiles

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.339 
this should pop up now these two tiles
you<00:04:16.409> want<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.620> flip<00:04:16.769> over<00:04:17.359> this<00:04:18.359> one<00:04:18.630> over<00:04:19.109> and

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
you want to flip over this one over and

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.430 
you want to flip over this one over and
then<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.549> two<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.269> just<00:04:21.449> made<00:04:21.659> out<00:04:21.930> and

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
then the two that you just made out and

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.290 
then the two that you just made out and
that's<00:04:22.979> why<00:04:23.219> when<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:23.430> see<00:04:23.639> people<00:04:23.789> solving

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
that's why when you see people solving

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.700 
that's why when you see people solving
they<00:04:24.419> go<00:04:24.539> like<00:04:24.630> this<00:04:24.810> i'm<00:04:25.020> pretty<00:04:25.260> sure<00:04:25.380> is<00:04:25.440> one

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
they go like this i'm pretty sure is one

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.470 
they go like this i'm pretty sure is one
of<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.860> fastest<00:04:26.250> if<00:04:26.430> not<00:04:26.639> be<00:04:26.789> fast<00:04:27.060> this

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
of the fastest if not be fast this

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.660 
of the fastest if not be fast this
well<00:04:28.470> actually<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.920> depends<00:04:29.190> on<00:04:29.310> who<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:29.520> are

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
well actually it depends on who you are

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.160 
well actually it depends on who you are
screeches<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.120> fastest<00:04:30.510> but<00:04:30.690> this<00:04:30.810> is<00:04:30.960> one

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
screeches the fastest but this is one

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.830 
screeches the fastest but this is one
that's<00:04:31.380> really<00:04:31.530> popular<00:04:32.030> so<00:04:33.030> this<00:04:33.450> is<00:04:33.480> this<00:04:33.690> is

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
that's really popular so this is this is

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.180 
that's really popular so this is this is
why<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:34.020> see<00:04:34.230> a<00:04:34.260> lot<00:04:34.350> of<00:04:34.470> people<00:04:34.740> going<00:04:34.920> and

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
why you see a lot of people going and

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.670 
why you see a lot of people going and
then<00:04:36.180> finishing<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:37.080> then<00:04:37.230> you<00:04:37.320> see<00:04:37.470> it's<00:04:37.590> not

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
then finishing and then you see it's not

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.170 
then finishing and then you see it's not
solved<00:04:38.130> an<00:04:38.220> ugly<00:04:38.430> turn<00:04:38.610> it<00:04:38.760> over<00:04:38.850> and<00:04:39.000> it's

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
solved an ugly turn it over and it's

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.770 
solved an ugly turn it over and it's
solved<00:04:39.480> so<00:04:40.260> then<00:04:40.440> once<00:04:40.590> again<00:04:40.920> these<00:04:41.340> two<00:04:41.550> over

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
solved so then once again these two over

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.770 
solved so then once again these two over
this<00:04:42.780> one<00:04:43.050> up<00:04:43.230> these<00:04:44.190> two<00:04:44.400> over<00:04:44.600> these<00:04:45.600> two

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
this one up these two over these two

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.420 
this one up these two over these two
down<00:04:46.020> this<00:04:46.830> one<00:04:47.220> over<00:04:47.720> these<00:04:48.720> two<00:04:48.900> down<00:04:49.430> turn

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
down this one over these two down turn

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.560 
down this one over these two down turn
it<00:04:50.550> like<00:04:50.640> this<00:04:51.290> bring<00:04:52.290> these<00:04:52.440> in<00:04:52.710> front<00:04:53.570> do

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
it like this bring these in front do

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.090 
it like this bring these in front do
that<00:04:54.840> whatever<00:04:55.560> that<00:04:55.770> is<00:04:56.360> open<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.450> up<00:04:57.570> open<00:04:58.100> it

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
that whatever that is open it up open it

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.000 
that whatever that is open it up open it
up<00:04:59.280> flip<00:05:00.030> those<00:05:00.240> in<00:05:00.450> that<00:05:00.960> over<00:05:01.230> the<00:05:01.320> top<00:05:01.500> and

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
up flip those in that over the top and

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.310 
up flip those in that over the top and
open<00:05:02.550> it<00:05:02.610> up<00:05:02.730> so<00:05:03.300> I'm<00:05:03.810> going<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:03.990> try<00:05:04.110> to<00:05:04.140> do

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
open it up so I'm going to try to do

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.290 
open it up so I'm going to try to do
kind<00:05:04.860> of<00:05:04.980> fast<00:05:05.220> but<00:05:05.640> I'm<00:05:05.820> warning<00:05:06.090> you<00:05:06.150> guys
