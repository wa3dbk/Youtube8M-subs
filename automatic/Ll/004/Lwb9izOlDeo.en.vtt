00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
heavy-duty professional-grade unit that

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.720

doesn't require the same pumping action
as<00:03:44.350> regular<00:03:45.040> guns<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:45.970> there's<00:03:46.150> less

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
as regular guns so there's less
