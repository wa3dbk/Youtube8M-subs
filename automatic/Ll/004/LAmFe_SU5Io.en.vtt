00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.820
 mysterious creatures of the forest in 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.460
 half of his life after leaving one of his 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.110
 several suitors is one of the 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.540
 so many adventures that the 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.950
 protagonist of this ballet created by 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.939
 the english ben stevenson in 1981 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.750
 based on the work of the dramatist 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:31.779
 henrik ibsen five years later came the 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.270
 municipal for the first time this is the 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.930
 third opportunity in which it presents 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.930
 In this stage 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.600
 if that was 40 years ago 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 approximately I had a dancer who 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.430
 was in the company in houston was a 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.770
 very strong actor a very good actor 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.200
 so I want to be something special for 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.269
 him and I thought that this would be a good 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.699
 story that's how I did it for 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:00.000
 first time and I beat benso is a 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.870
 choreographer who knows how to relate 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.869
 stories without which one needs to read the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.560
 book or read a program and that's a 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.380
 very special quality that has see crazy 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.600
 Alarcon is one of the two dancers 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.360
 charge of interpreting a priori who the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.950
 first ballet dancer of santiago 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.399
 highlights the acting challenge that the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.440
 work is very difficult you have to act 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.170
 too much and make the public give 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.450
 account of the story without speaking 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.320
 obviously bodily or with gestures of 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.700
 the face 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.100
 currently the ballet of santiago 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.440
 works in the rooms dedicated to the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.289
 ballet school newly inaugurated 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.970
 this because theirs were destroyed 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.860
 by the fire that affected the theater 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.930
 municipal in November and still 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.910
 There is no date for delivery so 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.770
 it will not be ready that I can not say 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.630
 because it is in the hands of many people 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.690
 but I know that every day that comes to the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.180
 Theater I I I go I look at what 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.970
 they are doing and they are doing the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.180
 maximum possible now clear is a job 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.400
 very big and that's going to take time and the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.160
 kit will be at the municipal theater of 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.320
 santiago until April 17
