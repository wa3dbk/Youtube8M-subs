your<00:01:06.409> bipod<00:01:06.740> for<00:01:07.040> you<00:01:07.159> I<00:01:07.310> don't<00:01:07.549> know<00:01:07.670> if<00:01:07.760> that

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
your bipod for you I don't know if that

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.030 
your bipod for you I don't know if that
was<00:01:08.060> meant<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.330> be<00:01:08.360> implemented<00:01:09.110> but<00:01:09.650> it<00:01:09.830> does

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
was meant to be implemented but it does

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.289 
was meant to be implemented but it does
seem<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.340> work<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:14.000> bipod<00:01:14.600> is<00:01:14.780> one<00:01:14.930> of<00:01:15.049> the<00:01:15.170> few

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
seem to work the bipod is one of the few

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.109 
seem to work the bipod is one of the few
purely<00:01:17.350> positive<00:01:18.850> attachments<00:01:19.850> I<00:01:19.940> use<00:01:20.090> that

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
purely positive attachments I use that

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.800 
purely positive attachments I use that
term<00:01:20.360> loosely<00:01:20.570> because<00:01:22.030> it<00:01:23.030> takes<00:01:23.570> time<00:01:23.780> to

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
term loosely because it takes time to

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.920 
term loosely because it takes time to
deploy<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.619> laser<00:01:25.010> sight<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.490> other<00:01:25.610> one

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
deploy the laser sight is the other one

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.210 
deploy the laser sight is the other one
but<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.020> can<00:01:27.229> be<00:01:27.409> spotted<00:01:27.710> with<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.010> laser

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
but you can be spotted with the laser

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.289 
but you can be spotted with the laser
sight<00:01:29.650> so<00:01:30.650> as<00:01:30.830> I<00:01:30.860> said<00:01:31.130> it<00:01:31.430> takes<00:01:31.820> one<00:01:32.000> second

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
sight so as I said it takes one second

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.210 
sight so as I said it takes one second
to<00:01:32.330> deploy<00:01:32.659> that<00:01:32.930> was<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.260> original<00:01:33.530> value<00:01:33.979> I

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
to deploy that was the original value I

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.789 
to deploy that was the original value I
don't<00:01:34.490> know<00:01:34.580> if<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.850> more<00:01:35.030> recent<00:01:35.240> patches

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
don't know if the more recent patches

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.670 
don't know if the more recent patches
have<00:01:37.060> decreased<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:38.270> snow<00:01:38.540> 2013<00:01:39.290> so<00:01:39.530> it

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
have decreased that snow 2013 so it

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.490 
have decreased that snow 2013 so it
might<00:01:39.920> be<00:01:40.119> half<00:01:41.119> a<00:01:41.299> second<00:01:41.840> or<00:01:41.960> quarter<00:01:42.380> of<00:01:42.439> a

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
might be half a second or quarter of a

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.890 
might be half a second or quarter of a
second<00:01:42.950> or<00:01:43.130> something<00:01:43.400> like<00:01:43.549> that<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:44.060> it

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
second or something like that and it

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.950 
second or something like that and it
uses<00:01:45.170> you're<00:01:45.500> under<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:45.950> lot<00:01:46.670> now<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.630> main

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
uses you're under a lot now the main

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.520 
uses you're under a lot now the main
thing<00:01:47.990> that<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:49.490> bipod<00:01:49.880> does<00:01:50.150> is<00:01:50.450> make<00:01:51.170> your

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
thing that the bipod does is make your

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.340 
thing that the bipod does is make your
weapon<00:01:52.009> super<00:01:52.880> super<00:01:53.180> accurate<00:01:53.509> like<00:01:53.930> laser

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
weapon super super accurate like laser

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.730 
weapon super super accurate like laser
accurate<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:55.790> reduces<00:01:56.570> your<00:01:57.259> horizontal

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
accurate it reduces your horizontal

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.850 
accurate it reduces your horizontal
recoil<00:01:58.189> by<00:01:58.610> 75<00:01:59.119> five<00:01:59.479> percent<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.140> your

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
recoil by 75 five percent and your

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.469 
recoil by 75 five percent and your
vertical<00:02:01.310> recoil<00:02:01.460> by<00:02:01.970> 50%<00:02:03.189> horizontal<00:02:04.189> is

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
vertical recoil by 50% horizontal is

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.780 
vertical recoil by 50% horizontal is
generally<00:02:05.479> considered<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.930> worst<00:02:06.110> because

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
generally considered the worst because

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.270 
generally considered the worst because
it's<00:02:07.790> really<00:02:08.000> hard<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.239> compensate<00:02:08.869> for<00:02:09.280> the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
it's really hard to compensate for the

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.920 
it's really hard to compensate for the
vertical<00:02:10.700> recoil<00:02:10.819> you<00:02:11.120> can<00:02:11.330> convince

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
vertical recoil you can convince

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.959 
vertical recoil you can convince
for<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.579> it<00:02:13.579> also<00:02:13.760> has<00:02:14.349> 75<00:02:15.349> percent<00:02:16.099> less<00:02:16.519> m

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:16.969 
for it it also has 75 percent less m

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.390

don't<00:02:17.299> say<00:02:17.510> spread<00:02:17.989> that's<00:02:18.799> for<00:02:19.069> assault

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
don't say spread that's for assault

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.199 
don't say spread that's for assault
rifles<00:02:19.969> and<00:02:20.450> carbines<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:22.489> that's<00:02:23.000> the

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
rifles and carbines and that's the

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.250 
rifles and carbines and that's the
radius<00:02:23.629> of<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.829> spread<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:26.239> that<00:02:26.689> makes<00:02:26.989> you

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
radius of the spread and that makes you

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.649 
radius of the spread and that makes you
around<00:02:27.769> ninety<00:02:28.219> five<00:02:28.400> percent<00:02:28.459> more<00:02:29.090> accurate

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
around ninety five percent more accurate

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.339 
around ninety five percent more accurate
to<00:02:30.040> more<00:02:31.040> accurate<00:02:31.430> fire<00:02:31.639> because<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:33.079> area

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
to more accurate fire because the area

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:42.089 
to more accurate fire because the area
of<00:02:33.439> a<00:02:33.500> circle<00:02:33.709> is<00:02:36.370> PI<00:02:37.370> R<00:02:37.730> squared<00:02:38.209> i<00:02:38.510> believe<00:02:40.750> so

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
of a circle is PI R squared i believe so

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.619 
of a circle is PI R squared i believe so
it<00:02:43.099> makes<00:02:43.310> about<00:02:43.609> ninety-five<00:02:44.150> percent<00:02:44.269> more

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
it makes about ninety-five percent more

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.129 
it makes about ninety-five percent more
accurate<00:02:45.109> but<00:02:45.769> bear<00:02:46.129> in<00:02:46.159> mind<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:47.139> that

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
accurate but bear in mind that that

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.809 
accurate but bear in mind that that
circle<00:02:48.620> will<00:02:48.739> still<00:02:49.010> get<00:02:49.129> larger<00:02:49.549> if<00:02:49.700> you

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
circle will still get larger if you

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.220 
circle will still get larger if you
spray<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.980> area<00:02:52.310> can<00:02:52.700> still<00:02:52.939> get<00:02:53.060> bigger<00:02:53.269> it

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
spray that area can still get bigger it

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.309 
spray that area can still get bigger it

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:04.669 
now and a few seconds so that's laser

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.649 
now and a few seconds so that's laser
fire<00:03:04.969> accurate<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:07.060> another<00:03:08.060> thing<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.480> does

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
fire accurate and another thing it does

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.830 
fire accurate and another thing it does
it's<00:03:08.959> half's<00:03:09.409> your<00:03:10.040> spread<00:03:10.459> multiplier<00:03:11.060> so

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
it's half's your spread multiplier so

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.619 
it's half's your spread multiplier so
the<00:03:12.939> you<00:03:13.939> when<00:03:14.329> you<00:03:14.450> spray<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:15.250> takes<00:03:16.629> double

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
the you when you spray it takes double

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.569 
the you when you spray it takes double
the<00:03:17.720> time<00:03:18.069> for<00:03:19.069> your<00:03:19.729> spread<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.510> increase

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
the time for your spread to increase

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:27.339 
the time for your spread to increase
these<00:03:22.579> all<00:03:23.440> apply<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.979> the<00:03:25.750> sniper<00:03:26.750> rifles<00:03:27.169> as

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
these all apply to the sniper rifles as

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.610 
these all apply to the sniper rifles as
well<00:03:28.209> which<00:03:29.560> they<00:03:30.560> aren't<00:03:30.769> really<00:03:31.400> that

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
well which they aren't really that

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.500 
well which they aren't really that
essential<00:03:33.620> because<00:03:34.000> sniper<00:03:35.000> rifles<00:03:35.449> are

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
essential because sniper rifles are

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.559 
essential because sniper rifles are
really<00:03:35.720> accurate<00:03:36.139> anyway<00:03:36.319> but<00:03:36.889> what<00:03:37.189> they<00:03:38.120> do

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
really accurate anyway but what they do

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.909 
really accurate anyway but what they do
which<00:03:39.439> is<00:03:39.680> really<00:03:39.949> important<00:03:40.459> is<00:03:40.549> the

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
which is really important is the

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.339 
which is really important is the
stabilizer<00:03:42.919> weapon<00:03:43.459> so<00:03:44.269> without<00:03:44.989> holding

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
stabilizer weapon so without holding

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.899 
stabilizer weapon so without holding
down<00:03:45.590> your<00:03:45.650> breath<00:03:45.919> for<00:03:46.099> acts<00:03:46.310> as<00:03:46.519> if<00:03:46.669> you<00:03:46.759> do

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
down your breath for acts as if you do

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.249 
down your breath for acts as if you do
hold<00:03:47.150> on<00:03:47.329> your<00:03:47.479> breath<00:03:47.659> which<00:03:47.930> is<00:03:48.049> really

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:48.259 
hold on your breath which is really

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.909 
hold on your breath which is really
helpful<00:03:48.500> for<00:03:48.739> long-range<00:03:49.129> fire<00:03:49.519> but<00:03:50.919> because

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
helpful for long-range fire but because

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.460 
helpful for long-range fire but because
it<00:03:52.099> takes<00:03:52.280> up<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.579> same<00:03:52.759> slot<00:03:53.090> as<00:03:53.329> the<00:03:53.870> street

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
it takes up the same slot as the street

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.460 
it takes up the same slot as the street
pool<00:03:54.709> ball<00:03:55.329> if<00:03:56.329> you're<00:03:56.540> not<00:03:56.659> going<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:56.989> go<00:03:57.229> for

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
pool ball if you're not going to go for

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.839 
pool ball if you're not going to go for
a<00:03:57.500> long-range<00:03:57.680> fire<00:03:58.099> I<00:03:58.250> would<00:03:58.459> recommend

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
a long-range fire I would recommend

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.780 
a long-range fire I would recommend
going<00:03:59.419> for<00:03:59.780> the<00:03:59.900> straight<00:04:00.229> pool<00:04:00.439> ball<00:04:00.650> as<00:04:00.829> if

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
going for the straight pool ball as if

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.780 
going for the straight pool ball as if
you're<00:04:02.060> a<00:04:02.090> terrible<00:04:02.359> short<00:04:02.689> like<00:04:02.959> me<00:04:03.790> it

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
you're a terrible short like me it

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.580 
you're a terrible short like me it
allows<00:04:05.030> you<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.299> pull<00:04:05.509> off<00:04:05.629> shots<00:04:05.930> quicker<00:04:06.259> and

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
allows you to pull off shots quicker and

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.820 
allows you to pull off shots quicker and
increases<00:04:07.129> your<00:04:07.159> real<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.459> little<00:04:07.699> time<00:04:09.759> but

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
increases your real a little time but

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.080 
increases your real a little time but
it's<00:04:12.760> still<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.390> very<00:04:13.780> good<00:04:13.960> attachment<00:04:14.230> for

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
it's still a very good attachment for

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.380 
it's still a very good attachment for
long-range<00:04:16.090> sniping<00:04:17.880> so<00:04:18.880> if<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.120> are<00:04:19.239> going

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
long-range sniping so if you are going

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.759 
long-range sniping so if you are going
to<00:04:19.480> be<00:04:19.540> sitting<00:04:19.780> back<00:04:20.019> if<00:04:20.200> you<00:04:20.320> are<00:04:20.350> a<00:04:20.500> pretty

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
to be sitting back if you are a pretty

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.030 
to be sitting back if you are a pretty
decent<00:04:21.190> shot<00:04:21.489> you<00:04:22.390> can<00:04:22.720> you<00:04:23.200> can<00:04:23.380> really<00:04:23.560> do

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
decent shot you can you can really do

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.360 
decent shot you can you can really do
well<00:04:24.280> with<00:04:24.430> this<00:04:24.520> attachment<00:04:28.350> which<00:04:29.350> is<00:04:29.650> it's

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
well with this attachment which is it's

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.020 
well with this attachment which is it's
good<00:04:30.640> it<00:04:30.880> does<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.330> stabilizing<00:04:31.960> effect<00:04:32.020> is

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
good it does the stabilizing effect is

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.970 
good it does the stabilizing effect is
really<00:04:34.030> good<00:04:34.230> even<00:04:35.230> if<00:04:35.350> you're<00:04:35.470> not<00:04:35.530> going<00:04:35.770> for

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
really good even if you're not going for

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.330 
really good even if you're not going for
super<00:04:36.310> long<00:04:36.460> ranges<00:04:37.650> back<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.920> can<00:04:39.100> still<00:04:39.310> be

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
super long ranges back it can still be

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.730 
super long ranges back it can still be
effective<00:04:39.910> as<00:04:40.150> long<00:04:40.480> as<00:04:40.600> you've<00:04:40.720> got<00:04:40.750> as<00:04:41.230> long

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
effective as long as you've got as long

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.840 
effective as long as you've got as long
as<00:04:41.860> you're<00:04:41.920> confident<00:04:42.340> you're<00:04:42.490> going<00:04:42.670> to<00:04:42.730> hit

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
as you're confident you're going to hit

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.510 
as you're confident you're going to hit
the<00:04:42.880> short<00:04:43.210> first<00:04:43.420> time<00:04:44.220> because<00:04:45.220> it<00:04:45.250> does

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
the short first time because it does

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.690 
the short first time because it does
reduce<00:04:45.700> your<00:04:46.030> mobility<00:04:46.830> but<00:04:47.830> where<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.190> bipod

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
reduce your mobility but where the bipod

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.270 
reduce your mobility but where the bipod
is<00:04:49.000> really<00:04:49.780> really<00:04:50.200> special<00:04:50.470> is<00:04:50.890> when<00:04:51.160> it
