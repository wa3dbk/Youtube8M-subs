you<00:01:45.630> pretty<00:01:45.869> good<00:01:46.049> drop<00:01:46.290> protection<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
you pretty good drop protection on the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.819 
you pretty good drop protection on the
sides<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> top<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.020> bottom<00:01:49.200> since<00:01:49.680> it

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
sides and on the top and bottom since it

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.100 
sides and on the top and bottom since it
sticks<00:01:50.070> out<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.280> little<00:01:50.369> bit<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.360> really<00:01:51.930> like

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
sticks out a little bit so I really like

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.770 
sticks out a little bit so I really like
that<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.619> from<00:01:53.490> my<00:01:53.700> testing<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.329> been<00:01:54.509> good

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that and from my testing it's been good

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.539 
that and from my testing it's been good
so<00:01:54.960> far<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.070> cutouts

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
so far and you can see all the cutouts

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.660 
so far and you can see all the cutouts
there<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> camera<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.719> speaker<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
there for the camera the speaker and the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.840 
there for the camera the speaker and the
pen<00:02:00.380> now<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.469> only<00:02:01.680> thing<00:02:01.770> about<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> pen<00:02:02.520> is

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
pen now the only thing about the pen is

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.780 
pen now the only thing about the pen is
that<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.170> cut<00:02:04.530> out<00:02:04.649> for<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.100> little<00:02:05.130> small

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
that the cut out for it's a little small

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.520 
that the cut out for it's a little small
so<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.149> have<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.600> small<00:02:06.659> fingers<00:02:07.380> you

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
so if you have really small fingers you

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.380 
so if you have really small fingers you
can<00:02:07.560> probably<00:02:07.920> get<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.280> out<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.429> there<00:02:08.759> but

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
can probably get it out of there but

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.940 
can probably get it out of there but
it's<00:02:09.599> definitely<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:10.200> large<00:02:10.560> enough<00:02:10.649> for

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
it's definitely not large enough for

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.589 
it's definitely not large enough for
your<00:02:11.280> finger<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.700> go<00:02:11.849> through<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.450> to

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
your finger to go through so you have to

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.910 
your finger to go through so you have to
kind<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.810> dig<00:02:13.110> into<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.590> little

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
kind of dig into it a little

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.339 
kind of dig into it a little
to<00:02:14.130> pull<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.430> pin<00:02:14.640> out<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:15.150> mean<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:16.140> little

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
to pull the pin out I mean it's a little

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.610 
to pull the pin out I mean it's a little
bit<00:02:16.620> annoying<00:02:16.920> but<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.490> not<00:02:17.670> terrible<00:02:18.270> but

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
bit annoying but it's not terrible but

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.479 
bit annoying but it's not terrible but
that's<00:02:19.620> something<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.099> wanted<00:02:20.400> to

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
that's something that I wanted to

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.030 
that's something that I wanted to
mention<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.209> review<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.709> would

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
mention in this review so you would

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.760 
mention in this review so you would
notice<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.400> even<00:02:23.760> with<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.569> case<00:02:24.750> open<00:02:25.020> you

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
notice that even with the case open you

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.270 
notice that even with the case open you
would<00:02:25.890> definitely<00:02:26.099> have<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:28.099> dig<00:02:29.099> your

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
would definitely have to just dig your

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.040 
would definitely have to just dig your
finger<00:02:29.610> into<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.970> just<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.300> little<00:02:30.330> bit<00:02:30.690> more

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
finger into it just a little bit more

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.220 
finger into it just a little bit more
and<00:02:31.670> just<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.850> get<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.150> out<00:02:33.239> it's<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.780> little<00:02:34.050> bit

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
and just to get it out it's a little bit

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.380 
and just to get it out it's a little bit
tough<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.800> get<00:02:35.280> out<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:35.760> that's<00:02:35.910> one<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.300> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
tough to get out so that's one of the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.449 
tough to get out so that's one of the
major<00:02:36.630> flaws<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.110> i<00:02:37.350> saw<00:02:37.620> with<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.160> case

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
major flaws that i saw with this case

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.280 
major flaws that i saw with this case
was<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.270> opening<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.100> pen<00:02:41.400> holder<00:02:42.290> but

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
was the opening to the pen holder but

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.690 
was the opening to the pen holder but
that's<00:02:43.470> something<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:43.860> can<00:02:43.980> get<00:02:44.160> used<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.550> as

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
that's something you can get used to as

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.190 
that's something you can get used to as
well<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.209> don't<00:02:45.450> think<00:02:45.599> it's<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.780> deal<00:02:45.959> breaker

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
well I don't think it's a deal breaker

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.380 
well I don't think it's a deal breaker
but<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:47.010> definitely<00:02:47.430> something<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:48.030> mention

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
but it's definitely something to mention

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.440 
but it's definitely something to mention
in<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:49.140> review<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.819> can<00:02:50.970> see<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.209> soft

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
in the review and you can see the soft

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.270 
in the review and you can see the soft
touch<00:02:51.630> finish<00:02:51.840> there<00:02:52.230> now<00:02:52.500> if<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.739> lay<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> flat

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
touch finish there now if you lay a flat

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.100 
touch finish there now if you lay a flat
like<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.519> you<00:02:53.910> will<00:02:54.060> see<00:02:54.299> that<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.660> puts<00:02:54.989> it

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
like that you will see that it puts it

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.740 
like that you will see that it puts it
up<00:02:55.230> at<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.440> slight<00:02:55.830> tilt<00:02:56.130> which<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.150> cool<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:57.420> you

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
up at a slight tilt which is cool so you

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.930 
up at a slight tilt which is cool so you
can<00:02:57.959> put<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.200> right<00:02:58.590> on<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.830> desk<00:02:59.100> or<00:02:59.549> on<00:02:59.610> a

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
can put that right on the desk or on a

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.960 
can put that right on the desk or on a
flat<00:03:00.209> surface<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:01.019> use<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.890> with<00:03:02.400> no<00:03:02.489> problems

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
flat surface and use it with no problems

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.640 
flat surface and use it with no problems
it<00:03:03.090> gives<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.480> slight<00:03:03.780> tilt<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.440> can

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
it gives it a slight tilt so you can

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.979 
it gives it a slight tilt so you can
watch<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:05.010> movie<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.459> way<00:03:05.670> it's<00:03:06.360> not<00:03:06.660> like

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
watch a movie that way it's not like

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.660 
watch a movie that way it's not like
they're<00:03:07.200> hard<00:03:07.470> bookcase<00:03:07.920> which<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.519> also

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
they're hard bookcase which I also

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.840 
they're hard bookcase which I also
reviewed<00:03:09.209> so<00:03:09.360> check<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:09.630> out<00:03:09.810> as<00:03:10.230> well<00:03:10.850> where

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
reviewed so check that out as well where

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.940 
reviewed so check that out as well where
it<00:03:12.000> lets<00:03:12.209> it<00:03:12.390> prop<00:03:12.720> up<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.170> stand<00:03:13.410> up<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.739> little

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
it lets it prop up and stand up a little

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.009 
it lets it prop up and stand up a little
bit<00:03:14.100> at<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.310> higher<00:03:14.489> angle<00:03:14.819> but<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:15.810> definitely

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
bit at a higher angle but it definitely

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.900 
bit at a higher angle but it definitely
gives<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> little<00:03:16.769> bit<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.610> viewing

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
gives you a little bit of a viewing

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.690 
gives you a little bit of a viewing
distance<00:03:18.420> with<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:18.989> little<00:03:19.680> bit<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.130> lift

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
distance with that little bit of lift

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.640 
distance with that little bit of lift
now<00:03:21.660> let<00:03:21.840> me<00:03:21.870> go<00:03:22.109> ahead<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.350> get<00:03:22.440> into

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
now let me go ahead and get into

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.289 
now let me go ahead and get into
something<00:03:23.010> else<00:03:23.190> about<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:23.700> case<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.030> I

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
something else about this case that I

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.360 
something else about this case that I
thought<00:03:24.600> was<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.380> little<00:03:25.620> bit<00:03:25.799> funny<00:03:26.100> and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
thought was a little bit funny and

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.190 
thought was a little bit funny and
because<00:03:27.209> since<00:03:27.450> i've<00:03:27.600> tested<00:03:27.840> other

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
because since i've tested other

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.990 
because since i've tested other
Valentina's<00:03:28.799> cases<00:03:29.160> before<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.970> the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
Valentina's cases before this is the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.750 
Valentina's cases before this is the
only<00:03:30.209> one<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:30.600> i've<00:03:30.870> known<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.470> do<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.859> with

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
only one that i've known to do this with

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.970 
only one that i've known to do this with
this<00:03:33.030> much<00:03:33.299> movement<00:03:33.630> now<00:03:34.320> you<00:03:34.380> can<00:03:34.590> see<00:03:34.769> with

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
this much movement now you can see with

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.280 
this much movement now you can see with
the<00:03:35.100> belt<00:03:35.340> clip<00:03:35.640> here<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.570> when<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.019> move

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
the belt clip here that when you move

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.190 
the belt clip here that when you move
the<00:03:37.650> top<00:03:38.609> part<00:03:38.910> around<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.450> definitely<00:03:39.900> slides

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
the top part around it definitely slides

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.380 
the top part around it definitely slides
around<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.709> lot<00:03:40.980> more<00:03:41.250> than<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:42.209> other

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
around a lot more than the other

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.569 
around a lot more than the other
Valentina's<00:03:43.079> cases<00:03:43.440> did<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.890> I<00:03:44.250> think<00:03:44.459> that

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
Valentina's cases did and I think that

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.849 
Valentina's cases did and I think that
has<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.760> do<00:03:45.030> with<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.299> large<00:03:45.660> screen<00:03:45.930> size<00:03:46.410> of

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
has to do with the large screen size of

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.120 
has to do with the large screen size of
the<00:03:47.310> galaxy<00:03:47.820> note<00:03:48.060> 2<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:49.530> can<00:03:49.680> see<00:03:49.890> that

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
the galaxy note 2 and you can see that

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.520 
the galaxy note 2 and you can see that
it<00:03:50.489> you<00:03:50.730> barely<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.420> move<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.989> get<00:03:52.440> it

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
it you barely have to move it to get it

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.080 
it you barely have to move it to get it
to<00:03:52.560> move<00:03:52.769> around<00:03:52.980> now<00:03:53.579> here's<00:03:53.910> the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
to move around now here's the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.750 
to move around now here's the
Valentina's<00:03:54.720> case<00:03:54.989> on<00:03:55.290> my<00:03:55.590> right<00:03:55.890> for<00:03:56.549> the

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
Valentina's case on my right for the

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.940 
Valentina's case on my right for the
iphone<00:03:57.150> 5<00:03:57.450> with<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.810> 4-inch<00:03:58.290> screen<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.890> you

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
iphone 5 with the 4-inch screen and you

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.800 
iphone 5 with the 4-inch screen and you
can<00:03:59.069> see<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.459> it's<00:03:59.609> very<00:03:59.790> very<00:04:00.120> solid<00:04:00.600> and<00:04:00.720> it

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
can see that it's very very solid and it

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.559 
can see that it's very very solid and it
doesn't<00:04:01.200> really<00:04:01.410> move<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:02.459> much<00:04:02.700> but<00:04:03.180> the

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
doesn't really move that much but the

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.680 
doesn't really move that much but the
galaxy<00:04:04.500> note<00:04:04.530> 2<00:04:04.950> Valentina's<00:04:05.760> definitely<00:04:06.480> has

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
galaxy note 2 Valentina's definitely has

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.710 
galaxy note 2 Valentina's definitely has
a<00:04:06.720> lot<00:04:06.930> of<00:04:06.959> movement<00:04:07.590> on<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:08.340> belt<00:04:08.579> clip<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.180> I

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
a lot of movement on the belt clip and I

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.970 
a lot of movement on the belt clip and I
think<00:04:10.049> that<00:04:10.170> has<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.319> do<00:04:10.530> with<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.709> large

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
think that has to do with a large

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.699 
think that has to do with a large
surface<00:04:11.400> area<00:04:11.760> so<00:04:12.269> definitely<00:04:12.750> want<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.560> take

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
surface area so definitely want to take

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.810 
surface area so definitely want to take
that<00:04:13.889> in<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.040> note<00:04:14.459> when<00:04:15.209> you<00:04:15.389> buy<00:04:15.600> this<00:04:15.660> case

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
that in to note when you buy this case

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.789 
that in to note when you buy this case
now<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:18.419> can<00:04:18.539> see<00:04:18.690> how<00:04:18.720> nice<00:04:19.169> this<00:04:19.410> leather<00:04:19.680> is

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
now you can see how nice this leather is

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.430
