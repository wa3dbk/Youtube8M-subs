friends now getting A's and B's on my

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.500 
friends now getting A's and B's on my
test<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.070> didn't<00:00:32.399> do<00:00:32.489> smart<00:00:32.850> brain<00:00:33.090> games<00:00:33.329> I

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
test if I didn't do smart brain games I

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.209 
test if I didn't do smart brain games I
probably<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.350> go<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.800> different

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219

let's go do this and let's go to this

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.840 
let's go do this and let's go to this
and<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.590> kind<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.010> annoying<00:01:11.430> after

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
a while smart brain game technology was

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.370 
a while smart brain game technology was
really<00:01:14.520> really<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.119> lot<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.479> fun<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.170> you

sit down you play video games and they
don't<00:01:18.090> even<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.390> your<00:01:18.720> training<00:01:19.080> yet<00:01:19.380> you

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
don't even know your training yet you

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.170 
don't even know your training yet you
come<00:01:19.770> out<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.220> near<00:01:20.490> different<00:01:21.030> it
