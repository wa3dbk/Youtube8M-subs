to<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.850> Pisani<00:00:40.210> axle-backs<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.860> what<00:00:42.010> we'll

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
to the Pisani axle-backs so what we'll

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.000 
to the Pisani axle-backs so what we'll
do<00:00:42.280> is<00:00:42.309> over<00:00:43.059> here<00:00:43.210> you<00:00:43.360> can<00:00:43.510> see<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:44.010> sunny

do is over here you can see the sunny

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.350 
do is over here you can see the sunny
axle-backs<00:00:45.580> these<00:00:45.760> things<00:00:45.970> have<00:00:46.150> about

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
axle-backs these things have about

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.390 
axle-backs these things have about
10,000<00:00:47.020> miles<00:00:47.170> on<00:00:47.379> them<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:48.010> headers<00:00:48.370> the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
10,000 miles on them the headers the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
x-pipe in the high flow cats at about

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.869 
x-pipe in the high flow cats at about
500<00:00:50.440> miles<00:00:50.680> on<00:00:50.739> them<00:00:50.890> so<00:00:51.460> let's<00:00:51.580> go<00:00:51.699> ahead<00:00:51.760> and

500 miles on them so let's go ahead and

00:00:51.879 --> 00:01:23.480 
500 miles on them so let's go ahead and
see<00:00:52.090> what<00:00:52.180> they<00:00:52.239> sound<00:00:52.449> broken<00:00:52.660> in

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
sounds

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.230 
sounds
on<00:01:26.320> startup<00:01:26.560> I'll<00:01:27.370> do<00:01:27.520> some<00:01:27.670> drive-bys<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:28.180> you

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
on startup I'll do some drive-bys so you

00:01:28.240 --> 00:02:19.330 
on startup I'll do some drive-bys so you
guys<00:01:28.360> can<00:01:28.540> hear<00:01:28.630> how<00:01:28.810> she<00:01:28.840> is<00:01:29.140> when<00:01:29.290> she<00:01:29.410> goes

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.380 

all<00:02:20.340> right<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:20.640> now<00:02:20.760> we're<00:02:20.940> gonna<00:02:21.000> see<00:02:21.269> how<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
all right so now we're gonna see how the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.119 
all right so now we're gonna see how the
pisani<00:02:21.720> headers<00:02:22.019> sound<00:02:22.290> inside<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.830> cabin<00:02:23.040> of

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
pisani headers sound inside the cabin of

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.559 
pisani headers sound inside the cabin of
the<00:02:23.160> car<00:02:24.620> yeah<00:02:25.620> sweet<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:27.209> good<00:02:27.390> thing<00:02:27.540> about

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
the car yeah sweet the good thing about

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.030 
the car yeah sweet the good thing about
the<00:02:27.870> headers<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.349> I<00:02:28.379> actually<00:02:28.590> believe<00:02:29.010> that

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
the headers is I actually believe that

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.680 
the headers is I actually believe that
it<00:02:29.280> smelled<00:02:29.489> at<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.760> tone<00:02:29.910> inside<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.330> cabin

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
it smelled at the tone inside the cabin

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.690 
it smelled at the tone inside the cabin
so<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.019> actually<00:02:31.290> reduces<00:02:31.709> drone<00:02:32.010> as<00:02:32.220> opposed

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
so it actually reduces drone as opposed

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.070 
so it actually reduces drone as opposed
to<00:02:32.730> just<00:02:32.880> having<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.239> Xbox<00:02:33.660> with<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.900> stock

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
to just having the Xbox with the stock

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.690 
to just having the Xbox with the stock
piping<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:35.010> go<00:02:35.220> ahead<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.459> drive<00:02:35.580> around

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
piping just go ahead and drive around
