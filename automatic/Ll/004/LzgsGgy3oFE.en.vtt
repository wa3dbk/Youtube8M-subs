00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.200
 To enter 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 Good shape 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.250
 First in 4 years

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.310
 Practice 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.580
 But because it is serious from now on 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.070
 Well there is also the end of the term 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.730
 And after all 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.200
 National Selection 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.390
 That's what it means 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.390
 I'm waiting for defensive 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.210
 Listen carefully 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.640

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.730
 Bad habit 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.840
 In the game a bad habit has come out 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.660
 Even for a list 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.120
 The 3rd number of Leland destiny 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.210
 To be 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.190
 Sticky spots 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.950
 I really have to fix such a habit 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.490
 If I can't fix it, I hope I'll come back next time 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.789
 Kanto meeting 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.129
 Qualifying 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.339
 After inter high qualifying 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:15.869
 After all such places 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.259
 I have to fix it 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.009
 That's my sister 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:24.489
 About 5 years together 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.799
 That morning with the same prefecture 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.159

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.729
 Ichijo rice 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:30.299
 Look at the match 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.459
 Turn around the circle 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.889
 How should I do my best 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.019
 Should we reintegrate? 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.999

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.649
 Please consider 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:46.929
 Well that's what it feels like 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:51.119
 I forgot to send in the post-Aboss game Europe and America, but 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:55.449
 It has become quite difficult to taste that amount 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:56.549
 So 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.549
 that 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.729
 As we want to make rice 71 with TV 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.949

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.339
 National Selection 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.759
 It may be true but it is surely 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.759
 Do various things that 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:21.139
 I can send it to those guys who can do my best 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:23.249
 I'll try to do my best 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:26.409
 It seems like that, please do national selection hard 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.120
 And please do your best next year
