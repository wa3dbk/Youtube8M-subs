00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.299 
preventer works by preventing seeds from
germinating<00:00:13.660> so<00:00:14.620> we<00:00:14.740> need<00:00:14.920> to<00:00:15.010> have<00:00:15.130> this

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
germinating so we need to have this

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.400 
germinating so we need to have this
product<00:00:15.580> down<00:00:15.940> on<00:00:16.150> the<00:00:16.269> ground<00:00:16.510> before<00:00:17.199> those

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
product down on the ground before those

weed seeds germinate the other important

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.599 
weed seeds germinate the other important
fact<00:00:20.019> is<00:00:20.259> that<00:00:20.589> the<00:00:20.890> chemical<00:00:21.279> that's<00:00:21.369> found

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:21.609 
fact is that the chemical that's found

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.189 
fact is that the chemical that's found
in<00:00:21.789> crabgrass<00:00:22.029> preventer<00:00:22.239> doesn't

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
in crabgrass preventer doesn't

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.050 
in crabgrass preventer doesn't
differentiate<00:00:23.589> between<00:00:23.919> crab<00:00:24.460> grass<00:00:24.699> seed

and<00:00:25.269> turf<00:00:25.779> grass<00:00:26.079> seed<00:00:26.349> so<00:00:26.829> if<00:00:26.890> you've<00:00:27.009> got

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
and turf grass seed so if you've got

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.889 
and turf grass seed so if you've got

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
different grasses but the rate will be

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.960 
different grasses but the rate will be
different<00:01:08.890> depending<00:01:09.460> on<00:01:09.520> what<00:01:09.700> type<00:01:09.940> of

different depending on what type of

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.120 
different depending on what type of
grass<00:01:10.300> you<00:01:10.330> have<00:01:10.720> in<00:01:10.870> your<00:01:10.960> yard<00:01:11.140> these<00:01:11.950> two

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
grass you have in your yard these two

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.730 
grass you have in your yard these two
bags<00:01:12.400> both<00:01:12.940> have<00:01:13.290> barricade<00:01:14.290> in<00:01:14.470> them<00:01:14.590> and

bags both have barricade in them and
they<00:01:14.890> both<00:01:15.100> have<00:01:15.370> 19<00:01:16.300> percent<00:01:16.750> nitrogen<00:01:17.170> so

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
they both have 19 percent nitrogen so

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.780 
they both have 19 percent nitrogen so
they<00:01:17.440> look<00:01:17.680> very<00:01:17.710> similar<00:01:18.010> they<00:01:18.490> look<00:01:18.520> like

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
they look very similar they look like

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.280 
they look very similar they look like
they<00:01:18.910> should<00:01:18.940> be<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.300> same<00:01:19.540> bag<00:01:20.260> of

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
they should be the same bag of

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.160 
they should be the same bag of
fertilizer<00:01:20.650> and<00:01:21.190> crabgrass<00:01:21.700> preventer

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
fertilizer and crabgrass preventer

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.240 
fertilizer and crabgrass preventer
however<00:01:23.170> when<00:01:23.380> we<00:01:23.470> look<00:01:23.650> closely<00:01:23.890> at<00:01:24.070> the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
however when we look closely at the

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.300 
however when we look closely at the
label<00:01:24.490> this<00:01:24.760> one<00:01:24.940> has<00:01:25.150> 0.2%<00:01:26.080> pro<00:01:26.650> diamine<00:01:27.160> and

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
label this one has 0.2% pro diamine and

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.750 
label this one has 0.2% pro diamine and
this<00:01:27.760> one<00:01:27.940> has<00:01:28.090> 0.38<00:01:28.870> percent<00:01:29.080> pro<00:01:29.800> diamine<00:01:30.250> so

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
this one has 0.38 percent pro diamine so

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.580 
this one has 0.38 percent pro diamine so
this<00:01:30.880> one<00:01:30.970> has<00:01:31.090> a<00:01:31.120> lot<00:01:31.420> more<00:01:31.450> barricade<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.320> so

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
this one has a lot more barricade and so

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.670 
this one has a lot more barricade and so
this<00:01:32.830> bag<00:01:33.100> will<00:01:33.640> actually<00:01:33.970> cover<00:01:34.680> 12,500
