00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:14.429
 back on a ramp that is quite 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.139
 well that I start on a ramp 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.180
 quietly and suddenly my character 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.039
 vanish on the bike and fall like that 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.570
 because if you know honestly I think 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.740
 something quite right if someone 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.930
 explains what has happened because I 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.310
 honestly we are not going to see this 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.130
 career because I do not know is a kind of 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.730
 giant ramp in which then you have to 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.340
 jump as it seems 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.130
 and once we have to get to the 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.910
 point exactly the guatafÃ¡n pool 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:45.050
 because there is the red dot that arrived 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.150
 disintegrated the smack but the case is 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.760
 that reaches the point that cool to see and 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.769
 Now that we have to do it, there are 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.300
 here one because a cylinder and a half do not 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:57.320
 I understand when it comes to pick up here 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.780
 I suppose ok we jump in guys well 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.940
 well fine three points seven of 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.460
 moments perfectly 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.649
 first let anyone while it is high is 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.640
 high 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.640
 here I do not reach point 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.820
 Well, the race does a little short 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.289
 true but but this footprint I know 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.509
 sincerely, memories and we are going to give 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.920
 stealing the writers for the boy 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.270
 but it tells how you are seeing in 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.830
 this case put the create the same 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.450
 career but vice because you because 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.649
 I wanted to make it different the case that 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.240
 let's see if we find the way to 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.729
 rise faster than my colleagues I 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.920
 I think jumping can be the option and 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.030
 Not an option valuation unless I 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.550
 fly away now here with my 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.930
 super bike that yes that would be handsome 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.430
 get to the point but that gives me that 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.380
 in my dreams maybe I get it 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.400
 real life like the bike and in the load at 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.350
 start jumping because if not the 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.350
 principal 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.540
 so let's try to keep the 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.650
 Straight bike that before is what fails is 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.180
 that bends the bike but if we keep it 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.010
 straight puts the problem and go up and up 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.840
 much faster 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.740
 there it is there is there they are writing 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.390
 for the side I am also conscious 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.270
 of it so let's rectify a 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.460
 little there it is and we're still jumping to 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.649
 what we call the jump more line than 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.780
 it is very noticeable but very many 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.650
 incredible to thank the one that rectifies 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.300
 there is again jump back to you 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.320
 we advance the partner this with 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.330
 care for you because it does not go na 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.160
 from here I can get to the point yes yes 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.260
 Yes, my mother, who did arrive, I have left over 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.680
 it arrived surpassed the companion wanted me 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.630
 troll but it will not get 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.780
 practical to have points I have the point 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.310
 perfect ok and now let's go first, and 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.900
 the uncle as see has tried to arrive is 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.180
 forget because he has been shot by the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.310
 butt that's worth how you want to take out 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.880
 from here through the door or where are you going to 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.040
 go out 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.710
 has tried to prepare the evils that do not 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.950
 can for something they will put doors in 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.780
 houses and all those things actually 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.520
 we go first three points are missing 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.930
 control and is our sheet these 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:03.410
 our we can back a sir if the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:05.590

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.950
 this never opens uses to use them 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.260
 god because this clue is supposed to be 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.120
 a track for vice but I've never known 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.470
 use none of the male gta and 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.400
 It gives me courage because it looks like 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.730
 cool 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.730
