 subsequent bonding of the film 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.710
 now we will select a film by the size of a nail 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.690
 and separate it from the base of the film you need 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.670

 film to the lamp and wait for it to start 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.979
 it can be twisted then 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.979
 glue 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.540

 smooth out all the bumps after 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.610
 gluing we cut off the excess with 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.860
 free edge of the nail and sawing already 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.720
 final processing of film residues 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.170
 nothing should cling and 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.170
 peel off 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.440
 doing the same procedure with another over 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.640
 team warm film under the lamp

 we process the remains of a film in the free 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.290
 land 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.300
 after the film is glued and 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.610
 free edge of the legs you put in order

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.660
 base drying every layer in the lamp i 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.849
