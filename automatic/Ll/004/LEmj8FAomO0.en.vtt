how can i strengthen my muscles and fix

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.910 
how can i strengthen my muscles and fix
it<00:01:30.740> in<00:01:30.920> balance<00:01:31.459> so<00:01:31.929> then<00:01:32.929> guys<00:01:33.350> that<00:01:33.649> looks<00:01:33.829> as

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
it in balance so then guys that looks as

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.740 
it in balance so then guys that looks as
much<00:01:34.100> as<00:01:34.219> he<00:01:34.340> does<00:01:34.490> probably<00:01:35.119> has<00:01:35.479> your<00:01:35.630> answer

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
much as he does probably has your answer

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.020 
much as he does probably has your answer
so<00:01:36.079> what<00:01:36.170> do<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:36.319> think<00:01:36.500> AJ<00:01:36.770> three<00:01:37.759> things

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
so what do you think AJ three things

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.660 
so what do you think AJ three things
that<00:01:38.179> could<00:01:38.390> be<00:01:38.590> most<00:01:39.590> people<00:01:39.829> have<00:01:39.950> weak

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
that could be most people have weak

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.990 
that could be most people have weak
glutes<00:01:41.229> weak<00:01:42.229> lower<00:01:42.470> back<00:01:42.739> or<00:01:43.130> weak<00:01:43.310> lacks<00:01:43.579> and

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
glutes weak lower back or weak lacks and

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.999 
glutes weak lower back or weak lacks and
so<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:44.750> could<00:01:44.929> be<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.049> combination<00:01:45.259> full<00:01:45.709> three

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
so it could be a combination full three

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.460 
so it could be a combination full three
and<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:47.239> a<00:01:47.299> lot<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.450> times<00:01:47.720> they<00:01:47.959> gotta<00:01:48.140> learn

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
and so a lot of times they gotta learn

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.319 
and so a lot of times they gotta learn
how<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.649> activate<00:01:49.039> their<00:01:49.369> glutes<00:01:49.610> we<00:01:50.090> can<00:01:50.239> do

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
how to activate their glutes we can do

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.660 
how to activate their glutes we can do
that<00:01:50.509> with<00:01:50.689> things<00:01:50.810> like<00:01:50.929> expand<00:01:51.409> walks<00:01:51.739> one

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
that with things like expand walks one

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.559 
that with things like expand walks one
legged<00:01:52.970> rdls

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
legged rdls

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.050 
legged rdls
exercises<00:01:54.500> like<00:01:54.649> that<00:01:54.920> we<00:01:55.700> need<00:01:55.849> to<00:01:55.909> build

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
exercises like that we need to build

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.209 
exercises like that we need to build
those<00:01:56.239> areas<00:01:56.689> up<00:01:56.869> first<00:01:57.319> of<00:01:57.560> all<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:57.979> really

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
those areas up first of all I really

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.520 
those areas up first of all I really
like<00:01:58.340> reverse<00:01:58.819> fibers<00:01:59.299> but<00:01:59.989> any<00:02:00.140> exercise

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
like reverse fibers but any exercise

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.199 
like reverse fibers but any exercise
that<00:02:00.649> hits<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:00.950> glutes<00:02:01.219> and<00:02:01.489> their<00:02:02.060> low<00:02:02.179> back

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
too but those three things will tend to

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.410 
too but those three things will tend to
fix<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.190> coffee<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.519> deadlift<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.120> what<00:02:17.269> most

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
supplemental after that so we do that

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.700 
supplemental after that so we do that
once<00:02:42.730> maybe<00:02:43.480> twice<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.810> week<00:02:44.110> we<00:02:44.230> do<00:02:44.380> some<00:02:44.560> real

size of the growth and then we can work
on<00:03:08.810> getting<00:03:08.840> stronger<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.409> main<00:03:09.620> exercises
