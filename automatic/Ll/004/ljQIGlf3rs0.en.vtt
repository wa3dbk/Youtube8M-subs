to show you the fastest way to power

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.190 
to show you the fastest way to power
level<00:00:04.799> your<00:00:05.549> characters<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.720> method<00:00:07.049> which

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
is faster than any other popular methods

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.970 
is faster than any other popular methods
at<00:00:09.660> least<00:00:09.990> from<00:00:10.200> what<00:00:10.410> I've<00:00:10.559> read<00:00:10.740> around<00:00:11.900> and

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
at least from what I've read around and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.300 
at least from what I've read around and
we<00:00:13.980> will<00:00:14.130> be<00:00:14.280> using<00:00:15.080> markers<00:00:16.080> dummy<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.680> get<00:00:16.859> XP

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
we will be using markers dummy to get XP

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.609 
we will be using markers dummy to get XP
but<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.180> need<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.660> quest<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.080> example

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
but we need it on a quest for example

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.010 
but we need it on a quest for example
you<00:00:19.680> can<00:00:19.859> see<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.250> now<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.300> mission<00:00:21.600> to

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
you can see that now I have a mission to

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.130 
you can see that now I have a mission to
burn<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> Vandal<00:00:22.920> wait<00:00:23.100> fire<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.750> we<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:24.930> use

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
burn the Vandal wait fire and we can use

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.009 
burn the Vandal wait fire and we can use
the<00:00:26.130> other<00:00:26.250> ones<00:00:26.550> also<00:00:26.760> but<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:27.630> complete

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the other ones also but if we complete

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.529 
the other ones also but if we complete
all<00:00:28.050> four<00:00:28.410> missions<00:00:28.769> then<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.160> can't<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:30.330> this

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
all four missions then we can't do this

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.260 
all four missions then we can't do this
method<00:00:30.980> hosting<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> character<00:00:32.640> that

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
method hosting on the character that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.479 
method hosting on the character that
completed<00:00:33.840> all<00:00:33.960> four<00:00:34.140> missions<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.309> thing

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
completed all four missions so the thing

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.729 
completed all four missions so the thing
is<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.880> now<00:00:36.300> if<00:00:36.570> we<00:00:36.690> shoot<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.020> dummy<00:00:37.500> with

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
is that now if we shoot this dummy with

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.700 
is that now if we shoot this dummy with
fire<00:00:38.239> we<00:00:39.239> will<00:00:39.360> complete<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> mission<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.410> if

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
fire we will complete the mission but if

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.799 
fire we will complete the mission but if
we<00:00:41.010> shoot<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:41.850> any<00:00:42.030> other<00:00:42.120> weapon<00:00:42.629> type

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
we shoot it with any other weapon type

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.380 
we shoot it with any other weapon type
we<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.980> continue<00:00:44.489> killing<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> dummy<00:00:45.149> over

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
we can continue killing the dummy over

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.410 
we can continue killing the dummy over
and<00:00:45.899> over<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.260> over<00:00:46.410> again<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:48.000> will<00:00:48.149> get

keep getting XP over and over again

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.600 
keep getting XP over and over again
well<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.289> case<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.710> won't<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:53.010> getting<00:00:53.129> XP

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
well in this case I won't be getting XP

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.330 
well in this case I won't be getting XP
because<00:00:54.000> I'm<00:00:54.120> level<00:00:54.390> 61<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.350> any<00:00:55.920> other

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
not who is not level 61 he will be

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.080 
not who is not level 61 he will be
getting<00:01:00.960> XP<00:01:01.500> all<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> time<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.820> want<00:01:03.030> to

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
getting XP all the time and we want to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.060 
getting XP all the time and we want to
kill<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.539> dummy<00:01:03.809> as<00:01:03.960> fast<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.350> possible<00:01:04.860> so

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
kill this dummy as fast as possible so

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.030 
kill this dummy as fast as possible so
we<00:01:05.400> want<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.729> get<00:01:05.880> behind<00:01:06.229> to<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.380> dummy<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.950> we

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
we want to get behind to the dummy so we

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.469 
we want to get behind to the dummy so we
can<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.700> will<00:01:08.760> show<00:01:09.000> how<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.420> it

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
can do it and I will show how to do it

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.679 
can do it and I will show how to do it
now<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.860> video<00:01:11.159> I'm<00:01:11.310> using<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:12.479> first

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
now in this video I'm using the first

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.399 
now in this video I'm using the first
mission<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.320> burn<00:01:13.860> vandal<00:01:14.360> but<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.259> be

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
mission to burn vandal but it can be

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.109 
mission to burn vandal but it can be
even<00:01:16.500> faster<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.400> complete<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> first

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
even faster if you complete the first

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.070 
even faster if you complete the first
three<00:01:18.330> missions<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.049> then<00:01:19.939> go<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.330> flag

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
three missions and then go to the flag

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.580 
three missions and then go to the flag
mission<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.430> use<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.750> fire<00:01:25.020> weapon

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
mission and then use the the fire weapon

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.580 
mission and then use the the fire weapon
because<00:01:26.580> Atlee<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.270> long<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.990> don't<00:01:28.140> slag

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
because Atlee as long as you don't slag

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.670 
because Atlee as long as you don't slag
the<00:01:29.220> Vandal<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.530> continue<00:01:31.530> killing

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the Vandal you can continue killing

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.649 
the Vandal you can continue killing
idiot<00:01:32.070> fire<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.700> flash<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.240> faster

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
idiot fire and it's flash so it's faster

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.140 
idiot fire and it's flash so it's faster
but<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.409> will<00:01:34.799> use<00:01:34.950> shock<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> fire<00:01:35.850> dummy

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
but I will use shock on a fire dummy

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.480 
but I will use shock on a fire dummy
which<00:01:36.450> will<00:01:36.659> also<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:37.229> pretty<00:01:37.560> fast<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.189> we

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
which will also be pretty fast so we

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.990 
which will also be pretty fast so we
have<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.909> reneedar<00:01:39.540> jump<00:01:40.490> grenade<00:01:41.490> jump<00:01:41.790> our

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
have to reneedar jump grenade jump our

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.160 
have to reneedar jump grenade jump our
way<00:01:42.210> up<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.380> roof<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.570> then<00:01:45.570> another

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
way up to this roof and then another

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.230 
way up to this roof and then another
grenade<00:01:46.950> jump<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:49.049> roof

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
grenade jump on that roof

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.080 
grenade jump on that roof
jump<00:01:51.240> through<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.899> one<00:01:52.369> go<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.820> black

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
jump through this one go to this black

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.920 
jump through this one go to this black
wall<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.659> then<00:01:55.470> walk<00:01:56.240> around<00:01:57.240> here<00:01:57.600> now<00:01:57.869> you

wall and then walk around here now you

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.200 
wall and then walk around here now you
have<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.740> careful<00:01:59.100> here<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.820> have<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.060> be

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
have to be careful here you have to be

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.600 
have to be careful here you have to be
in<00:02:01.140> between<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.770> shop<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.430> wall

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
in between the shop and the wall

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.740 
in between the shop and the wall
otherwise<00:02:03.299> you'll<00:02:03.930> fall<00:02:04.969> go<00:02:05.969> back<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.600> and

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
otherwise you'll fall go back here and

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.809 
otherwise you'll fall go back here and
now<00:02:07.110> here<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.770> where<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.610> real

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
now here is where you have to be real

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.160 
now here is where you have to be real
careful

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
careful

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
careful
you<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.920> go<00:02:11.099> slowly<00:02:11.520> because<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.920> can

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
you have to go slowly because you can

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.100 
you have to go slowly because you can
fall<00:02:14.760> down<00:02:14.790> like<00:02:15.180> one<00:02:16.140> centimeter<00:02:17.900> more<00:02:18.900> if

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
fall down like one centimeter more if

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.460 
fall down like one centimeter more if
you<00:02:19.260> go<00:02:19.470> go<00:02:20.190> around<00:02:20.520> here<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:21.000> there<00:02:21.750> we<00:02:21.900> go<00:02:22.110> we

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
you go go around here and there we go we

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.729 
you go go around here and there we go we
are<00:02:22.530> back<00:02:22.770> at<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.910> Marcus<00:02:24.300> Tommy<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.840> now<00:02:25.680> we

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
are back at the Marcus Tommy and now we

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.520 
are back at the Marcus Tommy and now we
can<00:02:26.099> start<00:02:26.190> killing<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.900> fastest<00:02:28.350> way

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
can start killing it so the fastest way

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.680 
can start killing it so the fastest way
we<00:02:28.709> found<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:29.220> possible<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.940> if<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.569> jump<00:02:30.900> up

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
we found it's possible is if you jump up

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.250 
we found it's possible is if you jump up
on<00:02:33.690> him<00:02:34.020> on<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:35.160> thing<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.910> holds<00:02:36.150> him<00:02:36.480> there

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
on him on the thing that holds him there

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.780 
on him on the thing that holds him there
we<00:02:37.380> go

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
we go

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.070 
we go
crouch<00:02:40.069> go<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.130> Ganzer<00:02:41.640> king<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.209> this<00:02:42.660> is<00:02:42.870> how

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
crouch go to Ganzer king and this is how

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.220 
crouch go to Ganzer king and this is how
it<00:02:43.230> looks<00:02:43.500> after<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.069> first<00:02:44.340> kill<00:02:48.110> there<00:02:49.110> we

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
it looks after the first kill there we

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.020 
it looks after the first kill there we
go<00:02:49.319> so<00:02:50.310> we<00:02:50.640> are<00:02:50.670> killing<00:02:51.000> like<00:02:51.950> ten<00:02:52.950> dummies<00:02:53.430> in

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
go so we are killing like ten dummies in

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.309 
go so we are killing like ten dummies in
one<00:02:54.360> second<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:57.060> somebody<00:02:57.959> who<00:02:58.200> is

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
one second and the somebody who is

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.120 
one second and the somebody who is
staying<00:02:59.120> with<00:03:00.120> us<00:03:00.299> in<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.660> game<00:03:00.930> which<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.920> not

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
staying with us in the game which is not

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.970 
staying with us in the game which is not
level<00:03:02.340> 61<00:03:02.910> will<00:03:03.090> keep<00:03:03.360> getting<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.989> lot<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.530> a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
level 61 will keep getting a lot and a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.520 
level 61 will keep getting a lot and a
lot<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.190> XP<00:03:05.819> all<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.299> time<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:07.290> can

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
lot of XP all the time you can

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.309 
lot of XP all the time you can
practically<00:03:08.030> bind<00:03:09.030> your<00:03:09.299> fire<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.900> your<00:03:10.019> space

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
practically bind your fire to your space

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.320 
practically bind your fire to your space
and<00:03:10.560> put<00:03:10.739> something<00:03:11.190> on<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.760> just<00:03:12.000> walk

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
and put something on it and just walk

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.500 
and put something on it and just walk
away<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.260> will<00:03:13.440> continue<00:03:14.180> doing<00:03:15.180> that

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
away and it will continue doing that

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.599 
away and it will continue doing that
I'll<00:03:15.720> stop<00:03:15.959> shooting<00:03:16.320> now<00:03:16.440> because<00:03:16.799> my<00:03:16.950> fps<00:03:17.430> is

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
I'll stop shooting now because my fps is

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.380 
I'll stop shooting now because my fps is
dropping<00:03:18.030> really<00:03:18.239> low<00:03:18.420> when<00:03:18.570> I'm<00:03:18.720> doing<00:03:18.959> that

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
dropping really low when I'm doing that

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.390 
dropping really low when I'm doing that
so<00:03:21.390> that's<00:03:21.870> practically<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.470> now<00:03:22.920> I<00:03:22.950> will<00:03:23.220> show

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
so that's practically it now I will show

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.620 
so that's practically it now I will show
what<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:24.150> have<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.540> use<00:03:24.750> for<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.410> work<00:03:25.530> we

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
what you have to use for this to work we

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.220 
what you have to use for this to work we
are<00:03:27.630> using<00:03:27.959> an<00:03:28.739> infinity<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.900> yeah<00:03:30.900> another

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
are using an infinity and yeah another

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.560 
are using an infinity and yeah another
thing<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:32.130> gear<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.609> use<00:03:32.850> doesn't<00:03:33.299> have<00:03:33.450> to

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
thing the gear you use doesn't have to

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.690 
thing the gear you use doesn't have to
be<00:03:33.720> perfect<00:03:34.140> at<00:03:34.260> all<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.280> need<00:03:35.459> an

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
be perfect at all you just need an

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.440 
be perfect at all you just need an
infinity<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.890> I'm<00:03:37.890> even<00:03:38.370> using<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.730> level<00:03:38.880> 51

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
infinity and I'm even using a level 51

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.440 
infinity and I'm even using a level 51
here<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:40.530> need<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.769> fiber<00:03:41.130> with<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:42.000> crit

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
here you need a fiber with the crit

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.979 
here you need a fiber with the crit
barrel<00:03:43.609> so<00:03:44.609> you<00:03:44.670> get<00:03:44.970> higher<00:03:45.299> crit<00:03:45.690> on<00:03:45.720> your

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
barrel so you get higher crit on your

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.530 
barrel so you get higher crit on your
affinity<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.829> need<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.100> be<00:03:47.340> again<00:03:47.910> not<00:03:48.390> too

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
affinity you need to be again not too

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.280 
affinity you need to be again not too
perfect<00:03:48.780> level<00:03:49.380> 50<00:03:49.709> B<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:50.880> need<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.510> hoarder

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
perfect level 50 B you need the hoarder

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.530 
perfect level 50 B you need the hoarder
class<00:03:52.590> mode<00:03:52.829> with<00:03:53.069> +6<00:03:53.670> lay<00:03:53.880> waste<00:03:54.090> that's

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
class mode with +6 lay waste that's

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.650 
class mode with +6 lay waste that's
really<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.140> only<00:03:55.200> thing<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.560> matters<00:03:56.069> and

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
really the only thing that matters and

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.650 
really the only thing that matters and
I'm<00:03:57.660> using<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.230> shock<00:03:58.680> damage<00:03:59.209> bone<00:04:00.209> of<00:04:00.510> the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
I'm using a shock damage bone of the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.860 
I'm using a shock damage bone of the
ancients<00:04:01.049> here<00:04:01.290> because<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.579> need<00:04:02.970> I'm<00:04:03.510> using<00:04:03.720> a

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
ancients here because I need I'm using a

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.440 
ancients here because I need I'm using a
shock<00:04:04.079> infinity<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:04.890> I<00:04:05.190> want<00:04:05.790> my<00:04:05.970> shock<00:04:06.239> damage

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
shock infinity so I want my shock damage

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.780 
shock infinity so I want my shock damage
to<00:04:06.690> be<00:04:06.780> as<00:04:06.870> high<00:04:07.019> as<00:04:07.109> possible<00:04:07.139> if<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.250> do<00:04:08.519> the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
to be as high as possible if you do the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.030 
to be as high as possible if you do the
same<00:04:08.970> thing<00:04:09.269> on<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.600> slag<00:04:09.870> dummy<00:04:10.200> then<00:04:10.590> you

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
same thing on the slag dummy then you

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.949 
same thing on the slag dummy then you
should<00:04:11.280> use<00:04:11.430> fire<00:04:11.790> infinity<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.720> fire

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
should use fire infinity and a fire

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.810 
should use fire infinity and a fire
relic<00:04:13.380> but<00:04:13.650> it's<00:04:14.639> fast<00:04:15.420> enough<00:04:15.540> anyway<00:04:16.820> you

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820

increases<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.240> time<00:05:10.510> you<00:05:10.810> can<00:05:11.020> gun<00:05:11.169> Zerg

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
increases the time you can gun Zerg

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.510 
increases the time you can gun Zerg
because<00:05:11.800> using<00:05:12.610> that<00:05:13.000> you<00:05:13.690> can<00:05:13.960> just<00:05:14.490> be<00:05:15.490> in

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
because using that you can just be in

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.580 
because using that you can just be in
gang<00:05:15.790> lurk<00:05:16.000> for<00:05:16.030> three<00:05:16.690> days<00:05:16.870> if<00:05:17.200> you<00:05:17.410> just

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
gang lurk for three days if you just

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.940 
gang lurk for three days if you just
continue<00:05:17.800> killing<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:19.120> dummy<00:05:19.330> and<00:05:19.860> there<00:05:20.860> are

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
continue killing the dummy and there are

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.719 
continue killing the dummy and there are
some<00:05:21.130> other<00:05:21.280> nice<00:05:21.820> kills<00:05:22.150> here<00:05:23.729> shooting

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
some other nice kills here shooting

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.010 
some other nice kills here shooting
faster<00:05:25.180> in<00:05:25.870> gangs<00:05:26.139> urk<00:05:26.320> and<00:05:26.620> so<00:05:26.800> on<00:05:27.510> so<00:05:28.510> that's

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
faster in gangs urk and so on so that's

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.150 
faster in gangs urk and so on so that's
pretty<00:05:29.229> much<00:05:29.350> it<00:05:30.300> I<00:05:31.300> will<00:05:32.260> show<00:05:32.500> how<00:05:32.979> it<00:05:33.130> looks

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
pretty much it I will show how it looks

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.360 
pretty much it I will show how it looks
from<00:05:33.640> the<00:05:34.260> perspective<00:05:35.260> of<00:05:35.380> somebody<00:05:35.830> who

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
from the perspective of somebody who

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.290 
from the perspective of somebody who
joins<00:05:36.640> the<00:05:36.820> game<00:05:37.229> when<00:05:38.760> when<00:05:39.760> somebody<00:05:40.180> is

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
joins the game when when somebody is

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.540 
joins the game when when somebody is
doing<00:05:40.450> this<00:05:41.820> from<00:05:42.820> level<00:05:43.120> 1<00:05:43.510> to<00:05:43.930> level<00:05:43.960> 50<00:05:44.650> it's

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
doing this from level 1 to level 50 it's

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.490 
doing this from level 1 to level 50 it's
a<00:05:45.820> parent<00:05:46.180> it's<00:05:46.450> approximately<00:05:48.120> 30<00:05:49.120> minutes

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
a parent it's approximately 30 minutes

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.719 
a parent it's approximately 30 minutes
from<00:05:50.500> level<00:05:50.890> 50<00:05:51.340> to<00:05:51.490> level<00:05:51.760> 61<00:05:52.330> it's<00:05:53.200> around<00:05:54.039> 40

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
from level 50 to level 61 it's around 40

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.860 
from level 50 to level 61 it's around 40
minutes<00:05:55.060> I<00:05:55.419> think<00:05:56.310> but<00:05:57.310> if<00:05:57.580> you<00:05:57.760> use<00:05:57.970> the<00:05:58.390> the

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
minutes I think but if you use the the

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.420 
minutes I think but if you use the the
relic<00:05:59.260> for<00:06:01.229> XP<00:06:02.229> boost<00:06:02.500> then<00:06:02.860> it<00:06:03.010> can<00:06:03.160> be<00:06:03.310> even

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
relic for XP boost then it can be even

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.630 
relic for XP boost then it can be even
faster<00:06:03.729> so<00:06:04.180> basically<00:06:04.630> if<00:06:05.380> you<00:06:05.620> have<00:06:05.890> a<00:06:06.160> friend

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
faster so basically if you have a friend

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.210 
faster so basically if you have a friend
who<00:06:07.390> can<00:06:07.570> set<00:06:07.840> up<00:06:08.020> a<00:06:08.169> gun<00:06:08.320> Zurcher<00:06:08.770> on<00:06:08.919> a<00:06:08.950> dummy

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
who can set up a gun Zurcher on a dummy

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.600 
who can set up a gun Zurcher on a dummy
for<00:06:09.520> you<00:06:10.200> you<00:06:11.200> can<00:06:11.440> be<00:06:11.680> from<00:06:11.950> level<00:06:12.250> you<00:06:12.430> can

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
for you you can be from level you can

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.000 
for you you can be from level you can
get<00:06:12.729> from<00:06:12.880> level<00:06:13.150> 1<00:06:13.330> to<00:06:13.360> level<00:06:13.510> 61<00:06:14.200> in<00:06:14.410> like<00:06:14.680> 1

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
get from level 1 to level 61 in like 1

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.820 
get from level 1 to level 61 in like 1
hour<00:06:15.220> if<00:06:15.580> especially<00:06:16.120> if<00:06:16.510> you<00:06:16.690> equip<00:06:16.990> XP

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
hour if especially if you equip XP

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.850 
hour if especially if you equip XP
really<00:06:18.100> after<00:06:18.460> level<00:06:18.729> 50<00:06:19.289> okay<00:06:20.289> that's<00:06:20.530> it<00:06:20.680> now

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
really after level 50 okay that's it now

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.730 
really after level 50 okay that's it now
let's<00:06:20.890> see<00:06:21.400> how<00:06:21.850> that<00:06:21.910> looks<00:06:22.440> from<00:06:23.440> the<00:06:23.620> other

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
let's see how that looks from the other

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.330 
let's see how that looks from the other
side

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.220 

so<00:06:29.340> I<00:06:29.370> create

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 
so I create

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.320 
so I create
one<00:06:30.470> character<00:06:30.920> and<00:06:31.630> I<00:06:32.630> a<00:06:32.780> striker<00:06:33.350> to<00:06:34.150> set<00:06:35.150> up

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
one character and I a striker to set up

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.200 
one character and I a striker to set up
his<00:06:35.540> gun<00:06:35.720> circle<00:06:36.110> on<00:06:36.350> a<00:06:36.410> dummy<00:06:36.740> so<00:06:37.670> I<00:06:37.700> can<00:06:37.970> join

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
his gun circle on a dummy so I can join

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.010 
his gun circle on a dummy so I can join
to<00:06:38.420> him<00:06:38.660> and<00:06:38.900> show<00:06:39.500> you<00:06:39.560> how<00:06:40.040> it<00:06:40.190> looks<00:06:41.020> from

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
to him and show you how it looks from

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.530 
to him and show you how it looks from
that<00:06:42.290> side<00:06:42.560> and<00:06:42.590> how<00:06:43.160> fast<00:06:43.490> will<00:06:44.000> get<00:06:44.360> getting

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
that side and how fast will get getting

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.220 
that side and how fast will get getting
XP<00:06:45.880> one<00:06:46.880> thing<00:06:47.090> that<00:06:47.240> I<00:06:47.360> forgot<00:06:47.540> to<00:06:47.750> say<00:06:48.050> before

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 
XP one thing that I forgot to say before
