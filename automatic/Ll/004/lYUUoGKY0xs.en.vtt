 here we are in the kitchen of the gray 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.840

 dry grated 100 g of butter oil a 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.149
 whole egg in the pro where he mentions the 100 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.829
 grams of walnuts and parsley of the 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.620
 grated breadcrumbs cheese 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:42.679
 to block the salt meatballs and 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:44.600
 pepper balls today small meatballs 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.390
 because they want this recipe 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.780
 can interpret a bit like saying a 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.309
 finger food if you make it small second 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.309
 flat if it makes a nice meatloaf 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.300
 in short, so let's start now what 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.909
 let's make 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.350
 we see the dry bread we have 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:08.000
 grated it poses toe we are here 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.630
 let's see what I want and soften a little 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.049
 using a little vegetable broth 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:19.219
 glass so fine at a time 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:21.350
 I would say that this can go at this point 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:28.520
 that if admit the meat in immediately 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:33.140
 favor of room always to amalgamate the 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.759
 first two ingredients well said 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.109
 meatballs with walnuts so let's take the 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.909
 we have it 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:44.119
 no unique for 800 then eat them become 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.770
 60 then no longer feel taxi driver will bring 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:53.030
 I know her knife too well 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.700
 it is not good for the knife for her the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.159
 classic pack is the half moon stuff 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.710
 real home row and all right of her busi 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.289

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:10.580
 quiet and hunting 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:17.330
 no no it should be used like this so-so but 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:33.620

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:38.420
 man or perfect perfect 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.730
 very badly with the passat in at the fair 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.670
 reset not chopped by too much fine because 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:49.129
 it's nice to hear the little piece of 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:53.900
 walnut is still worth a health if it does 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:59.150
 usually goes back with a glass of 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:07.940
 fig here is tired has yes yes we put 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:10.910
 let's say the voices here in my opinion dozens 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:15.769
 there is little harm from that broth 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:25.459

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:28.639

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.130
 thirty pepper 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:07.790
 I would say that here we are therefore in series a 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.790
 to heat the oil and butter 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:22.530
 I would say here it is opposed so 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:28.350
 then let's do this too 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:30.270
 effect well but there fridge did well 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.170

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.170
 we do chain work 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.050
 here is the last one 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.390

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:06.899

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:11.999

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:15.149

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:21.169
 another is fine ok perfect well well 

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:21.169
 I would say that this point 8 we hope
