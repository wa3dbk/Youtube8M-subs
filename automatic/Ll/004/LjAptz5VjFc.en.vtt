00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.670
 It will be the first time since the video very much to the Hello everybody hurtling notice 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:18.750
 This time I will play a free game by trying to take a break 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:20.020
 This time is a game full of tukomi that you have to die within 5 minutes 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.340
 I am careful here 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.930
 Please be careful if you watch it because it is somewhat black 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.930
 I will do it 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.660
 This is all English I can not read with my English ability 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.070
 Because I didn't feel like translating 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.760
 1 run down 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.149
 I think and skip 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.329
 A screen for selecting clothes came out 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:52.750
 Surprisingly it's there is a kind Well 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:57.610
 I don't care if I wear clothes to commit suicide 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:01.510
 I'm the type that I get lost in such a situation 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.860
 For some reason only two types can not be selected 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.870
 Well How can good 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:12.860
 This is what the pants are all the same color as the pants 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:17.260
 Make the shirt light blue and red tie 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.260
 Then I will do with this dress 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:29.520
 There are several kinds of stages in this game, but this time I made it to the airport 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:32.909
 Since everything else is English, I have checked in advance the operation method etc. 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:40.759
 And do we have a deal to say now door 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.759
 The word I understood was a line or so I lost my English ability. 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:53.030
 That's all for me 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:02:01.630
 Now it 's a production from here , but cause various events and damage yourself 5 minutes 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:01.630
 It seems to be successful if you can go to Nam Nam within the first time you go from this fat person 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.280
 What 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.250
 this is 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.400
 Ittaa to Oh 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.510
 Such a feeling reduces life 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.850
 6% less so now 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.510
 I will die immediately 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.230
 Next I do something like a conveyor belt 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.230
 goo 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.670
 This person will die normally now 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.380
 There is considerable vitality this 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.080
 How about the electric bulletin board 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:49.300
 It did is still bite 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:52.620
 Let's do more and more because Motamota are you doing when the time will come 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.620
 I have a car 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:05.970
 I'm sorry for those who are in the bathroom why there is a car here 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:09.890
 Something is slightly reddish 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.890
 This door is one way allowed 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.900
 Do you keep doing one more time 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:25.580
 Even so, the house is it amazing 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.580
 The back may be a drop in such a place 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.720
 Hmmm 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:37.220
 There is no reason- 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:43.930
 I knew about it, but as a result I have to thank those people 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.930
 I will go to another room if I love you 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.939
 It does not change so much 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.939
 What 's this 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.290
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.379
 Is this opportunity a de s 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:07.280
 No chance that the opportunity will be rebelled 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:07.280
 It seems that science has progressed, is there something really weird and why do you use it there? 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.170
 Doubled 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.269
 I'm sorry here 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.070
 What a farmer 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.019
 Are you attacking English again ? 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.190
 Hmmm 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.190
 Somehow middle 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.410
 What kind of trouble was it? 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.560
 That kind of thing came out 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.560
 What the hell was that 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.370
 I said and had to come back 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.630

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.020
 Contact What do interesting likely thing Oh 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.020
 You must not do it 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:08.980
 It's going to fall from above, it's like being there for suicide 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:13.110
 I do not anything else 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.110
 I will go to another floor again 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.610
 That's the first place here 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:26.500
 Moreover, on the other hand I came out from the place of traffic 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:31.230

 That 's not true- 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.350
 There was a door 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.490
