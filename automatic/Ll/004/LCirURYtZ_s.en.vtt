move come back cross your arms alright
so<00:02:05.270> let's<00:02:05.479> try<00:02:05.630> that<00:02:05.689> from<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.079> beginning<00:02:06.140> we

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
so let's try that from the beginning we

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.640 
so let's try that from the beginning we
go<00:02:06.890> one<00:02:07.280> two<00:02:08.170> back<00:02:09.170> cross<00:02:09.709> arms<00:02:10.660> okay<00:02:11.660> last

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
go one two back cross arms okay last

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.089 
go one two back cross arms okay last
time<00:02:12.799> here<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.700> step<00:02:17.120> okay<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.470> that's<00:02:18.739> pretty

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
time here and step okay so that's pretty

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.930 
time here and step okay so that's pretty
well<00:02:19.849> it<00:02:20.180> would<00:02:20.750> be<00:02:20.780> avoid<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:22.040> step<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.910> let's

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
well it would be avoid to step so let's
