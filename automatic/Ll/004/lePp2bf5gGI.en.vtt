upgrading<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.209> greater<00:03:21.570> Spyre<00:03:21.900> finally<00:03:22.530> but

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
upgrading to a greater Spyre finally but

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.280 
upgrading to a greater Spyre finally but
will<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.370> be<00:03:23.519> in<00:03:23.549> time<00:03:23.970> brood<00:03:24.360> lords<00:03:24.720> really

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
will it be in time brood lords really

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.229 
will it be in time brood lords really
really<00:03:25.590> needed<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.890> come<00:03:26.130> in<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.400> now<00:03:26.670> causing

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
really needed to come in and now causing
