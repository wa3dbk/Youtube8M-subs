00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
really sure why he said that I mean he's

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.590 
really sure why he said that I mean he's
always<00:01:13.470> had<00:01:13.860> an<00:01:14.100> idea<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.970> how<00:01:15.210> many<00:01:15.270> episodes

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
always had an idea of how many episodes

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.330 
always had an idea of how many episodes
he<00:01:15.900> wants<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.439> pretty<00:01:16.740> much<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.009> scripts

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
he wants and pretty much the scripts

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.770 
he wants and pretty much the scripts
before<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.450> show<00:01:18.659> started<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:20.630> saying<00:01:21.630> this

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
before the show started so saying this

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390 
before the show started so saying this
is<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.080> second<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.530> last<00:01:22.710> season<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> seems

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
is the second and last season it seems

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.469 
is the second and last season it seems
kind<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.640> odd<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.119> mean<00:01:24.299> they'll

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
kind of odd to be I mean they'll

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.870 
kind of odd to be I mean they'll
probably<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.930> there<00:01:25.229> probably<00:01:26.100> more<00:01:26.250> episodes

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
probably be there probably more episodes

probably be there probably more episodes
in<00:01:27.030> season<00:01:27.420> 2<00:01:27.600> than<00:01:27.780> season<00:01:28.140> 1<00:01:28.320> anyway<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.090> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
