 Swedish striker saw him from the podium 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.419

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:10.529
 with a sense of accomplishment 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.579
 Alexander Ovechkin leaves arena Mytishchi 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.529
 Atlanta his efforts overthrown this also 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.369
 reinforcements dynamo ovechkin managed 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.240
 organize 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.810
 niklas backstrom long-term partner 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.970
 Alexander Polushin who goes with 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.490
 the team to leave in a good mood he 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.200
 just saw what a strong club 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.939
 he usually got 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.800
 ovechkin was good 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.710
 what else did not do in Russia 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.960
 player atlanta otsubo crushing power 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.630
 receiving Alexander merchants 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.360
 and now it was to go 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.360
 ovechkin showed big 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.200
 supposed to call me several times 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.819
 dynamo and believe me without thinking twice 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:50.439
 our talks took about two weeks glad 

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:53.039
 I can play the rules I am proud of what is not 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.660
 wanted to see this team have to think 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.870
 so if you yourself become strong 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.389
 dynamo 

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:00.059
 here's a plan to hand on heart was 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.810
 few chances 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.760
 and in the attack did not work at all 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.760
 in many ways the Dynamo themselves brought 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.710
 but found and disappeared 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.560
 ioffe constantin 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.470
 wolves have distinguished 4 1 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.630
 who will rival dynamo when else 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.270
 to play easy for yourself 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.380
 imagine 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.510
 better ask me 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.640
 for example for rendering medical and 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.240
 of birth 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.770
 in the general group 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.160
 of course i think that 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.680
 put in place in the world cup and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.680
 washington for five years 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.060
 we just go backstrom registered in 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.720
 dynamo then she comes 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.870
 conflicting information can all 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.070
 end at all 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.640
 the city though offers which 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.420
 put forward x trail players are not satisfied 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 there are many nuances here immersed 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.680
 today i announce the time and place of it 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.840
 I do not remember, we can tell our estimates 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.010
 market including train station how can 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.990
 all can happen because complaints 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.380
 now say let's take a look 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.180
 brought to five years 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.080
 with them we are often nationalist 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.290
 we have a large part of all that rubles 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.889
 minus 5 to minus 50 degrees 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.439
 confession involved listening to it would 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.849
 explain it 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.499
 in ourselves it turns out happily 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.899
 we are certainly not something that was voices and 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:24.899
 kept going 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.269
 although accurate prices
