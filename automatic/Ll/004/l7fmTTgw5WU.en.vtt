but on battlefield 3 no problem piece of
cake<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.330> even<00:01:24.869> it'll<00:01:25.259> even<00:01:25.439> jump<00:01:25.740> up<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.009> 90

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280

frames<00:01:26.430> per<00:01:26.610> second<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.299> game<00:01:27.479> for

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
frames per second but on this game for

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.179 
frames per second but on this game for
some<00:01:27.869> reason<00:01:28.229> i<00:01:28.320> guess<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> Frostbite<00:01:29.159> 3

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
some reason i guess the Frostbite 3

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.330 
some reason i guess the Frostbite 3
engine<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.030> kind<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.450> meh<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:32.689> it<00:01:34.040> has<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
engine is just kind of meh so it has a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.300 
engine is just kind of meh so it has a
hard<00:01:35.610> time<00:01:35.640> keeping<00:01:36.060> up<00:01:36.150> with<00:01:36.299> that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
hard time keeping up with that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.240 
hard time keeping up with that
which<00:01:39.180> was<00:01:39.479> really<00:01:39.689> surprising<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.350> me<00:01:40.530> but

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
which was really surprising to me but

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.580 
which was really surprising to me but
let's<00:01:41.610> see<00:01:42.110> um<00:01:43.939> it<00:01:44.939> was<00:01:45.030> surprising<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.509> me<00:01:45.720> but

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
let's see um it was surprising to me but

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.100 
let's see um it was surprising to me but
I<00:01:46.890> think<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.509> all<00:01:48.659> right<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.079> know

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
I think I think it's all right you know

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.529 
I think I think it's all right you know
it<00:01:49.740> depends<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.340> what<00:01:50.520> map<00:01:50.700> you're<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.240> it

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
it depends on what map you're on it

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.210 
it depends on what map you're on it
depends<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:51.990> what<00:01:52.200> direction<00:01:52.560> you're<00:01:52.829> looking

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
depends on what direction you're looking

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.580 
depends on what direction you're looking
in<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:53.610> usual<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.929> can<00:01:55.020> see<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.350> game

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
in as usual but as you can see this game

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.859 
in as usual but as you can see this game
is<00:01:55.830> beautiful<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.179> absolutely<00:01:57.780> beautiful
