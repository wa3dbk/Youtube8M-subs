00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.970
 exceeded

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.799
 promised 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.660
 I have a little one again 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.890
 a challenger like you 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.509
 you might have noticed if you 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.640
 already in our videos Wahlerfolgs 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.800
 I love such challenges when 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.640
 occasion is not the following 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.550
 Visit from our friend heike and there 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.379
 we have a lot of work to do in it 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.030
 a next time such a few exciting 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.070
 we are planning a small project 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.540
 start co-operation while, however 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.100
 not yet revealed at this point 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.570
 but you can already sometimes if you 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.129
 you do not know now is the link to 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.730
 look over her blog 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.870
 how to do a really small thing and there 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.000
 we need a lot of time as I said 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.109
 for and have thought okay like 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.789
 can we do that we can do that 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.730
 to get things done 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.550
 we just need our sleep 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.570
 can perfect rhythm and indeed 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.009
 thought it now we are doing now 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.619
 just sheriff as long as she is there 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.320
 one and a half weeks every day in bed 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.060
 get up every day six o'clock because there 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.020
 is mine, I notice that too when I am 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.390
 go to bed early 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.429
 I'm so fit and up 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.600
 feel around me and now easy 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.209
 A fine thing you can do in the morning 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.069
 productive start the day and that is 

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:29.050
 just super good so yesterday it has 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.420
 but not quite worked out yet 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.800
 we try hard as I believe mine 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.780
 and slept at 11pm 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.849
 this morning he now has 36 of the alarm clock 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.940
 the bell rings and it is already 

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:42.520
 super good so a 36 directly 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.220
 then quickly rose outside round 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.840
 he went knocked out 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.190
 exercise and I am high among the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.759
 shower first the duration for electricity 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.259
 Water is not always good 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.849
 no matter what he does water drink it 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.709
 a fine thing in the morning always one to one 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:58.539
 5 liters of water you have you super this 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.060
 because we have now I want now 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.770
 no advertising but ours 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.079
 little new baby has as 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.520
 ordered penultimate of ak water filters 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.630
 beforehand one of the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.030
 unfortunately somehow collects such a collection 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.679
 9 was broken and me 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.599
 I am happy and still training 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.769
 rather water than before and anyway 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.360
 have that shortly after eight 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.160
 usually provides around the time only 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.720
 on and already said so much 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.300
 made then start right in the day 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.040
 can be equally productive a fine 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.810
 thing i feel super super good me 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.230
 think that's just a tree way 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.209
 feeling if you have already got up 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.709
 you can already start it already 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.959
 can be productive if normally 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.310
 the whole world just sleeps me 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.700
 love it because it's just that 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.049
 quiet and you feel it's just 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.720
 a wonderful feeling i like that totally 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.430
 a normal sleep rhythm was before 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.250
 actually always from zero to eight 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.900
 Clock is actually always saying on the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.030
 Paper pretty much two years later 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.500
 to get up but two hours later 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.630
 it makes a total difference then 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.880
 there are these magic rules as 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.769
 if you vote this from 2 20 to 2 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.519
 Do not live these four hours over 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.870
 that count almost double means if 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.160
 you really stop in midnight 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.480
 bed then you feel in the morning 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.560
 rested a lot even if you are me 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.359
 then set up what is actually a 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.980
 cool everyone knows when you're at 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.690
 weekend was somehow still gone and 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.280
 then you go sometime to two or 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.590
 three expats and then actually can 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.600
 Sleep is when you want until noon 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.170
 sleeps until twelve or something opens up 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.359
 and feels still so and whacked 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.519
 and Hartmann 2 and wii ten hours 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.739
 slept but not really recovered 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.380
 once these important four hours from 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.370
 22-2 hours did not sleep so 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.790
 today is the first day of us 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.470
 to adjust 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.760
 i feel so good i can only help them 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.950
 recommend to try it out first 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.000
 really try 22 and worth considering 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.950
 and close your eyes 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.060
 it's just a fine thing 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.590
 it seems that you are through 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.670
 forced the job or so already 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.700
 had long stand is 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.630
 probably yes 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.690
 but for all others i can only 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.820
 recommend it is tried if times 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.450
 It will not quite make it from 23 to 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.560
 7 o'clock is super good, too 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.200
 dives a bit he inspections 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.750
 Getting up a little earlier is great 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.790
 So I want to emphasize that again 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.010
 Nourishment is about that, that's what it's all about here 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.510
 all nutrition is a super 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.880
 important thing but there are still 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.000
 other things in life are very, very, very 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.100
 important are limp movement that one 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.209
 Things you do that makes you do that 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.750
 you deal with people and always gives 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.520
 likes 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.550
 There are so many different things 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.960
 are simply important for a 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.920
 happy and contented life there 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.840
 I can only recommend you 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.190
 I do not care so much about them 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.840
 Diet works is important but it 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.550
 there are others there are others 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.890
 other areas of life around oneself 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.780
 should take care of and if you say so now 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.980
 fans good that we also have a video 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.630

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.120
 directly and to do our climate raw food 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.320

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.880
 above, we would be glad if you say 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.560
 that is nonsense in the future 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.120
 Recipes and so on hear that 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.340

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:00.080
