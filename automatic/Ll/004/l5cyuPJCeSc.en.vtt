because I just made up like a 12 minute
video<00:00:09.769> so<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:11.099> just<00:00:11.400> wanted<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.759> make<00:00:11.910> something

quick<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.719> my<00:00:15.719> bobble<00:00:16.230> water

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.029 
quick this is a my bobble water
filtration<00:00:17.400> bottle<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.690> got<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.289> at<00:00:19.470> Target<00:00:19.500> I

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
filtration bottle I got this at Target I

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.590 
filtration bottle I got this at Target I
think<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.310> was<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.520> clearance<00:00:20.880> at<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.119> time<00:00:21.359> I

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
think it was on clearance at the time I

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.519 
think it was on clearance at the time I
think<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.170> paid<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.439> 8<00:00:22.619> bucks<00:00:22.800> for<00:00:23.100> it

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
think I paid like 8 bucks for it

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.890 
think I paid like 8 bucks for it
what<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.650> has<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.900> activated

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
what it has in it is just a activated

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.650 
what it has in it is just a activated
carbon<00:00:28.320> filter<00:00:28.650> at<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.800> top<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.340> think<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.449> is

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
carbon filter at the top I think this is

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.630 
carbon filter at the top I think this is
like<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.900> 1<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.289> 1/2<00:00:31.380> liter<00:00:31.830> from<00:00:32.399> that

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
like a 1 and 1/2 liter from that

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.510 
like a 1 and 1/2 liter from that
mistaken<00:00:33.149> or<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:33.510> liter<00:00:33.690> bottle<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:35.309> was

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
mistaken or a one liter bottle it was

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.810 
mistaken or a one liter bottle it was
the<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.700> large<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.660> they<00:00:36.780> had<00:00:37.820> it's

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the the large one that they had it's

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.729 
the the large one that they had it's
made<00:00:39.030> out<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.210> decent<00:00:40.020> plastic<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:40.590> it's

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
made out of decent plastic but it's

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.660 
made out of decent plastic but it's
squeezable<00:00:41.629> it<00:00:42.629> has<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> top<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:44.010> closes<00:00:44.460> and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
squeezable it has a top that closes and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.930 
squeezable it has a top that closes and
doesn't<00:00:45.059> leak<00:00:45.239> which<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.289> good<00:00:46.700> it<00:00:47.700> had<00:00:47.910> a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
doesn't leak which is good it had a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.850 
doesn't leak which is good it had a
cover<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.989> cover<00:00:49.230> actually<00:00:49.440> broke

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
cover on it but the cover actually broke

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.220 
cover on it but the cover actually broke
so<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> can't<00:00:50.940> say<00:00:51.120> much<00:00:51.270> for<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.539> cover<00:00:51.780> it's

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
so I can't say much for the cover it's

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.430 
so I can't say much for the cover it's
just<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.559> little<00:00:52.829> clear<00:00:53.280> plastic<00:00:53.550> dome<00:00:54.440> didn't

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
just a little clear plastic dome didn't

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.529 
just a little clear plastic dome didn't
really<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.739> anything<00:00:56.010> besides<00:00:56.550> keep<00:00:57.090> dust<00:00:57.360> off

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
really do anything besides keep dust off

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
really do anything besides keep dust off
it<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.750> guess<00:00:58.760> but<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.449> was<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
it I guess but it was just it was just a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.170 
it I guess but it was just it was just a
plastic<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:02.340> had<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> seam<00:01:02.789> down<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.059> middle

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
plastic it had a seam down the middle

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.270 
plastic it had a seam down the middle
and<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.870> guess<00:01:04.140> putting<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.650> over<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.070> over

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
and I guess putting it on over and over

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.120 
and I guess putting it on over and over
and<00:01:05.369> over<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.540> ended<00:01:06.960> up<00:01:07.049> cracking<00:01:07.350> so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
and over it I just ended up cracking so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.920 
and over it I just ended up cracking so
it<00:01:08.250> cracked<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.420> doesn't<00:01:09.600> stay<00:01:09.900> on

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it cracked and it just doesn't stay on

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.469 
it cracked and it just doesn't stay on
anymore<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> floppy<00:01:11.580> cover<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.420> I

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
anymore so it's like a floppy cover so I

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.960 
anymore so it's like a floppy cover so I
don't<00:01:12.659> use<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.650> um<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.369> unscrews

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
don't use it but um it just unscrews

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.270 
don't use it but um it just unscrews
right<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.229> fill<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.979> up<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.250> a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
right here so just fill it up like a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.070 
right here so just fill it up like a
normal<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.210> soda<00:01:21.509> bottle<00:01:21.720> like

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
normal it's like it's a soda bottle like

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.999 
normal it's like it's a soda bottle like
a<00:01:22.110> large<00:01:22.409> soda<00:01:22.619> both<00:01:22.830> size<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:24.710> this<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
a large soda both size and this is the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.830 
a large soda both size and this is the
filter<00:01:26.369> now<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> filter<00:01:27.119> doesn't<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.689> any

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
filter now the filter doesn't have any

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.300 
filter now the filter doesn't have any
replaceable<00:01:28.409> parts<00:01:28.710> or<00:01:28.829> anything<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.250> that

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
replaceable parts or anything like that

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.690 
replaceable parts or anything like that
I've<00:01:29.759> seen<00:01:30.299> these<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:31.560> sale<00:01:31.890> separate

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
I've seen these for sale separate

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.940 
I've seen these for sale separate
without<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.329> bottle<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
without the bottle so you can get the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.819 
without the bottle so you can get the
replacements<00:01:35.600> but<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.689> just<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.380> know<00:01:37.439> still

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
replacements but you just you know still

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.390 
replacements but you just you know still
it<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.100> water<00:01:38.430> screw<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.310> it's<00:01:41.310> ready

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
it up water screw it on and it's ready

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
it up water screw it on and it's ready
to<00:01:41.520> go

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
to go

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.899 
to go
if<00:01:42.810> basically<00:01:43.320> filters<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.340> way<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:44.640> and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
if basically filters on the way out and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.710 
if basically filters on the way out and
not<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> way<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:46.860> does<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.000> very<00:01:48.299> slow

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
not the way in it does it's a very slow

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.560 
not the way in it does it's a very slow
pour<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:50.070> obviously<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.180> leaking<00:01:51.390> at

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
pour so obviously it's not leaking at

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.520 
pour so obviously it's not leaking at
all<00:01:51.689> right<00:01:51.869> now<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:53.009> get<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.430> pour

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
all right now but to get it to pour

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.980 
all right now but to get it to pour
that's<00:01:55.530> about<00:01:55.710> as<00:01:55.860> fast<00:01:56.250> as<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:57.119> goes<00:01:57.149> right

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
that's about as fast as it goes right

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.730 
that's about as fast as it goes right
there

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
there

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.310 
there
of<00:01:59.130> course<00:01:59.430> when<00:01:59.820> you're<00:02:00.060> doing<00:02:00.390> water

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
of course when you're doing water

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.260 
of course when you're doing water
filters<00:02:01.740> any<00:02:02.460> type<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.700> water<00:02:02.939> filtration

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
filters any type of water filtration

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.560 
filters any type of water filtration
system<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.140> more<00:02:04.969> contact<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.119> water<00:02:06.329> has

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
system the more contact the water has

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.109 
system the more contact the water has
with<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.140> filtration<00:02:07.560> medium<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:08.910> you're

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
with the filtration medium if you're

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.699 
with the filtration medium if you're
using<00:02:09.239> carbon<00:02:09.810> or<00:02:10.050> different<00:02:10.410> types<00:02:10.560> of

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
using carbon or different types of

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.559 
using carbon or different types of
filters<00:02:10.890> ceramic<00:02:11.819> filters<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.300> stuff<00:02:12.360> like

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
filters ceramic filters and stuff like

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.340 
filters ceramic filters and stuff like
that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
that

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.250 
that
more<00:02:13.530> contact<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.190> better<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.970> are<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.990> the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
more contact the better you are so the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.920 
more contact the better you are so the
slower<00:02:16.860> poor<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.340> definitely<00:02:17.820> what<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.690> want

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
slower poor is definitely what you want

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.730 
slower poor is definitely what you want
to<00:02:19.260> filter<00:02:19.740> out<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.040> most<00:02:20.250> contaminants

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
to filter out the most contaminants

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.610 
to filter out the most contaminants
activated<00:02:22.740> carbon<00:02:23.420> filters<00:02:24.420> out<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.840> decent

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
activated carbon filters out a decent

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.130 
activated carbon filters out a decent
amount<00:02:25.680> I'm<00:02:26.180> not<00:02:27.180> sure<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.720> think<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:28.020> might

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
amount I'm not sure I think it might

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.360 
amount I'm not sure I think it might
even<00:02:28.170> be<00:02:28.470> up<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.710> 90%<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.960> like<00:02:30.960> solids<00:02:31.440> of

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
even be up to 90% of like solids of

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.360 
even be up to 90% of like solids of
course<00:02:32.670> there<00:02:33.480> are<00:02:33.510> some<00:02:34.100> bacterias<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.220> get

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
course there are some bacterias that get

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.430 
course there are some bacterias that get
their<00:02:35.520> carbon<00:02:35.910> for<00:02:36.690> anything<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.140> you

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
their carbon for anything like that you

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.520 
their carbon for anything like that you
would<00:02:37.920> want<00:02:38.130> um<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:39.000> know<00:02:39.090> more<00:02:39.510> stages<00:02:39.780> maybe

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
would want um you know more stages maybe

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.730 
would want um you know more stages maybe
a<00:02:40.880> four<00:02:41.880> stage<00:02:42.120> or<00:02:42.330> five<00:02:42.540> stage<00:02:42.840> if<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.560> want

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
a four stage or five stage if you want

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
a four stage or five stage if you want
really<00:02:44.640> pure<00:02:45.090> clean<00:02:45.330> water<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:46.160> use<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.400> five

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
really pure clean water I use a five

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.840 
really pure clean water I use a five
stage<00:02:48.320> deionized<00:02:49.320> water<00:02:49.620> filtration<00:02:50.250> system

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
stage deionized water filtration system

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.490 
stage deionized water filtration system
for<00:02:53.000> like<00:02:54.000> drinking<00:02:54.780> water<00:02:54.990> or<00:02:55.230> anything

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
for like drinking water or anything

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.950 
for like drinking water or anything
that's<00:02:55.770> uh<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.150> want<00:02:57.330> super<00:02:57.660> pure

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
that's uh that you want super pure

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.740 
that's uh that you want super pure
pretty<00:02:58.830> much<00:02:58.950> filters<00:02:59.310> everything<00:02:59.700> out<00:02:59.850> kind

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
pretty much filters everything out kind

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.980 
pretty much filters everything out kind
of<00:03:00.780> like<00:03:00.930> distilled<00:03:02.210> but<00:03:03.210> this<00:03:03.480> system<00:03:03.630> works

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
of like distilled but this system works

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.010 
of like distilled but this system works
great<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.410> think<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:05.430> works<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.940> doesn't<00:03:06.810> keep

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
great I think it works it doesn't keep

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.390 
great I think it works it doesn't keep
the<00:03:07.200> cold<00:03:07.440> or<00:03:07.620> anything<00:03:07.770> like<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:08.370> not

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
the cold or anything like that it's not

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.580 
the cold or anything like that it's not
insulated<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:09.540> just<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.960> you<00:03:10.260> know<00:03:10.350> plastic

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
insulated it's just a you know plastic

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.590 
insulated it's just a you know plastic
bottle<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.220> fill<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.520> up<00:03:11.580> cold<00:03:11.940> water<00:03:12.150> warm

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
bottle you fill it up cold water warm

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.630 
bottle you fill it up cold water warm
like<00:03:12.840> if<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.350> want<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.560> drink<00:03:13.680> warm<00:03:13.860> water<00:03:13.950> but

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
like if you want to drink warm water but

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.810 
like if you want to drink warm water but
you<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.210> fill<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.510> up<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.840> drink<00:03:16.320> as<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.560> go

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
you just fill it up and drink as you go

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.360 
you just fill it up and drink as you go
and<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.930> taste<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:19.350> fine<00:03:19.560> tastes<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.160> water

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
and the taste is fine tastes like water

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.680 
and the taste is fine tastes like water
nothing<00:03:21.060> spectacular<00:03:21.810> nothing<00:03:22.680> horrible

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
nothing spectacular nothing horrible

nothing spectacular nothing horrible
just<00:03:24.690> plain<00:03:24.960> all<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.140> drinking<00:03:25.380> water<00:03:25.530> but

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
just plain all the drinking water but

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.640 
just plain all the drinking water but
other<00:03:26.790> than<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:27.660> said<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.170> think<00:03:28.260> it's

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
other than that like I said I think it's

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.510 
other than that like I said I think it's
it's<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.490> great<00:03:29.640> bottle<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.960> uh<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:32.160> does<00:03:32.370> its

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
it's a great bottle it uh it does its

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.710 
it's a great bottle it uh it does its
job<00:03:32.550> as<00:03:33.000> far<00:03:33.210> as<00:03:33.330> I'm<00:03:33.450> concerned<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:35.720> bobble

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720
