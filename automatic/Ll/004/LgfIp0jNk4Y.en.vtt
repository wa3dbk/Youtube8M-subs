size of it and and the price you know
they're<00:00:43.890> virtually<00:00:44.489> identical<00:00:44.809> let's<00:00:45.809> do

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
they're virtually identical let's do

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.510 
they're virtually identical let's do
spec-wise<00:00:46.770> they're<00:00:47.129> virtually<00:00:47.370> identical

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520

you<00:00:48.329> know<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:49.079> only<00:00:49.170> difference<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
you know the only difference is the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.819 
you know the only difference is the

light really really thin in the Nexus 5
is<00:01:42.180> then<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.570> think<00:01:42.960> they're<00:01:43.079> even<00:01:43.259> fit<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
is then I think they're even fit in the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.399 
is then I think they're even fit in the
next<00:01:43.950> five<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.520> which<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.729> pretty<00:01:44.970> impressive

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
next five so which is pretty impressive

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.560 
next five so which is pretty impressive
so<00:01:46.409> I'm<00:01:46.439> getting<00:01:46.770> into<00:01:46.890> specs<00:01:47.310> once<00:01:48.240> again<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
so I'm getting into specs once again the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.330 
so I'm getting into specs once again the
only<00:01:48.659> difference<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.560> screen<00:01:49.799> size<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
only difference is the screen size and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.999 
only difference is the screen size and
the<00:01:50.700> screen<00:01:50.939> resolution<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.470> iphone<00:01:52.770> 6<00:01:52.950> is

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the screen resolution so the iphone 6 is

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.420

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.300 
us and overall as you can see these
phones<00:04:24.200> are<00:04:24.290> called<00:04:24.440> absolutely<00:04:25.190> identical

phones are called absolutely identical

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.160 
phones are called absolutely identical
other<00:04:25.970> than<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.300> fact<00:04:26.450> that<00:04:26.630> one<00:04:26.840> is<00:04:26.990> bigger

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
other than the fact that one is bigger

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.460 
other than the fact that one is bigger
than<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.410> other<00:04:27.670> so<00:04:28.670> I<00:04:28.910> mean<00:04:29.120> I<00:04:29.390> guess<00:04:30.230> it's

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
than the other so I mean I guess it's

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.900
