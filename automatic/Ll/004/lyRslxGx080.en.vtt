smoothly<00:02:04.920> with<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.460> perfect<00:02:05.850> detail<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.570> it

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
smoothly with the perfect detail that it

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.300 
smoothly with the perfect detail that it
just<00:02:06.869> does<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.860> almost<00:02:07.979> seems<00:02:08.250> like

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
just does it it almost seems like

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.190 
just does it it almost seems like
cheating<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.300> throw<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.569> spring<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.080> there

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
cheating to just throw a spring in there

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.080 
cheating to just throw a spring in there
so<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.500> way<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.400> almost<00:02:11.580> seems<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:11.910> you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
so that way it almost seems like you

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.760 
so that way it almost seems like you
don't<00:02:12.239> have<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.420> worry<00:02:12.750> about

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
don't have to worry about

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.970 
don't have to worry about
making<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.460> super<00:02:14.730> nice<00:02:15.300> because<00:02:15.930> as<00:02:16.680> long<00:02:16.860> as

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
making it super nice because as long as

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.530 
making it super nice because as long as
you<00:02:17.070> throw<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> spring<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.700> there<00:02:17.880> it'll<00:02:18.060> flick

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
you throw a spring in there it'll flick

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.270 
you throw a spring in there it'll flick
open<00:02:18.900> even<00:02:19.560> though<00:02:19.650> that's<00:02:19.830> not<00:02:19.920> really<00:02:20.190> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
open even though that's not really the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.800 
open even though that's not really the
case<00:02:20.310> with<00:02:20.700> these<00:02:20.910> because<00:02:21.210> they're<00:02:21.480> all<00:02:21.600> done

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
case with these because they're all done

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.690 
case with these because they're all done
very<00:02:21.840> well<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.950> removed<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.460> speed

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
very well I have removed the speed

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.500 
very well I have removed the speed
assist<00:02:24.060> from<00:02:25.160> 350<00:02:26.160> in<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.400> past<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.000> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
assist from 350 in the past and it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
assist from 350 in the past and it
flipped<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:28.020> fine<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.170> doesn't<00:02:31.500> really

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
flipped just fine so that doesn't really

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.380 
flipped just fine so that doesn't really
hold<00:02:31.770> true<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.130> these<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.670> I'm<00:02:32.940> just<00:02:33.180> saying

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
hold true to these but I'm just saying

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.600 
hold true to these but I'm just saying
that<00:02:33.480> maybe<00:02:33.630> that's<00:02:34.020> why<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.650> kind<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.400> didn't

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
that maybe that's why I kind of didn't

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.640 
that maybe that's why I kind of didn't
like<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:36.000> but<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.540> am<00:02:36.690> starting<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.170> like<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.530> and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
like it but I am starting to like it and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.470 
like it but I am starting to like it and
one<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.950> benefits<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.880> speed<00:02:39.120> assist

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
one of the benefits of the speed assist

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.600 
one of the benefits of the speed assist
is<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:40.110> if<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.350> mechanism<00:02:40.950> breaks<00:02:41.190> you

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
is that if the mechanism breaks you

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.810 
is that if the mechanism breaks you
still<00:02:41.880> have<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.480> mostly<00:02:42.960> functional<00:02:43.290> knife

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
still have a mostly functional knife

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.560 
still have a mostly functional knife
particularly<00:02:44.820> in<00:02:44.940> these<00:02:45.060> versions<00:02:45.300> you

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
particularly in these versions you

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.030 
particularly in these versions you
pretty<00:02:45.780> much<00:02:45.840> basically<00:02:46.170> have<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> manual

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
pretty much basically have a manual

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.220 
pretty much basically have a manual
knife<00:02:47.310> with<00:02:48.210> this<00:02:48.360> one<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.600> have<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.900> manual

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
knife with this one you have a manual

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.780 
knife with this one you have a manual
knife<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:51.710> you<00:02:52.710> know<00:02:52.800> may<00:02:53.040> not<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> d-10

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
knife that you know may not have a d-10

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.430 
knife that you know may not have a d-10
but<00:02:54.030> it'll<00:02:54.270> still<00:02:54.450> work<00:02:54.480> for<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.900> with<00:02:55.320> an

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
but it'll still work for you with an

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.130 
but it'll still work for you with an
automatic<00:02:55.800> knife<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.460> spring<00:02:56.790> breaks<00:02:57.140> it's

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
automatic knife that spring breaks it's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.000 
automatic knife that spring breaks it's
a<00:02:58.230> lot<00:02:58.500> less<00:02:59.280> usable<00:02:59.640> you<00:03:00.600> still<00:03:00.840> can<00:03:01.140> but<00:03:01.800> it's

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
a lot less usable you still can but it's

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.610 
a lot less usable you still can but it's
a<00:03:02.100> lot<00:03:02.280> less<00:03:02.430> usable<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.260> won't<00:03:04.410> function

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
a lot less usable and it won't function

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.000 
a lot less usable and it won't function
quite<00:03:05.010> as<00:03:05.250> well<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:06.510> has<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.320> then<00:03:07.470> also<00:03:07.650> if

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
quite as well it has and then also if

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.340 
quite as well it has and then also if
your<00:03:08.250> spring<00:03:08.670> for<00:03:09.240> your<00:03:09.390> lock<00:03:09.570> mechanism<00:03:10.200> your

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
your spring for your lock mechanism your

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.230 
your spring for your lock mechanism your
button<00:03:10.680> lock<00:03:10.890> were<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.460> fail<00:03:11.670> then<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.060> really

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
button lock were to fail then you really

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.000 
button lock were to fail then you really
ought<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.510> look<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:13.110> can't<00:03:13.350> do<00:03:13.500> anything<00:03:13.740> with

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
ought to look you can't do anything with

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.220 
ought to look you can't do anything with
that<00:03:14.040> night<00:03:14.510> whereas<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.690> uses<00:03:16.200> a

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
that night whereas this uses a

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.210 
that night whereas this uses a
traditional<00:03:16.890> manual<00:03:17.310> locking<00:03:17.880> system<00:03:18.300> and

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
traditional manual locking system and

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.340 
traditional manual locking system and
mechanics<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.490> yet<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.360> just<00:03:21.420> has<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.870> spring

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
mechanics and yet it just has a spring

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.640 
mechanics and yet it just has a spring
in<00:03:22.530> there<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:23.220> assists<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.270> opening<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.530> if

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
in there that assists the opening so if

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.560 
in there that assists the opening so if
it<00:03:25.770> were<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:25.980> break<00:03:26.190> not<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.910> big<00:03:27.090> deal<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.450> can

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
it were to break not a big deal you can

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.350 
it were to break not a big deal you can
still<00:03:27.780> use<00:03:27.930> your<00:03:28.080> knife<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.670> just<00:03:29.670> order<00:03:30.180> any

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
still use your knife and just order any

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.480 
still use your knife and just order any
spring<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.870> throw<00:03:31.080> it<00:03:31.170> in<00:03:31.290> there<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:32.280> also

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
spring and throw it in there it's also

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.600 
spring and throw it in there it's also
less<00:03:33.180> complicated<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.140> replace<00:03:34.680> Springs<00:03:35.040> than

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
less complicated to replace Springs than

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.240 
less complicated to replace Springs than
it<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:35.820> with<00:03:35.970> an<00:03:36.120> auto<00:03:36.590> you're<00:03:37.590> less<00:03:37.770> likely<00:03:37.800> to

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
it is with an auto you're less likely to

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.370 
it is with an auto you're less likely to
lose<00:03:38.790> parts<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:39.450> have<00:03:39.540> issues<00:03:39.959> if<00:03:40.110> you<00:03:40.200> take

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
lose parts and have issues if you take

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.100 
lose parts and have issues if you take
it<00:03:40.530> apart<00:03:41.120> so<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.270> does<00:03:42.450> work<00:03:42.480> quite<00:03:42.660> well<00:03:42.900> so

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
it apart so it does work quite well so

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.890 
it apart so it does work quite well so
like<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:44.100> mentioned<00:03:44.130> before<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.760> am<00:03:45.209> warming<00:03:45.690> up

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
like I mentioned before I am warming up

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.699 
like I mentioned before I am warming up
to<00:03:46.640> speed<00:03:47.640> Isis<00:03:48.020> it's<00:03:49.020> also<00:03:49.170> nice<00:03:49.410> because

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
to speed Isis it's also nice because

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.490 
to speed Isis it's also nice because
whoops<00:03:50.400> hit<00:03:51.150> my<00:03:51.330> tripod<00:03:51.540> there<00:03:51.930> it's<00:03:52.380> also

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
whoops hit my tripod there it's also
