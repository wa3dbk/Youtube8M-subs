00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.760 
I'm saying I thought it offered a lot of
possibilities<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:34.330> I<00:03:34.630> was<00:03:34.840> kind<00:03:35.080> of<00:03:35.140> excited<00:03:35.440> I

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
possibilities so I was kind of excited I

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.530 
possibilities so I was kind of excited I
was<00:03:35.920> pumped<00:03:36.220> for<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.430> beginning<00:03:36.730> but<00:03:37.390> then

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
was pumped for the beginning but then

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.480 
was pumped for the beginning but then
when<00:03:37.990> i<00:03:38.020> was<00:03:38.290> like<00:03:38.470> thinking<00:03:38.650> of<00:03:38.950> things<00:03:39.160> to

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
when i was like thinking of things to

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.670 
when i was like thinking of things to
say<00:03:39.760> in<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.300> review<00:03:40.750> I<00:03:40.959> kind<00:03:41.230> of<00:03:41.290> realized

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
say in this review I kind of realized

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.580 
say in this review I kind of realized
that<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:43.239> was<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.810> only<00:03:43.959> thing<00:03:44.140> I<00:03:44.380> really

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
that that was the only thing I really

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.410 
that that was the only thing I really
liked<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:45.040> middle<00:03:45.430> of<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.640> book<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.150> me<00:03:46.180> it's

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
liked the middle of the book to me it's

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.850 
liked the middle of the book to me it's
just<00:03:46.450> kind<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.780> like<00:03:46.840> this<00:03:47.080> blur<00:03:47.440> I<00:03:47.709> don't

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
just kind of like this blur I don't

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.470 
just kind of like this blur I don't
really<00:03:47.980> feel<00:03:48.070> like<00:03:48.250> anything<00:03:48.790> really

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
really feel like anything really

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.420 
really feel like anything really
happened<00:03:50.260> there<00:03:50.709> were<00:03:50.800> definitely<00:03:51.130> you<00:03:51.310> know

happened there were definitely you know
something<00:03:51.760> events<00:03:52.209> some<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.140> know<00:03:53.820> tension

something events some you know tension

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.180 
something events some you know tension
the<00:03:55.330> trailer<00:03:55.870> or<00:03:56.500> whatever<00:03:56.890> there<00:03:57.130> were

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
the trailer or whatever there were

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.949 
the trailer or whatever there were
definitely<00:03:57.520> some<00:03:57.610> you<00:03:58.030> know<00:03:58.060> things<00:03:58.780> that

definitely some you know things that
happen<00:03:59.530> but<00:03:59.800> for<00:04:00.100> me<00:04:00.220> it<00:04:00.550> just<00:04:00.610> when<00:04:01.480> you

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
happen but for me it just when you

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.750 
happen but for me it just when you
compare<00:04:02.050> what<00:04:02.350> happened<00:04:02.770> in<00:04:03.010> divergent<00:04:03.610> you

compare what happened in divergent you

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.460 
compare what happened in divergent you
know<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:04.000> like<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.150> whole<00:04:04.390> initiation<00:04:04.840> and

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
dying and when you compare that what

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 
what I'm saying a lot happened

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:24.540 
what I'm saying a lot happened
throughout<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.680> first<00:04:23.860> two<00:04:24.009> books<00:04:24.220> in<00:04:24.400> this

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
throughout the first two books in this

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.170 
throughout the first two books in this
series<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:25.270> for<00:04:25.810> me<00:04:26.160> not<00:04:27.160> a<00:04:27.190> lot<00:04:27.520> happened<00:04:27.970> in

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
series and for me not a lot happened in

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.850 
series and for me not a lot happened in
Allegiant<00:04:28.660> like<00:04:28.810> in<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.169> middle<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.680> books

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
Allegiant like in the middle the books

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.570 
Allegiant like in the middle the books
just<00:04:30.009> kind<00:04:30.250> of<00:04:30.340> dragged<00:04:30.669> on<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:31.509> I<00:04:31.870> felt<00:04:32.139> like

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
just kind of dragged on and I felt like

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.370 
just kind of dragged on and I felt like
alternating<00:04:33.580> from<00:04:33.880> Tris<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.330> four<00:04:34.630> point<00:04:35.289> of

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
alternating from Tris and four point of

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.749 
alternating from Tris and four point of
view<00:04:35.530> even<00:04:35.830> though<00:04:35.949> I<00:04:35.979> said<00:04:36.220> I<00:04:36.250> like<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:36.669> in

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
view even though I said I like that in

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.670 
view even though I said I like that in
the<00:04:36.850> beginning<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:37.419> felt<00:04:37.780> like<00:04:38.199> towards<00:04:38.560> the

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
the beginning I felt like towards the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.800 
the beginning I felt like towards the
middle<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:38.979> just<00:04:39.190> helped<00:04:39.699> the<00:04:39.880> book<00:04:40.060> drag<00:04:40.509> on

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
middle that just helped the book drag on

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.170 
middle that just helped the book drag on
a<00:04:40.840> little<00:04:41.259> bit<00:04:41.380> more<00:04:41.560> because<00:04:41.919> honestly<00:04:42.490> the

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
a little bit more because honestly the

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.820 
a little bit more because honestly the
way<00:04:43.300> they<00:04:43.479> speak<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:44.139> their<00:04:44.320> tone<00:04:44.560> of<00:04:44.710> voice

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
way they speak and their tone of voice

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.820 
way they speak and their tone of voice
is<00:04:45.250> just<00:04:45.310> really<00:04:45.970> really<00:04:46.120> similar<00:04:46.539> so<00:04:47.410> it<00:04:47.770> just

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
is just really really similar so it just

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.460 
is just really really similar so it just
didn't<00:04:48.580> really<00:04:48.729> offer<00:04:49.060> a<00:04:49.330> lot<00:04:49.690> of<00:04:49.810> variation

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
didn't really offer a lot of variation

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.439 
didn't really offer a lot of variation
you<00:04:51.190> know<00:04:51.280> sometimes<00:04:51.760> I<00:04:51.910> be<00:04:52.060> reading<00:04:52.389> a

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
you know sometimes I be reading a

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.240 
you know sometimes I be reading a
paragraph<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:53.350> I'd<00:04:53.530> be<00:04:53.740> like<00:04:53.770> who<00:04:54.130> was

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
paragraph and I'd be like who was

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.010 
paragraph and I'd be like who was
talking<00:04:54.760> because<00:04:55.120> they<00:04:55.449> didn't<00:04:55.810> have<00:04:55.840> a

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
talking because they didn't have a

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.779 
talking because they didn't have a
different<00:04:56.530> tone<00:04:56.680> of<00:04:56.860> voice<00:04:57.010> I'd<00:04:57.340> have<00:04:57.520> to<00:04:57.639> look

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
different tone of voice I'd have to look

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.450 
different tone of voice I'd have to look
for<00:04:58.030> a<00:04:58.060> he<00:04:58.419> or<00:04:58.510> she<00:04:58.570> pronoun<00:04:59.289> before<00:05:00.220> I<00:05:00.250> could

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
for a he or she pronoun before I could

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.360 
for a he or she pronoun before I could
like<00:05:00.639> figure<00:05:01.360> out<00:05:01.389> what<00:05:01.870> was<00:05:02.050> going<00:05:02.139> on<00:05:02.560> so<00:05:03.310> to

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
like figure out what was going on so to

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.189 
like figure out what was going on so to
me<00:05:03.639> the<00:05:04.120> middle<00:05:04.510> was<00:05:04.660> just<00:05:04.840> kind<00:05:04.990> of<00:05:05.050> this

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
me the middle was just kind of this

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.529 
me the middle was just kind of this
build-up<00:05:05.650> to<00:05:05.889> this<00:05:06.340> big<00:05:06.610> ending<00:05:07.120> and<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.419> was

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
build-up to this big ending and I was

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.089 
build-up to this big ending and I was
excited<00:05:08.020> for<00:05:08.050> that<00:05:08.289> like<00:05:08.470> i<00:05:08.620> don't<00:05:08.889> i<00:05:09.039> don't

worth it in fact to me the ending was

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.909 
worth it in fact to me the ending was
kind<00:05:15.970> of<00:05:16.030> like<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.210> cop-out<00:05:16.630> I<00:05:16.870> didn't<00:05:17.590> like<00:05:17.740> it

you know with that big cliffhanger and

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.189 
you know with that big cliffhanger and
we<00:05:48.699> were<00:05:48.820> just<00:05:48.849> set<00:05:49.180> up<00:05:49.300> for<00:05:49.330> this<00:05:49.659> big<00:05:49.930> thing

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
we were just set up for this big thing

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.800 
we were just set up for this big thing

to happen in Allegiant and then maybe

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.140 
to happen in Allegiant and then maybe
Veronica<00:05:53.349> Roth<00:05:53.500> kind<00:05:53.860> of<00:05:53.949> realized<00:05:54.250> that<00:05:54.520> she

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
Veronica Roth kind of realized that she

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.730 
Veronica Roth kind of realized that she
didn't<00:05:55.330> have<00:05:55.449> a<00:05:55.479> lot<00:05:55.630> to<00:05:55.780> work<00:05:55.960> with<00:05:55.990> or<00:05:56.530> there

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
didn't have a lot to work with or there

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.950 
didn't have a lot to work with or there
wasn't<00:05:56.889> a<00:05:57.070> lot<00:05:57.220> to<00:05:57.370> do<00:05:57.550> so<00:05:58.270> she<00:05:58.330> just<00:05:58.449> kind<00:05:58.900> of

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
wasn't a lot to do so she just kind of

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.409 
wasn't a lot to do so she just kind of
made<00:05:59.139> this<00:05:59.289> big<00:05:59.470> shock<00:05:59.830> value<00:06:00.130> ending<00:06:00.699> and<00:06:00.940> I

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
made this big shock value ending and I

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.570 
made this big shock value ending and I
just<00:06:01.900> didn't<00:06:02.139> like<00:06:02.260> it<00:06:02.470> like<00:06:02.740> like<00:06:03.250> I<00:06:03.370> said<00:06:03.550> I

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
just didn't like it like like I said I

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.850 
just didn't like it like like I said I
think<00:06:03.820> it<00:06:03.909> was<00:06:04.000> only<00:06:04.180> for<00:06:04.570> shock<00:06:04.810> value<00:06:04.860> there

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
think it was only for shock value there

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.710 
think it was only for shock value there
was<00:06:05.979> definitely<00:06:06.280> some<00:06:06.550> like<00:06:06.789> symbolism<00:06:07.570> and

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
was definitely some like symbolism and

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.480 
was definitely some like symbolism and
emotional<00:06:08.199> meaning<00:06:08.409> behind<00:06:08.770> what<00:06:09.010> happened

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
emotional meaning behind what happened

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.740 
emotional meaning behind what happened
but<00:06:10.330> I<00:06:10.360> don't<00:06:10.720> really<00:06:10.840> care<00:06:11.139> I<00:06:12.449> felt<00:06:13.449> a<00:06:13.570> little

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
but I don't really care I felt a little

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.080 
but I don't really care I felt a little
cheated<00:06:14.169> honestly<00:06:14.710> after<00:06:15.070> reading<00:06:15.820> all<00:06:15.909> these

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
characters and going through all these

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:21.899 
characters and going through all these
things<00:06:20.560> that<00:06:20.650> happened<00:06:21.130> with<00:06:21.340> them<00:06:21.520> for<00:06:21.880> the

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:21.909 
things that happened with them for the

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:23.730 
things that happened with them for the
book<00:06:22.060> to<00:06:22.210> end<00:06:22.360> in<00:06:22.659> the<00:06:22.750> way<00:06:22.870> it<00:06:23.020> did<00:06:23.199> I<00:06:23.500> just

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
book to end in the way it did I just

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.670 
book to end in the way it did I just
honestly<00:06:23.949> I<00:06:24.690> just<00:06:25.690> felt<00:06:26.080> like<00:06:26.139> the<00:06:26.320> journey

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
honestly I just felt like the journey

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.620 
honestly I just felt like the journey
wasn't<00:06:27.039> really<00:06:27.460> worth<00:06:27.639> it<00:06:27.880> and

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
wasn't really worth it and

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.540 
wasn't really worth it and
I'm<00:06:28.780> really<00:06:29.110> sorry<00:06:29.260> to<00:06:29.680> say<00:06:29.920> that<00:06:29.950> because<00:06:30.250> i

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
I'm really sorry to say that because i

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.360 
I'm really sorry to say that because i
love<00:06:30.850> divergent<00:06:31.570> I<00:06:31.660> loved<00:06:31.960> insurgent<00:06:32.590> but

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
love divergent I loved insurgent but

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.210 
love divergent I loved insurgent but
this<00:06:33.940> was<00:06:34.240> just<00:06:34.270> not<00:06:34.600> the<00:06:35.500> way<00:06:35.650> I<00:06:35.680> would<00:06:36.040> have

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
this was just not the way I would have

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:42.030 
this was just not the way I would have
ended<00:06:36.550> Allegiant<00:06:37.360> and<00:06:40.440> so<00:06:41.440> I<00:06:41.470> would<00:06:41.650> say<00:06:41.890> how

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040 
ended Allegiant and so I would say how

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.350 
ended Allegiant and so I would say how
much<00:06:42.190> you<00:06:42.340> liked<00:06:42.520> this<00:06:42.640> book<00:06:42.850> is<00:06:43.060> probably
