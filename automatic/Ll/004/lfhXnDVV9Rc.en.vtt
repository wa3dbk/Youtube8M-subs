00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
just have to wash your face very

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.630 
just have to wash your face very
thoroughly<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.860> just<00:01:33.040> new<00:01:33.130> stuff<00:01:33.310> one<00:01:33.460> or<00:01:33.549> two

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
thoroughly and just new stuff one or two

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.050 
I find that if you pack more stuff in
your<00:01:38.530> faces<00:01:38.740> makes<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:39.220> worse<00:01:39.400> I<00:01:39.610> don't<00:01:39.640> if<00:01:39.909> you

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
your faces makes it worse I don't if you

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.480
