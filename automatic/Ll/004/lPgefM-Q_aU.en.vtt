00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
because this Lutz Asoka specs being

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.439 
because this Lutz Asoka specs being
added<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> game<00:00:26.010> oh<00:00:28.160> my<00:00:29.160> lord<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:30.000> want<00:00:30.330> to

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
added to the game oh my lord I want to

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.709 
added to the game oh my lord I want to
see<00:00:30.570> how<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.779> matches<00:00:30.929> up<00:00:31.230> compared<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
see how it matches up compared to the

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.389 
see how it matches up compared to the
Murcielago<00:00:33.719> because<00:00:34.140> everybody<00:00:34.890> knows<00:00:35.190> that

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
Murcielago because everybody knows that

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.100 
Murcielago because everybody knows that
that<00:00:35.730> was<00:00:35.850> pretty<00:00:36.149> much<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.510> fastest<00:00:36.809> car<00:00:37.020> at

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
that was pretty much the fastest car at

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.540 
that was pretty much the fastest car at
one<00:00:37.230> point<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.829> know<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.100> was<00:00:38.280> from<00:00:38.460> that

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
one point you know it was from that

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.639 
one point you know it was from that
video<00:00:38.850> anyway<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.260> they<00:00:40.379> added<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
video anyway and then they added the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.780 
video anyway and then they added the
mini<00:00:40.829> which<00:00:41.100> dominates<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.610> because

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
mini which dominates it because

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.760 
mini which dominates it because
all-wheel<00:00:42.030> drive<00:00:42.329> proper<00:00:42.989> all-wheel<00:00:43.230> drive<00:00:43.500> I

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
all-wheel drive proper all-wheel drive I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.889 
all-wheel drive proper all-wheel drive I
want<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> see<00:00:44.250> how<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.399> Gallardo<00:00:44.789> handles<00:00:45.149> we

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
want to see how this Gallardo handles we

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.630 
want to see how this Gallardo handles we
are<00:00:45.989> gonna<00:00:46.140> do<00:00:46.350> not<00:00:46.920> much<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.250> car<00:00:47.520> actually

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
are gonna do not much this car actually

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.270 
are gonna do not much this car actually
go<00:00:48.090> up<00:00:48.270> well<00:00:48.989> why<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.500> bottom<00:00:49.739> split<00:00:50.039> still

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
go up well why is the bottom split still

try this full of cysts let's just put
that<00:03:15.560> on<00:03:15.739> because<00:03:16.400> I<00:03:16.580> like<00:03:16.730> switching<00:03:17.270> up<00:03:17.390> just

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
that on because I like switching up just

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.180 
that on because I like switching up just
to<00:03:17.720> see<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:18.020> like<00:03:18.200> because<00:03:18.560> some<00:03:18.770> people<00:03:19.040> use
