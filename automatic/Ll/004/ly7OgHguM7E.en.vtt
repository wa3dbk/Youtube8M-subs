00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
okay here we go this is the second bucks

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.319 
okay here we go this is the second bucks
from<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.780> case<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.410> cry<00:00:55.739> number<00:00:56.370> 14<00:00:57.149> I

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
from that case we just cry number 14 I

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.090 
from that case we just cry number 14 I
think<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.660> box<00:00:57.840> was<00:00:57.960> number<00:00:58.199> 13<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.980> they

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
think that box was number 13 so they

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.209 
think that box was number 13 so they
were<00:00:59.190> sequential<00:00:59.579> Joe<00:01:00.030> um<00:01:00.649> if<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.829> haven't

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
were sequential Joe um if you haven't

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.709 
were sequential Joe um if you haven't
