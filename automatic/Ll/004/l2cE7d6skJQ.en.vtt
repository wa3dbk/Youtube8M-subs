00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 It's a quiet personal hang -out 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.610
 another time I make our broth 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.160
 of meat is of people esteem diverse 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.880
 ways to make everything clear as 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.130
 dark but his base will always be on the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.490
 In case of the works the meat was cruzei josé 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.750
 last rainbow and a few more 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.269
 wells 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.080
 We just bought it separately, too. 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.199
 Germany is not so easy to find or 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:36.690
 also very cheap here in 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.579
 around 9 reais per kilo bag but now 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.850
 I like to do the aftermath at home. 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.920
 which is a bit healthier has entered the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.860
 that have the houses under control 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.680
 fillet then I have to have a kilo 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.320
 and half of the works plus three pounds of 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.489
 bones that also gives the case of collagen is 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.770
 7 to 1 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.719
 in different text a different flavor 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.149
 continued with his sauce I think 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:06.869
 interesting is that we have a group to 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:12.600
 have a shorts that have roots or are who 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:15.470
 flame of the itaipu line 14 carrots has 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:21.420
 four onions with average 23 small 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.490
 hard parsley tomato concentrate you 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.409
 can use only the tomato but also the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.290
 train but also has no 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.180
 problem and this average here in the case 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.670
 you can also add several 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.369
 other seasonings kingdom length stay 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.439
 and it 's a crime 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.420
 there will rise to the head activity and 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.229
 people if you want to add flavor 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.259
 your calculation 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.119
 you can sleep also said I 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.780
 I have at home, I guess what I did. 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.500
 that now the first step here we go 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.320
 put the bones with the works of the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.659
 home while fillet oven at 200 degrees 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.000
 at least half an hour and a half the power 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.990
 sound can also be faster and 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.619
 slower 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.170
 she's good good brown color we already bold 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.039
 take out the oven to add our 64 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.039
 beauty 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.370
 she says it was more or less 25 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.230
 minutes on this legal curve prepare us 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.140
 but now the time has come for 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.140
 put our best and dust inside 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.709
 he will love it too if it were 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.500
 a dark place to drive but make a 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.920
 the process in the forest and 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.920
 sergio aquino if I have the tomato 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:54.600
 We put least 200 grams of tomato is 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.959
 a really cool thing about your sauce here one 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:03.650
 facing the oven more or less but is 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.650
 It's only 15 minutes for him to have nine golden 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:13.230
 So our team is already doing well, it's a 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.020
 taste all special to your 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:22.019
 today do now believe that such a 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:39.060
 greater penalty is greater 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:49.410
 first arrived before adding 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:52.049
 in the case of the ford rogélio alone here I go 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.360
 sit the water but the amount of liters 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.350
 which I will put on screen because every 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:04.910
 liter dinner two grams of salt and water 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.910
 between 112 liters of water 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:22.620
 the balls boil to be proud 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.479
 slightly access to it the temperature 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.300
 sister 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.560
 this will prevent the local round and is 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.440
 dark etc 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:42.410
 now the lowest and there are always these 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:49.650
 bugs here we'll take back the beautiful 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:51.990
 cook for six to eight hours 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:57.330
 very low fire for pure well 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:59.280
 in which the ideal of cold water 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.949
 it will leave all the flavors to meats 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.620
 vegetables and gazelles is placed 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.020
 show and decide every half hour 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.150
 every hour or so you check the broth 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.150
 to withdraw from the model- type parties 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:15.419
 in about two hours he believed 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.610
 What a boil on his face was he 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.949
 tried to let it go for a bit 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.650
 this water we will also call for more 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:26.509
 at least four hours , or even at least 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.509
 It's proof and will taste it 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.250
 after about eight hours 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.229
 cooking over low heat or 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.379
 can you not play bubbles 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:39.150
 can perceive and the taste and 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:42.840
 Amazing 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:46.469
 now I curdle here and I'll let it cool 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.650
 to be base for sauces broth soups 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:53.479
 Anything that I have in my head is 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.310
 supersaudable super tasty and so 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:06:01.759
 practically on something positive I am things 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:09.569
 industry in general is cool 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:16.199
 create the broth that way here with 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:21.210
 fat and in this case it was in the 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:23.610
 rebound we had not actually got 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.759
 also included in the broth faces and 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.060
 It certainly gives a different tone. 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:33.240
 the text says that the place also has more 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.800
 now that make your mood direct use 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.719
 down google to use some 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:42.930
 prepare or cut in half as 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:46.500
 Immigration or also how I do at home 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:51.270
 with care in small portions you need 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:54.509
 with broth of meat made many 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.610
 hours but I know I have great 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:59.279
 chicken broth that gave a month a 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.500
 month and a half or so once a month 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:04.860
 I do in my car in which of chicken 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:07.870
 the home-made vegetable stock is fine 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.600
 healthier better at home 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:14.040
 but I also know tasty hope 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.040
