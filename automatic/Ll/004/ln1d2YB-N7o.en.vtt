 to your car presents you car and 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:17.220
 traffic environmental influences such as UV rays 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.449
 and acid rain leave the vehicle paint 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.760
 quickly dull 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.949
 Rollsplit dirt bird droppings and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.230
 tree resins affect the gloss of the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.519
 Lackes in addition so very much arise 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.880
 fast high costs for the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.750
 Repairing these damages 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.090
 extremely expensive, the at 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.370
 Lease vehicles become particular 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.170
 at the return since the incurred 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.180
 Damage and paint damage 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.219
 Customers are fully invoiced 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.410
 therefore it is worth a professional 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.600
 vehicle preparation to perform 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.550
 Allow the costs to a minimum 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.200
 to reduce 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.030
 There are frequent leasing returns 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.010
 big surprises 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.559
 the bad surprises because the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.140
 evaluation of the damage on the return 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.930
 to big loud payments or 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.120
 requirements and is here 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.790
 it so it partly minor damage 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.159
 are those with smart repair or 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.439
 maybe strung without paint 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.530
 can be and no big ones 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.360
 costs have to cause a 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.520
 Vehicle preparation respectively 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.470
 a professional autorization is 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.570
 before the delivery of a leasing vehicle 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.369
 definitely recommend the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.900
 resulting costs are compared to 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.369
 the potential claims of the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.670
 Leasing company with vehicle 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.430
 Defective relatively low 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.259
 So on average from mine 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.030
 experience is it so you only 50 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.670
 so saving a percent of the sum can be 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.979
 I now return a car without 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.869
 before we get sometime advice 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.320
 or what can it do to it 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.250
 be that mine for 1000 euros 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.310
 remittance court and the 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.049
 can loose so on average around the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.520
 half be reduced if you go ahead 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.780
 take appropriate action 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.490
 not just from the outside 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.100
 leasing vehicles an intensive 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.110
 cleaning and care door sills 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.390
 the entire cockpit rugs and 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.520
 Doormats or the seat cushions are 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.330
 often no longer in the best optical 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.489
 constitution 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.470
 therefore, experts always advise one 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.069
 Thorough cleaning and, above all, too 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.720
 a preparation at a complete 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.450
 Cleaning the interior in each case 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.400
 makes sense if you think about what you 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.019
 afterwards for it again and in the 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.360
 vehicle rating from the appreciation has 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.069
 for a complete interior cleaning 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.980
 I get a wet cleaning of the 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.959
 leather upholstery then if I am 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.880
 have a leather seat or otherwise at 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.329
 stuff occasion cleaning the stains 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.530
 can be removed as far as possible and 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.200
 cockpit in the plastic area 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.760
 Plastic care in plastic 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.100
 Refresh not as bulky as before 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.810
 In the past there was one of bacon 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.329
 convinced that shone so but that 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.209
 are really like new and that is in 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:56.690
 so in complete preparation everything 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.579
 Contain self-torn scratches or 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.260
 holes in the dashboard can 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.180
 nowadays with special plastic 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.739
 be filled so that the original 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.530
 structure is restored 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.690
 cracks and burn holes in the upholstery or 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.319
 Leather interiors can be just as fast 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.700
 and be cheaply eliminated 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.829
 Scratches in the paint can occur quickly 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.810
 and are very annoying for the owner 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.940
 the removal of a superficial 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.190
 Scratching is also through pure polishing 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.680
 possible the way to the painter is not 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.569
 mandatory a complete 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.670
 Although vehicle preparation costs as well 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.200
 but money saves a large part of the sum 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.430
 a the the leasing company in 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.630
 bill 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.630
 a cleanup alone costs 70 to 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.890
 100 euros 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.010
 a complete preparation with 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.140
 foreign policy between 2 and 3 100 euro 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.610
 if i after the vehicle or 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.620
 can return as but to 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.410
 Differences in the rating of 1 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.930
 2000 euro and in case of doubt 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.060
 even if I want to sell a car 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.010
 private then decides the 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.830
 Buyer of course for an extremely 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.010
 well maintained car if it is technically accurate 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.900
 the equivalent is a vehicle cleaning 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.730
 And care does not necessarily have to be from 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.170
 be carried out by a specialist company 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.660
 many things can also be done on one's own 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.130
 Of course, it should be taken 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.400
 to be noticed 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.590
 the expert explains so it is 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.750
 quite possible himself his vehicle 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.070
 about the leasing time also in one 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.360
 good condition 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.240
 you do not need it every time 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.730
 professional to go but that makes sense 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.460
 to get tips like for example the 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.200
 Keep plastic fresh on the vehicle 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.790
 Can there be good products 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.340
 you should not just be like that 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.710
 buy together but previously advice 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.500
 pick and then good care products 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.660
 buy plastic with fresh ones 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.250
 and keeps you elastic with them 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.110
 maybe here are the fabrics from time to time 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.480
 cleans and leathers above all things 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.430
 Maintains there is only good leather care 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.470
 you can apply that once more and 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.990
 then it will be supple again and will 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.610
 not fragile 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.440
 So you like to wear your vehicle 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.450
 preparers and get one 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.160
 cost estimate or just one 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.790
 few tips and assistance to 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.790
