00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.820 

to<00:00:07.080> catch<00:00:07.620> up

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.140 

we'll<00:00:13.520> take<00:00:13.640> a<00:00:13.700> look<00:00:13.850> at<00:00:13.970> what<00:00:14.060> we<00:00:14.150> saw<00:00:14.330> there

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
we'll take a look at what we saw there

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.440 
we'll take a look at what we saw there
45<00:00:15.870> minutes<00:00:16.200> just<00:00:16.550> not<00:00:17.550> quite<00:00:17.970> happening

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
45 minutes just not quite happening

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.130 
45 minutes just not quite happening
there<00:00:19.200> that<00:00:19.230> ball<00:00:19.650> was<00:00:19.800> behind<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.580> roof

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
there that ball was behind this roof

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.660 
there that ball was behind this roof
boulders<00:00:22.140> there<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.770> think<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.189> one<00:00:23.460> also

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
boulders there and I think this one also

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.920 
boulders there and I think this one also
kinda<00:00:24.630> behind<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:26.369> seasons<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.390> aren't

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
kinda behind so the seasons just aren't

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.089 
kinda behind so the seasons just aren't
quite<00:00:28.170> falling<00:00:29.010> into<00:00:29.189> place<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:30.180> also<00:00:30.390> for

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
quite falling into place and also for

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.619 
quite falling into place and also for
15s<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.400> blind<00:00:32.610> touch<00:00:32.970> their<00:00:33.270> by<00:00:33.480> their

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
15s it's a blind touch their by their

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.930 
15s it's a blind touch their by their
number<00:00:33.870> 17<00:00:34.379> but<00:00:37.309> obviously<00:00:38.309> falling<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.730> for

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
number 17 but obviously falling is for

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.360 
number 17 but obviously falling is for
their<00:00:39.120> hands<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:40.110> saw<00:00:40.470> a<00:00:40.500> lot<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.070> down

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
their hands and saw a lot of this down

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.820 
their hands and saw a lot of this down
through<00:00:41.970> balls<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.449> didn't<00:00:42.870> quite<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
through balls it didn't quite have the

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.700 
through balls it didn't quite have the
right<00:00:44.160> weight<00:00:44.400> I<00:00:44.699> think<00:00:45.170> what<00:00:46.170> we're<00:00:46.350> told<00:00:46.530> is

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
right weight I think what we're told is

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.340 
right weight I think what we're told is
it<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.489> can't<00:00:47.970> not<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.450> straight<00:00:48.809> ball<00:00:49.079> for

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
it is you can't not a straight ball for

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.750 
it is you can't not a straight ball for
someone<00:00:49.620> running<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.980> switch<00:00:50.280> because<00:00:50.430> you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
someone running on switch because you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760 
someone running on switch because you
can't<00:00:51.000> run<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.329> fast<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.809> football<00:00:52.200> which<00:00:52.739> is

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
can't run as fast the football which is

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.590 
can't run as fast the football which is
why<00:00:53.010> we're<00:00:53.250> saying<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:53.880> need<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
why we're saying that we need to get the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.690 
why we're saying that we need to get the
ball<00:00:54.780> out<00:00:54.809> wide<00:00:55.200> people<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.190> run<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.489> side

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
ball out wide people to run on side

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.120 
ball out wide people to run on side
diagonal<00:00:57.270> passes<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.899> then<00:00:58.020> join<00:00:58.290> in<00:00:58.500> yeah<00:00:58.920> so

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
diagonal passes and then join in yeah so

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.590 
diagonal passes and then join in yeah so
we're<00:00:59.280> seeing<00:00:59.460> some<00:00:59.610> pretty<00:00:59.910> good<00:01:00.120> quality

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
we're seeing some pretty good quality

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.180 
we're seeing some pretty good quality
fastness<00:01:01.050> from<00:01:01.200> the<00:01:01.290> back<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> midfield

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
fastness from the back to the midfield

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.189 
fastness from the back to the midfield
but<00:01:02.430> what's<00:01:02.969> happening<00:01:03.390> from<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> midfield

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
but what's happening from the midfield

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.109 
but what's happening from the midfield
of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> footer<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> passage<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.580> too<00:01:05.759> strong

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
of the footer the passage is too strong

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.910 
of the footer the passage is too strong
or<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.570> are<00:01:06.930> they<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.200> hard<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.800> as

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
or this are they so hard to be as

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.529 
or this are they so hard to be as
accurate<00:01:08.130> that's<00:01:08.550> the<00:01:08.670> midfield<00:01:09.060> faster<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
accurate that's the midfield faster I

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:11.540 
accurate that's the midfield faster I
think<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.840> party<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.350> gypsy<00:01:10.740> strikes<00:01:11.160> it<00:01:11.399> is

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
think the party the gypsy strikes it is

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.790 
think the party the gypsy strikes it is
it's<00:01:12.000> very<00:01:12.090> very<00:01:12.360> difficult<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.140> get<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
it's very very difficult to get the

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.609 
it's very very difficult to get the
weight<00:01:13.979> right<00:01:14.250> when<00:01:14.369> you're<00:01:14.520> passing<00:01:15.619> because

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
weight right when you're passing because

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.010 
weight right when you're passing because
you're<00:01:16.830> basically<00:01:17.180> expecting<00:01:18.180> your<00:01:18.360> forward

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you're basically expecting your forward

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.080 
you're basically expecting your forward
to<00:01:19.140> run<00:01:19.289> as<00:01:19.410> fast<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.950> football<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.819> if<00:01:20.940> you

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
to run as fast as a football but if you

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.749 
to run as fast as a football but if you
know<00:01:21.209> if<00:01:21.300> you're<00:01:21.420> passing<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.929> ball<00:01:22.110> out<00:01:22.289> wide

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
know if you're passing the ball out wide

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.370 
know if you're passing the ball out wide
diagonal<00:01:23.759> parking<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.330> very<00:01:24.360> very<00:01:24.869> easy<00:01:25.050> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
diagonal parking is very very easy to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.710 
diagonal parking is very very easy to
find<00:01:25.860> advice<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:27.119> first<00:01:27.360> touch

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.050 

the<00:01:59.350> nastiness<00:01:59.800> had<00:02:00.160> developed<00:02:00.760> a<00:02:00.880> few

the nastiness had developed a few
minutes<00:02:01.300> earlier<00:02:01.630> after<00:02:01.780> my<00:02:02.140> site<00:02:02.380> was

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
awarded and of course it is for in

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.780 
awarded and of course it is for in
actual<00:03:14.590> field<00:03:15.010> playing<00:03:15.370> with<00:03:15.760> our

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
actual field playing with our

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.060 
actual field playing with our
differences<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.660> Rio<00:03:17.050> Vista<00:03:17.290> claps<00:03:17.620> back<00:03:17.860> when

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
differences to Rio Vista claps back when

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.860 
differences to Rio Vista claps back when
the<00:03:18.160> troops<00:03:18.430> files<00:03:18.640> we<00:03:18.820> call<00:03:19.030> inside<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.660> box

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
the troops files we call inside the box

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.020 
the troops files we call inside the box
I<00:03:20.170> think<00:03:20.530> basically<00:03:20.980> what's<00:03:21.520> happened<00:03:21.880> there

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
I think basically what's happened there

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.030 
I think basically what's happened there
is<00:03:22.240> they've<00:03:22.810> caught<00:03:23.110> us<00:03:23.260> were<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.470> free<00:03:23.770> pass

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
is they've caught us were a free pass

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.500 
is they've caught us were a free pass
one<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.400> most<00:03:24.580> dangerous<00:03:24.760> passes<00:03:25.360> in

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
one of the most dangerous passes in

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.240 
one of the most dangerous passes in
football<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.050> pass<00:03:26.320> between<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.890> center

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
football is the pass between the center

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.070 
football is the pass between the center
back<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:28.120> wing<00:03:28.300> back<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.780> they've<00:03:28.900> done

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
back and the wing back and they've done

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.350 
back and the wing back and they've done
it<00:03:29.200> twice<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.830> they're<00:03:30.490> beating<00:03:30.670> us<00:03:30.910> for<00:03:31.150> pace

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
it twice and they're beating us for pace

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.330 
it twice and they're beating us for pace
and<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.750> with<00:03:32.080> their<00:03:32.380> forced<00:03:32.770> us<00:03:32.950> into<00:03:32.980> that

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
and it with their forced us into that

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.370 
and it with their forced us into that
situation<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.510> I<00:03:34.600> think<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.990> referee

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
situation and I think the referee

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.980 
situation and I think the referee
definitely<00:03:35.980> had<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.340> give<00:03:36.490> the<00:03:36.670> first<00:03:36.880> one<00:03:37.270> the

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
definitely had to give the first one the

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.050 
definitely had to give the first one the
second<00:03:38.440> one<00:03:38.470> with<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.190> goalkeeper<00:03:39.430> coming

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
second one with the goalkeeper coming

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.730 
second one with the goalkeeper coming
out<00:03:40.180> like<00:03:40.330> that<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.780> think<00:03:41.050> with<00:03:41.200> questionable

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
out like that I think with questionable

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.110 
out like that I think with questionable
let's<00:03:42.490> take<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.640> look<00:03:42.790> at<00:03:42.880> some<00:03:42.970> of<00:03:43.060> the

let's take a look at some of the

highlights and exactly what happened in

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.090 
highlights and exactly what happened in
those<00:03:45.610> two<00:03:46.030> fouls<00:03:46.360> that<00:03:47.110> resulted<00:03:47.590> abilities

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
those two fouls that resulted abilities

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.860 
those two fouls that resulted abilities
for<00:03:48.340> our<00:03:48.430> team<00:03:48.610> Laos<00:03:48.820> and<00:03:49.270> as<00:03:49.390> well<00:03:49.510> as<00:03:49.600> some<00:03:49.750> of

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
chances they most certainly did and here

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.870 
chances they most certainly did and here
with<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.470> incident<00:03:56.950> that<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.280> spark<00:03:57.640> the
