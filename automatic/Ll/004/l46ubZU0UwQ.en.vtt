because basically he has moved to a team

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.140 
because basically he has moved to a team
in<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.380> Ukrainian<00:00:22.949> league<00:00:23.160> now<00:00:23.580> what<00:00:24.090> this

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
in the Ukrainian league now what this

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
the reason for this is because Ukrainian

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.380 
the reason for this is because Ukrainian
league<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.500> ultimate<00:00:31.949> team<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:33.210> now

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
actually think he's trolling at the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.539 
actually think he's trolling at the
start<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.719> i<00:02:04.259> didn't<00:02:04.530> actually<00:02:04.619> buy<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> few<00:02:05.310> i

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
start and i didn't actually buy a few i

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.370 
start and i didn't actually buy a few i
was<00:02:06.210> really<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> first<00:02:06.990> people<00:02:07.290> on

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
was really one of the first people on

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.320 
was really one of the first people on
the<00:02:07.439> PSP<00:02:07.770> market<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.340> actually<00:02:08.610> find<00:02:08.970> his

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the PSP market to actually find his

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.510 
the PSP market to actually find his
price

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
price

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.000 
price
and<00:02:10.850> think<00:02:11.750> about<00:02:11.840> bidding<00:02:12.170> buying<00:02:12.680> one

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
and think about bidding buying one

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.510 
and think about bidding buying one
because<00:02:13.430> there<00:02:13.910> was<00:02:14.060> one<00:02:14.500> 435<00:02:15.500> capin<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.460> I

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
because there was one 435 capin and I

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.830 
because there was one 435 capin and I
was<00:02:16.610> like<00:02:16.700> now<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:17.120> don't<00:02:17.390> think<00:02:17.450> it's<00:02:17.660> possible

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
was like now I don't think it's possible

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.770 
was like now I don't think it's possible
rise<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.800> think<00:02:19.370> all<00:02:19.520> this<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:19.700> just

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
rise I think all this is just

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.600 
rise I think all this is just
and<00:02:20.990> I<00:02:21.080> think<00:02:21.290> real<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.770> real<00:02:21.800> Crowley<00:02:22.430> is

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
and I think real the real Crowley is

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.540 
and I think real the real Crowley is
