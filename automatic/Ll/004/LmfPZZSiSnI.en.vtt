00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.059
 hello to all the kids and welcome 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.119
 once again to ray survival in this 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.180
 occasion we will learn how to make fire 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:17.570
 with a magnifying glass I recommend that you use a 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.550
 magnifying glass of this size more or less like 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.140
 minimal because 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.939
 and if they are of a smaller size it is going to 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.630
 cost more what would ignite and have 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.699
 to be crystal 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.859
 with the glass is easier than 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.469
 let's get fire with plastic 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.840
 agreement is better the glass than the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.970
 plastic 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.600
 and I have several good things about here 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.270
 example a piece of cardboard a sheet and a 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.780
 I want you to be in a 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.289
 previous video and I want you to see how 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.289
 as ars we are not going to do three tests 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.489
 how are we going to burn for example we have 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.260
 the object 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.520
 we have to get a point of 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.810
 agreement is only 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.000
 in that position of heaven 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.030
 over there then we place 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.580
 then so 10 look how they form a 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.160
 sort of point we have to do that 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.880
 the point is as small as possible and 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.730
 that's when they are already affecting what 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.630
 concentrates on the light and what it does 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:25.300
 that they burn or what we want no no 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.160
 let's move on because if you look 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.710
 the closer the larger circle 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.080
 until the last point that is small and 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.180
 then , as he opened it, we are good 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.970
 get it to be a little circle and 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.390
 small and how are we going to see for example 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.240
 with the house sheet 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.939
 late 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.080
 and it is very useful when it comes to 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:53.360
 a survival situation 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.580
 well first let's go to 0 and what 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.240
 place we make the small point up 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.979
 that burns as you can see 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.009
 I have taken advantage of a day in which 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.890
 quite a charge of about 26 degrees and for 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:11.080
 that you see that good the more heat 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.260
 obviously make it easier to be 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.260
 Light the fire 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.319
 good as you can see it's pretty 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.319
 simple and very effective 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.540
 and I hope it's already on and we can 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.290
 take advantage to do 1 summer 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.290
 good the sheet as you have already seen 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.290
 perfectly 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.090
 it also depends on the type of blade that this 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.120
 I think it 's honeysuckle if I do not remember 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.120
 wrong 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.820
 and this if you agree well or not 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.819
 depending on the sheet it's like this more 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.700
 thicker dark of worse but 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.790
 but you can see that it burns in 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.280
 easily and finally on a piece of 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.840
 cardboard that I have taken from I do not know what 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.420
 exactly I think it's a padlock that 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.420
 I bought myself for the bicycle but good 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.250
 let's try here we have the point and 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.400
 we see that it also burns with enough 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.400
 ease 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.209
 but if it is decided more I will focus for 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:39.080
 see what you want 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:42.010
 the point is still there 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.580
 concentrate the light in such a way that 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.580
 that burn 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.420
 Well, I hope you have served this 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.790
 video 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.940
 and see you on another occasion a greeting 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.940
 for all
