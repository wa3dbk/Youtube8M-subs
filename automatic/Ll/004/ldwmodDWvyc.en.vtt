and basically the Polka blocks are kind

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.020 
and basically the Polka blocks are kind
of<00:01:35.189> hard<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:36.299> get<00:01:36.540> even<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:37.700> like<00:01:38.700> all<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
of hard to to get even with like all the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.969 
of hard to to get even with like all the
berries<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.540> because<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.409> every<00:01:40.710> berry

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
berries just because I have every berry

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.020 
berries just because I have every berry
but<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.759> kind<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.060> awkward<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.930> all<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
but it's kind of awkward to get all the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.210 
but it's kind of awkward to get all the
rainbow<00:01:45.030> blocks<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.689> stuff<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.829> because

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
rainbow blocks and stuff just because

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.980 
rainbow blocks and stuff just because
sometimes<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.060> doesn't<00:01:48.329> give<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
sometimes it doesn't give you the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.469 
sometimes it doesn't give you the
rainbow<00:01:49.649> one<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.700> want<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.060> stuff<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.390> it's

wonder cards same thing for chinese
alternate<00:03:17.859> codes<00:03:18.129> there<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:19.209> st.<00:03:19.959> Pikachu

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
alternate codes there is st. Pikachu

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.129 
alternate codes there is st. Pikachu
they<00:03:20.590> are<00:03:20.709> kiram<00:03:21.159> still<00:03:21.459> they<00:03:22.389> made<00:03:22.629> Hoopa

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
they are kiram still they made Hoopa

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.069 
they are kiram still they made Hoopa
which<00:03:23.349> is<00:03:23.560> pretty<00:03:23.889> pointless<00:03:24.370> but<00:03:25.079> actually

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
which is pretty pointless but actually

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.009 
which is pretty pointless but actually
kind<00:03:26.319> of<00:03:26.409> not<00:03:26.680> pointless<00:03:27.069> because<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:28.209> hoop

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
kind of not pointless because the hoop

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.800 
kind of not pointless because the hoop
the<00:03:29.260> Hoopa<00:03:29.590> form<00:03:29.829> is<00:03:30.040> basically<00:03:30.489> like<00:03:30.810> Sheamus

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
the Hoopa form is basically like Sheamus

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.390 
the Hoopa form is basically like Sheamus
sky<00:03:32.019> form<00:03:32.349> where<00:03:32.590> if<00:03:32.769> you<00:03:32.859> put<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.099> back<00:03:33.220> in<00:03:33.370> the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
sky form where if you put it back in the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.740 
sky form where if you put it back in the
PC<00:03:33.879> box<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:35.109> it<00:03:35.470> will<00:03:35.739> actually<00:03:35.949> turn<00:03:36.750> back

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
PC box it it will actually turn back

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.379 
PC box it it will actually turn back
into<00:03:38.049> regular<00:03:38.379> Shaymin<00:03:39.069> so<00:03:39.639> this<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.180> might

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
into regular Shaymin so this I might

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.789 
into regular Shaymin so this I might
actually<00:03:40.510> use<00:03:40.720> this<00:03:41.019> because<00:03:41.319> I<00:03:41.379> want<00:03:41.409> to<00:03:41.650> use

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
actually use this because I want to use

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.180 
actually use this because I want to use
hoopla's<00:03:42.280> alternate<00:03:42.819> or<00:03:43.079> weakened<00:03:44.079> former<00:03:44.560> or

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
hoopla's alternate or weakened former or

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.780 
hoopla's alternate or weakened former or
what<00:03:45.430> I<00:03:45.459> forgot<00:03:45.940> what<00:03:46.090> unbound<00:03:46.840> form<00:03:47.579> so<00:03:48.579> yeah

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
what I forgot what unbound form so yeah

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.670 
what I forgot what unbound form so yeah
this<00:03:49.060> is<00:03:49.239> kind<00:03:49.479> of<00:03:49.540> useful<00:03:49.780> because<00:03:50.109> then<00:03:50.560> you

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
this is kind of useful because then you

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.289 
this is kind of useful because then you
can<00:03:50.799> put<00:03:50.949> in<00:03:51.069> your<00:03:51.129> battle<00:03:51.489> box<00:03:51.669> and<00:03:51.909> stuff<00:03:52.120> so

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
can put in your battle box and stuff so

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.210 
can put in your battle box and stuff so
that's<00:03:52.479> actually<00:03:52.599> pretty<00:03:52.870> useful<00:03:53.220> the

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
that's actually pretty useful the

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.149 
that's actually pretty useful the
diancie<00:03:54.579> this<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.239> pretty<00:03:55.930> this<00:03:56.409> is<00:03:56.470> mostly

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
diancie this is pretty this is mostly

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.369 
diancie this is pretty this is mostly
like<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.370> hack<00:03:57.639> mod<00:03:57.879> because<00:03:58.120> obviously<00:03:58.479> you

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
like a hack mod because obviously you

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.319 
like a hack mod because obviously you
know<00:03:59.470> alternate<00:03:59.979> form<00:04:00.280> is<00:04:00.430> a<00:04:00.459> mega<00:04:00.790> evolution

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
know alternate form is a mega evolution

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.349 
know alternate form is a mega evolution
so<00:04:01.449> you<00:04:01.510> need<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:01.930> have<00:04:02.139> a<00:04:02.409> mega<00:04:02.680> evo<00:04:03.159> or<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.060> mega

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
so you need to have a mega evo or a mega

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.929 
so you need to have a mega evo or a mega
evolution<00:04:04.870> stone<00:04:05.199> on<00:04:05.530> it<00:04:06.189> so<00:04:06.459> it's<00:04:06.639> kind<00:04:06.879> of

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:06.939 
evolution stone on it so it's kind of

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.330 
evolution stone on it so it's kind of
this<00:04:07.090> kind<00:04:07.299> of<00:04:07.389> like<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.569> hack<00:04:07.810> mod<00:04:08.109> and<00:04:09.040> grout

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
this kind of like a hack mod and grout

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.280 
this kind of like a hack mod and grout

basically what you remind it going to be

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.309 
basically what you remind it going to be
able<00:04:12.909> to<00:04:13.060> use<00:04:13.209> hopefully<00:04:13.810> I<00:04:13.840> can<00:04:13.930> use<00:04:14.139> the

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
able to use hopefully I can use the

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.620 
able to use hopefully I can use the
hoopla<00:04:14.650> though<00:04:14.769> because<00:04:14.949> it's<00:04:15.430> just<00:04:15.729> a<00:04:15.849> form

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
hoopla though because it's just a form

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.089 
hoopla though because it's just a form
change<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.169> and<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.440> didn't<00:04:17.680> need<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.979> item

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
change it and it didn't need the item

believe that's the same thing but you

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.950 
believe that's the same thing but you
know<00:04:29.310> who<00:04:29.760> cares<00:04:29.970> about<00:04:30.090> cloning<00:04:30.420> on<00:04:30.630> with

that language modifier that's act this
is<00:04:33.570> actually<00:04:33.810> pretty<00:04:33.930> cool<00:04:34.140> I<00:04:34.410> don't<00:04:34.920> think

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
is actually pretty cool I don't think

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.740 
is actually pretty cool I don't think
they<00:04:35.160> had<00:04:35.310> this<00:04:35.460> before<00:04:35.640> I<00:04:36.120> believe<00:04:36.630> this

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
they had this before I believe this

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.730 
they had this before I believe this
modifies<00:04:37.200> your<00:04:37.380> game<00:04:37.650> language<00:04:39.110> so<00:04:40.110> like<00:04:40.410> you

into a luxury ball with this thing or
whatever<00:05:09.810> I<00:05:09.990> think<00:05:10.230> it's<00:05:10.350> a<00:05:10.410> luxury<00:05:10.740> of<00:05:10.770> all

whatever I think it's a luxury of all

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.990 
whatever I think it's a luxury of all
wear<00:05:11.160> it<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.850> uh<00:05:12.080> it<00:05:13.080> makes<00:05:13.530> it's<00:05:13.740> like

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
wear it it uh it makes it's like

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.950 
wear it it uh it makes it's like

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
friendship go up or whatever but I'm not

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.750 
friendship go up or whatever but I'm not
really<00:05:16.080> sure<00:05:16.200> well<00:05:16.650> if<00:05:16.890> it<00:05:17.070> actually<00:05:17.280> does

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
really sure well if it actually does

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.430 
really sure well if it actually does
those<00:05:18.000> things<00:05:18.030> but<00:05:18.480> I<00:05:18.720> guess<00:05:19.050> it's<00:05:19.200> kind<00:05:19.380> of

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
those things but I guess it's kind of

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.560 
those things but I guess it's kind of
cool<00:05:19.650> to<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:20.400> show<00:05:20.700> like<00:05:20.910> if<00:05:21.060> you've<00:05:21.240> had<00:05:21.450> to
