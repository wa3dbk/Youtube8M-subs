00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
is basically what the natural state of

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.430 
is basically what the natural state of
the<00:01:13.220> hair<00:01:13.490> is<00:01:13.670> in<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:14.270> is<00:01:14.660> like<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.870> natural

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
basically I was told it's just processed

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.450 
basically I was told it's just processed
by<00:01:24.910> steam<00:01:25.910> to<00:01:26.510> get<00:01:26.990> a<00:01:27.200> longer<00:01:27.590> lasting<00:01:27.920> curl

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
by steam to get a longer lasting curl

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.830 
by steam to get a longer lasting curl

this hair I'm the natural state of the
hair<00:01:41.000> i<00:01:41.240> am<00:01:41.510> not<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.900> fan<00:01:42.110> of<00:01:42.440> unless<00:01:43.250> i<00:01:43.550> had

probably would have been able to feel
comfortable<00:01:49.870> with<00:01:50.870> the<00:01:51.170> natural<00:01:52.060> texture<00:01:53.060> and

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
comfortable with the natural texture and

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.840 
comfortable with the natural texture and
pattern<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.840> hair<00:01:54.080> um<00:01:54.400> so<00:01:55.400> when<00:01:55.820> i

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
pattern of the hair um so when i

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.270 
pattern of the hair um so when i
installed<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:56.840> hair<00:01:57.050> i<00:01:57.080> went<00:01:57.440> ahead<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.770> flat

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
installed the hair i went ahead and flat

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.450 
installed the hair i went ahead and flat
irons<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:59.060> I<00:02:00.050> just<00:02:00.590> worked<00:02:00.890> with<00:02:01.159> it<00:02:01.280> from

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
irons it and I just worked with it from

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.180 
irons it and I just worked with it from
there<00:02:01.520> with<00:02:02.420> my<00:02:02.600> closure<00:02:02.900> is<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.229> very<00:02:03.650> natural

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
there with my closure is a very natural

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.000 
there with my closure is a very natural
light<00:02:04.790> closure<00:02:05.530> in<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.680> calm

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
light closure in a calm

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.359 
light closure in a calm
the<00:02:07.630> Eurasian<00:02:08.630> hair<00:02:08.990> very<00:02:09.560> wonderfully<00:02:10.160> this

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
the Eurasian hair very wonderfully this

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.180 
the Eurasian hair very wonderfully this
closure<00:02:10.610> is<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.000> Malaysian<00:02:11.600> closure<00:02:11.870> um<00:02:12.290> so<00:02:13.160> I

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
closure is a Malaysian closure um so I

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.030 
closure is a Malaysian closure um so I
think<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.700> complements<00:02:14.390> this<00:02:14.720> hair<00:02:15.410> texture

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
think it complements this hair texture

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.880 
think it complements this hair texture
wonderfully<00:02:16.640> now<00:02:17.270> for<00:02:17.690> as<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:17.990> maintenance

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890
