 A new social product to be produced in the Polynesian region 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.730
 In the beginning there is everyone's adoption in glitter 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.960
 Apparently maintenance and propolis homey vegetables f40 series 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.960
 Contains significance and ingredients 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:32.870
 Criminal is also a contract man himself 57 in the same night the same day 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.560
 Cultivate 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.560
 The rate of increase in Nagoya 35 months is 6.8% down 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.310
 Warring States Basara dogs have recently become popular 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.710
 Founded in criminal group 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.470
 14 years 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.890
 Just an example 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.170
 14 but I taught 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.030
 In the tenth decade 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.670
 The girl who let me announce 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.670
 The proceedings will be in 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.260
 This technology is 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.780
 But there may be some of you here too 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.290
 With a variety program 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.630
 In the statement 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.730
 It is said that it will be used for 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.350
 The impression is 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.960
 I think it's strong 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.150
 Yes, there are many who say that great 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.910
 But me 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.899
 Just this is about one day 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.440
 It is a quantity but 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.980
 Because I'm out after every day for six years 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.940
 Especially about 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.890
 Meanwhile, the confrontation between countries has deepened 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.890
 I will do for a moment 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.090
 throw 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.310
 Is there 6 or less 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.580
 It is a required course 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.070
 Fire under the word regulation law 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.360
 But this is it 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.750
 in this way 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.720
 In a nutshell 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.030
 Unfavorable Nakata is often unnecessary, though 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.910
 Five people carried out for these past six years 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:09.969
 Continue to be supported 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:11.569
 Right now 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.829
 n It is the first small girl who keeps popularity 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.389
 It is a lot of escape For eco-customers 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.389
 I am scared now but 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.089
 There was no celebrity 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.759
 We have introduced the successor of this to various magazines 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.799
 It is often said that it is the biggest feature and how it is different from something 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.159
 Though 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.569
 The best feature is 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.749
 So much 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:42.049
 Stone color 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.269
 Selling results 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.339
 The panda of that grade 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:48.279
 My pace is raised 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:49.639
 And 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.549
 Pasteurize 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.549
 Because we manufacture 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:03:00.079
 The state forest country Jedda business was scared while in business 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:02.739
 And one more thing 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:03.849
 big 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.709
 It is to the director general 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.189
 I did not wait 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:09.399
 Among these 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:11.550
 Other than impossible 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.669
 Water line 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:16.849
 The best feature of this book is that it is not included 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.209
 I think it is not 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.359
 It is true I am on a business trip abroad 

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:25.729
 There are two surprises 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:27.369
 One is it 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:30.569
 I was attacking the beach 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.089
 Morning Sleeping King 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:34.629
 Like that 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.949
 I am a beach member 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:40.369
 Because it is delicious and Ishino taste 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:43.369
 I am raising a small lot of movies 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:47.409
 You only have to start the application for which the intention to change work has been consigned 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:50.599
 Even though the same business 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.779
 Growing up in a heroic way 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.489
 I felt the vitality of br-2 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.179
 I say that it led me to go beyond 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.939
 A doctor on the island dances with it 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.549
 Originally put 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.879
 It's a volcano 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.359
 I want to swing around and be reminiscent of 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.099
 I want to do that 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.689
 At first 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.879
 It is a plant that has come 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:19.439
 It seems to have become the same 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:20.789
 Well that exerciser 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.689
 The next day after growing up 

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:27.150
 The added amount has become more serious 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.969
 I thought only at 4 o'clock 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:31.819
 It continues and is vitality 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:34.409
 Not only can I see it but also 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:38.340
 Such 326 mainly on the blog etc 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.389
 We deliver the source of n fine 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.439
 Always think 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.689
 What a truly pleasing gift 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.289
 After all it is 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:51.749
 In the environment 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:54.580
 I think it may be a mirror 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.580
 Earthquake motion 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:01.479
 A form where ob can not be taken yet in voice zoom 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:02.430
 Trial 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.610
 I would like to receive
