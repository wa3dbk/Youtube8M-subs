00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
this you can also use machines to the

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.379 
this you can also use machines to the
row<00:04:35.220> machine<00:04:35.400> obviously<00:04:35.820> I<00:04:36.030> don't<00:04:36.090> encourage

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
row machine obviously I don't encourage

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:37.790 
row machine obviously I don't encourage
machines<00:04:36.750> but<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:37.020> can<00:04:37.229> use<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.560> machine

obviously<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.280> row<00:04:38.370> machine<00:04:38.550> excellent<00:04:39.060> it's

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
obviously the row machine excellent it's

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.180 
obviously the row machine excellent it's
pretty<00:04:39.360> much<00:04:39.479> similar<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.229> the<00:04:40.500> barbell<00:04:41.130> with

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
machine pretty much equivalent to the

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.270 
machine pretty much equivalent to the

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
perform a good number of pull-ups then

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.150 
perform a good number of pull-ups then
there<00:04:49.020> are<00:04:49.110> very<00:04:49.320> effective<00:04:49.680> exercises<00:04:50.099> as
