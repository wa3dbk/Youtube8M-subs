00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
level this I'll be honest is one of the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.890 
level this I'll be honest is one of the
more<00:00:11.280> challenging<00:00:11.340> levels<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.330> defeated

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
more challenging levels and it defeated

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.200 
more challenging levels and it defeated
us<00:00:13.080> once<00:00:13.320> because<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.799> we<00:00:14.250> see<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.730> ring<00:00:15.030> we

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
us once because we we see that ring we

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.880 
us once because we we see that ring we
see<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> spot<00:00:16.080> where<00:00:16.260> our<00:00:16.320> troops<00:00:16.680> can

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
see a spot where our troops can

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.410 
see a spot where our troops can
definitely<00:00:17.430> sit<00:00:17.699> behind<00:00:18.260> but<00:00:19.970> it's<00:00:20.970> tough<00:00:21.270> to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
definitely sit behind but it's tough to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.939 
definitely sit behind but it's tough to
get<00:00:21.510> them<00:00:21.660> back<00:00:21.810> there<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.320> do<00:00:22.619> want<00:00:22.830> to

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
get them back there so you do want to

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.710 
get them back there so you do want to
save<00:00:23.490> some<00:00:23.519> flares<00:00:24.000> because<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.390> need<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.630> be

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
save some flares because you need to be

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.179 
save some flares because you need to be
ready<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.990> take<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.410> out<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:25.740> as<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.099> can

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
ready to take that out but as you can

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.560 
ready to take that out but as you can
see<00:00:26.369> there's<00:00:26.580> iron<00:00:26.820> for<00:00:27.029> jizz<00:00:27.210> all<00:00:27.300> over<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
see there's iron for jizz all over the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.210 
see there's iron for jizz all over the
place<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.930> we're<00:00:28.650> gonna<00:00:28.800> start<00:00:29.039> out<00:00:29.130> with

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
place and we're gonna start out with

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.999 
place and we're gonna start out with
artillery<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.060> right<00:00:30.660> side<00:00:30.990> sniper<00:00:31.740> tower

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
artillery on the right side sniper tower

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.950 
artillery on the right side sniper tower
now<00:00:32.160> these<00:00:32.309> are<00:00:32.520> level<00:00:32.880> 9<00:00:33.090> sniper<00:00:33.450> towers<00:00:33.840> so

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
now these are level 9 sniper towers so

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.450 
now these are level 9 sniper towers so
they're<00:00:34.140> pretty<00:00:34.440> advanced<00:00:34.800> they<00:00:35.040> will<00:00:35.250> do

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
they're pretty advanced they will do

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.100 
they're pretty advanced they will do
some<00:00:35.670> damage<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.120> have<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.270> nice<00:00:36.450> mix<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.840> troops

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
some damage we have a nice mix of troops

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.780 
some damage we have a nice mix of troops
though<00:00:37.350> we're<00:00:37.890> gonna<00:00:37.980> obviously<00:00:38.219> start<00:00:38.670> out

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
though we're gonna obviously start out

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.119 
though we're gonna obviously start out
with<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.059> heavy<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:40.230> can't<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.010> down

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
with the heavy and you can't get it down

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.340 
with the heavy and you can't get it down
all<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.550> way<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:41.899> we'll<00:00:42.899> start<00:00:43.140> out<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
all the way but we'll start out with the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.840 
all the way but we'll start out with the
heavy<00:00:43.530> trip<00:00:43.739> hopefully<00:00:44.010> he<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.309> soak<00:00:44.550> up<00:00:44.670> some

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
heavy trip hopefully he can soak up some

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.150 
heavy trip hopefully he can soak up some
damage<00:00:45.289> you<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.410> want<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.620> bring<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
damage you do want to bring it to the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.540 
damage you do want to bring it to the
right<00:00:47.340> however<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:49.620> left<00:00:49.890> our<00:00:50.100> will<00:00:50.370> get

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
right however the left our will get

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.069 
right however the left our will get
involved<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.210> start<00:00:51.449> engaging<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.960> your
