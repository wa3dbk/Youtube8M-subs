we're<00:03:31.930> actually<00:03:32.110> editing<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.830> we<00:03:32.920> have<00:03:33.040> a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
separate video in this game but this is

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
all new parts and only capacitors and so

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.060 
all new parts and only capacitors and so
is<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.239> amplifier<00:03:52.870> I<00:03:53.170> want<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:53.829> show<00:03:54.010> you

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
is the amplifier I want to show you

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.190 
is the amplifier I want to show you
something<00:03:54.579> if<00:03:54.850> you<00:03:54.970> start<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.810> fart<00:03:56.079> around

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
something if you start to fart around

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.090 
something if you start to fart around
with<00:03:56.560> your<00:03:56.680> amplifier<00:03:57.220> is<00:03:58.030> -<00:03:58.420> it<00:03:58.570> lungs<00:03:58.980> can<00:03:59.980> be

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
with your amplifier is - it lungs can be

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.400 
with your amplifier is - it lungs can be
plugged<00:04:00.430> in<00:04:00.670> backwards<00:04:01.299> if<00:04:01.570> you<00:04:01.780> reverse<00:04:02.109> them

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
plugged in backwards if you reverse them

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.460 
plugged in backwards if you reverse them
and<00:04:03.070> will<00:04:03.280> blow<00:04:03.670> up<00:04:03.910> that<00:04:04.420> amplifier<00:04:05.109> and

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
and will blow up that amplifier and

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.580 
and will blow up that amplifier and
you'll<00:04:05.620> probably<00:04:05.769> damage<00:04:06.549> this<00:04:06.850> board<00:04:07.200> so<00:04:08.200> you

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
you'll probably damage this board so you

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.060 
you'll probably damage this board so you
need<00:04:08.799> to<00:04:08.950> mark<00:04:09.250> these<00:04:09.549> left<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.930> right<00:04:11.200> if<00:04:11.859> you

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
need to mark these left and right if you

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.560 
need to mark these left and right if you
are<00:04:12.220> starting<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.790> fart<00:04:13.060> around<00:04:13.180> without

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
are starting to fart around without

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
by still running when I was there you'll

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.270 
by still running when I was there you'll
see<00:04:45.240> them<00:04:45.420> and<00:04:45.660> look<00:04:46.290> let's<00:04:46.530> let's<00:04:46.980> look<00:04:47.130> at

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
see them and look let's let's look at

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.230 
see them and look let's let's look at
the<00:04:47.400> serial<00:04:47.730> number<00:04:48.030> Oh<00:04:48.830> 502<00:04:49.830> -<00:04:52.880> no<00:04:53.880> I<00:04:53.910> don't

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
the serial number Oh 502 - no I don't

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.210 
the serial number Oh 502 - no I don't
know<00:04:54.570> what<00:04:54.750> I<00:04:54.780> would've<00:04:55.380> assumed<00:04:55.770> that<00:04:56.010> means

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
know what I would've assumed that means

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.060 
know what I would've assumed that means
it's<00:04:56.510> five<00:04:57.510> thousand<00:04:58.140> twenty<00:04:58.290> two<00:04:58.680> but<00:04:58.920> it's

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
it's five thousand twenty two but it's

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.460 
it's five thousand twenty two but it's
hard<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.430> say<00:04:59.700> sometimes<00:04:59.970> they<00:05:00.930> only<00:05:01.080> use<00:05:01.290> the

hard to say sometimes they only use the
