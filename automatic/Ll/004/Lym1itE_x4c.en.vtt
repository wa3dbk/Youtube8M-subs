00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
okay right in neutral now the one

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.930 
okay right in neutral now the one
closest<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.780> put<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.170> down<00:00:58.550> okay<00:00:59.550> right

there that's like the basic setting okay
bounce<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:04.129> see<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.369> little<00:01:05.489> firm

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
bounce on that see it's a little firm

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.899 
bounce on that see it's a little firm
you<00:01:06.180> know<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.580> general<00:01:08.580> setting

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
you know it's like a general setting

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.670 
you know it's like a general setting
about<00:01:09.180> ninety<00:01:09.510> percent<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:10.020> time<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.470> good

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
about ninety percent of time it's good

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.320 
about ninety percent of time it's good
so<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.280> you're<00:01:11.400> going<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.700> some<00:01:11.909> canyon

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
so put the switch all the way toward the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.749 
so put the switch all the way toward the
front<00:01:16.350> put<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:18.830> see<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.860> suspension<00:01:20.430> is

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
put it in neutral now see how firm that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.719 
put it in neutral now see how firm that
is<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.900> barely<00:01:28.140> moves<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.250> now<00:01:29.430> when<00:01:29.610> you're

riding that low and you're going to be
cornering<00:02:15.030> you're<00:02:15.180> going<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.360> want<00:02:15.510> ground

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
cornering you're going to want ground

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.500 
cornering you're going to want ground
clearance<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:17.010> all<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.760> got<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.030> do<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.210> flip

clearance so all you got to do is flip

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.240 
clearance so all you got to do is flip
those<00:02:18.720> switches<00:02:18.750> up<00:02:20.720> see<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:22.070> raises<00:02:23.070> them

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
those switches up see that raises them

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.560 
those switches up see that raises them

rebound<00:03:05.220> air<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.700> compression<00:03:06.450> air<00:03:06.689> both

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
rebound air and compression air both

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.429 
rebound air and compression air both
high<00:03:07.829> pressure<00:03:08.189> so<00:03:09.150> that's<00:03:09.359> good<00:03:09.629> 90<00:03:10.019> percent

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
high pressure so that's good 90 percent

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.149 
high pressure so that's good 90 percent
of<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.620> time<00:03:10.829> right<00:03:11.129> there<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:13.159> that's

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
of the time right there that that's

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
compressor is large and it's bracketed

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.849 
compressor is large and it's bracketed
on<00:03:44.010> there<00:03:44.189> real<00:03:44.400> good<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:44.849> sturdy<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:46.500> shock

is one piece so it actually makes the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.490 
is one piece so it actually makes the
swingarm<00:03:50.129> sturdier<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.720> you'll<00:03:51.930> get<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.230> more

you feel when you're writing it'll be a

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.149 
you feel when you're writing it'll be a
north<00:03:54.840> side<00:03:55.109> right<00:03:55.470> like<00:03:55.709> if<00:03:55.859> you've<00:03:56.040> ever

freeway you felt that before so
something<00:04:04.049> really<00:04:04.079> yeah<00:04:04.620> some<00:04:04.919> self<00:04:05.280> tell

something really yeah some self tell
writers<00:04:05.849> do<00:04:06.060> something<00:04:06.419> don't<00:04:06.599> well<00:04:07.079> you'll

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
writers do something don't well you'll

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.720 
writers do something don't well you'll
notice<00:04:07.470> that<00:04:07.769> this<00:04:07.949> is<00:04:08.129> going<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.340> feel<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.579> lot

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
notice that this is going to feel a lot

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.149 
notice that this is going to feel a lot
more<00:04:08.790> stable<00:04:09.449> because<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.409> one<00:04:10.560> piece<00:04:10.799> shock

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
more stable because the one piece shock

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.629 
more stable because the one piece shock
makes<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.329> rear<00:04:12.540> suspension<00:04:13.319> a<00:04:13.560> more<00:04:14.340> stable

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
makes the rear suspension a more stable

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.240 
makes the rear suspension a more stable
member<00:04:15.180> instead<00:04:15.569> of<00:04:15.690> two<00:04:15.870> shocks<00:04:16.229> you<00:04:17.039> get

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
member instead of two shocks you get

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.279 
member instead of two shocks you get
some<00:04:17.549> monkey<00:04:18.180> motion<00:04:18.570> going<00:04:18.750> on<00:04:18.959> with<00:04:19.109> two

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
some monkey motion going on with two

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.529 
some monkey motion going on with two
shocks<00:04:19.590> with<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.430> one<00:04:20.579> shot<00:04:20.880> gets<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.209> lot<00:04:21.359> more

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
shocks with the one shot gets a lot more
