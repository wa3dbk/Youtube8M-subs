00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.720 

I

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.740 

a<00:00:14.790> lot<00:00:15.419> of<00:00:15.450> other<00:00:15.719> people<00:00:16.430> have<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.720> have<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
a lot of other people have a have a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.330 
a lot of other people have a have a
couple<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.170> pedals<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.770> go<00:00:19.860> straight<00:00:20.070> into

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
couple of pedals and go straight into

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.700 
couple of pedals and go straight into
the<00:00:20.550> amp<00:00:20.699> which<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.119> what<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.300> used<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.720> do<00:00:21.900> but

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
the amp which is what I used to do but

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.920 
the amp which is what I used to do but
then<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.759> more<00:00:23.939> effects<00:00:24.329> you<00:00:24.449> use<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
then the more effects you use on the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.720 
then the more effects you use on the
record<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.500> more<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.770> miss<00:00:26.130> them<00:00:26.310> when<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.460> play

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
record the more I miss them when I play

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:47.480 
record the more I miss them when I play
live<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.329> know<00:00:27.449> so

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.920 

I'm<00:00:48.000> I'm<00:00:48.990> a<00:00:49.050> gadget<00:00:49.440> freak<00:00:49.650> so<00:00:50.330> thus<00:00:51.330> we've<00:00:51.720> got

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
I'm I'm a gadget freak so thus we've got

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:09.880 
I'm I'm a gadget freak so thus we've got
this<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.560> know

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.240 

the<00:01:10.400> way<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.580> works<00:01:10.909> is<00:01:11.240> that<00:01:11.620> if<00:01:12.620> you<00:01:12.740> think<00:01:12.770> of

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
the way it works is that if you think of

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.420 
the way it works is that if you think of
like<00:01:13.460> a<00:01:13.490> 100<00:01:14.450> watt<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.800> happens<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.190> be<00:01:16.280> a

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
like a 100 watt and it happens to be a

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.390 
like a 100 watt and it happens to be a
marshal<00:01:17.030> that<00:01:17.060> was<00:01:17.510> modded<00:01:17.930> for<00:01:18.200> me<00:01:18.320> but<00:01:18.650> it

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
marshal that was modded for me but it

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.450 
marshal that was modded for me but it
has<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.640> send<00:01:20.210> in<00:01:20.330> return<00:01:20.530> basically<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:21.920> if<00:01:22.250> you

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
has a send in return basically so if you

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.160 
has a send in return basically so if you
think<00:01:22.490> of<00:01:22.760> that<00:01:22.880> one<00:01:23.090> it's<00:01:23.300> going<00:01:23.540> into<00:01:23.810> the

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
think of that one it's going into the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.750 
think of that one it's going into the
middle<00:01:24.470> cabinet<00:01:24.650> here<00:01:25.040> i<00:01:25.100> have<00:01:25.369> three

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
middle cabinet here i have three

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.100 
middle cabinet here i have three
cabinets<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.690> then<00:01:27.590> i<00:01:27.920> have<00:01:28.880> an<00:01:29.110> preamp

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
cabinets and then i have an preamp

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.100 
cabinets and then i have an preamp
switch<00:01:32.259> there's<00:01:33.259> a<00:01:33.380> fender<00:01:34.300> here<00:01:35.300> basement

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
switch there's a fender here basement

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
switch there's a fender here basement
and<00:01:36.290> there's<00:01:37.190> egg<00:01:37.580> nater<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:39.170> group<00:01:39.619> of<00:01:39.800> four

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
and there's egg nater a group of four

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.620 
and there's egg nater a group of four
preamp<00:01:40.550> so<00:01:40.759> in<00:01:41.060> fact<00:01:41.270> I<00:01:41.450> have<00:01:41.659> 15<00:01:42.460> here<00:01:43.460> as<00:01:43.729> well

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
preamp so in fact I have 15 here as well

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.170 
preamp so in fact I have 15 here as well
as<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.080> marshal<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.130> what<00:01:46.520> happens<00:01:46.880> is<00:01:47.000> the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
as the marshal so what happens is the

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.210 
as the marshal so what happens is the
preamps<00:01:47.690> which<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:48.050> puts<00:01:48.289> them<00:01:48.500> all<00:01:48.710> through

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
preamps which you puts them all through

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.540 
preamps which you puts them all through
the<00:01:49.430> back<00:01:49.610> end<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:51.229> power<00:01:51.770> section<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.430> the

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
the back end of the power section of the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.249 
the back end of the power section of the
Marshall<00:01:52.970> hundred<00:01:53.300> watt<00:01:53.450> which<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:53.990> quite

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
Marshall hundred watt which is quite

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.100 
Marshall hundred watt which is quite
unique<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:54.800> then<00:01:55.460> basically<00:01:56.119> all<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.750> stereo

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
unique and then basically all the stereo

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:16.620 
unique and then basically all the stereo
effects<00:01:58.149> return<00:01:59.149> through<00:01:59.690> all<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.170> lot<00:02:00.410> here

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.400 

and<00:02:17.580> then<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:18.880> have<00:02:19.180> mono<00:02:19.840> out<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.320> the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
and then so I have mono out of the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.810 
and then so I have mono out of the
middle<00:02:20.850> no<00:02:21.850> effects<00:02:22.270> except<00:02:23.520> for<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.700> know

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
middle no effects except for you know

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.120 
middle no effects except for you know

that<00:02:30.640> sort<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.000> stuff<00:02:31.240> goes<00:02:31.600> through<00:02:32.020> as<00:02:32.290> you

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
that sort of stuff goes through as you

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.890 
that sort of stuff goes through as you
normally<00:02:33.190> would<00:02:33.430> front<00:02:33.940> end<00:02:34.210> effects<00:02:34.600> you

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
normally would front end effects you

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.560 
normally would front end effects you
know<00:02:34.930> before<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.710> before<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.460> amp<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.910> they

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
know before the before the amp and they

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.170 
know before the before the amp and they
all<00:02:38.020> come<00:02:38.200> out<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.530> there<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:38.980> then<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.850> send

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
all come out of there and then the send

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.050 
all come out of there and then the send
sends<00:02:40.810> them<00:02:41.020> to<00:02:41.050> all<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.100> lot<00:02:42.430> in<00:02:42.610> here<00:02:42.910> and

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
sends them to all the lot in here and

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.400 
sends them to all the lot in here and
they<00:02:43.570> they<00:02:43.990> go<00:02:44.200> through<00:02:44.470> another<00:02:45.120> clean<00:02:46.120> a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
they they go through another clean a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.760 
they they go through another clean a
boogie<00:02:47.410> power<00:02:47.740> amp<00:02:48.570> which<00:02:49.570> puts<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.620> either

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
boogie power amp which puts it either

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.010 
boogie power amp which puts it either
side<00:02:51.130> here<00:02:51.430> so<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.760> stereo<00:02:52.120> affects<00:02:52.480> my

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
side here so the stereo affects my

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.990 
side here so the stereo affects my
delays<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.710> stuff<00:02:53.950> come<00:02:54.190> back<00:02:54.370> nice<00:02:54.970> and

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
delays and stuff come back nice and

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.190 
delays and stuff come back nice and
clean<00:02:55.450> either<00:02:56.110> side

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.990 

it's<00:03:06.030> 1973<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:08.709> just<00:03:09.310> messed<00:03:09.580> around<00:03:09.730> with

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
it's 1973 and I just messed around with

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.910 
it's 1973 and I just messed around with
it<00:03:10.209> for<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.450> while<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.660> then<00:03:10.989> started<00:03:11.470> using<00:03:11.680> it

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
it for a while and then started using it

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.949 
it for a while and then started using it
live<00:03:12.160> on<00:03:13.440> on<00:03:14.440> do<00:03:14.830> you<00:03:15.010> feel<00:03:15.280> just<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.810> end

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
section there and it was really

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.650 
section there and it was really
effective<00:03:20.800> I<00:03:21.010> mean<00:03:21.340> it's<00:03:21.550> a<00:03:21.760> it's<00:03:22.330> a<00:03:22.420> very
