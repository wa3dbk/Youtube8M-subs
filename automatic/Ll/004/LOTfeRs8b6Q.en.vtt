of course smartphone cameras are getting
better<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.730> better<00:00:08.790> but<00:00:09.389> they're<00:00:09.510> still

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
better and better but they're still

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.940 
better and better but they're still

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
going to be limited there's not going to

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.259 
going to be limited there's not going to
be<00:00:11.040> any<00:00:11.190> zoom<00:00:11.429> there's<00:00:11.820> gonna<00:00:11.910> be<00:00:12.030> some<00:00:12.150> little

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
be any zoom there's gonna be some little

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.030 
be any zoom there's gonna be some little
issues<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:12.840> far<00:00:12.990> as<00:00:13.139> just<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.469> small<00:00:13.679> sensor

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
issues as far as just the small sensor

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.499 
issues as far as just the small sensor
you<00:00:14.429> can't<00:00:14.639> get<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> best<00:00:15.089> images<00:00:15.360> all

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
you can't get you the best images all

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.880 
you can't get you the best images all
the<00:00:15.630> time<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.260> that's<00:00:16.320> where<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.590> Galaxy

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
the time so that's where the Galaxy

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.500 
the time so that's where the Galaxy
camera<00:00:17.070> comes<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.609> it's<00:00:17.910> basically<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.300> normal

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
camera comes in it's basically a normal

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.090 
camera comes in it's basically a normal
compact<00:00:19.020> camera<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.529> it's<00:00:19.619> got<00:00:19.710> all<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.980> guts

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
compact camera but it's got all the guts

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.529 
compact camera but it's got all the guts
of<00:00:20.250> something<00:00:20.550> like<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> Samsung<00:00:21.090> Galaxy<00:00:21.210> has

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
of something like the Samsung Galaxy has

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.939 
of something like the Samsung Galaxy has
to<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:21.720> built<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.050> taking<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.680> look<00:00:22.800> at<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
to be built in taking a look at the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.290 
to be built in taking a look at the
galaxy<00:00:23.250> camera<00:00:23.580> you'll<00:00:23.730> see<00:00:23.850> from<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> front

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
galaxy camera you'll see from the front

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.400 
galaxy camera you'll see from the front
it<00:00:24.390> looks<00:00:24.420> pretty<00:00:24.720> much<00:00:24.779> like<00:00:24.900> every<00:00:25.320> other

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
it looks pretty much like every other

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.259 
it looks pretty much like every other
compact<00:00:25.890> camera<00:00:26.189> around<00:00:26.460> cover<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.060> flip<00:00:27.210> it

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
compact camera around cover it flip it

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.400 
compact camera around cover it flip it
around<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.599> back<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.109> will<00:00:28.260> see<00:00:28.380> a

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
around to the back and you will see a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.919 
around to the back and you will see a
giant<00:00:28.890> 4.7<00:00:29.550> inch<00:00:29.670> display<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.689> very

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
giant 4.7 inch display so this is very

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.120 
giant 4.7 inch display so this is very
similar<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.529> will<00:00:31.590> find<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
similar to what you will find on the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.130 
similar to what you will find on the
galaxy<00:00:32.460> s3<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.059> what<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.660> means<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:33.989> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
galaxy s3 and what it means is that you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.479 
galaxy s3 and what it means is that you
actually<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:34.950> really<00:00:35.340> nice

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
actually have a really really nice

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.979 
actually have a really really nice
display<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.000> there's<00:00:36.270> no<00:00:36.390> other<00:00:36.570> buttons<00:00:36.899> on

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
display so there's no other buttons on

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.290 
display so there's no other buttons on
the<00:00:37.110> back<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> couple<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.190> top<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:38.760> as<00:00:39.120> far

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
the back or a couple up top here as far

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.850 
the back or a couple up top here as far
as<00:00:39.360> resume<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.870> whatnot<00:00:40.140> but<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> most

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
as resume and whatnot but for the most

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.229

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
using a normal Android smartphone it's

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.560 
using a normal Android smartphone it's
even<00:01:34.439> has<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> drop-down<00:01:35.189> notification<00:01:35.820> bar<00:01:36.000> so

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
of course you have a couple of specific

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.170 
of course you have a couple of specific
apps<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.340> example<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> video

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
apps so for example you have a video

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.030 
apps so for example you have a video
editor<00:01:39.600> which<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.840> definitely<00:01:40.079> cool<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.950> I

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
editor which is definitely cool and I

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.380 
editor which is definitely cool and I
can<00:01:41.159> actually<00:01:41.369> see<00:01:41.460> myself<00:01:41.610> actually<00:01:41.970> using

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
can actually see myself actually using

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.060 
can actually see myself actually using
this<00:01:42.509> example<00:01:43.079> shooting<00:01:43.500> some<00:01:43.649> video<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:43.890> an

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
this example shooting some video and an

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.190 
this example shooting some video and an
event<00:01:44.399> editing<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.329> device<00:01:45.479> uploading

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
event editing it on the device uploading

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.840 
event editing it on the device uploading
it<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.560> does<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.829> course<00:01:46.860> have<00:01:47.130> Wi-Fi

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
it because it does of course have Wi-Fi

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.030 
it because it does of course have Wi-Fi
as<00:01:47.970> well<00:01:48.000> as<00:01:48.210> 4G<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.200> also<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.829> Play

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
as well as 4G you also do have the Play

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.410 
as well as 4G you also do have the Play
Store<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:50.820> actually<00:01:50.909> not<00:01:51.149> going<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.360> be

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
