00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
I was basically breaking the quick

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.649 
I was basically breaking the quick
attack<00:01:30.829> I<00:01:30.950> mean<00:01:31.100> endeavor<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.090> quick<00:01:32.270> attacks

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
attack I mean endeavor and quick attacks

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.419 
attack I mean endeavor and quick attacks
combination<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:33.679> like<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:33.979> most<00:01:34.130> obvious

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
combination is like the most obvious

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.149 
combination is like the most obvious
thing<00:01:34.789> in<00:01:34.909> this<00:01:34.999> world<00:01:35.079> so<00:01:36.079> I<00:01:36.439> was<00:01:36.770> basically

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
thing in this world so I was basically

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.429 
thing in this world so I was basically
breaking<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.729> quick<00:01:38.179> attack<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:38.479> I<00:01:38.960> think

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
breaking the quick attack and I think

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.989 
breaking the quick attack and I think
that<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.619> noticed<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.280> very<00:01:40.520> beginning<00:01:40.820> of<00:01:40.909> the

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
that I noticed the very beginning of the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.429 
that I noticed the very beginning of the
game<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:41.240> that<00:01:41.390> this<00:01:41.450> guy<00:01:41.630> is<00:01:41.659> not<00:01:42.109> really

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
game is that this guy is not really

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.789 
game is that this guy is not really
