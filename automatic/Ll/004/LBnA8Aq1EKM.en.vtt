00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.360
 who has had the opportunity to give a 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.910
 tour around europe should know them 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.920
 are modern robust transiting in 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.500
 middle of the avenues without causing any type 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.470
 problem on the contrary in many 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.240
 cities like paris munich the amsterdam 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.789
 known light rail vehicles 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.730
 were the solution found to relieve 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.320
 the day-to-day traffic 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.360
 in Brazil the first region to 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.190
 experience vlt as a means of 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.350
 transport was ceará 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.600
 the solution was deployed to connect two 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.059
 cities of the hinterland and a 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 experience that worked today 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.629
 numerous projects for the construction 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.260
 of these means of transport here in the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.930
 Brazil 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.210
 some have not even left the paper and others have 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.520
 are in the final stages of implementation, as is the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.770
 Case Santos region of the VLT that 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.539
 will connect saint vicente to the port of santos in 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.620
 only 30 minutes 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.690
 and begins here in this first 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.630
 step here in the barreiro in the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.260
 here next season here at the site and 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.200
 he goes on the old train line told 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.930
 worldwide the old center saints 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.070
 nor to carry the core content in the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.060
 new miniseries and goes up to 14 port 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.979
 in the estuary 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.700
 then this transport that gives a 11 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.700
 kilometers 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.670
 the buses are big and can not 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.280
 to divert traffic from the city 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.450
 already the subway are fast and efficient but 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.580
 they cost dear 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.400
 vlt then appears as a new option 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.900
 that unites these two means is as if it were 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.390
 a super bus that travels in 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.390
 surface on rails 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.640
 much more comfortable and fast travel 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.030
 the first vlt landed in the port of 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.310
 Saints in May 2014 and now goes through 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.860
 intensive tests before receiving 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.990
 passengers on an experimental basis 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.930
 each time he is formed by seven 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.360
 connected modules that add up to 44 meters 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.640
 and has the ability to carry up to 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.640
 400 users and achieve a speed 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.709
 average of 25 kilometers per hour 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.900
 besides counting on the comfort of the air 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.850
 conditioning and lower floor to 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.310
 facilitate the movement of users 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.000
 with difficulty locomotion 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.320
 we will reduce around 20 to 30% 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.959
 of the buses 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.239
 then there is a gain in the frontal zone a 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.840
 government pollution reduction vlt 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.060
 the rails were also 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.640
 imported from Spain and are identical 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.709
 those used on the subway to supply 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.630
 nine and a half kilometers from the first phase 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.230
 were used two thousand and four 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.230
 tons 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.730
 despite being a vehicle that circulates 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.250
 on rails the sensation when walking in a 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.380
 VLT will be quite different because besides the 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.450
 noise is almost imperceptible the 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.280
 rails and the wheels have shock absorbers 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.150
 specials that avoid the trepidation 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.150
 during locomotion 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.680
 works are fast-paced 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.599
 if everything goes as expected the vlt 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.010
 must be circling the streets of 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.069
 saints and saints 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.140
 already in March 2015 but for this the 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.140
 engineers must overcome a series of 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.180
 challenges that range from mobilizing 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.909
 population to the foundation all done 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.349
 under the sand the seasons are all 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:30.659
 with spiked concrete piles is the 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.780
 bridges because the conditions of 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:37.920
 surnames on the channels and by question 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:42.689
 of not having interference with the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.370
 cards are channels that are not 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.879
 original design was a last highlight 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.150
 the root of you dig concrete then the 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:53.099
 slab or newspaper or the ground as a 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.620
 people changed this project because of 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.579
 contaminates the water in the canal and 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.019
 onwards 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.150
 the greatest challenge that engineers 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.909
 found it was precisely in this stretch 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.579
 of the joseph tunnel boy to pass the vlt 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.720
 here it is necessary to expand the height and 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.819
 tunnel width 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.159
 this is being used this 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.959
 equipment known as game 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.940
 the game itself for drilling 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.519
 and is widely used in 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.289
 Tunis constructs his role is 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.690
 make small holes in the rocks where 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.120
 dynamics will be deployed and thus 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.039
 inclusion in the case of this tunnel by 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.840
 a very populated area and the 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.180
 ground is not very reliable 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.030
 an explosion was out of the question to 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.639
 solution was to use more expansive 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.310
 further possible dynamite place is 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.680
 a knowledge that you make a hole 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.930
 big and be in there and when she goes 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.830
 surrounding neighborhood she will be able to use it 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.050
 expands 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:51.510
 then she expands her rock fracture in the 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.789
 rock is has an aspect that is even 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.460
 Beautiful, she makes plaques, huh? 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:05:01.009
 Are you going there with an equipment? 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.310
 any 11 high-end excavator in the 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.590
 scoreboard 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.690
 located on the yellow line viaduct 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.570
 on the avenue antônio emerick the difference 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.490
 notable after its complete demolition the 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.860
 viaduct was rebuilt with dimensions 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.050
 much larger 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.449
 below it will now pass two tracks 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.349
 beyond the vlt line and a 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.659
 bicycle path 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.430
 the same concern with the terrain did 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.770
 with which engineers invest in 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.789
 large containment walls and tie rods 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.189
 of concrete 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.889
 the whole work employs more than 180 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:32.719
 equipment and 1200 people 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.879
 the total investment of the project was 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:37.879
 1.9 billion reais 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:40.669
 when completed the line will have 22 3 and 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:43.009
 will serve 70 thousand users per day 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.120
 stay in the news of the world 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.490
 of construction 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.900
 we are watching the final tv of the play is 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.900
 building in motion 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.500
 hall
