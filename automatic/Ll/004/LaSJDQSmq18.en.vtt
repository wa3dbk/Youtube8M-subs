00:00:00.606 --> 00:00:02.977
 Another task - running a motorcycle. 

00:00:12.523 --> 00:00:14.457
 Remember, we do not have to run a motorcycle. 

00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:16.989
 It is a motorcycle exit from the garage. 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.856
 3 changes of direction are. 

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:33.222
 Okay, we're giving a foot. 

00:00:33.822 --> 00:00:35.246
 We leave the motorcycle. 

00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:42.616
 Please, first error when you take the motorcycle out of the garage. 

00:00:43.274 --> 00:00:47.925
 The foot is on the line where it should not be. 

00:00:48.558 --> 00:00:51.280
 The task needs to be repeated, we have the first mistake. 

00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:57.159
 At this point the motorcycle examiner re-introduces. 

00:01:07.206 --> 00:01:08.920
 And proceed to the task again. 

00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:31.024
 Remember - 3 changes in the direction of travel, during the first attempt there was no change in the direction to the rear. 

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.167
 Oh, you have to come forward. 

00:01:34.207 --> 00:01:35.930
 The trainee wanted to do this task at once. 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.740
 And unfortunately it is impossible at the same time. 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.410
 Back, forward, backward. 

00:01:56.158 --> 00:02:04.650
 The task is done correctly, preparation for driving, the next exam task - free slalom, 5 eights, free slalom. 

00:02:06.097 --> 00:02:06.890
 Here you are.
