rubber<00:00:33.360> weapon<00:00:33.809> nice<00:00:34.760> apparently<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:36.059> not

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
rubber weapon nice apparently I was not

rubber weapon nice apparently I was not
trying<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.780> do<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.050> well<00:00:37.500> enough<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.649> made

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
trying to do it well enough and I made

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.880 
trying to do it well enough and I made
the<00:00:40.950> crowbars<00:00:41.309> okay<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.989> cast<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the crowbars okay but the cast was a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.729 
the crowbars okay but the cast was a
failure<00:00:44.190> because<00:00:44.910> i<00:00:45.120> fused<00:00:45.690> both<00:00:46.170> sides<00:00:46.500> of

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
failure because i fused both sides of

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.590 
failure because i fused both sides of
the<00:00:47.809> thing<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.140> was<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.500> big<00:00:49.649> block<00:00:49.860> of

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
the thing so it was just a big block of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.279 
the thing so it was just a big block of
plaster<00:00:51.600> I've<00:00:51.960> I've<00:00:52.530> done<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.890> before<00:00:54.289> born

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
plaster I've I've done that before born

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.040 
plaster I've I've done that before born
when<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.649> did<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.100> first<00:00:56.370> crystal<00:00:57.149> skull<00:00:57.570> it

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
when I did the first crystal skull it

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.680 
when I did the first crystal skull it
was<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> complete<00:00:59.280> disaster<00:00:59.309> it<00:01:00.239> was<00:01:00.390> because

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
was a complete disaster it was because

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.569 
was a complete disaster it was because
when<00:01:00.870> you're<00:01:01.530> dealing<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:01.859> molding<00:01:02.370> it's

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
when you're dealing with molding it's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.910 
when you're dealing with molding it's
just<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:02.940> every<00:01:03.690> single<00:01:04.080> chemical<00:01:04.290> has<00:01:04.680> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
just like every single chemical has to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.399 
just like every single chemical has to
work<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.909> right<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.510> all<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.869> segments

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
work just right and all the segments

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.320 
work just right and all the segments
have<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.890> alignment<00:01:08.100> well<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.909> forgot

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
have to be in alignment well I forgot

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.160 
have to be in alignment well I forgot
the<00:01:10.310> important<00:01:11.310> part<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.960> putting<00:01:12.960> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the important part of putting a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.039 
the important part of putting a
separator<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.159> between<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:15.090> vaseline<00:01:15.810> or

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
separator in between like vaseline or

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.320 
separator in between like vaseline or
something<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.850> might<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.180> well

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
something like that so I might as well

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.880 
something like that so I might as well
just<00:01:18.720> poured<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> entire<00:01:19.170> thing<00:01:19.470> full<00:01:19.860> of

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
just poured the entire thing full of

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.490 
just poured the entire thing full of
plaster<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:20.850> just<00:01:21.180> been<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.509> well<00:01:21.780> now

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
plaster and then just been like well now

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.940 
plaster and then just been like well now
it<00:01:22.680> didn't<00:01:22.920> work<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:24.030> well<00:01:24.470> well<00:01:25.470> you're<00:01:25.860> going

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it didn't work so well well you're going

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.859 
it didn't work so well well you're going
to<00:01:26.009> try<00:01:26.250> again<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:27.060> guess<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.540> we're<00:01:27.689> going<00:01:27.780> to
