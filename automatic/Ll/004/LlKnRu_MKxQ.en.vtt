solution we're going to focus on taking
a<00:00:15.719> specific<00:00:16.199> gravity<00:00:16.379> from<00:00:16.800> our<00:00:17.010> beer<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.820> this

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
a specific gravity from our beer so this

a specific gravity from our beer so this
is<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.779> be<00:00:18.840> our<00:00:18.930> final<00:00:19.289> gravity

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
is going to be our final gravity

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.130 
is going to be our final gravity
measurement<00:00:20.300> we're<00:00:21.300> going<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.570> use<00:00:21.990> our

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
measurement we're going to use our

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:34.670

with our final gravity measurement we're

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.850 
with our final gravity measurement we're
aiming<00:00:37.480> for<00:00:37.660> something<00:00:37.990> that<00:00:38.350> is<00:00:38.500> roughly

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
aiming for something that is roughly

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.070 
aiming for something that is roughly
twenty-five<00:00:39.580> percent<00:00:39.850> of<00:00:40.360> what<00:00:40.600> we<00:00:40.750> started

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
twenty-five percent of what we started

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.280 
twenty-five percent of what we started
with<00:00:41.170> so<00:00:41.590> if<00:00:41.770> we<00:00:41.920> had<00:00:42.070> a<00:00:42.100> beer<00:00:42.520> that<00:00:42.550> started<00:00:42.760> at

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
with so if we had a beer that started at

tip<00:00:55.600> I'm<00:00:55.809> taking<00:00:56.350> your<00:00:56.500> measurement<00:00:56.950> it's

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
tip I'm taking your measurement it's

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.400 
tip I'm taking your measurement it's
right<00:00:57.640> before<00:00:57.820> you<00:00:58.059> take<00:00:58.270> it<00:00:58.420> give<00:00:59.170> a<00:00:59.200> little

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
right before you take it give a little

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.140 
right before you take it give a little
tap<00:00:59.710> and<00:00:59.980> unlock<00:01:00.340> some<00:01:00.520> of<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.670> bubbles<00:01:01.000> off

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
tap and unlock some of the bubbles off

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.020 
tap and unlock some of the bubbles off
and<00:01:01.360> give<00:01:01.450> you<00:01:01.570> more<00:01:01.750> accurate<00:01:02.230> measurement

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
and give you more accurate measurement

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.400 
and give you more accurate measurement
after<00:01:04.030> you've<00:01:04.180> taken<00:01:04.390> your<00:01:04.570> final<00:01:04.780> specific

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
after you've taken your final specific

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.080 
after you've taken your final specific
gravity<00:01:05.830> measurement<00:01:05.860> you<00:01:06.430> can<00:01:06.610> subtract

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
gravity measurement you can subtract

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.280 
gravity measurement you can subtract
that<00:01:07.300> from<00:01:07.360> your<00:01:07.630> original<00:01:07.720> gravity

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
that from your original gravity

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.550 
that from your original gravity
measurement<00:01:08.950> multiply<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.759> result<00:01:10.000> by<00:01:10.560> 131

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
measurement multiply the result by 131

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.170 
measurement multiply the result by 131
and<00:01:11.800> that<00:01:11.860> will<00:01:12.340> give<00:01:12.490> you<00:01:12.700> your<00:01:13.000> final

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
and that will give you your final

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.070 
and that will give you your final
alcohol<00:01:14.020> content<00:01:14.369> alcohol<00:01:15.369> by<00:01:15.520> potty<00:01:16.080> now

alcohol content alcohol by potty now
we're<00:01:17.259> going<00:01:17.380> to<00:01:17.500> start<00:01:17.649> worrying<00:01:17.979> about

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
we're going to start worrying about

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.639 
we're going to start worrying about
getting<00:01:18.460> our<00:01:18.820> priming<00:01:19.090> sugar<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.869> our<00:01:20.350> bottle
