00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.920
 [music] 

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:12.490
 greet you dear friends in touch 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:15.309
 professor keecker all our affection with you 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.259
 already come to an end but I did one 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.810
 slight omission i forgot you 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:22.359
 talk about a map more human 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.470
 body and the subject and will be devoted 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.470
 our video 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.110
 [music] 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.670
 and how to start directly 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.610
 considering the card more on our 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.230
 a copy of the experimental, I note that different 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.050
 people differently carry tattoos on 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.480
 same places also in women for 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.940
 week and during the menstrual cycle 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.010
 increases sensitivity and it happens 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.460
 sometimes ticklish even the most unpredictable 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.800
 all locations can be in the lives of most 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.110
 the frequency of that irah and we places it hands 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.290
 so let's start and directly link 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.960
 our hand consists of fingers 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.540
 nonsense shoulders and attention friends this one 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.760
 the part is called the forearm and this one 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.180
 the part is called the shoulder respectively 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.250
 this is the inner side of the cry 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.650
 I will say in advance that I share an approximate 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.440
 pore pain means four types first 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.380
 this is normal the second is tolerable third 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.180
 it hurts and 4 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.370
 where do you drown stop the sick 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.159
 the places on the hand are directly brush 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.830
 and fingers as is the lower part 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.520
 forearm elbow and inner side 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.890
 shoulder 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.270
 Well, everything in general but clear instead 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.939
 rings rings here also located 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.770
 bones as for the shoulder so here 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.420
 there are a lot of nerve endings 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.659
 as well as sweat glands 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.490
 therefore it is not necessary to choose 1 tattoo 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.409
 it is these places all the rest on hand 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.329
 I also want to note separately 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.280
 tattoos that do on the inside 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.259
 the hand and fingers is not necessary 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.640
 do them why are you very often 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.170
 use your hand in everyday life 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.329
 look after the tattoo will 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.429
 quite difficult well and 90 percent 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.630
 choose you just in time 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.000
 here 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.220
 go to the torso well let's go from the bottom up 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.349
 the most painful places here are these 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.750
 why here is very thin skin 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.569
 next is equal to the solar plexus and 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.180
 owed the junction of nerve endings to transform 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.830
 really quite a painful place 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.080
 due to the fact that the bones stick out also 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.700
 only bones come here 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.050
 bulge out 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.220
 go directly to 6 head very 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.110
 hit very hard on his Adam's apple 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.220
 Well, the whole head is very painful 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.750
 open place everything else 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.480
 pretty tolerable 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.250
 oh yeah forgot nipples asleep and as for 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.019
 back then all pretty tolerant 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.420
 maliciously apart from the district itself 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.299
 spine itself why is it because 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.340
 vertebrae bulge out 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.930
 obso below all intimate zone as well 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.120
 inner thigh and buttocks 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.650
 muscles pretty painful area 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.910
 why because there are so many 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.360
 nerve endings 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.000
 well you understand me hope also very 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.040
 it hurts to do here in this place 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.560
 back of the knee by the way the name 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.989
 This part of the body is not in one 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.209
 dictionary it's true go to screen in 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.239
 the principle of the game is pretty tolerant 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.190
 zone except that the exception is to 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.269
 a place where pasta is laid bare and due to 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.000
 that skin is thin 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.069
 it becomes very painful for us 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.720
 concerns the lower leg and also the rise of the foot 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.510
 this place is called lifting the foot by the way 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.950
 speaking on the model of the foot to do a tattoo 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.400
 pretty sick the reason that 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.430
 Again, the skin is thin and the bones are not necessarily 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.650
 works specifically here at this place hurt 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.450
 Further, everything is pretty tolerable that 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.200
 concerns this very patient zone here 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.060
 this knee 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.100
 why because here is in 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.769
 nearby skin bones as well here 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.690
 is a bundle of nerve when hit in 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.049
 it can give pain or in the course 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.850
 things are either down or somewhere near everything 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.920
 the rest is in principle quite tolerable 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.720
 and tolerably well as for intimate areas 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.819
 I think everyone understands everything very much 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.950
 thin skin and also she is very 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.530
 sensitive and well and by itself and 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.780
 hold it down 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.430
 the zone starts to touch you there and you 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.209
 starting to get excited blood starts 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.220
 shed 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.910
 and it is not clear how it all ends 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.110
 maybe not even a tattoo 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.730
 today we briefly ran through 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.830
 map over the human body and rise 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.750
 world want to say the following what is 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.549
 pain as well as happiness everyone understands 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.570
 in its own way and because everything is known in 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.790
 comparing 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.620
 so don't be afraid just go and do 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.970
 tattoo and then tell your with 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.040
 cycle you have a friend like you hurt 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.320
 or not while you smoke together 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.600
 spice panic everyone thanks for watching 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.749
