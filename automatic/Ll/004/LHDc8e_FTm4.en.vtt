 he asks for refugee status then 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.300
 said the participants of the meeting on her 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.110
 ending 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.520
 first mister soo danny phantom 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.789
 such a person exists 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:13.430
 second he asked for political asylum 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:16.300
 in Russia and asks to support him in this 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.879
 desire human rights community 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.790
 he asked to address the president 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.910
 united states of america with requests for 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.519
 that grossly violated the universal 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.010
 human rights declaration to my question about 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.410
 whether he knows about the condition of the president 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.269
 Putin 's granting that political 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.790
 asylum is possible only in that case 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.610
 if he stop causing damage 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.130
 united states of america mister 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.860
 answered yes again he said 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.209
 that it is easy for him to fulfill this requirement 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.849
 because firstly all he did 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.400
 already left in the past and what they say 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:55.310
 journalists not relevant to his 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.430
 current activities and in the future he is not 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.239
 intends to damage his country 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.950
 united states of america sergei what 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.510
 they say what snowdon looked like 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.400
 Are there any details of that 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.870
 where he was all this time how he lived 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.790
 snowden looked like that again 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.410
 duna which was shot in hong kong portrait 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.660
 on he was somewhat pale but quite 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.920
 cheerfully joked and the car gave out to understand that 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.329
 all this time he was in 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.620
 Sheremetyevo because he continued 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.060
 calmly talk when everyone 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.590
 the rest were confused time 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.750
 announcements will have on departures 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.720
 which are usually heard in the era of sail but 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.150
 here he said in thin already used to 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.200
 really tell all the participants 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.870
 meetings made sure that 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.519
 probabilistic given this ideological fighter is not 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.889
 He does not look like he was an agent of similar type 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.230
 on such a single person in that sense 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.970
 and gained sympathy for human rights activists and 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.950
 asked today they did not see those 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.280
 the most four laptops which are stored 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.800
 cigarettes again 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.599
 4 letters did not see he was on the sheet that 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.910
 called accompanied by two ladies 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.709
 translator airport employee and on 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.319
 say I understand why Moscow needs 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.680
 this airport because well, like Cerberus 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.290
 were our colleagues and 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.780
 something Sheremetyevo not allowing at all 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.189
 us to break the rules which are the same 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.659
 job asked him at the end 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.609
 opportunities to make at least a couple 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.590
 photos said that here only 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.479
 press which including supports 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.239
 he is waiting for confirmation that it’s better that 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.850
 here but apparently all the same for 5 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.169
 security is strong enough he said 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.800
 what he asks not to do it is 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.130
 reflection 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.449
 simply his life regina snowdon said 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.100
 that he seems to be ready to accept 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.720
 Russian conditions are good what's next 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.169
 technically legally would look 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.400
 obtaining from political asylum 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.810

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.820

 We arrived here and under the procedure 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.320
 likely to have to petition and 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.630
