00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 Y 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.600
 ah 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.040
 hi my facebook followers and 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.470
 youtube my name is angelica known 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.960
 As an angelic blazon, today I have them 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.630
 this reissued video of chiles 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.390
 stuffed and what I'm doing here is 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.000
 by stepping or roasting poblano peppers 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.170
 and this process is for the skin of the 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.170
 chile can take off 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.780
 also when doing this is it 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.019
 concentrating the flavor will not believe them 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.839
 will give a burnt taste let us burn 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.059
 until you get almost black chile 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.840
 all sides trying to preserve the 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.359
 stem to be able to ride the well 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.090
 I have an easier trick to unveil 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:16.270
 without breaking the chiles and 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.670
 keep and stay whole before 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.859
 to make them adam the chile carefully and 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.619
 cut in the trunk inside to take out 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:27.010
 the seed all together and thus make them 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:30.180
 later and the work will be less dirty 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.220
 when they had the chile well roasted 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.460
 remove it from the grill fire and 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.670
 let's leave it to rest in a bag 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.060
 plastic for about 10 to 20 minutes to 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.270
 your ID card easier skinning 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.270
 the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.770
 ah 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.170
 now here we are going to slide them and 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.800
 unveil but as I had already recorded this 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.500
 video more before I could not be the 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.790
 training before doing it and this is 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.920
 before they gave me that kit I'll put the 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.920
 bag to the side to put all the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.660
 skin there you can see it slide 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.490
 very easily the shell and is in the 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.670
 chile and this is because we leave them 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.980
 rest in the bag and if you do not do this 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.840
 step the peel will stick to the chili and 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.780
 it will be harder to peel them 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.040
 do not wash us like that, leave it because 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.020
 they will leave the taste 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.990
 here we will cut the cheese 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.000
 and here I am using fresh cheese but 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.000
 you can use the cheese that you like 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.390
 We are not going to cut the long chiles 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.180
 to make a bag and thus put the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.610
 cheese inside trying not to pierce the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.430
 opposite side of the chili if it will not open 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.400
 completely and it will be difficult to sustain the 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.920
 cheese inside 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.530
 now put the feed and close with a 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.299
 stick ensuring that it is firm 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.090
 to be able to ride with the egg 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.439
 beaten this agreement to take away the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.709
 stick before serving 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:12.959
 notify your family on the stick if not 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.959
 they will meet with the great surprise 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.590
 ok already having all the peppers 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.680
 lying down stir the flour 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.380
 use pot should be wheat flour 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.480
 to bake out the out proposals that 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.480
 we know here in the united states 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.950
 let's separate the yolks from the whites for 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:42.120
 be able to beat the whites to the point of nougat 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.120
 good until I 'm stiff 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.400
 When you start foaming, add 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.680
 the cream of tartar and this powder is going to 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.560
 help keep the whites firmer 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.819
 For a longer time do not add much 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.819
 that this is sour 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.450
 here deliver the salt 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.409
 When they have finished, undo the 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.930
 buds that you reserved and add only to 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.670
 the whites in the form of doubles for not 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.780
 remove the air that we have incorporated 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.780
 the Clares 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.160
 Y 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.900
 do not 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.060
 in a hot pan the corn oil 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.880
 or canola does not use olive oil 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.490
 to fry because like he does not write it 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.430
 very good but that is your choice 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.789
 grab your chili by the stem and capello 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.020
 with the egg and put it to fry 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.220
 remember to have the hot oil 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.220
 before frying 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.870
 they see that the egg sticks well 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.240
 flour is that the flour is the glue 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.160
 for the egg 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.800
 when they have the chili in the pan 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.680
 frying the spatula with the 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.340
 oil to crust over and 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.630
 so when they turn it over they do not know 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.630
 spread the egg sideways 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.770
 when they turn the chili they have 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.060
 caution as it releases water the chili and 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.060
 can jump oil 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.810
 bathing in chiles with the oil so that 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.810
 no raw egg 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.240
 if they could only garnish an egg 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.430
 only side as here put it in the 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.220
 pan immediately with a spoon 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.130
 big a hotel in handsome egg by 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.770
 over completely and well so that it 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.310
 It encapsulates the whole bandana again with 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.310
 oil 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.990
 turn it over and cook it completely 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:12.669
 here in the blender I have the tomato 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:15.969
 garlic onions cumin and pepper and 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:18.990
 I'm going to liquefy add the water so that 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:18.990
 can grind well 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:36.249
 in a saucepan put some oil and 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:38.490
 Season in the tomato with two or 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:41.690
 three bay leaves 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:45.289
 and also add the bouillon cubes 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.289
 revolve and cover 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.780
 when it is boiling add the 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.790
 raw vegetables and paper again up 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.730
 that the vegetables are soft 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:02.160
