this<00:00:07.930> patient<00:00:08.320> developed<00:00:09.000> significant

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
this patient developed significant

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.750 
this patient developed significant
corneal<00:00:10.420> thinning<00:00:11.549> irregularity<00:00:12.549> and

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760 
corneal thinning irregularity and

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.610 
corneal thinning irregularity and
eventually<00:00:13.299> scarring<00:00:13.840> and<00:00:13.990> poor<00:00:14.259> vision

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
eventually scarring and poor vision

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.089 
eventually scarring and poor vision
after<00:00:14.920> lasik<00:00:15.879> for<00:00:16.180> nearsightedness<00:00:17.099> this

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
after lasik for nearsightedness this

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:19.820 
after lasik for nearsightedness this
eventually<00:00:18.369> required<00:00:18.880> a<00:00:19.119> corneal<00:00:19.509> transplant

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
eventually required a corneal transplant

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.560 
eventually required a corneal transplant
here<00:00:20.830> I'm<00:00:20.980> measuring<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.490> size<00:00:21.759> of<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:22.210> scar

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
here I'm measuring the size of the scar

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.600 
here I'm measuring the size of the scar
to<00:00:22.930> determine<00:00:23.380> the<00:00:23.470> size<00:00:23.710> of<00:00:23.919> the<00:00:23.980> transplant

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
to determine the size of the transplant

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.659 
to determine the size of the transplant
I<00:00:24.910> have<00:00:25.840> selected<00:00:26.140> a<00:00:26.439> circular<00:00:26.950> blade<00:00:27.279> or<00:00:27.610> a

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
I have selected a circular blade or a

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.389 
I have selected a circular blade or a
trephine<00:00:28.570> of<00:00:29.020> appropriate<00:00:29.829> size<00:00:29.860> to<00:00:30.040> get

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399 
trephine of appropriate size to get

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.370 
trephine of appropriate size to get
around<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:30.820> scar<00:00:31.149> and<00:00:31.419> I'm<00:00:31.869> marking<00:00:32.259> the

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
around the scar and I'm marking the

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.870 
around the scar and I'm marking the
cornea<00:00:32.710> to<00:00:32.860> make<00:00:33.010> sure<00:00:33.160> it<00:00:33.280> gets<00:00:33.399> all<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.760> way

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
cornea to make sure it gets all the way

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.319 
cornea to make sure it gets all the way
around<00:00:34.920> I'm<00:00:35.920> now<00:00:36.160> placing<00:00:36.610> a<00:00:36.670> flow<00:00:36.940> ringer

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
around I'm now placing a flow ringer

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.030 
around I'm now placing a flow ringer
ring<00:00:37.570> on<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:38.410> eye<00:00:38.440> which<00:00:39.190> I<00:00:39.340> will<00:00:39.490> secure<00:00:40.060> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
ring on the eye which I will secure to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.620 
ring on the eye which I will secure to
prevent<00:00:42.040> the<00:00:42.190> AI<00:00:42.220> from<00:00:42.310> becoming<00:00:42.850> too<00:00:42.970> soft

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
prevent the AI from becoming too soft

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.330 
prevent the AI from becoming too soft
during<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.110> cornea<00:00:44.440> transplant<00:00:45.040> surgery

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
during the cornea transplant surgery

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.970 
during the cornea transplant surgery
here<00:00:48.340> I'm<00:00:48.460> making<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:48.850> mark<00:00:49.090> reappear<00:00:50.079> and<00:00:50.829> I

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
here I'm making the mark reappear and I

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.880 
here I'm making the mark reappear and I
will<00:00:51.130> place<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.700> trephine<00:00:52.570> right<00:00:53.500> on<00:00:53.680> that

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
will place the trephine right on that

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.150 
will place the trephine right on that
mark<00:00:53.920> so<00:00:54.850> it's<00:00:55.030> exactly<00:00:55.690> where<00:00:56.140> I<00:00:56.440> want<00:00:56.950> the

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
mark so it's exactly where I want the

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.180 
mark so it's exactly where I want the
incision<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:57.670> be<00:00:57.940> made<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.500> treefon<00:00:59.890> is<00:01:00.100> a

suction device which is secured to the

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.789 
suction device which is secured to the
eye<00:01:02.079> and<00:01:02.950> once<00:01:03.130> it's<00:01:03.310> secured<00:01:03.910> I<00:01:04.409> spin<00:01:05.409> the

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
eye and once it's secured I spin the

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.559 
eye and once it's secured I spin the
circular<00:01:06.340> blade<00:01:06.700> to<00:01:07.479> an<00:01:07.570> exact<00:01:07.990> depth<00:01:08.380> to

remove<00:02:50.270> some<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:50.720> jelly<00:02:50.959> inside<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.800> eye

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
remove some of the jelly inside the eye

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.740 
remove some of the jelly inside the eye
and<00:02:52.250> also<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.790> make<00:02:53.000> sure<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.480> cornea

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
and also to make sure the cornea

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:02.229 
and also to make sure the cornea
transplant<00:02:54.350> is<00:02:54.500> in<00:02:54.830> excellent<00:02:55.430> position<00:03:01.239> 116

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
transplant is in excellent position 116

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.800 
transplant is in excellent position 116
sutures<00:03:03.080> are<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.440> then<00:03:04.120> suture<00:03:05.120> ends<00:03:05.390> are<00:03:05.660> all

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
sutures are in then suture ends are all

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.509 
sutures are in then suture ends are all
cut<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.709> knots<00:03:06.920> are<00:03:07.190> buried<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:09.519> then

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
cut and the knots are buried I then

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.520 
cut and the knots are buried I then
check<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.940> wound<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.390> make<00:03:11.540> sure<00:03:11.750> everything

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
check the wound to make sure everything

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.039 
check the wound to make sure everything
is<00:03:12.680> intact<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:13.580> there's<00:03:13.790> no<00:03:14.000> leaking<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:17.049> then

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
is intact and there's no leaking I then

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.289 
is intact and there's no leaking I then
check<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.709> corneal<00:03:19.100> curvature<00:03:19.549> to<00:03:19.910> make<00:03:20.060> sure

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
check the corneal curvature to make sure

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.210 
check the corneal curvature to make sure
it<00:03:20.480> is<00:03:20.600> as<00:03:20.720> round<00:03:20.989> as<00:03:21.170> possible<00:03:21.410> at<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:21.920> end<00:03:21.950> of

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
it is as round as possible at the end of

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.729 
it is as round as possible at the end of
surgery<00:03:22.840> once<00:03:23.840> it's<00:03:24.049> nice<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.260> round

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
surgery once it's nice and round

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.140 
surgery once it's nice and round
I<00:03:24.769> remove<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.100> fleur<00:03:25.400> Inga<00:03:25.610> ring<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.000> the
