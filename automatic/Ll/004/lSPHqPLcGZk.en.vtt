the feel of it again so much personal
preference<00:00:50.449> with<00:00:50.660> that<00:00:50.750> kind<00:00:50.989> of<00:00:51.079> stuff<00:00:51.399> now

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
preference with that kind of stuff now

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.729 
preference with that kind of stuff now
when<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.719> big<00:00:53.899> difference<00:00:54.230> between<00:00:54.289> these

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
when the big difference between these

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.000 
when the big difference between these
two<00:00:55.010> particular<00:00:55.510> ones<00:00:56.510> is<00:00:57.289> this<00:00:57.559> a<00:00:57.620> much

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
two particular ones is this a much

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.829 
two particular ones is this a much
steeper<00:00:59.410> curve<00:01:00.410> to<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:01.339> claw<00:01:01.579> part<00:01:02.000> you<00:01:02.629> can

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
steeper curve to the claw part you can

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.240 
steeper curve to the claw part you can
get<00:01:03.019> a<00:01:04.360> wood<00:01:05.360> handle<00:01:05.810> with<00:01:06.020> any<00:01:06.380> type<00:01:06.710> claw<00:01:07.010> so

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
get a wood handle with any type claw so

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.670 
get a wood handle with any type claw so
I'm<00:01:07.310> going<00:01:07.430> to<00:01:07.490> come<00:01:07.610> straight<00:01:07.970> back<00:01:08.110> but<00:01:09.110> it's

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
I'm going to come straight back but it's

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.390 
I'm going to come straight back but it's
not<00:01:10.540> it<00:01:11.540> doesn't<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:12.260> handles<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.070> handles

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
not it doesn't the handles the handles

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.090 
not it doesn't the handles the handles
can<00:01:13.460> be<00:01:13.610> on<00:01:13.790> any<00:01:14.030> type<00:01:14.390> of<00:01:14.420> head<00:01:14.810> it's<00:01:15.710> just<00:01:16.010> a

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
can be on any type of head it's just a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.930 
can be on any type of head it's just a
different<00:01:16.430> type<00:01:16.640> of<00:01:16.840> handle<00:01:17.840> system<00:01:18.130> so<00:01:19.130> what

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
different type of handle system so what

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.710 
different type of handle system so what
the<00:01:20.060> claws<00:01:20.330> he<00:01:20.660> is<00:01:20.780> for<00:01:21.170> is<00:01:21.640> for<00:01:22.640> for<00:01:23.360> pulling

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
the claws he is for is for for pulling

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.930 
the claws he is for is for for pulling
nails<00:01:23.930> can<00:01:24.320> pull<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.620> nail<00:01:24.800> out<00:01:24.830> now<00:01:25.730> one

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
nails can pull the nail out now one

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.330 
nails can pull the nail out now one
thing<00:01:26.150> I<00:01:26.270> wanted<00:01:26.510> to<00:01:26.570> point<00:01:26.660> out<00:01:27.110> was<00:01:27.470> when

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
thing I wanted to point out was when

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.910 
thing I wanted to point out was when
you're<00:01:28.460> pulling<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.940> nail<00:01:29.210> out<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:30.590> least

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
you're pulling a nail out the least

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.530 
you're pulling a nail out the least
force<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.550> pull<00:01:31.760> it<00:01:31.910> out<00:01:32.030> it's<00:01:32.270> going<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.480> be

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
force to pull it out it's going to be

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.170 
force to pull it out it's going to be
straight<00:01:33.080> up<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.470> down<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:34.640> if<00:01:34.760> you<00:01:34.880> start

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
straight up and down and if you start

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.600 
straight up and down and if you start
pulling<00:01:35.480> it<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.840> side<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.620> know<00:01:37.190> how<00:01:37.400> that

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
pulling it to the side you know how that

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.450 
pulling it to the side you know how that
that<00:01:38.090> can<00:01:38.300> happen<00:01:38.510> is<00:01:38.840> with<00:01:39.050> a<00:01:39.080> claw<00:01:39.440> itself<00:01:40.160> if

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
that can happen is with a claw itself if

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.580 
that can happen is with a claw itself if
you<00:01:40.880> have<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.060> claw<00:01:41.360> here<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:41.840> you're<00:01:42.230> grabbing

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
you have a claw here and you're grabbing

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.390 
you have a claw here and you're grabbing
the<00:01:42.920> nail<00:01:43.100> way<00:01:43.430> up<00:01:43.670> here<00:01:44.920> once<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.070> pull<00:01:46.280> it

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
the nail way up here once you pull it

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.610 
the nail way up here once you pull it
out<00:01:46.490> partway<00:01:46.910> it<00:01:47.360> really<00:01:47.630> goes<00:01:47.810> at<00:01:48.020> an<00:01:48.110> angle

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
out partway it really goes at an angle

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.440 
out partway it really goes at an angle
so<00:01:49.190> what<00:01:49.460> you're<00:01:49.610> doing<00:01:49.640> is<00:01:50.030> you're<00:01:50.210> bending

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
so what you're doing is you're bending

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.510 
so what you're doing is you're bending
the<00:01:50.630> nail<00:01:51.050> in<00:01:51.410> you're<00:01:51.740> pushing<00:01:52.160> it<00:01:52.250> into<00:01:52.400> the

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
the nail in you're pushing it into the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.240 
the nail in you're pushing it into the
wood<00:01:52.760> at<00:01:52.910> the<00:01:53.000> same<00:01:53.210> time<00:01:53.740> ideally<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:55.040> pull

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
wood at the same time ideally you pull

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.860 
wood at the same time ideally you pull
it<00:01:55.370> straight<00:01:55.520> up<00:01:55.760> well<00:01:56.480> you<00:01:56.570> don't<00:01:56.660> get<00:01:56.810> a

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
it straight up well you don't get a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.660 
it straight up well you don't get a
lever<00:01:57.170> action<00:01:57.410> by<00:01:57.740> pulling<00:01:58.100> completely

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
lever action by pulling completely

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.020 
lever action by pulling completely
