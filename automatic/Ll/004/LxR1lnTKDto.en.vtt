way mock up here underneath the box but

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.769

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.280 
videos not saying their builds were bad
I'm<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:32.969> saying<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.540> what<00:00:33.750> I've<00:00:33.840> heard<00:00:34.050> and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290

what I've read online and just seeing

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.670 
what I've read online and just seeing
the<00:00:36.480> way<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.690> parts<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.200> everything<00:00:37.500> so

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the way the parts are and everything so

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.720 
the way the parts are and everything so
I<00:00:37.710> wasn't<00:00:37.890> really<00:00:38.160> thinking<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.489> was<00:00:38.640> going

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
I wasn't really thinking this was going

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.940 
I wasn't really thinking this was going
to<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> great<00:00:39.149> kit<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.420> start<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:39.950> but

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
to be a great kit to start with but

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
to be a great kit to start with but
after<00:00:41.629> putting<00:00:42.629> some<00:00:42.899> stuff<00:00:42.989> together

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
after putting some stuff together

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.160 
after putting some stuff together
looking<00:00:43.739> at<00:00:43.829> all<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> parts<00:00:44.280> I'm<00:00:44.430> really<00:00:44.640> not

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
looking at all the parts I'm really not

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.510 
looking at all the parts I'm really not
satisfied<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:47.070> probably<00:00:47.340> just

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
satisfied at all so I'm probably just

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279 
satisfied at all so I'm probably just
gonna<00:00:47.730> stop<00:00:48.000> where<00:00:48.180> I'm<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.480> take<00:00:48.960> everything

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
gonna stop where I'm at take everything

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.869 
gonna stop where I'm at take everything
apart<00:00:49.379> bag<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.950> back<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.550> get<00:00:50.700> rid<00:00:50.820> of

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
apart bag it back up and just get rid of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.729 
apart bag it back up and just get rid of
the<00:00:51.000> kit<00:00:51.180> because<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:54.559> think<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
the kit because I have the think it's a

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.479 
the kit because I have the think it's a
Revell<00:00:56.449> 56<00:00:57.449> Ford<00:00:57.750> f100<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.590> ed<00:00:58.770> Roth<00:00:58.980> version

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
Revell 56 Ford f100 the ed Roth version

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.790 
Revell 56 Ford f100 the ed Roth version
far<00:01:00.449> better<00:01:00.719> detailing<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.320> know<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
far better detailing I know it's not a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.560 
far better detailing I know it's not a
55<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.579> think<00:01:02.760> they<00:01:02.879> make<00:01:03.030> another<00:01:03.270> version

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
55 but I think they make another version

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.960 
55 but I think they make another version
of<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.899> 55<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.580> actually<00:01:05.729> build

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
of this 55 that you can actually build

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.250 
of this 55 that you can actually build
stock<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.510> everything<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.930> just<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
stock and everything this is just a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.289 
stock and everything this is just a
street<00:01:07.500> rod<00:01:07.650> version<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.880> from<00:01:09.060> what<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.210> can

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
street rod version and from what I can

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.859 
street rod version and from what I can
tell<00:01:09.890> they<00:01:10.890> modeled<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.430> after<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.850> 80s<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
tell they modeled this after a 80s to

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.190 
tell they modeled this after a 80s to
90s<00:01:13.729> Street<00:01:14.729> riding<00:01:14.939> kind<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.810> conversion

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
90s Street riding kind of conversion

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.320

either a Cordoba or of a lower I think
they<00:01:31.350> call<00:01:31.530> them<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.670> torsion<00:01:33.570> bar

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
they call them and it's a torsion bar

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.090 
they call them and it's a torsion bar
style<00:01:33.990> front<00:01:34.259> suspension<00:01:34.770> which<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:34.890> the

style front suspension which is the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.530 
style front suspension which is the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
goofiest thing I've ever seen why they

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.080 
goofiest thing I've ever seen why they
didn't<00:01:36.780> put<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.229> Mustang<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.280> style<00:01:38.579> suspension

didn't put a Mustang to style suspension

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.280 
didn't put a Mustang to style suspension
with<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> coil<00:01:39.450> overs<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.900> everything<00:01:40.200> it

with the coil overs and everything it

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.840 
with the coil overs and everything it
would<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.470> made<00:01:40.530> more<00:01:40.710> sense<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.549> looks<00:01:41.700> like

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
would have made more sense it looks like

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.730 
would have made more sense it looks like
you<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:42.060> might<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.720> able<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.990> convert<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you can might be able to convert this to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.510 
you can might be able to convert this to
something<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.250> you'll<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.460> to

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
something like that you'll have to

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.859 
something like that you'll have to
remake<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> spindles<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.509> everything<00:01:45.750> but

the five layer and everything and I

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.040 
the five layer and everything and I
think<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.820> things<00:02:23.240> that<00:02:23.420> I'm<00:02:23.540> most<00:02:23.570> upset

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
think the the things that I'm most upset

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.810 
think the the things that I'm most upset
about<00:02:24.410> this<00:02:24.680> kit<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:26.200> wheels<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.410> tires

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
about this kit is the wheels and tires

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.720 
about this kit is the wheels and tires
and<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:30.020> front<00:02:30.380> rear<00:02:30.560> suspension<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.400> just

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
and the front rear suspension I just

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.420 
and the front rear suspension I just
don't<00:02:31.970> see<00:02:32.240> why<00:02:32.860> they<00:02:33.860> did<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.160> like<00:02:34.280> this

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
don't see why they did it like this

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.160 
don't see why they did it like this
maybe<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.940> original<00:02:35.030> version<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.690> came<00:02:35.960> out

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
maybe the original version that came out

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.390 
maybe the original version that came out
it<00:02:36.350> was<00:02:36.410> done<00:02:36.620> like<00:02:36.770> this<00:02:36.920> for<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.190> certain

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
it was done like this for a certain

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.130 
it was done like this for a certain
reason<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.030> if<00:02:38.150> anybody<00:02:38.480> knows<00:02:38.540> like<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:38.930> said

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
know I didn't look that far into it but

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.130 
know I didn't look that far into it but
like<00:02:43.820> I<00:02:43.910> said<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.180> reissue<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.780> just<00:02:44.960> it

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
doesn't fit anywhere for me I find it to

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.490 
doesn't fit anywhere for me I find it to
be<00:02:47.090> goofy<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.810> mean<00:02:47.960> the<00:02:48.050> engine<00:02:48.380> and

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
be goofy I mean the engine and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.860 
be goofy I mean the engine and
transmission<00:02:48.770> swap<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.270> can<00:02:50.420> understand

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
transmission swap that I can understand

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.750 
transmission swap that I can understand
because<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.800> was<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.920> really<00:02:52.040> popular<00:02:52.280> swap

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
because that was a really popular swap

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.940 
because that was a really popular swap
to<00:02:52.910> do<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.210> five<00:02:53.450> liter<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.990> you<00:02:54.650> have<00:02:54.800> all

to do the five liter and you have all

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.770 
to do the five liter and you have all
the<00:02:55.070> parts<00:02:55.280> almost<00:02:55.580> besides<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.300> air<00:02:56.450> cleaner

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
the parts almost besides the air cleaner

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.780 
the parts almost besides the air cleaner
to<00:02:57.020> build<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.410> tripower<00:02:58.040> setup<00:02:58.520> it<00:02:58.640> looks

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
to build the tripower setup it looks

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.680 
to build the tripower setup it looks
like<00:02:59.030> so<00:03:00.070> but<00:03:01.070> I<00:03:01.100> mean<00:03:01.160> overall<00:03:01.340> just<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:02.180> mean

the parts are good and the mock-up went

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.180 
the parts are good and the mock-up went
pretty<00:03:05.120> good<00:03:05.420> from<00:03:05.750> what<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:05.900> did<00:03:06.200> there's<00:03:07.130> a

know<00:03:20.810> I've<00:03:21.020> seen<00:03:21.170> it<00:03:21.230> quiet<00:03:21.500> quite<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:21.980> few

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
know I've seen it quiet quite a few

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.520 
know I've seen it quiet quite a few
different<00:03:22.550> times<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:24.020> parts<00:03:24.260> are<00:03:24.350> good<00:03:24.500> I

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
different times and the parts are good I

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.810 
different times and the parts are good I
mean<00:03:24.770> I<00:03:24.860> don't<00:03:24.920> know<00:03:25.070> maybe<00:03:25.190> they<00:03:25.400> did<00:03:25.580> a<00:03:25.610> new

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
mean I don't know maybe they did a new

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.100 
mean I don't know maybe they did a new
tooling<00:03:26.209> on<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.420> mould<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:26.780> everything

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
tooling on the mould and everything

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.840 
tooling on the mould and everything
because<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.380> really<00:03:27.590> isn't<00:03:27.740> much<00:03:28.160> flash<00:03:28.490> it

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
because it really isn't much flash it

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.130 
because it really isn't much flash it
just<00:03:29.030> seems<00:03:29.209> like<00:03:29.300> some<00:03:29.570> of<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.690> parts<00:03:29.990> don't

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
just seems like some of the parts don't

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.760 
just seems like some of the parts don't
fit<00:03:30.290> quite<00:03:30.650> right<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.870> rear<00:03:33.320> end<00:03:33.350> seems

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
fit quite right and the rear end seems

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.110 
fit quite right and the rear end seems
to<00:03:33.890> sit<00:03:34.070> up<00:03:34.160> too<00:03:34.310> high<00:03:34.459> actually<00:03:34.850> don't<00:03:35.000> even

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
to sit up too high actually don't even

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.730 
to sit up too high actually don't even
have<00:03:35.360> and<00:03:35.660> there's<00:03:35.870> some<00:03:36.020> fit<00:03:36.200> issues<00:03:36.230> what<00:03:36.709> I

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
have and there's some fit issues what I

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.940 
have and there's some fit issues what I
found<00:03:36.980> with<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:37.310> differential<00:03:38.060> here<00:03:38.950> so

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
found with this differential here so

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.199 
found with this differential here so
that's<00:03:40.100> one<00:03:40.310> of<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.459> reasons<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:40.850> just<00:03:41.060> don't

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
that's one of the reasons I just don't

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.430 
that's one of the reasons I just don't
want<00:03:41.330> to<00:03:41.360> mess<00:03:41.510> with<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:41.870> honestly<00:03:41.990> I<00:03:42.290> have

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
want to mess with it honestly I have

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.290 
want to mess with it honestly I have
enough<00:03:42.680> other<00:03:43.040> projects<00:03:43.640> I<00:03:43.790> wanted<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.120> kind

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
enough other projects I wanted to kind

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.460 
enough other projects I wanted to kind
of<00:03:44.360> have<00:03:44.510> this<00:03:44.690> is<00:03:44.870> just<00:03:44.900> something<00:03:45.200> I<00:03:45.290> could

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
of have this is just something I could

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.310 
of have this is just something I could
test<00:03:45.880> different<00:03:46.880> painting<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:48.230> know

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
test different painting and you know

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.780 
test different painting and you know
just<00:03:48.590> stuff<00:03:48.770> like<00:03:48.860> that<00:03:49.130> really<00:03:49.340> nothing<00:03:49.580> I

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
just stuff like that really nothing I

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.190 
just stuff like that really nothing I
could<00:03:49.850> I<00:03:50.120> didn't<00:03:50.390> really<00:03:50.540> want<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.750> mod<00:03:50.930> it<00:03:50.959> at

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
could I didn't really want to mod it at

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.610 
could I didn't really want to mod it at
all

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
all

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.390 
all
but<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.310> just<00:03:52.520> I'm<00:03:52.730> not<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.940> fan<00:03:53.330> of<00:03:53.360> it<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:55.100> front

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
but I just I'm not a fan of it the front

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.740 
but I just I'm not a fan of it the front
suspension<00:03:55.580> just<00:03:56.270> doesn't<00:03:56.570> look<00:03:56.690> right

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
suspension just doesn't look right

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.380 
suspension just doesn't look right
itself<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.350> Chrysler<00:03:58.000> because<00:03:59.000> I<00:03:59.060> even<00:03:59.240> looked

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
itself a Chrysler because I even looked

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.630 
itself a Chrysler because I even looked
at<00:03:59.510> forward<00:03:59.840> torsion<00:04:00.200> bars<00:04:00.640> independent

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
at forward torsion bars independent

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.430 
at forward torsion bars independent
front<00:04:01.790> suspension<00:04:01.850> and<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.959> only<00:04:03.110> thing<00:04:03.290> that

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
front suspension and the only thing that

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.370 
front suspension and the only thing that
comes<00:04:03.560> up<00:04:03.830> is<00:04:04.070> for<00:04:04.520> trucks<00:04:04.959> so<00:04:05.959> I<00:04:05.990> know<00:04:06.140> it's<00:04:06.320> a

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
comes up is for trucks so I know it's a

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.690 
comes up is for trucks so I know it's a
Chrysler<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:06.830> did<00:04:07.010> a<00:04:07.040> little<00:04:07.190> bit<00:04:07.340> of<00:04:07.370> research

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
Chrysler I did a little bit of research

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.760 
Chrysler I did a little bit of research
and<00:04:07.940> it<00:04:08.180> is<00:04:08.330> a<00:04:08.360> popular<00:04:08.870> swap<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.380> use<00:04:09.500> the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
and it is a popular swap to use the

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.479 
and it is a popular swap to use the
Cordoba<00:04:10.730> or<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.209> velour<00:04:11.510> front<00:04:11.900> suspension

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
Cordoba or the velour front suspension

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.949 
Cordoba or the velour front suspension
they<00:04:13.489> were<00:04:13.550> ex<00:04:13.820> old<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.330> doesn't<00:04:14.630> even<00:04:14.690> have

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
they were ex old it doesn't even have

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.060 
they were ex old it doesn't even have
you<00:04:15.080> instead<00:04:15.380> it's<00:04:15.560> got<00:04:15.650> this<00:04:15.830> thing<00:04:16.040> here

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
you instead it's got this thing here

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.949 
you instead it's got this thing here
mocking<00:04:16.370> it<00:04:16.609> up<00:04:16.760> it<00:04:17.299> doesn't<00:04:17.480> even<00:04:17.660> have<00:04:17.810> that

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
mocking it up it doesn't even have that

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.479 
mocking it up it doesn't even have that
middle<00:04:18.109> differential<00:04:18.799> on<00:04:18.919> there<00:04:19.100> so<00:04:19.340> it's

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
middle differential on there so it's

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.830 
middle differential on there so it's
going<00:04:19.640> to<00:04:19.700> sit<00:04:20.000> quite<00:04:20.419> a<00:04:20.450> bit<00:04:20.630> higher<00:04:20.810> than

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
going to sit quite a bit higher than

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.270 
going to sit quite a bit higher than
this<00:04:21.049> this<00:04:21.260> actually<00:04:21.470> has<00:04:21.830> it<00:04:22.010> to<00:04:22.100> where<00:04:22.220> it

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
this this actually has it to where it

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.680 
this this actually has it to where it
sits<00:04:22.490> level<00:04:22.700> I<00:04:22.940> don't<00:04:23.030> have<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.330> rims<00:04:23.540> in

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
sits level I don't have the rims in

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.050 
sits level I don't have the rims in
there<00:04:23.840> it's<00:04:23.960> got<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.140> back<00:04:24.380> plates<00:04:24.680> I<00:04:25.060> mean

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
there it's got the back plates I mean

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.220 
there it's got the back plates I mean
the<00:04:26.120> wheels<00:04:26.270> do<00:04:26.540> role<00:04:26.780> that<00:04:27.050> the

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
the wheels do role that the

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.040 
the wheels do role that the
wheels<00:04:27.350> and<00:04:27.560> tires<00:04:27.740> are<00:04:27.950> so<00:04:28.220> small<00:04:28.580> on<00:04:28.790> this

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
wheels and tires are so small on this

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.420 
wheels and tires are so small on this
that<00:04:30.050> is<00:04:30.230> one<00:04:30.500> of<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.680> things<00:04:30.890> that<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.130> hate<00:04:31.370> I

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
that is one of the things that I hate I

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.950 
that is one of the things that I hate I
mean<00:04:31.670> they<00:04:31.790> look<00:04:32.170> like<00:04:33.170> they're<00:04:33.440> me<00:04:34.400> I'm

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
mean they look like they're me I'm

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.510 
mean they look like they're me I'm
thinking<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.320> they're<00:04:36.440> supposed<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:36.800> be<00:04:36.860> 14

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
thinking that they're supposed to be 14

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.070 
thinking that they're supposed to be 14
or<00:04:37.550> 15<00:04:38.030> inch<00:04:38.210> wheels<00:04:38.270> but<00:04:38.780> they<00:04:38.900> look<00:04:39.050> like

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
or 15 inch wheels but they look like

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.920 
or 15 inch wheels but they look like
they're<00:04:39.350> like<00:04:39.530> 13s<00:04:40.390> because<00:04:41.390> I<00:04:41.480> mean<00:04:41.630> this<00:04:41.750> is

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
they're like 13s because I mean this is

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.140 
they're like 13s because I mean this is
like<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.140> popular<00:04:42.620> type<00:04:43.040> of<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:43.820> know<00:04:43.850> wheel

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
like a popular type of you know wheel

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.610 
like a popular type of you know wheel
and<00:04:44.360> tire<00:04:44.510> combination<00:04:44.840> that<00:04:45.260> they<00:04:45.350> put<00:04:45.590> on

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
and tire combination that they put on

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.950 
and tire combination that they put on
these<00:04:45.830> trucks<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:47.210> chrome<00:04:47.420> plating<00:04:47.840> and

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
mean the detailing is not bad and like I

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.520 
mean the detailing is not bad and like I
said<00:06:01.670> it's<00:06:02.000> got<00:06:02.980> that<00:06:03.980> suspension<00:06:04.790> that<00:06:05.530> it

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
said it's got that suspension that it

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.200 
said it's got that suspension that it
doesn't<00:06:06.860> have<00:06:06.980> coil<00:06:07.310> springs<00:06:07.700> and<00:06:07.850> it<00:06:08.000> uses

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
doesn't have coil springs and it uses

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.250 
doesn't have coil springs and it uses
the<00:06:08.450> torsion<00:06:08.870> bars<00:06:09.080> for<00:06:10.090> keeping<00:06:11.170> you<00:06:12.170> know

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
the torsion bars for keeping you know

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.900 
the torsion bars for keeping you know
the<00:06:12.380> suspension<00:06:12.950> taught<00:06:13.160> basically<00:06:13.700> and

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
the suspension taught basically and

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.550 
the suspension taught basically and
keeping<00:06:14.180> the<00:06:14.240> car<00:06:14.450> up<00:06:14.630> in<00:06:14.690> the<00:06:14.750> air<00:06:14.840> and<00:06:15.500> you

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
keeping the car up in the air and you

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.740 
keeping the car up in the air and you
can<00:06:15.710> adjust<00:06:15.800> this<00:06:16.310> the<00:06:16.790> pre<00:06:17.000> tension<00:06:17.420> on<00:06:17.540> it<00:06:17.570> to

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
can adjust this the pre tension on it to

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.560 
can adjust this the pre tension on it to
give<00:06:17.870> you<00:06:17.990> a<00:06:18.050> stiffer<00:06:18.650> or<00:06:18.680> smoother<00:06:19.220> ride<00:06:19.570> but

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
give you a stiffer or smoother ride but

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.850 
give you a stiffer or smoother ride but
there's<00:06:20.750> basically<00:06:20.900> between<00:06:21.440> the<00:06:21.680> lower

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
there's basically between the lower

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.650 
there's basically between the lower
control<00:06:22.250> arms<00:06:22.640> and<00:06:22.700> the<00:06:22.850> upper<00:06:23.030> control<00:06:23.300> arms

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
control arms and the upper control arms

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.880 
control arms and the upper control arms
there's<00:06:23.780> basically<00:06:24.080> just<00:06:24.200> shocks<00:06:24.500> that<00:06:24.770> go

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
there's basically just shocks that go

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.980 
there's basically just shocks that go
through<00:06:25.160> but<00:06:26.030> I<00:06:26.060> can<00:06:26.240> see<00:06:26.480> how<00:06:26.600> this<00:06:26.720> would<00:06:26.870> be

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
through but I can see how this would be

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.900 
through but I can see how this would be
easy<00:06:27.200> to<00:06:27.560> cut<00:06:27.950> this<00:06:28.100> part<00:06:28.310> off<00:06:28.490> cut<00:06:28.760> these

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
easy to cut this part off cut these

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.550 
easy to cut this part off cut these
torsion<00:06:29.330> bars<00:06:29.510> off<00:06:29.720> and<00:06:29.900> actually<00:06:30.110> modify

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
torsion bars off and actually modify

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.440 
torsion bars off and actually modify
this<00:06:30.830> I<00:06:31.040> know<00:06:31.550> these<00:06:31.820> lower<00:06:32.000> controls

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
this I know these lower controls

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.750 
this I know these lower controls
wouldn't<00:06:32.780> be<00:06:32.840> quite<00:06:33.140> right<00:06:33.550> you<00:06:34.550> could<00:06:34.670> even

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
wouldn't be quite right you could even

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.070 
wouldn't be quite right you could even
change<00:06:35.120> them<00:06:35.270> up<00:06:35.330> if<00:06:35.450> you<00:06:35.510> wanted<00:06:35.840> and<00:06:36.050> you

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
change them up if you wanted and you

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.560 
change them up if you wanted and you
might<00:06:36.260> have<00:06:36.380> to<00:06:36.500> do<00:06:36.710> a<00:06:36.740> front<00:06:37.250> anti-roll<00:06:38.150> bar

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
might have to do a front anti-roll bar

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.270 
might have to do a front anti-roll bar
instead<00:06:38.930> of<00:06:38.990> the<00:06:39.080> rear<00:06:39.260> but<00:06:39.830> you<00:06:39.950> can<00:06:40.040> actually

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
instead of the rear but you can actually

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.750 
instead of the rear but you can actually
can

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
can

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.790 
can
Verte<00:06:40.970> this<00:06:41.150> to<00:06:41.360> coil-spring<00:06:42.020> front

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
Verte this to coil-spring front

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.290 
Verte this to coil-spring front
suspension<00:06:43.280> from<00:06:43.430> what<00:06:43.550> it<00:06:43.610> looks<00:06:43.790> like<00:06:43.970> and

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
suspension from what it looks like and

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.210 
suspension from what it looks like and
then<00:06:44.960> the<00:06:45.050> rear<00:06:45.170> suspension<00:06:45.740> actually<00:06:46.010> comes

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
then the rear suspension actually comes

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.860 
then the rear suspension actually comes
just<00:06:46.430> like<00:06:46.490> this<00:06:46.610> and<00:06:47.150> then<00:06:47.240> you<00:06:47.360> mount<00:06:47.630> the

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
just like this and then you mount the

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.080 
just like this and then you mount the
two<00:06:48.740> differential<00:06:49.160> pieces<00:06:49.670> on<00:06:49.820> there<00:06:50.030> and

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
two differential pieces on there and

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.340 
two differential pieces on there and
then<00:06:50.210> there's<00:06:50.360> a<00:06:50.420> tab<00:06:50.690> that<00:06:50.720> mounts<00:06:51.140> up<00:06:51.230> to<00:06:51.260> the

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.350 
then there's a tab that mounts up to the

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.590 
then there's a tab that mounts up to the
frame<00:06:51.410> but<00:06:52.010> from<00:06:52.160> what<00:06:52.310> I've<00:06:52.430> read<00:06:52.640> doesn't

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
frame but from what I've read doesn't

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.390 
frame but from what I've read doesn't
line<00:06:53.750> up<00:06:53.900> very<00:06:54.020> well<00:06:54.140> and<00:06:54.650> from<00:06:54.920> what<00:06:55.040> I<00:06:55.070> saw

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
line up very well and from what I saw

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.070 
line up very well and from what I saw
the<00:06:55.460> differential<00:06:56.360> didn't<00:06:56.600> even<00:06:56.750> line<00:06:56.930> up

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
the differential didn't even line up

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.930 
the differential didn't even line up
with<00:06:57.200> this<00:06:57.380> part<00:06:57.650> so<00:06:58.580> there's<00:06:58.730> a<00:06:58.760> little<00:06:58.850> bit

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
with this part so there's a little bit

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.190 
with this part so there's a little bit
of<00:06:59.060> sanding<00:06:59.390> there<00:06:59.570> and<00:06:59.780> you've<00:06:59.870> got<00:06:59.900> some

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.200 
of sanding there and you've got some

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.870 
of sanding there and you've got some
modification<00:07:00.920> to<00:07:00.950> do<00:07:01.160> to<00:07:01.250> this<00:07:01.370> stuff<00:07:01.640> to<00:07:01.760> get

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:01.880 
modification to do to this stuff to get

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.090 
modification to do to this stuff to get
it<00:07:01.970> to<00:07:02.060> all<00:07:02.120> line<00:07:02.360> up<00:07:02.390> properly<00:07:02.990> the<00:07:03.740> highlight

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.100 
it to all line up properly the highlight

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.310 
it to all line up properly the highlight
of<00:07:04.130> the<00:07:04.280> kid<00:07:04.460> I<00:07:04.490> guess<00:07:04.640> I<00:07:04.910> got<00:07:05.060> to<00:07:05.150> say<00:07:05.360> is<00:07:05.720> the

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.320 
of the kid I guess I got to say is the

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.070 
of the kid I guess I got to say is the
engine<00:07:06.790> the<00:07:07.790> engine<00:07:07.940> is<00:07:08.180> very<00:07:08.240> nice

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 
engine the engine is very nice

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.060 
engine the engine is very nice
it's<00:07:09.890> the<00:07:10.100> Cobra<00:07:10.610> the<00:07:11.450> chrome<00:07:11.890> valve<00:07:12.890> covers

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.070 
it's the Cobra the chrome valve covers

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.560 
it's the Cobra the chrome valve covers
and<00:07:13.490> everything<00:07:13.580> and<00:07:14.060> it's<00:07:14.150> got<00:07:14.270> the<00:07:14.390> bench

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570 
and everything and it's got the bench

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.050 
and everything and it's got the bench
seat<00:07:15.280> and<00:07:16.280> I<00:07:16.370> mean<00:07:16.520> it's<00:07:16.640> a<00:07:16.670> pretty<00:07:16.850> detailed

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060 
seat and I mean it's a pretty detailed

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.970 
seat and I mean it's a pretty detailed
setup<00:07:17.720> there<00:07:17.900> and<00:07:18.260> like<00:07:18.350> I<00:07:18.440> said<00:07:18.500> if<00:07:18.740> you<00:07:18.830> get<00:07:18.920> a

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:18.980 
setup there and like I said if you get a

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.680 
setup there and like I said if you get a
an<00:07:19.340> oval<00:07:19.670> air<00:07:19.790> cleaner<00:07:20.060> you<00:07:20.180> can<00:07:20.270> do<00:07:20.390> the<00:07:20.510> Tri

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:20.690 
an oval air cleaner you can do the Tri

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.540 
an oval air cleaner you can do the Tri
power<00:07:20.990> setup<00:07:21.380> or<00:07:21.560> the<00:07:21.710> fuel<00:07:21.890> injection<00:07:22.250> either

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:22.550 
power setup or the fuel injection either

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.180 
power setup or the fuel injection either
one<00:07:22.930> but<00:07:23.930> overall<00:07:24.200> guys<00:07:24.500> there's<00:07:24.800> the<00:07:24.950> parts

one but overall guys there's the parts

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.710 
one but overall guys there's the parts
that<00:07:25.280> come<00:07:25.490> in<00:07:25.580> the<00:07:25.640> kit<00:07:25.670> like<00:07:26.210> I<00:07:26.300> said<00:07:26.510> I'm<00:07:26.600> not

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 
that come in the kit like I said I'm not

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.510 
that come in the kit like I said I'm not
too<00:07:26.870> happy<00:07:27.050> with<00:07:27.260> it<00:07:27.590> so<00:07:27.890> I'm<00:07:28.160> just<00:07:28.190> going<00:07:28.460> to

think<00:07:39.470> of<00:07:39.620> this<00:07:39.710> kit<00:07:39.980> if<00:07:40.100> you've<00:07:40.250> built<00:07:40.430> it<00:07:40.670> up

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:40.760 
think of this kit if you've built it up

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.520 
think of this kit if you've built it up
or<00:07:40.910> whatnot<00:07:41.060> but<00:07:41.270> honestly<00:07:41.840> I've<00:07:42.050> got<00:07:42.260> so<00:07:42.440> many

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:42.530 
or whatnot but honestly I've got so many

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.260 
or whatnot but honestly I've got so many
projects<00:07:43.070> this<00:07:43.220> is<00:07:43.280> just<00:07:43.610> not<00:07:43.760> something<00:07:44.210> I

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.270 
projects this is just not something I

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.780 
projects this is just not something I
want<00:07:44.450> to<00:07:44.510> get<00:07:44.600> into<00:07:44.780> right<00:07:44.930> now<00:07:45.170> so<00:07:45.650> it's<00:07:46.640> easy
