that does have a habit of slipping if
you<00:01:34.650> do<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> magnet<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.790> should<00:01:36.000> give<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
you do the magnet in you should give it

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.270 
you do the magnet in you should give it
to<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> magnet<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> rocker<00:01:38.040> and

to the magnet and if the rocker and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.280 
to the magnet and if the rocker and
finally<00:01:41.930> extend<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.290> line<00:01:45.140> just<00:01:46.140> quite

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
finally extend it in line just quite

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.510 
finally extend it in line just quite
common<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.619> spring<00:01:46.950> how<00:01:47.280> about<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
common this spring how about the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.350 
common this spring how about the
slipping<00:01:47.880> causes<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.390> car<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> slow<00:01:48.750> down

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
slipping causes the car to slow down

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.249 
slipping causes the car to slow down
maintenance<00:01:51.360> has<00:01:51.570> actually<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> maintenance

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
maintenance has actually a maintenance

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.399 
maintenance has actually a maintenance
video<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.950> all<00:01:53.040> about<00:01:53.159> oiling<00:01:54.409> generally

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
video it's all about oiling generally

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.319 
video it's all about oiling generally
the<00:01:55.470> same<00:01:55.590> for<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> cars<00:01:57.619> that's<00:01:58.619> oil

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
the same for all the cars that's oil

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.969 
the same for all the cars that's oil
which<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.450> here<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.020> really<00:02:01.469> weird<00:02:01.590> weapon<00:02:01.890> at

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
which is here the really weird weapon at

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.300 
which is here the really weird weapon at
this<00:02:02.070> angle<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:03.030> two<00:02:03.210> hands<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.070> you<00:02:05.070> want<00:02:05.250> to

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
this angle and two hands so you want to

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.389 
this angle and two hands so you want to
put<00:02:05.430> oil<00:02:05.520> usually<00:02:06.350> on<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> pinion<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
put oil usually on the pinion and the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.520 
put oil usually on the pinion and the
gear<00:02:08.640> where<00:02:08.790> they<00:02:08.880> join<00:02:09.289> especially<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.410> in

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
gear where they join especially the in

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.319 
gear where they join especially the in
lines<00:02:10.769> because<00:02:11.160> these<00:02:11.519> teeth<00:02:11.850> do<00:02:12.150> ever<00:02:12.269> have

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
lines because these teeth do ever have

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.960 
lines because these teeth do ever have
it<00:02:12.510> breaking<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.459> want<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.700> keep<00:02:14.790> them

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
it breaking so you want to keep them

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.050 
it breaking so you want to keep them
well-oiled<00:02:15.360> oil<00:02:16.140> inside<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.829> bearing<00:02:17.220> so

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
well-oiled oil inside the bearing so

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.590 
well-oiled oil inside the bearing so
that<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:20.700> axles<00:02:20.970> are<00:02:21.030> turn<00:02:21.180> clear<00:02:21.389> you<00:02:21.480> want

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
that the axles are turn clear you want

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.520 
that the axles are turn clear you want
to<00:02:21.660> keep<00:02:21.750> these<00:02:21.930> clean<00:02:22.139> as<00:02:22.320> well

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
to keep these clean as well

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.790 
to keep these clean as well
finally<00:02:24.400> now<00:02:24.610> this<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:25.000> power<00:02:25.360> Lube<00:02:25.630> PL<00:02:26.170> 64

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
finally now this is power Lube PL 64

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.250 
finally now this is power Lube PL 64
this<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.220> stuff<00:02:27.400> they<00:02:27.520> use<00:02:27.670> for<00:02:27.820> trains

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
this is the stuff they use for trains

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.050 
this is the stuff they use for trains
for<00:02:29.260> electrical<00:02:29.590> stops<00:02:29.950> arcing<00:02:30.280> supposedly

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
for electrical stops arcing supposedly

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.880 
for electrical stops arcing supposedly
just<00:02:32.050> spike<00:02:32.560> dab<00:02:33.330> just<00:02:34.330> on<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.690> point<00:02:34.890> there
