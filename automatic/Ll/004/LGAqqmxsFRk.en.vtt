00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.620
 an interesting new mystery 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.620
 we go there 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.220
 well guys very attentive on the map 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.290
 collector that ends collection 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.620
 special card 5 or the map of the 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.730
 mysteries or you can see them card 5 map 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.870
 we will begin the key to this mystery 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.850
 how are you seeing and down to the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.320
 left we have a note a note that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.360
 everyone has been very wrong 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.250
 with her a note that really has 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.840
 much mystery everyone how is 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.700
 living was thought to be a note 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.320
 to get money you would earn 500 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.210
 thousand dollars but we really have 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.620
 understood backwards because of the little that I've 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.420
 seen out there everyone thought that 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.300
 in that location if I could get there 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.740
 of you would earn 500 thousand dollars and it is everything 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.810
 opposite and in this video I will explain 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.880
 why really what he gives us is a 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.530
 location a location where 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.180
 we have to go a location in the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.400
 that we would have to carry 500 thousand 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.260
 dollars I will tell you because how are you? 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.850
 seeing gives us some indications and there 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.200
 I went we start saying where we have 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.330
 to go where we have to move 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.580
 how far do you have to go and casually 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.800
 we come to a very mysterious area of 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.500
 an area where all the 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.570
 importance of this game the area where 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.090
 we finished one of the most final 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.670
 important of this story the 11 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.530
 when we say choose to save the three 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.310
 characters in the end we go to a place 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.720
 to a place 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.979
 which we are going to do a lot of spoiler 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.990
 but you see it to consciousness is not to say 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.970
 what happens for the most knowledgeable is 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.039
 what you have spent the game what 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.479
 you'll understand we got to this area and 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.520
 this area is where the game ends 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.370
 if you choose the option c they come back guys 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.810
 this is where the note sends us the note 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.360
 tells us to come here that we bring 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.760
 500,000 dollars but 500 thousand dollars 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.590
 for what and with whom we are going to 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.170
 find here I went when I had already 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.540
 past the campaign if I do not remember the and 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.099
 there was really nothing until I arrived 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.260
 directly to what you are going to see 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.940
 then go down to the docks and do not 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
 were any springs always 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.970
 had thought that these springs would be 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.610
 something any or that would have nothing 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.920
 mysterious but it's not like that guys has 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.540
 something very very funny behind but before 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.459
 that they wanted to talk about this ending on 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.840
 end that we choose when we kill another 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.849
 person who does not think to do much spoiler 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.099
 I repeat the most understood with the chat is 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.200
 you will understand it let's say let's go to this area 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.819
 to finish one of the most final 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.549
 important when we save the three 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.830
 characters but because it is now sent 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.150
 here this note really if we finish 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.160
 missions with any of the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.410
 main characters we would arrive here 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.880
 would give us something more 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.130
 Well, guys, as you are seeing in 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.830
 screen this dock is for searches with 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.140
 ringing this pier tries to look 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.520
 things under the sea with sound so that 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.920
 do not know searches with sonar 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.420
 try the following let's say they are like 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.280
 small radars that are looking for 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.500
 under the sea everything that they catch everything 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.900
 animate or inanimate object what you 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.730
 you want to search you will be granted 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.770
 Searches with sonar as I said 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.140
 they are radars that go with frequencies of 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.910
 sound good guys you will have to see 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.770
 this with this note what mystery has 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.420
 that see well guys the cloc the 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.030
 conclusion that I have really arrived 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.710
 is that it may be that a mega has to 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.720
 see with this may be that the 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.520
 responsible for writing that mural have 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.350
 something to do with all this mystery if 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.110
 well it has not been considered in the note 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.430
 is signed with 5x the same x that 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.920
 we have in the map of the mural of the mountain 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.780
 chilian the same x that surely 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.180
 have painted mega as well I said if that 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.620
 mural I would have painted it or mega if 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.270
 really taking those 500 thousand dollars 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.240
 when you have one hundred percent of the game 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.100
 we arrived there and he gave us the 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.080
 option to go to the four zancudo through 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.600
 under the sea by an entrance which 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.860
 we do not know guys, but if you have 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.750
 one hundred percent of the game completed 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.400
 I would ask you to help us 6 so much to me 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.930
 as to my colleagues that without them 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.519
 none these mysteries would be possible 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.109
 as well I said this mystery not 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.670
 ends here this mystery will have more 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.530
