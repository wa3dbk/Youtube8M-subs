00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:42.030 

okay<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.650> see<00:02:34.410> g7f<00:02:40.019> for<00:02:41.019> d7r<00:02:41.590> bring<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:41.860> thumb

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:56.270 

c7<00:02:52.500> fifth<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.709> fourth

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.860 

so<00:02:57.280> let's<00:02:57.459> establish<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:58.090> timing<00:02:58.569> now<00:02:58.720> which

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
so let's establish this timing now which

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.430 
so let's establish this timing now which
is<00:02:59.019> this<00:02:59.349> song<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.620> in<00:02:59.830> 4/4<00:03:00.519> common<00:03:01.000> time<00:03:01.440> so

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
is this song is in 4/4 common time so

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.680 
is this song is in 4/4 common time so
I'm<00:03:02.500> going<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.709> count<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.459> try<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.180> keep<00:03:04.510> it

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
I'm going to count and try and keep it

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.690 
I'm going to count and try and keep it
really<00:03:04.989> slow<00:03:05.349> so<00:03:05.380> everybody<00:03:05.950> can<00:03:06.099> get<00:03:06.310> access

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
really slow so everybody can get access

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:26.100 
really slow so everybody can get access
to<00:03:06.730> this<00:03:07.769> starting<00:03:08.769> this<00:03:08.890> C<00:03:09.069> of<00:03:09.099> course

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.030 

so<00:03:27.110> that's<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.410> pattern<00:03:27.680> we're<00:03:27.770> trying<00:03:27.980> to

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
so that's the pattern we're trying to

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.390 
so that's the pattern we're trying to
establish<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:29.630> I'll<00:03:29.810> count<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:30.260> out<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.800> slow

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
establish and I'll count it out and slow

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.030 
establish and I'll count it out and slow
it<00:03:31.520> right<00:03:31.700> down

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
it right down
