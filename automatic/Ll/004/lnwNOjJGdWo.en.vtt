that<00:03:23.740> it<00:03:23.980> looks<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.280> bit<00:03:24.310> better<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:25.030> time<00:03:25.110> not

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
that it looks a bit better this time not

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.750 
that it looks a bit better this time not
sure<00:03:26.380> if<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.650> will<00:03:26.770> work<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.280> I<00:03:27.340> will<00:03:27.460> see<00:03:27.640> the

and I also like the additional color the
3d<00:03:58.540> meters<00:03:58.900> providing<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.890> sound<00:04:00.250> effects

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
3d meters providing the sound effects

00:04:00.700 --> 00:05:35.520 
3d meters providing the sound effects
are<00:04:00.880> also<00:04:01.120> great

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.020 

let's<00:05:36.530> have<00:05:36.770> a<00:05:36.890> quick<00:05:36.950> look<00:05:37.160> at<00:05:37.490> the<00:05:37.610> 2d

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
let's have a quick look at the 2d

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.060 
let's have a quick look at the 2d
version<00:05:38.180> of<00:05:38.480> the<00:05:38.660> game<00:05:38.810> as<00:05:38.960> well<00:05:38.990> my<00:05:39.770> only

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
version of the game as well my only

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.430 
version of the game as well my only
complaint<00:05:40.460> here<00:05:40.970> is<00:05:41.120> that<00:05:41.270> the<00:05:41.390> 2d<00:05:41.840> version<00:05:42.050> of

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
complaint here is that the 2d version of

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.130 
complaint here is that the 2d version of
the<00:05:42.980> game<00:05:43.160> runs<00:05:43.430> faster<00:05:44.030> than<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:44.270> 3d<00:05:44.600> version

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
the game runs faster than the 3d version

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.190 
the game runs faster than the 3d version
so<00:05:45.590> for<00:05:45.800> 3d<00:05:46.250> more<00:05:46.850> time<00:05:47.210> is<00:05:47.420> needed<00:05:47.450> to<00:05:47.930> draw

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
so for 3d more time is needed to draw

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.320 
so for 3d more time is needed to draw
the<00:05:48.260> objects<00:05:48.830> on<00:05:48.920> the<00:05:49.010> screen<00:05:49.130> as<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:50.030> matrix

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
the objects on the screen as the matrix

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.150 
the objects on the screen as the matrix
has<00:05:50.540> to<00:05:50.660> draw<00:05:50.840> everything<00:05:51.260> twice<00:05:51.590> once<00:05:52.010> for

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
has to draw everything twice once for

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.100 
has to draw everything twice once for
the<00:05:52.250> left<00:05:52.460> eye<00:05:52.700> and<00:05:52.880> once<00:05:53.420> for<00:05:53.600> the<00:05:53.690> right<00:05:53.870> eye

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
the left eye and once for the right eye

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.190 
the left eye and once for the right eye
in<00:05:54.590> 2d<00:05:55.280> every<00:05:55.970> object<00:05:56.510> is<00:05:56.630> to<00:05:56.780> be<00:05:56.900> rendered

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
in 2d every object is to be rendered

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.750 
in 2d every object is to be rendered
only<00:05:57.500> once<00:05:57.770> and<00:05:58.130> the<00:05:58.220> game<00:05:58.430> was<00:05:58.610> not

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
only once and the game was not

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.970 
only once and the game was not
programmed<00:05:59.060> in<00:05:59.420> a<00:05:59.480> way<00:05:59.600> to<00:06:00.080> compensate<00:06:00.800> them

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
programmed in a way to compensate them

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.220 
programmed in a way to compensate them
so<00:06:01.460> that<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:01.730> 2d<00:06:02.180> version<00:06:02.330> would<00:06:02.660> run<00:06:02.900> slower

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
so that the 2d version would run slower

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.460 
so that the 2d version would run slower
so<00:06:03.980> the<00:06:04.160> 2d<00:06:05.000> version<00:06:05.180> is<00:06:05.480> harder<00:06:05.960> than<00:06:06.080> the<00:06:06.200> 3d

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
so the 2d version is harder than the 3d

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.560 
so the 2d version is harder than the 3d
version<00:06:06.680> and<00:06:07.100> I<00:06:07.580> could<00:06:07.790> not<00:06:07.910> find<00:06:08.090> out<00:06:08.300> any

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
version and I could not find out any

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.380 
version and I could not find out any
trick<00:06:08.810> to<00:06:08.930> reduce<00:06:09.230> the<00:06:09.410> speed<00:06:09.680> in<00:06:09.890> 2d<00:06:10.400> anyway

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
trick to reduce the speed in 2d anyway

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.870 
trick to reduce the speed in 2d anyway
let's<00:06:11.690> start<00:06:11.810> the<00:06:12.140> 2d<00:06:12.620> version<00:06:12.830> and<00:06:13.250> let's<00:06:13.610> try

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
let's start the 2d version and let's try

00:06:13.880 --> 00:07:11.470 
let's start the 2d version and let's try
to<00:06:13.910> shoot<00:06:14.240> some<00:06:14.450> robots

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.480 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.570 

so<00:07:12.480> was<00:07:12.780> it<00:07:12.960> worth<00:07:13.050> airing<00:07:13.710> this<00:07:13.890> came<00:07:14.220> to<00:07:14.460> my

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580 
so was it worth airing this came to my

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.380 
so was it worth airing this came to my
collection

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:15.390

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.570

it<00:07:15.690> is<00:07:15.870> not<00:07:16.110> my<00:07:16.320> favorite<00:07:16.530> metric<00:07:17.130> screen<00:07:17.370> but

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
it is not my favorite metric screen but

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.520 
it is not my favorite metric screen but
I<00:07:17.610> like<00:07:17.880> it<00:07:18.120> and<00:07:18.270> I<00:07:18.360> also<00:07:18.570> wanted<00:07:18.990> to<00:07:19.050> have<00:07:19.290> all
