temperaments<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.559> think<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:56.340> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
temperaments is is I think one of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.779 
temperaments is is I think one of
balentine's<00:00:57.239> greatest<00:00:57.899> works<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> one

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
balentine's greatest works it is a one

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.660 
balentine's greatest works it is a one
of<00:00:59.910> his<00:01:00.030> black<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.420> white<00:01:00.570> programs<00:01:01.199> which

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
of his black and white programs which

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.670 
of his black and white programs which
has<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.910> dancers<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.510> very<00:01:03.750> minimal<00:01:04.170> costume

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
has the dancers in very minimal costume

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.929 
has the dancers in very minimal costume
and<00:01:05.000> has<00:01:06.000> sort<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.780> very<00:01:07.439> almost<00:01:08.070> modern

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
and has sort of a very almost modern

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.570 
and has sort of a very almost modern
classical<00:01:09.510> style<00:01:09.900> even<00:01:10.830> though<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> appears

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
classical style even though it appears

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.330 
classical style even though it appears
to<00:01:11.790> be<00:01:11.970> among<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.049> least<00:01:13.290> complex<00:01:14.010> it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
to be among the least complex it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.420 
to be among the least complex it
actually<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.689> most<00:01:16.200> exposed<00:01:16.770> because

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
actually is the most exposed because

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.120 
actually is the most exposed because
suddenly<00:01:17.700> you're<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.240> very<00:01:19.020> little<00:01:19.259> costume

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
suddenly you're in very little costume

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.630 
suddenly you're in very little costume
and<00:01:20.430> you're<00:01:21.119> presenting<00:01:22.130> incredibly<00:01:23.130> musical

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and you're presenting incredibly musical

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.780 
and you're presenting incredibly musical
choreography<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.619> very<00:01:25.619> detailed<00:01:26.130> shape<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
choreography and very detailed shape and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.090 
choreography and very detailed shape and
pattern<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:28.170> think<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> company

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
pattern and I think that the company

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.280 
pattern and I think that the company
when<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.729> performs<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.270> again<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.659> time<00:01:30.930> will

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
when it performs it again this time will

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.520 
when it performs it again this time will
reach<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.770> very<00:01:32.250> new<00:01:32.460> level<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.600> we're<00:01:34.229> very

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
reach a very new level of it we're very

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.560 
reach a very new level of it we're very
lucky<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.009> Judy<00:01:35.430> Fugate<00:01:35.880> coming<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
lucky to have Judy Fugate coming in to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.499 
lucky to have Judy Fugate coming in to
set<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.500> very<00:01:37.680> exciting<00:01:38.360> ballet<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
set it it's a very exciting ballet to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.330 
set it it's a very exciting ballet to
return<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> those<00:01:40.829> pieces<00:01:41.100> that

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
return to it's one of those pieces that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.670 
return to it's one of those pieces that
every<00:01:41.640> time<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.180> see<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:42.960> hear<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.320> finale

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
every time I see it or hear the finale

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.010 
every time I see it or hear the finale
you<00:01:43.920> get<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.700> goosebumps<00:01:45.329> even<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
you get the goosebumps even just the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.710 
you get the goosebumps even just the
beginning<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.560> taan<00:01:46.920> dues<00:01:47.210> it's<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.479> work

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
beginning with the taan dues it's a work

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.039 
beginning with the taan dues it's a work
that<00:01:48.960> changed<00:01:49.729> dance<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.329> think<00:01:51.630> it's

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
that changed dance and I think it's

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.230 
that changed dance and I think it's
certainly<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.560> piece<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.189> belongs<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.090> our

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
certainly a piece that belongs in our

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.740 
certainly a piece that belongs in our
master's<00:01:54.689> program
