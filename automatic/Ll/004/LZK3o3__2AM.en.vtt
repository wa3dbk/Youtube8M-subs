brought<00:00:43.570> up<00:00:43.660> in<00:00:43.750> a<00:00:43.810> house<00:00:43.989> with<00:00:44.260> a<00:00:44.320> cat<00:00:44.649> in<00:00:44.829> it<00:00:44.950> a

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
brought up in a house with a cat in it a

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.860 
brought up in a house with a cat in it a
whole<00:00:45.520> bunch<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:45.760> scientists<00:00:46.239> in<00:00:46.300> Sweden<00:00:46.750> and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
whole bunch of scientists in Sweden and

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.720 
whole bunch of scientists in Sweden and
Finland<00:00:47.320> have<00:00:47.470> found<00:00:47.710> that<00:00:47.860> exposing<00:00:48.460> a<00:00:48.520> baby

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
Finland have found that exposing a baby

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.580 
Finland have found that exposing a baby
to<00:00:49.000> a<00:00:49.030> cat<00:00:49.329> can<00:00:49.540> help<00:00:49.690> build<00:00:49.960> up<00:00:50.079> its<00:00:50.260> immunity

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
to a cat can help build up its immunity

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.020 
to a cat can help build up its immunity
and<00:00:50.890> reduce<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.579> risk<00:00:51.610> of<00:00:51.880> developing

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
and reduce the risk of developing

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.810 
and reduce the risk of developing
allergies<00:00:52.600> later<00:00:53.140> in<00:00:53.290> life<00:00:53.500> okay<00:00:54.370> so<00:00:54.430> I've

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
allergies later in life okay so I've

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.819 
allergies later in life okay so I've
already<00:00:54.969> screwed<00:00:55.480> up<00:00:55.780> not<00:00:56.079> having<00:00:56.320> a<00:00:56.469> cat<00:00:56.680> when

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
already screwed up not having a cat when

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.490 
already screwed up not having a cat when
I<00:00:56.920> was<00:00:57.040> a<00:00:57.070> kid<00:00:57.340> so<00:00:57.579> why<00:00:58.239> should<00:00:58.510> I<00:00:58.600> get<00:00:58.660> one<00:00:58.870> now

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
I was a kid so why should I get one now

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.900 
I was a kid so why should I get one now
well<00:00:59.649> don't<00:00:59.920> worry<00:01:00.070> even<00:01:00.579> you<00:01:00.700> and<00:01:00.790> I<00:01:00.879> can

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
well don't worry even you and I can

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.760 
well don't worry even you and I can
still<00:01:01.210> benefit<00:01:01.480> from<00:01:01.510> cats<00:01:01.899> researchers<00:01:02.680> at

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
still benefit from cats researchers at

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.499 
still benefit from cats researchers at
the<00:01:02.800> University<00:01:03.340> of<00:01:03.370> Minnesota<00:01:03.579> found<00:01:04.239> that

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
the University of Minnesota found that

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.080 
the University of Minnesota found that
cat<00:01:04.719> owners<00:01:05.049> have<00:01:05.229> a<00:01:05.280> 40%<00:01:06.280> less<00:01:06.520> chance<00:01:06.939> of

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
cat owners have a 40% less chance of

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.580 
cat owners have a 40% less chance of
having<00:01:07.149> heart<00:01:07.569> attacks<00:01:07.899> and<00:01:08.109> heart<00:01:08.229> disease

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
having heart attacks and heart disease

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.649 
having heart attacks and heart disease
at<00:01:09.130> this<00:01:09.340> point<00:01:09.609> I'm<00:01:09.759> pretty<00:01:10.060> sure<00:01:10.270> as<00:01:10.420> cat

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
at this point I'm pretty sure as cat

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.449 
at this point I'm pretty sure as cat
ladies<00:01:10.990> are<00:01:11.139> freaking<00:01:11.560> immortal

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:12.459 
ladies are freaking immortal

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.179 
ladies are freaking immortal
so<00:01:13.060> apparently<00:01:13.600> petting<00:01:14.319> an<00:01:14.499> animal<00:01:14.770> is

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
so apparently petting an animal is

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.370 
so apparently petting an animal is
strong<00:01:15.490> enough<00:01:15.700> to<00:01:15.909> lower<00:01:16.119> stress<00:01:16.719> levels<00:01:17.170> and

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
strong enough to lower stress levels and

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.219 
strong enough to lower stress levels and
blood<00:01:17.829> pressure<00:01:18.219> basically<00:01:19.060> my<00:01:19.810> cats<00:01:20.079> can

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
blood pressure basically my cats can

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.840 
blood pressure basically my cats can
even<00:01:20.439> detect<00:01:20.770> when<00:01:20.920> my<00:01:21.039> boyfriend<00:01:21.279> is<00:01:21.579> having

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
even detect when my boyfriend is having

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.940 
even detect when my boyfriend is having
a<00:01:21.939> diabetic<00:01:22.270> low<00:01:22.630> which<00:01:22.869> is<00:01:23.079> pretty<00:01:23.529> radical

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
a diabetic low which is pretty radical

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.760 
a diabetic low which is pretty radical
that's<00:01:24.729> awesome<00:01:25.119> so<00:01:25.299> what<00:01:25.719> else<00:01:25.929> can<00:01:26.350> cats<00:01:26.560> do

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
that's awesome so what else can cats do

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.080 
that's awesome so what else can cats do
I<00:01:26.799> heard<00:01:27.130> they<00:01:27.310> can<00:01:27.369> like<00:01:27.639> make<00:01:27.850> me

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
I heard they can like make me

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.830 
I heard they can like make me
indestructible

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
indestructible

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.339 
indestructible
ah<00:01:29.549> kind<00:01:30.549> not<00:01:31.179> exactly<00:01:31.599> close<00:01:31.929> enough<00:01:32.229> I

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:32.349 
ah kind not exactly close enough I

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:34.289 
ah kind not exactly close enough I
suppose<00:01:32.709> one<00:01:33.279> of<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.459> reasons<00:01:33.789> that<00:01:33.909> cats<00:01:34.119> are

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
suppose one of the reasons that cats are

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.330 
suppose one of the reasons that cats are
such<00:01:34.659> great<00:01:34.840> healers<00:01:35.289> is<00:01:35.469> their<00:01:35.709> per<00:01:36.009> a

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
such great healers is their per a

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.160 
such great healers is their per a
purring<00:01:36.880> cat<00:01:37.090> creates<00:01:37.450> vibrations<00:01:37.630> between

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
purring cat creates vibrations between

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.309 
purring cat creates vibrations between
20<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:38.799> 100<00:01:39.009> 40<00:01:39.490> Hertz<00:01:39.639> and<00:01:39.939> apparently<00:01:40.569> that

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
20 and 100 40 Hertz and apparently that

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.440 
20 and 100 40 Hertz and apparently that
frequency<00:01:41.799> contains<00:01:42.310> therapeutic<00:01:42.939> benefits

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
frequency contains therapeutic benefits

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.330 
frequency contains therapeutic benefits
