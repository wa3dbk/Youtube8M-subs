00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.910
 learn to burn a dvd without 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.290
 as well go through a program of 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.809
 style the titanium toast 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.120
 we will burn a dvd with the window of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.630
 finder then there are two ways of 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.540
 proceed 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:23.460
 the first is the next we go in 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:26.250
 cd dvd system preferences is here in 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.410
 the small tab at the insertion of a cd 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.619
 blank we'll tell him to open the finder 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.250
 same for the insertion of a DVD 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.550
 virgin 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.070
 we tell him to open the finder that's it 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.670
 depends on what you introduce in 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.410
 the drive writer of your mac intosh 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.739
 here is the result is simple enough 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.800
 to insert in your burner a cd 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.250
 blank or a virgin dvd me it will be a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.270
 cd and he'll appear on the desktop here 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.059
 in a moment 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.329
 and so that's the first way to 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.760
 so work on inserting a cd 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.119
 or a dvd one asks him to do 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.070
 appear on the desktop the blank cd 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.280
 and so if you double click and you 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.930
 go see a finder window 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.979
 appear the second way and well 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.409
 it's just to pass 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.650
 directly in the finder and there you 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.740
 have the opportunity to create a new 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.400
 aggravated file that is greyed out by that 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.119
 there for now 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.490
 I use the burning feature 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.780
 already then so he will not show it to me 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:38.909
 but know that this is the second 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:41.340
 opportunity to operate I open a 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.540
 another Finder window is over there I 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.950
 prepare some small photos 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.640
 aggravated that I simply slip 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.590
 see it's very simple and once 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.220
 it's done you press the button 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:58.759
 serious and it's a breeze 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.759
 so this is where you have rename your 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.979
 your project 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.170
 this is then low to givet a game 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.370
 serious 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.650
 see these parts there is for one 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.150
 minute or two since what I have him 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.280
 given a serious and not very heavy 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.450
 there he goes through all the stages 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.280
 ie writing preparation 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.720
 then the finalization you will see 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.330
 just after 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.690
 and as in an engraving program 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:41.819
 traditional and well he'll check if 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.819
 the disc is functional 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.000
 alas almost finished you see it's going 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.180
 super fast 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.600
 once that will be done well he's going 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.040
 mount the cd or dvd on your desktop 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.100
 you're going to see it coming 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.400
 this is done it remains only to 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.540
 check by double-clicking and you 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.610
 see that all the photos appear 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.950
 everything is fine there everything went well 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.280
 past I wish you a very good 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.540
