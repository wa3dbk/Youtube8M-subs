00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.710
 to 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.110
 when the best scientists and 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.480
 technology experts from around the world 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.440
 warn about the dangers 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.980
 potentially technological 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.989
 apocalyptic should matter more 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.239
 but instead public opinion 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.340
 ridicules his theories by treating them as 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.680
 sci-fi movie scripts 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.629
 and the reality is that technology already 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.540
 is conquering our society 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.910
 endangering our existence to 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.129
 mid-2012 the alarms jumped 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.150
 after the Russian tycoon dmitri 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.250
 peskov creator of the movement Russia 2045 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.800
 the idea of ​​a new civilization of 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.300
 Android avatars said publicly that 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.430
 his goal was to get the 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.500
 immortality by transplanting the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.000
 brain and his personality to a body 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.490
 robotic 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.040
 the scientific community applauded the idea 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.520
 but some scientists and experts 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.990
 they quickly opposed this project 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.479
 warning of apocalyptic effects 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.130
 in our society one of the first 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.619
 in warning humanity was the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.030
 acclaimed physical stephen hawking who 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.890
 He said that we had to maximize the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.500
 concern in the future to avoid 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.840
 that artificial intelligence ends 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.270
 controlling the human race to this 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.369
 warning was added elon musk founder 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.260
 of paypal and space ex that during a 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.450
 interview with the media 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.119
 warned about the possibility that 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.520
 machines with artificial intelligence 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.649
 end up thinking for themselves and now 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.210
 another scientific voice has been raised for 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.860
 warn humanity about the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.560
 dangers of artificial intelligence 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.380
 but this time the conclusions are much 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.360
 most devastating physicist and author louis 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.729
 del monte warns that within three 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.010
 decades the dominant species will no longer be 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.470
 humans will be machines 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.060
 the rebellion of the machines of the mount 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.010
 author of the revolution of the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.840
 artificial intelligence said to 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.660
 businessinsider that intelligence 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.130
 artificial will become so advanced 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.100
 that will be like a single individual 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.080
 combined with human intelligence he 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.060
 is convinced that this trend is already 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.280
 is increasing exponentially 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.720
 with the lack of legislation on 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.540
 programming of the machines 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.460
 artificial intelligence currently not 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.500
 there is no legislation regarding the 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.120
 amount of intelligence that a machine 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.940
 may have said of the mountain to 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.680
 businessinsider if this continues we 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.230
 let's find a trend 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.240
 exponential we're going to get to the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.760
 uniqueness in the time frame that 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.680
 most experts predict to 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.390
 from there you will see that the species 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.540
 main will no longer be human beings 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.550
 will be the monte machines estimated 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.160
 the machines will merge slowly 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.230
 with humans creating cyborgs and 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.100
 that human intelligence will be overcome 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.320
 by artificial intelligence in 2040 or 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.000
 2045 at the end of this century the greatest 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.740
 part of the human race there will be 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.200
 become side works 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.810
 the attraction will be immortality said 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.850
 of the mountain the machines will make advances in 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.830
 america technology most of 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.570
 people will have more free time and 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.360
 let's think that we have never lived 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.370
 better the concern of this is that the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.010
 machines will see us as a kind 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.930
 unpredictable and dangerous delmonte is a 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.930
 scientist more than warns about the 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.700
 dangers of artificial intelligence 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.130
 it is clear that the most skeptical believe 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.730
 that it is a new theory 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.450
 catastrophist and that the scenario 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.160
 proposed by the mount will never happen 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.450
 but according to him the end of the human race 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.490
 as a dominant species already has a date 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.070
 2045 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.070
 believe or not believe what I leave at your discretion
