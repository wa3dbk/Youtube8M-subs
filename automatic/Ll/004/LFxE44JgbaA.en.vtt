to<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:47.250> NECA<00:00:48.410> comic<00:00:49.410> style

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
to the NECA comic style

Michelangelo<00:00:51.059> all<00:00:51.210> these<00:00:51.480> turtles<00:00:51.809> are<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
Michelangelo all these turtles are the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.240 
Michelangelo all these turtles are the
same<00:00:52.230> size<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.739> doesn't<00:00:52.949> really<00:00:53.039> matter

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
same size so it doesn't really matter

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.549 
same size so it doesn't really matter
which<00:00:53.430> one<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:53.910> he<00:00:54.360> really<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.690> towers<00:00:55.199> over

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
which one but he really just towers over

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.490 
which one but he really just towers over
them<00:00:55.820> aside<00:00:56.820> from<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.180> size<00:00:57.420> issue<00:00:57.809> it's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
them aside from the size issue it's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.080 
them aside from the size issue it's
really<00:00:58.829> good<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.340> think<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.850> both<00:01:00.059> of

that's<00:01:52.290> nice<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:53.820> course<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> straps<00:01:54.509> are

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
that's nice of course the straps are

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.850 
that's nice of course the straps are
soft<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.079> they<00:01:55.170> don't<00:01:55.320> get<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.560> way<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
soft so they don't get in the way of the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.859 
soft so they don't get in the way of the
articulation<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:57.030> we'll<00:01:57.180> get<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
articulation but we'll get to that in a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.240 
articulation but we'll get to that in a
minute<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.579> heads<00:01:59.579> are<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.890> that<00:02:01.890> kind<00:02:02.130> of

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
minute the heads are on that kind of

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.209 
minute the heads are on that kind of
joint<00:02:02.460> which<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.000> fine<00:02:03.420> except<00:02:04.170> if<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.770> ask<00:02:04.950> me

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
joint which is fine except if you ask me

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.649 
joint which is fine except if you ask me
they<00:02:05.369> should<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.640> used<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.939> smaller<00:02:06.329> ball

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
they should have used a smaller ball

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.940 
they should have used a smaller ball
joint<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.320> get<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> little<00:02:07.590> bit<00:02:07.740> more

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
joint so you can get a little bit more

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.339 
joint so you can get a little bit more
range<00:02:08.250> out<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.910> mobility<00:02:09.330> they<00:02:10.170> don't

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
range out of the mobility they don't

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.780 
range out of the mobility they don't
have<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> whole<00:02:10.770> lot<00:02:10.950> they<00:02:11.099> had<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.310> swivel<00:02:11.670> of

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
have a whole lot they had the swivel of

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.640 
have a whole lot they had the swivel of
course<00:02:12.060> but<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:12.870> far<00:02:13.080> as<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.349> other

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
course but as far as the other

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.460 
course but as far as the other
motion<00:02:14.069> it's<00:02:14.909> kind<00:02:15.299> of<00:02:15.480> limited<00:02:15.870> not<00:02:16.079> too<00:02:16.290> bad

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
motion it's kind of limited not too bad

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.410 
motion it's kind of limited not too bad
obviously<00:02:16.680> it's<00:02:17.129> fine<00:02:17.459> I'm<00:02:17.879> just<00:02:17.939> saying<00:02:18.269> it

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
obviously it's fine I'm just saying it

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.490 
obviously it's fine I'm just saying it
could<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.689> been<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.840> little<00:02:19.049> bit<00:02:19.290> better

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
could have been a little bit better

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.649 
could have been a little bit better
sculpt<00:02:20.400> work<00:02:20.519> is<00:02:20.670> fine<00:02:20.909> though<00:02:21.060> overall<00:02:21.420> it

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
sculpt work is fine though overall it

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.179 
sculpt work is fine though overall it
looks<00:02:21.720> great<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.439> looks<00:02:22.650> just<00:02:22.829> like<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.069> should

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
looks great it looks just like it should

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.119 
looks great it looks just like it should
a<00:02:23.670> lot<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.450> people<00:02:24.720> have<00:02:24.870> trouble<00:02:25.079> with<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
a lot of people have trouble with the

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.240 
a lot of people have trouble with the
eyes<00:02:26.819> being<00:02:27.360> googly<00:02:27.900> that's<00:02:28.349> easy<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.829> paint

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
eyes being googly that's easy to paint

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.369 
eyes being googly that's easy to paint
those<00:02:29.459> over<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.849> fix<00:02:30.090> those<00:02:30.329> but<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.019> was<00:02:31.200> able

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
those over and fix those but I was able

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.899 
those over and fix those but I was able
to<00:02:31.409> get<00:02:31.530> some<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.829> weren't<00:02:32.040> too<00:02:32.220> too<00:02:32.400> bad<00:02:32.609> so

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
to get some that weren't too too bad so

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.220 
to get some that weren't too too bad so
I<00:02:32.939> may<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.209> leave<00:02:33.510> them<00:02:33.659> I<00:02:33.750> don't<00:02:33.810> know<00:02:34.019> yet

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
I may just leave them I don't know yet

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.789 
I may just leave them I don't know yet
for<00:02:34.260> sure

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
for sure

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.339 
for sure
the<00:02:35.730> bandanas<00:02:36.329> are<00:02:36.540> soft<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.079> we<00:02:37.140> don't<00:02:37.260> have

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
the bandanas are soft so we don't have

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.580 
the bandanas are soft so we don't have
to<00:02:37.409> worry<00:02:37.530> about<00:02:37.620> them<00:02:37.920> breaking<00:02:38.129> and<00:02:39.590> overall

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
to worry about them breaking and overall

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.050 
to worry about them breaking and overall
the<00:02:40.709> paint<00:02:40.920> works<00:02:41.069> pretty<00:02:41.310> decent<00:02:41.730> everywhere

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the paint works pretty decent everywhere

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.449 
the paint works pretty decent everywhere
other<00:02:42.299> than<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.629> eyes<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:44.069> belts<00:02:44.340> are<00:02:44.430> a

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
other than the eyes the belts are a

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.949 
other than the eyes the belts are a
little<00:02:44.849> sloppy<00:02:45.150> here<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.599> there<00:02:45.720> but<00:02:45.840> it's

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
little sloppy here and there but it's

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:46.809 
little sloppy here and there but it's
not<00:02:45.989> too<00:02:46.260> bad

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
not too bad

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.599 
not too bad
and<00:02:47.989> it's<00:02:48.989> nice<00:02:49.139> and<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.829> shell<00:02:50.250> part<00:02:50.519> is

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
and it's nice and like the shell part is

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.369 
and it's nice and like the shell part is
nice<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:50.970> flat<00:02:51.239> there's<00:02:51.540> no<00:02:51.690> glossiness<00:02:52.260> to

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
nice and flat there's no glossiness to

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.140 
nice and flat there's no glossiness to
the<00:02:52.470> front<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:52.950> little<00:02:53.250> bit<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.639> the<00:02:53.730> back<00:02:53.940> but

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
the front a little bit to the back but

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.879 
the front a little bit to the back but
not<00:02:54.269> too<00:02:54.450> bad<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.139> overall<00:02:55.379> it<00:02:55.530> looks<00:02:55.560> pretty

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
not too bad so overall it looks pretty

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.890 
not too bad so overall it looks pretty
good<00:02:56.099> shoulder<00:02:56.819> articulation<00:02:57.569> just<00:02:57.780> like

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
good shoulder articulation just like

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.309 
good shoulder articulation just like
Marvel<00:02:58.319> legends<00:02:58.709> ball<00:02:59.250> disc<00:02:59.609> by<00:03:00.569> sub<00:03:00.930> swivel

Marvel legends ball disc by sub swivel

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.259 
Marvel legends ball disc by sub swivel
double<00:03:01.829> jointed<00:03:02.129> elbow<00:03:02.519> so<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.790> good<00:03:02.909> range<00:03:03.120> of

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
double jointed elbow so a good range of

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.319 
double jointed elbow so a good range of
motion<00:03:03.980> there's<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.099> wrist<00:03:05.280> swivel<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.030> it's

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
motion there's the wrist swivel and it's

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.449 
motion there's the wrist swivel and it's
technically<00:03:07.099> see<00:03:08.099> if<00:03:08.189> I<00:03:08.250> can<00:03:08.370> show<00:03:08.579> you<00:03:08.639> this

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
technically see if I can show you this

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.250 
technically see if I can show you this
there's<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.549> hinge<00:03:11.819> in<00:03:12.000> there<00:03:12.269> so<00:03:12.750> it's<00:03:13.079> got<00:03:13.230> a

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
there's a hinge in there so it's got a

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.140 
there's a hinge in there so it's got a
little<00:03:13.560> bit<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.769> extra<00:03:14.129> range<00:03:14.609> of<00:03:14.730> motion<00:03:15.060> in

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
little bit of extra range of motion in

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.809 
little bit of extra range of motion in
there<00:03:15.329> it's<00:03:15.780> really<00:03:15.959> stiff<00:03:16.409> but<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.950> can<00:03:17.189> use

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
there it's really stiff but you can use

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.689 
there it's really stiff but you can use
it<00:03:18.030> then<00:03:18.840> each<00:03:19.109> finger<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.799> articulated

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
it then each finger is articulated

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.270 
it then each finger is articulated
individually<00:03:21.419> I<00:03:21.599> thought<00:03:22.169> this<00:03:22.379> ugly<00:03:23.010> joint

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
individually I thought this ugly joint

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.680 
individually I thought this ugly joint
here<00:03:23.489> was<00:03:23.609> going<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.849> bother<00:03:24.030> me<00:03:24.209> but<00:03:24.419> you<00:03:24.540> get

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
here was going to bother me but you get

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.180 
here was going to bother me but you get
used<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:24.989> really<00:03:25.230> fast<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:25.949> it's<00:03:26.099> not

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
used to it really fast so it's not

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.189 
used to it really fast so it's not
really<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.489> problem<00:03:26.760> then<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.690> thumb<00:03:27.930> has<00:03:28.139> a

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
really a problem then the thumb has a

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.500 
really a problem then the thumb has a
swivel<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.159> hinge<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.609> it<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.329> can

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
swivel and a hinge in it so you can

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.420 
swivel and a hinge in it so you can
really<00:03:30.659> get<00:03:30.840> some<00:03:30.900> nice<00:03:31.199> poses<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.949> he<00:03:32.280> can

hold the staff with no problem at all

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.569 
hold the staff with no problem at all
just<00:03:35.909> rotate<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.629> thumb<00:03:36.870> down<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:38.400> it's

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
just rotate the thumb down and it's

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.399 
just rotate the thumb down and it's
really<00:03:38.790> not<00:03:39.030> an<00:03:39.180> issue<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:39.750> that's<00:03:40.079> a<00:03:40.169> very

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
really not an issue so that's a very

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:41.089 
really not an issue so that's a very
nice<00:03:40.620> feature

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
nice feature

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.559 
nice feature
having<00:03:41.549> figures<00:03:41.819> able<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.239> hold<00:03:42.389> their

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
having figures able to hold their

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.619 
having figures able to hold their
accessories<00:03:43.079> is<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.799> big<00:03:44.370> bonus<00:03:45.169> the<00:03:46.169> torso<00:03:46.650> is

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
accessories is a big bonus the torso is

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.110 
accessories is a big bonus the torso is
separate<00:03:48.739> he's<00:03:49.739> got<00:03:49.949> great<00:03:50.250> range<00:03:50.549> of<00:03:50.729> motion

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
separate he's got great range of motion

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.780 
separate he's got great range of motion
so<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.359> decide<00:03:51.919> rotation<00:03:52.919> in<00:03:53.159> front<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.549> back

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
so I decide rotation in front to back

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.240 
so I decide rotation in front to back
somewhat<00:03:54.599> limited<00:03:54.989> but<00:03:55.139> not<00:03:55.319> too<00:03:55.470> bad<00:03:55.709> the

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
somewhat limited but not too bad the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.250 
somewhat limited but not too bad the
shell<00:03:56.489> is<00:03:56.579> connected<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.180> top<00:03:57.389> half<00:03:57.659> which

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
shell is connected to the top half which

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.750 
shell is connected to the top half which
works<00:03:58.500> well<00:03:58.709> because<00:03:58.979> no<00:03:59.310> matter<00:03:59.459> how<00:03:59.579> you

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
works well because no matter how you

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.360 
works well because no matter how you
pose<00:04:00.060> me<00:04:00.269> it's<00:04:00.359> gonna<00:04:00.510> look<00:04:00.690> pretty<00:04:00.930> good<00:04:01.370> not

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
pose me it's gonna look pretty good not

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.770 
pose me it's gonna look pretty good not
really<00:04:02.609> too<00:04:02.760> much<00:04:02.790> of<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.120> problem<00:04:03.449> unless<00:04:03.569> you

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
really too much of a problem unless you

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.149 
really too much of a problem unless you
look<00:04:03.959> directly<00:04:04.349> from<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.650> side<00:04:04.859> then<00:04:05.069> it

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
look directly from the side then it

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.490 
look directly from the side then it
looks<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.400> little<00:04:05.549> weird<00:04:05.819> but<00:04:06.150> no<00:04:06.930> big<00:04:07.139> deal<00:04:07.319> the

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
looks a little weird but no big deal the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.780 
looks a little weird but no big deal the
belt<00:04:07.709> goes<00:04:07.919> all<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.099> way<00:04:08.250> around<00:04:08.519> on<00:04:08.669> the

belt goes all the way around on the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.149 
belt goes all the way around on the
shell<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.329> then<00:04:09.569> on<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.930> body<00:04:10.139> so<00:04:10.859> that<00:04:11.040> way

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
shell and then on the body so that way

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.770 
shell and then on the body so that way
that's<00:04:11.400> always<00:04:11.639> solid<00:04:12.060> too<00:04:12.359> so<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.629> looks

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
that's always solid too so it looks

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.710 
that's always solid too so it looks
great<00:04:13.669> hips<00:04:14.669> are<00:04:14.940> like<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.329> new<00:04:15.479> Marvel

a<00:04:50.410> huge<00:04:50.830> problem<00:04:51.580> because<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.419> toes<00:04:52.599> are

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
a huge problem because the toes are

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.870 
a huge problem because the toes are
individually<00:04:53.289> articulated<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:54.460> even<00:04:54.699> if<00:04:54.789> you

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
individually articulated so even if you

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.100

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
put his foot out to the side a little

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.070 
put his foot out to the side a little
farther<00:04:56.560> you<00:04:57.280> can<00:04:57.310> kind<00:04:57.639> of<00:04:57.729> turn<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:58.120> and<00:04:58.270> get

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
farther you can kind of turn it and get

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.080 
farther you can kind of turn it and get
it<00:04:59.199> to<00:04:59.289> work<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.560> way<00:04:59.590> you<00:04:59.740> want<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:00.849> it's

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
it to work the way you want and it's

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.969 
it to work the way you want and it's
okay<00:05:01.449> it's<00:05:01.810> not<00:05:01.990> a<00:05:02.020> problem<00:05:02.289> but<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:02.830> could

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
okay it's not a problem but it could

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.230 
okay it's not a problem but it could
have<00:05:03.099> been<00:05:03.190> a<00:05:03.250> little<00:05:03.580> bit<00:05:03.699> better<00:05:03.910> if<00:05:04.120> they

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
have been a little bit better if they

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.629 
have been a little bit better if they
did<00:05:04.449> the<00:05:04.570> head<00:05:05.009> other<00:05:06.009> than<00:05:06.130> that<00:05:06.400> thoughts

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
did the head other than that thoughts

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.760 
did the head other than that thoughts
have<00:05:06.849> really<00:05:07.210> solid<00:05:07.419> figure<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.199> size<00:05:08.440> alone

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
have really solid figure the size alone

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.560 
have really solid figure the size alone
makes<00:05:09.130> it<00:05:09.250> worth<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.610> price<00:05:09.820> I<00:05:10.060> think<00:05:10.389> he's<00:05:10.539> a

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570
