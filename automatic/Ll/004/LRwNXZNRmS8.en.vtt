00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
really agree with that they said that's

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.649 
really agree with that they said that's
not<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.630> realistic<00:01:40.110> which<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.130> agree<00:01:41.659> then

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
not really realistic which I agree then

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.480 
not really realistic which I agree then
we<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> pool<00:01:43.290> table<00:01:43.649> which<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.280> what

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
we have the pool table which I like what

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.980 
we have the pool table which I like what
he<00:01:44.549> did<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> pool<00:01:45.030> table<00:01:45.390> because<00:01:45.750> it's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
he did with the pool table because it's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.139 
he did with the pool table because it's
more<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.549> you<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.729> actually<00:01:47.970> feels<00:01:48.119> like

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
more of you know it actually feels like

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.929 
more of you know it actually feels like
a<00:01:48.270> pool<00:01:48.420> table<00:01:48.570> he<00:01:48.990> even<00:01:49.200> did<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.590> pool<00:01:49.890> cue<00:01:50.759> in

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
a pool table he even did a pool cue in

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.330 
a pool table he even did a pool cue in
the<00:01:51.060> middle<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.470> little<00:01:52.829> fish<00:01:53.100> tank

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
the middle we have a little fish tank

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.819 
the middle we have a little fish tank
here<00:01:53.689> now<00:01:54.689> let's<00:01:54.930> keep<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.170> mind<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.500> am<00:01:55.619> using

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
here now let's keep in mind I am using

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.109 
here now let's keep in mind I am using
their<00:01:56.009> texture<00:01:56.340> packs<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:56.759> some<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:56.969> these

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
their texture packs so some of these

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.639 
their texture packs so some of these
things<00:01:57.360> might<00:01:57.600> look<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.899> little<00:01:58.049> bit<00:01:58.259> different

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
things might look a little bit different

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.109 
things might look a little bit different
so<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.250> kind<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.460> keep<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.820> mind<00:02:00.000> as

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
so it's kind of keep that in mind as

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.990 
so it's kind of keep that in mind as
well<00:02:00.619> excuse<00:02:01.619> me<00:02:01.770> over<00:02:02.520> here<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
meant to change for the texturepack to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.980 
meant to change for the texturepack to
the<00:02:15.840> right<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.530> door<00:02:16.680> we<00:02:16.980> have<00:02:17.220> our<00:02:17.990> dining

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
that looks like a clock I'm not sure if

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.870 
that looks like a clock I'm not sure if
it<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.000> right<00:02:57.090> though<00:02:57.420> uh<00:02:58.310> right<00:02:59.310> here<00:02:59.340> we<00:02:59.670> have

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
it is right though uh right here we have

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.970 
it is right though uh right here we have
basically<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.840> relaxing<00:03:01.410> room<00:03:01.590> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
basically just a relaxing room the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.350 
basically just a relaxing room the
windows<00:03:02.280> open<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.760> can<00:03:02.880> look<00:03:03.120> at<00:03:03.210> the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
windows open so you can look at the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.260 
windows open so you can look at the
backyard<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:04.440> see<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.710> lot<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:04.950> stuff<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.580> just

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
backyard and see a lot of stuff and just

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.630 
backyard and see a lot of stuff and just
chillax<00:03:06.840> now<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.710> like<00:03:08.190> what<00:03:08.310> he<00:03:08.370> did<00:03:08.430> with<00:03:08.490> the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
chillax now I like what he did with the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.310 
chillax now I like what he did with the
faint<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.150> grandfather<00:03:09.570> clock<00:03:09.840> though<00:03:10.110> I've

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
faint the grandfather clock though I've

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.450 
faint the grandfather clock though I've
never<00:03:10.530> really<00:03:10.740> thought<00:03:10.770> about<00:03:11.040> doing<00:03:11.190> that

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
never really thought about doing that

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.530 
never really thought about doing that
but<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:11.910> really<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.390> unique<00:03:13.080> design<00:03:14.540> over

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
but it is really a unique design over

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.000 
but it is really a unique design over
here<00:03:15.720> we<00:03:15.840> have<00:03:15.960> some<00:03:16.080> of<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.230> bedrooms<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:16.860> we

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
here we have some of the bedrooms so we

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.820 
here we have some of the bedrooms so we
have<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.160> master<00:03:17.640> bedroom<00:03:18.360> maybe<00:03:18.780> I'm<00:03:19.290> I'm

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
have a master bedroom maybe I'm I'm

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.980 
have a master bedroom maybe I'm I'm
guessing<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.459> master<00:03:20.820> like<00:03:21.780> he<00:03:21.900> has

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
guessing this is the master like he has

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.230 
guessing this is the master like he has
a<00:03:22.020> little<00:03:22.380> hot<00:03:22.740> tub<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.100> looks<00:03:23.250> like<00:03:23.400> maybe<00:03:23.610> is

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
a little hot tub it looks like maybe is

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.500 
a little hot tub it looks like maybe is
this<00:03:24.810> master<00:03:25.260> I'm<00:03:25.440> not<00:03:25.740> too<00:03:26.130> sure<00:03:26.520> I<00:03:26.880> guess<00:03:27.390> I

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
this master I'm not too sure I guess I

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.980 
this master I'm not too sure I guess I
have<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.900> be<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:28.290> know<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.730> up<00:03:30.570> nope<00:03:30.810> this

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
have to be I know this is up nope this

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.660 
have to be I know this is up nope this
isn't<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.320> master<00:03:31.440> yes<00:03:31.740> that<00:03:31.980> was<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.340> master

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
isn't the master yes that was the master

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.400 
isn't the master yes that was the master
so<00:03:33.300> look<00:03:33.480> like<00:03:33.600> it's<00:03:33.750> only<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.990> one-bedroom

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
so look like it's only a one-bedroom

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.550 
so look like it's only a one-bedroom
house<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:36.660> we<00:03:36.930> can<00:03:37.050> kind<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.410> lay
