00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:04.270
 I now pull the third video to this day 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.260
 because hardly too good part both and I thought I'm just going fast 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.459
 the last video was a Ko 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.579
 in the same year again two nail polish to have 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:16.240
 and 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.110
 because I can fix something to say these are basically as always but of course 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.539
 to have naive is clear 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:24.769
 Steinmeier stopped that 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.029
 Rampf Dutch 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.449
 that meant Bhatti that meant in BÃ¼hlau 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.460
 I see it more like the room with the blue line 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.870
 Aabar we had at the 1 4 as a chef 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.100
 I'm the expert with colors and stuff like that, but that's me 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.379
 is a sad one 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.210
 look here 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.090
 to Comet light blue I stand so then also the weather looks like Bensheim 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.900
 to 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.820
 Vreni Elstner 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.030
 stands and does not stop smoking City anymore now 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.090
 and I think I honestly have the beautiful scenery here as well 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.550
 everywhere on it 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.770
 and therefore he is not 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.040
 Have you ever seen ten more so I think they are really beautiful 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.899
 Experience 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.009
 the only problem is the analyst 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.690
 as well as this 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.530
 Strategists in the Giessener really bad, everything is there really long 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.930
 until they are dry 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.230
 I know why the two are so outliers the others are one 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.180
 Really quite subtle though not the best though 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.180
 that mix right arm bit noticed that's not good 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.600
 dry the other 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.320
 I find myself defeated so I have the others because they eliminate so much 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.130
 because they are unpacked I was totally 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.250
 Percent enthusiastic 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.100
 I think that's a ketchup bottle or something like that anyway 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.680
 as if up here was the threat of it and it seemed like class 10 me 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.470
 my 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.990
 I thought that was totally funny 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.450
 and the hot one else sees today 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.080
 and it fits so totally so I find really schnieke opened 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.150
 I like it very much 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.289
 Unfortunately too 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.409
 the dry season 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.730
 not so great 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.229
 from the women otherwise looks just like me here on the area in the end too 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.219
 a single cover in a layer 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:13.299
 So smoke-kallat two layers that would also be unfavorable in the 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.509
 dry season 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.169
 but yes he brought a shift then it is covered or nothing to do 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.179
 on 1 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:24.839
 Georg r Trauer has so little bit Action Name Trend on the LN 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.609
 but they brought no Xpand 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:32.079
 Relatively poor fallen and the dry season unreasonable people from the puck 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.040
 through the wall a forest at POPMOG com or something 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.239
 he usually extends an info box 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.069
 At Amazon's win there, I do not have that much to new even Aabar 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.389
 if the culprit has or so then yes Wipro could still order 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.839
 Munich traveled I have already said everything 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:55.409
 I think so 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.239
 1 year 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.980
 that could have consequences 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.949
 p2 that's fast dry Frey 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:05.069
 cloudy from Preen WDR protect a color should have gepuppttet 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.549
 Year so this looks year goes "I would not have any athlete out of 6 4 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:13.089
 Voigt l 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:15.779
 focusing in one adjusting screw 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:19.450
 where I then donated money so friend of other country was nothing happened 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.779
 I am also unanimously riding 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:23.509
 otherwise 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:27.959
 That's not it was not that incredibly almost unbelievably worse 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.969
 it's got pigmeat 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.099
 and York 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.279
 that was it 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.279
 That was only short demonstrating show 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.329
 protrude 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.649
 in a 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.719
 if she feels good afterwards and see you next time
