the Saturn 2.0 keyboard is a slightly

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.370 
the Saturn 2.0 keyboard is a slightly
improved<00:00:11.340> version<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.059> Saturn<00:00:12.389> 1.0<00:00:12.900> the

improved version of the Saturn 1.0 the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.990

difference between the Windows key and

difference between the Windows key and
the<00:00:15.120> function<00:00:15.509> key<00:00:15.660> swapped<00:00:16.139> makes<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.619> easier

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
the function key swapped makes it easier

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.529 
the function key swapped makes it easier
to<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.039> my<00:00:17.160> desktop<00:00:17.430> but<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.150> LED

to of my desktop but the LED

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.000 
to of my desktop but the LED
backlighting<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.140> much<00:00:19.350> cooler<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.150 
colors but all keys were the same color
and<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.480> could<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.750> either<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.289> or<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:29.010> could

do where they pulse kind of like they

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.970 
do where they pulse kind of like they
breathe<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.810> colors<00:00:31.080> fade<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.650> come<00:00:31.830> back

with the Saturn 2.0 you get multi
section<00:00:36.690> colors<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.649> keys<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.100> could<00:00:38.219> see

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
section colors on the keys you could see

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.250 
section colors on the keys you could see
that<00:00:38.489> how<00:00:38.610> they<00:00:38.730> cycle<00:00:39.180> through<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.690> there's

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
that how they cycle through and there's

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260 
that how they cycle through and there's
different<00:00:40.440> sections<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.219> colors<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.790> didn't

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
different sections of colors I didn't

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.700 
different sections of colors I didn't
count<00:00:42.420> them<00:00:42.600> all<00:00:42.719> right<00:00:42.870> now<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.260> there's<00:00:43.500> one

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
count them all right now but there's one

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.729 
count them all right now but there's one
two<00:00:44.010> three<00:00:44.399> four<00:00:44.700> five<00:00:45.030> six<00:00:45.390> seven<00:00:45.660> eight<00:00:45.960> nine

10 11 there's 12 different cycling areas

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.319 
10 11 there's 12 different cycling areas
so<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:49.950> way<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.250> get<00:00:50.460> different<00:00:50.700> colors<00:00:51.149> for

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
so that way you get different colors for

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.939 
so that way you get different colors for
different<00:00:51.629> areas<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.960> your<00:00:52.140> keys<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:52.860> a

nice<00:00:53.340> little<00:00:53.579> effect<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> little<00:00:54.600> trick

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
nice little effect in the little trick

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.200 
nice little effect in the little trick
you<00:00:55.320> could<00:00:55.440> swap<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.949> color<00:00:56.190> schemes<00:00:56.640> like

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
you could swap the color schemes like

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.830 
you could swap the color schemes like

can also have it where they cycle and
roll<00:01:12.510> through<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> rainbow<00:01:13.409> they<00:01:13.680> roll

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
way that I could see offhand to make

way that I could see offhand to make
them<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.009> where<00:01:20.100> they're<00:01:20.189> all<00:01:20.400> solid<00:01:20.700> you're

that<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> mean<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:57.060> get<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.509> ability

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
that I mean you get the ability

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.030 
that I mean you get the ability
programming<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.350> buttons<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.860> can

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
programming in the buttons but it can

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.100 
programming in the buttons but it can
with<00:01:59.189> any<00:01:59.250> keyboard<00:01:59.520> configuration<00:02:00.450> thing

with any keyboard configuration thing

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.899 
with any keyboard configuration thing
but<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.770> know<00:02:01.860> they<00:02:01.979> could<00:02:02.040> add<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> one<00:02:02.670> or<00:02:02.759> two

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
but you know they could add a one or two

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.850 
but you know they could add a one or two
Mac<00:02:03.090> robots<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.600> probably<00:02:04.110> say<00:02:04.200> for<00:02:04.500> macro

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
Mac robots and probably say for macro

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.830 
Mac robots and probably say for macro
buttons<00:02:05.100> pop<00:02:05.340> them<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.640> somewhere<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.750> would

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
buttons pop them in somewhere that would

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.359 
buttons pop them in somewhere that would
probably<00:02:07.110> be<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> good<00:02:07.380> added<00:02:07.770> improvement<00:02:08.280> I'd

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
probably be a good added improvement I'd

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.010 
probably be a good added improvement I'd
say<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:09.060> other<00:02:09.179> thing<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.360> like<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.629> see<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
version 3 is I'm telling to like

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.809 
version 3 is I'm telling to like
keyboards<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.080> haven't

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
3.5 millimeter audio pastor they'll take

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.679 
3.5 millimeter audio pastor they'll take
it<00:02:16.280> like<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:16.489> my<00:02:16.519> laptop<00:02:16.969> my<00:02:17.060> desktops<00:02:17.420> under

the desk right and if I have 3.5
millimeter<00:02:20.090> headphone<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.629> I<00:02:20.659> don't<00:02:20.780> wanna

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
run a cord into the desk I'm up here

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.649 
run a cord into the desk I'm up here
it'd<00:02:22.639> be<00:02:22.760> nice<00:02:22.879> about<00:02:22.999> some<00:02:23.269> sort<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.480> audio

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
it'd be nice about some sort of audio

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.539 
it'd be nice about some sort of audio
pass-through<00:02:24.319> into<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.069> keyboard<00:02:25.249> some

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
pass-through into the keyboard some

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.069 
pass-through into the keyboard some
keyboards<00:02:25.879> offering<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.269> now<00:02:26.450> some<00:02:26.840> dome

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
keyboards offering that now some dome

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.839 
keyboards offering that now some dome
those<00:02:27.680> would<00:02:27.829> be<00:02:27.920> areas<00:02:28.189> that<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.519> think<00:02:28.579> they

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
those would be areas that I think they

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.399 
those would be areas that I think they
could<00:02:29.060> add<00:02:29.209> in<00:02:29.389> in<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.599> future<00:02:29.930> version<00:02:30.079> 3

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
could add in in a future version 3

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.259 
could add in in a future version 3
version<00:02:30.439> audio<00:02:31.310> pass-through<00:02:31.849> but

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
version audio pass-through but

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.789 
version audio pass-through but
especially<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.750> macro<00:02:33.139> buttons<00:02:33.409> having<00:02:33.680> a

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
especially the macro buttons having a

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.129 
especially the macro buttons having a

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:36.139 
you know about 4 mm 1 through m for

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:37.509 
you know about 4 mm 1 through m for
customizable<00:02:36.739> macro<00:02:37.040> buttons<00:02:37.250> they

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
customizable macro buttons they

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.559 
customizable macro buttons they
basically<00:02:37.730> do<00:02:37.939> nothing<00:02:38.120> unless<00:02:38.450> you

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
basically do nothing unless you

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.420 
basically do nothing unless you
customize<00:02:39.049> them<00:02:39.200> those<00:02:40.040> would<00:02:40.219> be<00:02:40.340> the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
customize them those would be the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.220 
customize them those would be the
probably<00:02:40.819> that's<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.540> last<00:02:41.840> little<00:02:42.049> touch

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
probably that's the last little touch

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.690 
probably that's the last little touch
I'd<00:02:42.439> add<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.739> make<00:02:42.859> this<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.129> perfect<00:02:43.310> gaming
