into<00:01:45.869> your<00:01:46.110> bridge<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:48.000> spotter<00:01:48.360> should<00:01:48.509> have

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
into your bridge the spotter should have

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.069 
into your bridge the spotter should have
your<00:01:49.290> feel<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.220> their<00:01:50.880> arms<00:01:51.840> right

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
your feel like this and their arms right

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.490 
your feel like this and their arms right
here<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.649> make<00:01:53.399> sure<00:01:53.430> they<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.790> their<00:01:54.270> own

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
here and make sure they have their own

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.889 
here and make sure they have their own
hands<00:01:55.500> too<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.640> lift<00:01:56.850> them<00:01:57.119> up<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.570> this

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
hands too and you lift them up like this

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.249 
hands too and you lift them up like this
and<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:59.070> each<00:01:59.310> time<00:01:59.729> use<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.780> little<00:02:01.110> less

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and then each time use a little less

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.800 
and then each time use a little less
pressure<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.520> then<00:02:02.700> by<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:02.969> end<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.540> date

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
pressure so then by the end of a date

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.899 
pressure so then by the end of a date
might<00:02:04.350> get<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> hang<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:05.790> you

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
might get the hang of it and if you

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.700 
might get the hang of it and if you
still<00:02:06.149> don't<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> hang<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.530> can

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
still don't have the hang of it you can

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.600 
still don't have the hang of it you can
use<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.160> wall<00:02:08.369> method<00:02:08.849> which<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.629> same<00:02:09.869> as

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
use the wall method which is the same as

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.040 
use the wall method which is the same as
thing<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:10.910> do<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.180> bridge<00:02:11.420> except<00:02:11.900> its

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
thing you do the bridge except its

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.590 
thing you do the bridge except its
recovery<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.940> basically<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:16.730> just<00:02:16.760> use<00:02:17.570> a

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
recovery so basically you just use a

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.180 
recovery so basically you just use a
little<00:02:17.750> wall<00:02:18.200> like<00:02:18.800> this<00:02:20.170> okay<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.380> then<00:02:21.620> you

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
little wall like this okay and then you

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.480 
little wall like this okay and then you
when<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.880> bridge<00:02:23.570> is<00:02:23.930> a<00:02:24.290> backbend<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:25.070> where<00:02:25.400> you

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
when a bridge is a backbend is where you

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.060 
when a bridge is a backbend is where you
walk<00:02:25.730> your<00:02:25.910> hands<00:02:26.120> down<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:27.050> for<00:02:27.260> recovery

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
walk your hands down but for recovery

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.570 
walk your hands down but for recovery
you<00:02:28.250> walk<00:02:28.460> your<00:02:28.610> hands<00:02:28.820> up<00:02:29.030> with<00:02:29.210> this<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:31.370> that

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
you walk your hands up with this so that

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.660 
you walk your hands up with this so that
was<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.820> bridge<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.660> then<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.410> covering<00:02:33.950> you

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
was a bridge and then the covering you

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.350 
was a bridge and then the covering you
walk<00:02:34.910> your<00:02:35.150> hands<00:02:35.450> up<00:02:35.890> like<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.550> you

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
walk your hands up like that and you

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.970 
walk your hands up like that and you
have<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.660> keep<00:02:38.840> doing<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.410> at<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.709> first

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
have to keep doing this at the first

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.100 
have to keep doing this at the first
time<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.490> might<00:02:40.640> be<00:02:40.760> able<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:40.970> walk<00:02:41.180> up<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.660> I

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
time you might be able to walk up and I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.870 
time you might be able to walk up and I
know<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.410> looks<00:02:42.560> easy<00:02:42.890> i<00:02:43.040> thought<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:43.550> was<00:02:43.640> easy

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
know it looks easy i thought it was easy

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.640 
know it looks easy i thought it was easy
to<00:02:44.000> when<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.510> watch<00:02:44.750> some<00:02:44.990> other<00:02:45.170> YouTube

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
to when I watch some other YouTube

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.340 
to when I watch some other YouTube
videos<00:02:45.680> on<00:02:46.160> how<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.370> do<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.760> then<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.870> turns<00:02:48.170> out

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
videos on how to do it then it turns out

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.520 
videos on how to do it then it turns out
it<00:02:48.590> wasn't<00:02:48.830> so<00:02:49.160> easy<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:50.780> can<00:02:51.170> just<00:02:51.200> keep

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
it wasn't so easy so you can just keep

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.280 
it wasn't so easy so you can just keep
trying<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.850> once<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.690> get<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.959> hang<00:02:53.989> of

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
trying that and once you get the hang of

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.560 
trying that and once you get the hang of
it<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.590> can<00:02:54.739> try<00:02:55.070> doing<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.459> on<00:02:55.640> yourself<00:02:56.300> if

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
it you can try doing it on yourself if

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.020 
it you can try doing it on yourself if
you're<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.140> hundred<00:02:57.440> percent<00:02:57.590> sure<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.940> you

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
you're a hundred percent sure that you

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.830 
you're a hundred percent sure that you
can<00:02:59.209> do<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.540> but<00:03:00.110> if<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:00.920> are<00:03:00.950> not<00:03:01.760> sure<00:03:01.840> but

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
can do it but if you are not sure but

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.470 
can do it but if you are not sure but
you<00:03:03.020> really<00:03:03.200> want<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.530> try<00:03:03.739> I<00:03:04.040> would<00:03:04.700> just<00:03:04.880> go

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
you really want to try I would just go

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.500 
you really want to try I would just go
ahead<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.870> try<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:06.350> anyway<00:03:06.890> because<00:03:07.520> really

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
ahead and try it anyway because really

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.250 
ahead and try it anyway because really
when<00:03:09.050> you<00:03:09.290> do<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.770> and<00:03:10.010> if<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.520> fail<00:03:10.910> like<00:03:11.840> if

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
when you do it and if you fail like if

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.970 
when you do it and if you fail like if
you<00:03:12.530> go<00:03:12.680> down<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.660> then<00:03:14.660> if<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.140> fail<00:03:15.500> you're
