this<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.180> very<00:00:39.540> very<00:00:39.719> interesting<00:00:40.440> because

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
this is very very interesting because

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.530 
this is very very interesting because
they're<00:00:41.280> not<00:00:41.430> seeing<00:00:41.670> anything<00:00:41.910> else<00:00:42.180> whiskey

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
and i think there is going to be a major

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.860 
and i think there is going to be a major
quest<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.640> future<00:00:44.940> about<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.570> happens

with this k so excited for that and our

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.490 
with this k so excited for that and our
next<00:00:49.739> question<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.480> extent<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:52.350> our

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
next question is to what extent do our

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.619 
next question is to what extent do our
godly<00:00:52.680> powers<00:00:53.129> work<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:54.000> against<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.449> gods

godly powers work just against the gods

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.569 
godly powers work just against the gods
or<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.469> develop<00:00:55.620> ourselves<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.460> new

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
or can we develop ourselves in the new

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.869 
or can we develop ourselves in the new
upcoming<00:00:56.789> skills<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:58.590> hour<00:00:58.739> v1<00:00:59.190> ourselves

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
upcoming skills to one hour v1 ourselves

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.900 
upcoming skills to one hour v1 ourselves
um<00:01:00.440> i<00:01:01.440> think<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:02.280> i<00:01:02.430> don't<00:01:02.640> think<00:01:02.670> we're

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
um i think that i don't think we're

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.380 
um i think that i don't think we're
going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.090> become<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.329> god<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:04.260> um<00:01:05.330> even<00:01:06.330> though

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
going to become a god but um even though

going to become a god but um even though
we<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.659> godly<00:01:07.020> powers<00:01:07.409> i<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.740> think<00:01:07.950> that

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
we have godly powers i just think that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.940

maybe we give it to someone someone else

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.160 
maybe we give it to someone someone else
becomes<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.909> god<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.479> give<00:01:12.659> our<00:01:12.780> golly<00:01:13.020> foul

or<00:02:34.359> not<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:35.379> think<00:02:35.829> they're<00:02:36.310> right<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.760> I

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
or not I I think they're right and I

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.470 
or not I I think they're right and I
think<00:02:36.879> it<00:02:37.299> was<00:02:37.510> just<00:02:37.569> a<00:02:37.750> glitch<00:02:38.129> but<00:02:39.480> possibly

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
think it was just a glitch but possibly

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.759 
think it was just a glitch but possibly
might<00:02:40.720> be<00:02:40.750> Majora's<00:02:41.140> ourselves<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.739> know

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
might be Majora's ourselves you know

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.569 
might be Majora's ourselves you know
brainwashed<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:43.569> maybe<00:02:44.440> were<00:02:44.859> the<00:02:44.889> evil

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579

secret weapon question number 6 Sarah

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.300

hide or will he beat zeros for once and
for<00:03:30.280> all<00:03:30.329> um<00:03:32.790> hmm<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:34.470> think<00:03:35.470> there<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:35.769> going<00:03:35.889> to

for all um hmm I think there is going to
be<00:03:36.159> something<00:03:36.340> between<00:03:36.639> zero<00:03:36.970> since<00:03:37.209> iraq<00:03:37.569> and

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
be something between zero since iraq and

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.509 
be something between zero since iraq and
i<00:03:37.870> think<00:03:38.290> is<00:03:38.409> with<00:03:38.859> that<00:03:38.889> new<00:03:39.159> god<00:03:39.370> that's

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
i think is with that new god that's

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.349 
i think is with that new god that's
going<00:03:39.639> to<00:03:39.699> come<00:03:39.790> out<00:03:39.849> there's<00:03:40.090> going<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.269> be<00:03:40.299> a

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
going to come out there's going to be a

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
i think imma be able to figure it out

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.409 
i think imma be able to figure it out
until<00:03:47.979> then<00:03:48.220> but<00:03:50.519> hmm<00:03:51.519> these<00:03:51.729> are<00:03:51.879> some<00:03:52.209> very

dungeoneering sagas there we go is the

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.040 
dungeoneering sagas there we go is the
one<00:04:59.320> with<00:04:59.500> Moya<00:04:59.860> and<00:05:00.270> where<00:05:01.270> she<00:05:01.690> they<00:05:01.990> were

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
one with Moya and where she they were

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.659 
one with Moya and where she they were
trying<00:05:02.260> to<00:05:02.380> go<00:05:02.979> into<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.310> realm<00:05:03.520> where

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
trying to go into the realm where

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.930 
trying to go into the realm where
zamorak<00:05:04.060> was<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:06.400> was<00:05:06.430> really<00:05:06.789> all<00:05:06.910> we

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
zamorak was and that was really all we

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.730 
zamorak was and that was really all we
have<00:05:07.240> had<00:05:07.510> since<00:05:07.810> then<00:05:07.990> which<00:05:08.139> at<00:05:08.320> is<00:05:08.530> very

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
have had since then which at is very

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.219 
have had since then which at is very
interesting<00:05:09.190> num<00:05:09.310> people<00:05:09.550> play<00:05:09.820> it<00:05:09.970> I<00:05:10.229> think

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
interesting num people play it I think

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:12.839 
interesting num people play it I think
unless<00:05:11.350> though<00:05:11.680> you<00:05:11.979> know<00:05:12.099> hardcore<00:05:12.460> vote<00:05:12.699> or

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
unless though you know hardcore vote or

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:15.990 
unless though you know hardcore vote or
people<00:05:13.210> do<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:14.160> I<00:05:15.160> think<00:05:15.699> it<00:05:15.820> should<00:05:15.940> be

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
people do and I think it should be

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.330 
people do and I think it should be
brought<00:05:16.660> more<00:05:16.900> attention<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.320> be<00:05:17.800> honest<00:05:18.099> and

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
brought more attention to be honest and

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.430 
brought more attention to be honest and
I<00:05:18.970> also<00:05:19.120> think<00:05:19.360> that<00:05:19.449> she<00:05:19.630> developed<00:05:20.020> the

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
I also think that she developed the

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.010 
I also think that she developed the
daemon<00:05:21.039> hind<00:05:21.220> more<00:05:21.400> because<00:05:21.759> if<00:05:22.449> not<00:05:22.660> had<00:05:22.930> an

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
daemon hind more because if not had an

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.200 
daemon hind more because if not had an
update<00:05:23.320> to<00:05:23.410> same<00:05:23.560> time<00:05:23.800> really<00:05:24.729> with<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:24.910> lore

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
update to same time really with the lore

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.870 
update to same time really with the lore
and<00:05:25.360> everything<00:05:25.630> since<00:05:25.870> it<00:05:26.020> came<00:05:26.169> out<00:05:26.289> so<00:05:26.949> that

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
and everything since it came out so that

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.680 
and everything since it came out so that
and<00:05:28.410> also<00:05:29.410> the<00:05:29.710> task<00:05:30.160> system<00:05:30.820> in<00:05:31.180> daytime<00:05:31.479> I

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
and also the task system in daytime I

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.839 
and also the task system in daytime I
want<00:05:32.530> desk<00:05:32.770> looks<00:05:33.010> task<00:05:33.430> system<00:05:34.199> now<00:05:35.849> eight

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 
want desk looks task system now eight

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:38.370 
want desk looks task system now eight
because<00:05:37.750> the<00:05:37.810> new<00:05:37.930> skill<00:05:38.169> will<00:05:38.289> be

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
because the new skill will be

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.960 
because the new skill will be
interstellar<00:05:38.830> just<00:05:39.159> put<00:05:39.400> our<00:05:39.520> traveling

interstellar just put our traveling
maybe<00:05:42.970> I<00:05:43.090> can<00:05:43.419> and<00:05:43.840> maybe<00:05:44.650> you<00:05:45.639> could<00:05:45.820> go

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
maybe I can and maybe you could go

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.839 
maybe I can and maybe you could go
across<00:05:46.360> different<00:05:46.720> planes<00:05:46.990> and<00:05:47.260> everything

across different planes and everything

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.520 
across different planes and everything
as<00:05:48.849> we<00:05:49.030> went<00:05:49.150> to<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:49.449> gothic<00:05:49.870> says<00:05:50.020> world<00:05:50.260> home

as we went to the gothic says world home
through<00:05:50.889> his<00:05:51.010> memory<00:05:51.280> it<00:05:51.669> would<00:05:51.849> be<00:05:51.940> kid<00:05:52.150> or

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
through his memory it would be kid or

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.390

like Moya in that saga as I was just

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.610
