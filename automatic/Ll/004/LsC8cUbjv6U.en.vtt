D major G major C adenine which is just
like<00:00:21.150> G<00:00:21.420> major<00:00:21.630> but<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:21.990> take<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.320> first<00:00:22.560> two

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
like G major but you take the first two

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.100 
like G major but you take the first two
fingers<00:00:22.950> and<00:00:23.189> put<00:00:23.340> them<00:00:23.430> down<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.640> string<00:00:24.110> and

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.500 
then the last chord is a minor seventh
which<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.680> from<00:00:29.400> CI<00:00:29.640> 9<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.240> take<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
which is from CI 9 you can take the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.240 
which is from CI 9 you can take the
first<00:00:30.750> finger<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.230> put<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.680> one<00:00:31.949> string

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.030 
first finger and put it up one string
and<00:00:32.550> then<00:00:33.270> take<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:34.110> second<00:00:34.500> finger<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.739> put

and then take the second finger and put
it<00:00:35.129> right<00:00:35.190> below<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> first<00:00:35.820> finger<00:00:36.150> in<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
it right below the first finger in the

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.680 
it right below the first finger in the
same<00:00:36.449> fret<00:00:37.070> it<00:00:38.070> sounds<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.400> that<00:00:38.519> so<00:00:39.420> for<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
same fret it sounds like that so for the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.979 
same fret it sounds like that so for the
introduction<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.360> chords<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.840> would

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
introduction the the chords you would

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.479 
introduction the the chords you would
play<00:00:43.199> our<00:00:43.530> E<00:00:43.860> minor<00:00:44.250> 7<00:00:44.790> 2<00:00:45.360> D<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:46.320> C<00:00:46.530> anyway<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
play our E minor 7 2 D to C anyway and

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.220 
play our E minor 7 2 D to C anyway and
usually<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.090> go<00:00:48.390> through<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.690> rotation

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
usually I just go through that rotation

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.900 
usually I just go through that rotation
two<00:00:49.410> times<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.040> can<00:00:50.190> do<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.489> however

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
two times but you can do it have however

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.910 
two times but you can do it have however
many<00:00:51.300> times<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.719> want<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.559> would<00:00:52.680> go<00:00:52.800> like

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
many times you want so it would go like

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:04.840 
many times you want so it would go like
this

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.310 

and<00:01:05.850> then<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.120> go<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:06.450> into<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.810> verse<00:01:07.020> and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
and then you go right into the verse and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.280 
and then you go right into the verse and
so<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> verse<00:01:07.920> goes<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.780> same<00:01:09.990> chords

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
so the verse goes is the same chords

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.020 
so the verse goes is the same chords
three<00:01:10.500> times<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.950> row<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.670> minor

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
three times in a row so it's a minor

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.290 
three times in a row so it's a minor
seventh<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:13.170> D<00:01:13.410> to<00:01:13.830> C<00:01:14.070> at<00:01:14.280> nine<00:01:14.520> three<00:01:14.880> times<00:01:15.120> in

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
seventh to D to C at nine three times in

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.750 
seventh to D to C at nine three times in
a<00:01:15.390> row<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.690> then<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.140> go<00:01:16.410> to<00:01:16.470> G<00:01:16.890> major<00:01:17.190> a<00:01:17.750> minor

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
a row and then you go to G major a minor

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.510 
a row and then you go to G major a minor
and<00:01:20.760> an<00:01:20.970> E<00:01:21.180> minor<00:01:21.300> seven<00:01:22.160> so<00:01:23.160> to<00:01:23.220> play<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520

and an E minor seven so to play the
introduction<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.270> verse<00:01:24.510> it<00:01:24.780> would<00:01:24.900> go<00:01:25.050> like

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
introduction in verse it would go like

00:01:25.229 --> 00:02:03.889 
introduction in verse it would go like
this<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.149> verse<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.630> then<00:02:03.750> you

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
this so that is the verse and then you

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.109 
this so that is the verse and then you
keep<00:02:04.140> going<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.680> however<00:02:04.830> many<00:02:05.130> verses<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
keep going and however many verses that

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.300 
keep going and however many verses that
you're<00:02:06.240> gonna<00:02:06.390> do<00:02:06.660> and<00:02:06.929> then<00:02:07.050> then<00:02:07.709> you'll<00:02:08.100> get

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
can play from C to a minor as many times

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.400 
can play from C to a minor as many times
as<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.910> want<00:02:15.030> for<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.330> transition<00:02:16.050> from<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
as you want for a transition from the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.840 
as you want for a transition from the
first<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.800> course<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.700> would<00:02:17.849> just<00:02:17.880> go

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.220 

and<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.090> make<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.360> however<00:02:24.570> long<00:02:24.840> you

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
and you can make that however long you

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.040 
and you can make that however long you
want<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.500> make<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:27.180> course<00:02:27.510> chords

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
want to make it and so the course chords

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.940 
want to make it and so the course chords
are<00:02:28.970> after<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.180> C<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.900> minor<00:02:31.320> you

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
are after the C and the a minor you

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.090 
are after the C and the a minor you
would<00:02:32.130> go<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.310> D<00:02:33.530> see<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:35.450> minor<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:37.260> then<00:02:37.740> again

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
would go to D see a minor and then again

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.270 
would go to D see a minor and then again
D<00:02:38.750> see<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:40.830> minor<00:02:41.460> and<00:02:41.910> then<00:02:42.630> D<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.860> E<00:02:44.100> minor

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
D see a minor and then D in E minor

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.240 
D see a minor and then D in E minor
seven<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:45.720> that's<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.110> whole<00:02:46.290> course<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.190> it

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
seven and that's the whole course so it

00:02:47.250 --> 00:03:12.580 
seven and that's the whole course so it
would<00:02:47.370> go<00:02:47.520> like<00:02:47.700> this

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.990 

and<00:03:13.590> then<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:13.860> end<00:03:14.069> up<00:03:14.250> on<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.640> E<00:03:14.670> minor

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
and then you end up on the E minor

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.119 
and then you end up on the E minor
seventh<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.599> that's<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.989> first<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.860> first
