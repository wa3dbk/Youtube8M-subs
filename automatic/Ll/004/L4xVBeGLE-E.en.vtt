those of you who have m16s no stands for
Armalite<00:00:33.780> rifle<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.469> that's<00:00:34.739> because<00:00:35.070> this

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
Armalite rifle and that's because this

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.430 
Armalite rifle and that's because this
rifle<00:00:35.550> was<00:00:35.880> first<00:00:36.149> designed<00:00:36.540> by<00:00:36.750> Jean<00:00:37.050> stoner

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
rifle was first designed by Jean stoner

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.510 
rifle was first designed by Jean stoner
at<00:00:37.770> Armalite<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:39.180> was<00:00:39.270> first<00:00:39.600> released<00:00:40.020> in

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
at Armalite and it was first released in

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.869 
at Armalite and it was first released in
1959

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
1959

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.240 
1959
now<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.450> AR<00:00:42.780> 7<00:00:43.170> has<00:00:43.320> gone<00:00:43.559> through<00:00:43.800> five

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
now the AR 7 has gone through five

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250 
now the AR 7 has gone through five
different<00:00:44.480> manufacturers<00:00:45.480> over<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.989> time

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
different manufacturers over that time

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.279 
different manufacturers over that time
but<00:00:46.530> today<00:00:46.969> Henry<00:00:47.969> brings<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.510> back<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.020> form

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
but today Henry brings it back in a form

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.930 
but today Henry brings it back in a form
that's<00:00:49.379> probably<00:00:50.039> as<00:00:50.160> good<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.399> better<00:00:50.640> than

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that's probably as good or better than

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.750 
that's probably as good or better than
it's<00:00:51.059> ever<00:00:51.210> been<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:52.170> has<00:00:52.680> some<00:00:53.280> really<00:00:53.489> unique

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
it's ever been it has some really unique

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.200 
it's ever been it has some really unique
features<00:00:54.110> one<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.140> which<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.210> molded

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
features one of which is the molded

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.439 
features one of which is the molded
plastic<00:00:57.840> stock<00:00:58.440> which<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.770> hollow<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.670> allows

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
plastic stock which is hollow and allows

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.080 
plastic stock which is hollow and allows
the<00:01:00.660> entire<00:01:00.989> action<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.280> broken<00:01:02.640> down<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the entire action to be broken down and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.509 
the entire action to be broken down and
put<00:01:03.270> inside<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.170> then<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> stock<00:01:05.070> itself

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
put inside it and then the stock itself

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.399 
put inside it and then the stock itself
is<00:01:05.909> filled<00:01:06.180> with<00:01:06.299> foam<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.110> once

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
is filled with foam so that once

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.649 
is filled with foam so that once
everything<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.010> sealed<00:01:08.280> inside<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.210> gun

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
everything is sealed inside the gun

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.399 
everything is sealed inside the gun
actually<00:01:09.900> floats<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
actually floats so you have a

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.770 
actually floats so you have a
semi-automatic<00:01:13.409> 22<00:01:14.310> long<00:01:14.549> rifle<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
semi-automatic 22 long rifle and the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.260 
semi-automatic 22 long rifle and the
entire<00:01:16.110> thing<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:16.830> put<00:01:17.100> inside<00:01:17.340> itself

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
entire thing can be put inside itself

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.200 
entire thing can be put inside itself
and<00:01:18.540> made<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.680> float<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.759> that's<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.030> pretty

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
and made to float so that's a pretty

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.450 
and made to float so that's a pretty
tall<00:01:21.479> order<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.290> survival<00:01:22.770> gun<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.340> it's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
tall order for a survival gun and it's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.280 
tall order for a survival gun and it's
always<00:01:23.729> been<00:01:24.119> kind<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.659> class<00:01:24.960> by<00:01:25.259> itself

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
always been kind of in a class by itself

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.749 
always been kind of in a class by itself
as<00:01:26.040> far<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:27.150> even<00:01:28.049> takedown<00:01:28.680> survival<00:01:29.280> guns<00:01:29.490> go

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
as far as even takedown survival guns go

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.399 
as far as even takedown survival guns go
but<00:01:30.000> there's<00:01:30.150> usually<00:01:30.299> have<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> two<00:01:31.110> pieces

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
but there's usually have the two pieces

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.069 
but there's usually have the two pieces
and<00:01:31.890> they<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.340> put<00:01:32.520> into<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.820> case<00:01:33.150> but

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
and they have to be put into a case but

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.819 
and they have to be put into a case but
in<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.500> case<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.939> case<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.079> stock<00:01:37.350> now

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
in this case the case is the stock now

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.950 
in this case the case is the stock now
even<00:01:38.100> though<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> design<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:39.060> fundamentally

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
even though the design is fundamentally

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.749 
even though the design is fundamentally
the<00:01:40.020> same<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.650> fact<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.040> lot<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> parts

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the same and in fact a lot of the parts

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.850 
the same and in fact a lot of the parts
interchange<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.630> magazine's<00:01:43.290> interchange

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
interchange the magazine's interchange

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.789 
interchange the magazine's interchange
across<00:01:44.460> all<00:01:44.729> those<00:01:44.939> manufacturers<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.439> Henry

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
across all those manufacturers the Henry

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.380 
across all those manufacturers the Henry
is<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.920> little<00:01:47.220> different<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.000> adds<00:01:48.210> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
is a little different in that it adds a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.889 
is a little different in that it adds a
few<00:01:49.040> refinements<00:01:50.040> one<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.850> which<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.329> an<00:01:51.450> extra

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
few refinements one of which is an extra

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.749 
few refinements one of which is an extra
magazine<00:01:52.110> storage<00:01:52.950> compartment<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
magazine storage compartment in the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.090 
magazine storage compartment in the
buttstock<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.659> actually<00:01:54.810> store<00:01:55.320> two

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
buttstock so it can actually store two

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.760 
buttstock so it can actually store two
magazines<00:01:56.689> they<00:01:57.689> do<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.290> removed

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
magazines they do have to be removed

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.069 
magazines they do have to be removed
from<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.340> action<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:00.780> get<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
from the action so you can get the

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.709 
from the action so you can get the
action<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.710> two<00:02:01.890> magazines<00:02:02.130> inside<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.299> then

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
action and two magazines inside and then

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.840 
action and two magazines inside and then
in<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> front<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.920> Henry<00:02:05.310> adds<00:02:05.490> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
in the in the front the Henry adds a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.260 
in the in the front the Henry adds a
bright<00:02:06.750> orange<00:02:07.259> front<00:02:08.160> sight<00:02:08.459> insert<00:02:09.030> which

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
bright orange front sight insert which

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.880 
bright orange front sight insert which
is<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> little<00:02:09.720> easier<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.140> pick<00:02:10.349> up<00:02:10.379> through

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
is a little easier to pick up through

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.020 
is a little easier to pick up through
the<00:02:11.069> aperture<00:02:11.610> rear<00:02:11.879> sight

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
the aperture rear sight

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.120 
the aperture rear sight
the<00:02:13.270> front<00:02:13.540> sight<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:14.110> adjustable<00:02:14.290> somewhat

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
the front sight is adjustable somewhat

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.950 
the front sight is adjustable somewhat
for<00:02:15.340> windage<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:15.970> then<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.150> rear<00:02:16.360> sight<00:02:16.690> is

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
for windage and then the rear sight is
