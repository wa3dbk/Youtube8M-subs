00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
evaporate off so that means we're

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.660 
evaporate off so that means we're
starting<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.540> lose<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:34.049> majority<00:01:34.400> we're<00:01:35.400> also

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
starting to lose a majority we're also

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.210 
starting to lose a majority we're also
starting<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.720> take<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.140> some<00:01:37.409> color<00:01:37.710> from<00:01:38.100> the

cast the natural tannins and the oak

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.190 
cast the natural tannins and the oak

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.020 
root give whisky some of it is of the
color<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.250> see<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.670> we're<00:01:44.790> starting

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
color so you can see that we're starting

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.149 
color so you can see that we're starting
to<00:01:45.360> get<00:01:45.509> some<00:01:45.750> colored<00:01:46.140> pink<00:01:46.500> clothes<00:01:46.770> there

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
to get some colored pink clothes there

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.700 
to get some colored pink clothes there
so<00:01:48.030> as<00:01:48.119> we<00:01:48.270> move<00:01:48.420> along<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.439> would<00:01:49.560> say

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
so as we move along and I would say

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.190 
so as we move along and I would say
maybe<00:01:49.860> between<00:01:50.310> 5<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.329> 10<00:01:51.720> years<00:01:51.990> we're

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
maybe between 5 to 10 years we're

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.600 
maybe between 5 to 10 years we're
starting<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.860> lose

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
starting to lose

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.050 
starting to lose
maturity<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.870> whiskey<00:01:55.230> begins<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:56.060> soften

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
maturity so the whiskey begins to soften

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.890 
maturity so the whiskey begins to soften
and<00:01:57.390> become<00:01:57.690> less<00:01:58.200> harsh<00:01:59.480> once<00:02:00.480> you<00:02:00.600> get<00:02:00.750> to

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
and become less harsh once you get to

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.600 
and become less harsh once you get to
about<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.170> point<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.280> roughly

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
about this point I see this is roughly

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.070 
about this point I see this is roughly
where<00:02:02.910> they<00:02:03.030> wouldn't<00:02:03.420> fourteen-year-old

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
where they wouldn't fourteen-year-old

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.200 
where they wouldn't fourteen-year-old
would<00:02:04.290> set<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:05.220> you<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.460> see<00:02:05.580> we've<00:02:05.730> lost<00:02:05.940> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
would set so you can see we've lost a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.240 
would set so you can see we've lost a
little<00:02:06.270> maturity<00:02:06.840> you've<00:02:07.590> now<00:02:07.770> got<00:02:07.980> the<00:02:08.070> nice

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
little maturity you've now got the nice

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.310 
little maturity you've now got the nice
increments<00:02:08.820> coming<00:02:09.119> from<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.450> castle<00:02:09.960> which

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
increments coming from the castle which

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.260 
increments coming from the castle which
is<00:02:10.350> very<00:02:10.680> balanced<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.000> urban

longer<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.209> whisky<00:02:36.600> matures<00:02:36.990> in<00:02:37.230> the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
longer that the whisky matures in the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.640 
longer that the whisky matures in the
cast<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.280> more<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.700> influence<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.350> cast

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
cast the more the influence of the cast

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.980 
cast the more the influence of the cast
plays<00:02:41.130> on<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.610> influence<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.480> whiskey

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
plays on the influence of the whiskey

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.320 
plays on the influence of the whiskey
and<00:02:43.590> when<00:02:43.770> we<00:02:43.860> get<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.070> very<00:02:44.550> alt<00:02:44.850> whiskies

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
and when we get to very alt whiskies

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.740 
and when we get to very alt whiskies
maybe<00:02:45.570> up<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.200> 30<00:02:46.650> 40<00:02:47.280> even<00:02:47.490> 50<00:02:48.000> years<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.570> each

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.380 
maybe up to 30 40 even 50 years of each
what<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.560> find<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.610> whisky<00:02:51.000> tastes

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
what you find is that the whisky tastes

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.570 
what you find is that the whisky tastes
an<00:02:51.540> awful<00:02:51.900> lot<00:02:52.050> they<00:02:52.470> actually<00:02:52.890> cast<00:02:53.190> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
an awful lot they actually cast the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.230 
an awful lot they actually cast the
witty<00:02:53.760> character<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:55.040> it's<00:02:56.040> also<00:02:56.250> very<00:02:56.760> deep

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
witty character and it's also very deep

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.150 
witty character and it's also very deep
in<00:02:57.480> color<00:02:57.750> as<00:02:57.989> well<00:02:58.200> because<00:02:58.590> it's<00:02:58.739> had<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.950> lot

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
in color as well because it's had a lot

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.210 
in color as well because it's had a lot
of<00:02:59.220> time<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.730> ensure<00:02:59.910> in<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.630> cask<00:03:00.900> now<00:03:01.890> at

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
of time to ensure in the cask now at

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.759 
of time to ensure in the cask now at
that<00:03:02.459> point<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:03.630> really<00:03:03.900> comes<00:03:04.320> down<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
that point it really comes down to the

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.259 
that point it really comes down to the
individual<00:03:05.250> whisky<00:03:05.700> whether<00:03:05.910> you've<00:03:06.090> got<00:03:06.239> a

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
individual whisky whether you've got a

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.660 
individual whisky whether you've got a
nice<00:03:06.450> balance<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.200> or<00:03:07.320> not<00:03:07.530> people<00:03:07.830> do<00:03:08.400> tend

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
nice balance to it or not people do tend

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.160 
nice balance to it or not people do tend
to<00:03:08.790> think<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.150> order<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.510> whisky<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.989> better

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
to think the order the whisky the better

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.560 
to think the order the whisky the better
I<00:03:10.620> was<00:03:11.010> true<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.459> point<00:03:11.790> but<00:03:12.180> by<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.390> time

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
I was true to a point but by the time

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.790 
I was true to a point but by the time
you<00:03:12.720> get<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.170> point

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
you get to this point

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.729 
you get to this point
it's<00:03:14.100> very<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:15.060> can<00:03:15.480> actually<00:03:15.900> t<00:03:16.320> small<00:03:16.590> of

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
it's very you can actually t small of

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.040 
it's very you can actually t small of
the<00:03:16.860> caspin<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.820> individual<00:03:18.660> whisky

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
the caspin of the individual whisky

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.710 
the caspin of the individual whisky
itself<00:03:19.440> sort<00:03:20.070> of<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.430> fine<00:03:20.730> balancing<00:03:21.390> act<00:03:21.600> that

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
itself sort of a fine balancing act that

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.410 
itself sort of a fine balancing act that
the<00:03:21.959> distillers<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.890> achieve<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:24.090> really

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the distillers have to achieve so really

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.590 
the distillers have to achieve so really
