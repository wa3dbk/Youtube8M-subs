 making Sunday lunch the father 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.320
 invited to go with him buy it though 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:34.870
 we came out with two bags full of 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.720
 Brasilia - I was getting excited 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.860
 because we were getting close to the 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.260
 snack bar 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.170
 but to my surprise my father passed 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.160
 straight and did not stop 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.329
 it seemed that he had not seen the snack bar 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.820
 so I asked you not going to buy 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.610
 here he said let's not 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.379
 forward 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.600
 we followed a few more meters and arrived 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.570
 near the wall of the bakery is well in 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.119
 in front of the snack bar 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.860
 I was intrigued can quietly 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.409
 he went ahead with you not 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.789
 I had seen the bakery I asked more 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.409
 We will not get the soft drinks. 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:20.229
 here and he patiently answered only 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.770
 a little more and has already we arrive 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.799
 in the market 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.130
 and hey I was getting annoyed and 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.259
 white and we have been through three 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.110
 different places that sold guarana 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.840
 My father wanted to walk alone but I'm already there. 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.780
 and he wanted to buy there I found it strange 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.340
 But that's when we enter the market. 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.319
 your whistle 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.909
 he gives us a very spontaneous smile 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.189
 the first thing you asked him was 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.390
 had improved from the flu and the 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.610
 was helpfully catching the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.229
 our bags and putting them in the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.360
 soft drinks 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.450
 My father wanted to know the woman's news. 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.369
 his wife and was informed that 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.039
 she was cleaning the house and preparing 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.670
 Sunday lunch was the only day of the 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:13.250
 the week that I did not work all day 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.069
 the two of them talked some more 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.190
 so I could observe the friendship and the 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.910
 affection that respectfully had a 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.980
 terror when you said goodbye 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.920
 silva made an affectionate gesture on my 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.049
 and looked with tenderness and commented 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.180
 With my dad, how's it going? 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.720
 Boy , you're going to be very proud. 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.609
 his 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.910
 we left that market and came back 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:39.910
 to home 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.730
 the way I started thinking and 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.860
 answer in my father's shoes 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.000
 the question that the same had made him 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.830
 meanwhile the price of that 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.420

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.450

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.410

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.140

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:08.090
