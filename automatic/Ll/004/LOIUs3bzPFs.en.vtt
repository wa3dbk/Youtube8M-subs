just<00:01:14.970> settle<00:01:15.240> down<00:01:15.360> earlier<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.710> know

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
just settle down earlier and I know

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.880 
just settle down earlier and I know
that's<00:01:17.040> his<00:01:17.250> style<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.540> moving<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:19.259> lot

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
that's his style of just moving a lot

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.920 
that's his style of just moving a lot
but<00:01:20.880> he<00:01:20.939> should<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.210> settled<00:01:21.509> out<00:01:21.570> earlier

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930

but he should have settled out earlier
stop<00:01:22.170> throwing<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.500> combinations<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.130> then

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
stop throwing the combinations and then

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.030 
stop throwing the combinations and then
I<00:01:24.390> think<00:01:24.840> he<00:01:24.930> would<00:01:25.049> want<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.680> know<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> lot
