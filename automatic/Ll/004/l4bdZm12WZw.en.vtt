00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.220 
pretty good so I would say that you know
six<00:00:32.250> months<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.730> definitely<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.329> long<00:00:33.660> end

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
six months is definitely on the long end

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
so so these vacuum packed machines can

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.990 
so so these vacuum packed machines can
do<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.320> trick<00:00:37.559> for<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.800> yeah<00:00:38.309> yeah<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:38.940> you

so that seals across the bottom I like
to<00:01:53.740> actually<00:01:54.160> seal<00:01:54.400> it<00:01:54.550> a<00:01:54.610> second<00:01:55.000> time<00:01:56.040> just

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
to actually seal it a second time just

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.760 
to actually seal it a second time just
so<00:01:57.130> that<00:01:57.160> it<00:01:57.370> doesn't<00:01:57.760> get<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.030> here<00:01:58.530> does<00:01:59.530> get

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
so that it doesn't get in here does get

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.990 
so that it doesn't get in here does get
air<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.220> then<00:02:00.750> every

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
and I like to start with the larger end

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.460 
and I like to start with the larger end
first<00:02:26.210> and<00:02:27.520> just<00:02:28.520> open<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.000> bag<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.350> lay<00:02:30.350> it

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
first and just open the bag and lay it

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.420 
first and just open the bag and lay it
down<00:02:30.500> on<00:02:30.800> one<00:02:31.010> side<00:02:32.230> okay

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
down on one side okay

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.510 
down on one side okay
these<00:02:34.430> should<00:02:34.610> be<00:02:34.640> relatively<00:02:35.300> dry<00:02:36.400> do<00:02:37.400> the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
these should be relatively dry do the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.220 
these should be relatively dry do the
same<00:02:37.700> thing<00:02:37.910> with<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.150> other<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.870> just<00:02:38.960> put

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
same thing with the other and just put

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.390 
same thing with the other and just put
it<00:02:39.320> on<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.500> other<00:02:39.620> side<00:02:39.740> you<00:02:40.040> want<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.220> leave<00:02:40.340> a

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
it on the other side you want to leave a

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.400 
it on the other side you want to leave a
little<00:02:40.490> bit<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.820> gap<00:02:41.030> in<00:02:41.300> between<00:02:41.330> them<00:02:41.810> okay

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
little bit of a gap in between them okay

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.470 
little bit of a gap in between them okay
the<00:02:42.980> idea<00:02:43.070> there<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.460> to<00:02:43.580> let<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.910> plastic

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
the idea there is to let the plastic

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.680 
the idea there is to let the plastic
seal<00:02:45.230> completely<00:02:45.680> around<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.400> fish<00:02:46.670> what<00:02:47.660> I

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
seal completely around the fish what I

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.030 
seal completely around the fish what I
like<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.050> do<00:02:48.200> because<00:02:48.410> it's<00:02:48.740> almost

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
like to do because it's almost

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.160 
like to do because it's almost
impossible<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.700> get<00:02:49.850> rid<00:02:49.880> of<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.330> little<00:02:50.959> bit

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
impossible to get rid of that little bit

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.850 
impossible to get rid of that little bit
of<00:02:51.230> extra<00:02:51.440> moisture<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:53.440> I'll<00:02:54.440> take<00:02:54.680> another

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
of extra moisture is I'll take another

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.880 
of extra moisture is I'll take another
paper<00:02:55.220> towel<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.750> fold<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.200> three<00:03:00.200> like

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
such and then I just kind of roll it up

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.120 
such and then I just kind of roll it up

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.280 
it keeps it from coming up to the top
and<00:03:49.500> breaking<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.920> seal

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.179 

pretty<00:03:52.920> neat<00:03:53.099> trick<00:03:53.340> there<00:03:53.670> subscribe<00:03:53.819> yeah

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
pretty neat trick there subscribe yeah

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.970 
pretty neat trick there subscribe yeah
so<00:03:56.189> once<00:03:56.640> that<00:03:56.730> sealed<00:03:57.239> always<00:03:57.989> just<00:03:58.680> give<00:03:58.859> it

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
so once that sealed always just give it

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.539 
so once that sealed always just give it
an<00:03:59.099> extra<00:03:59.459> seal<00:03:59.700> you<00:04:00.359> know<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:01.079> can<00:04:01.290> go<00:04:01.769> in<00:04:02.069> or

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
an extra seal you know you can go in or

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:03.920 
an extra seal you know you can go in or
out<00:04:02.579> it<00:04:02.939> doesn't<00:04:03.090> matter<00:04:03.239> just<00:04:03.599> put<00:04:03.719> another

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
out it doesn't matter just put another

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.030 
out it doesn't matter just put another
line
