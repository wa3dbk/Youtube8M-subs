00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you're right I got him upside down okay

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.670 
you're right I got him upside down okay
I<00:01:10.979> was<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> right<00:01:11.640> track<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:13.409> have

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
I was on the right track so I just have

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.469 
I was on the right track so I just have
to<00:01:13.890> make<00:01:14.130> sure<00:01:14.430> we're<00:01:14.729> at<00:01:14.880> least<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
to make sure we're at least in the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.710 
to make sure we're at least in the
ballpark<00:01:18.290> okay<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.850> these<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
ballpark okay I see so these are the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.249 
ballpark okay I see so these are the
bottoms<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.590> legs<00:01:22.950> are<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> little<00:01:23.790> loops<00:01:24.259> so

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
bottoms the legs are the little loops so

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.440 
bottoms the legs are the little loops so
I<00:01:25.290> initially<00:01:25.770> had<00:01:26.159> those<00:01:26.369> upside<00:01:26.909> down<00:01:27.119> but

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
I initially had those upside down but

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.480 
I initially had those upside down but
that<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:28.560> goes<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.829> show<00:01:30.979> directions<00:01:31.979> are

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
that just goes to show directions are

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.340 
that just goes to show directions are

have this upside down when you're
installing<00:03:42.260> these<00:03:42.739> yeah<00:03:43.310> well<00:03:43.610> I<00:03:43.640> didn't<00:03:43.910> know

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
installing these yeah well I didn't know

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.190 
installing these yeah well I didn't know
what<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.150> was<00:03:44.270> doing<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.540> first<00:03:44.750> time<00:03:44.989> and<00:03:45.140> I

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
what I was doing the first time and I

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.540 
what I was doing the first time and I
really<00:03:45.560> don't<00:03:45.830> know<00:03:46.040> what<00:03:46.160> I'm<00:03:46.250> doing<00:03:46.520> this

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
really don't know what I'm doing this

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:58.920 
really don't know what I'm doing this
time<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:51.190> think<00:03:52.900> back<00:03:53.900> down<00:03:54.260> here

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.479 

okay<00:03:59.930> so<00:04:00.290> this<00:04:00.470> could<00:04:00.890> be<00:04:01.010> something<00:04:01.280> like

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
okay so this could be something like

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:14.800 
okay so this could be something like
this<00:04:02.680> this<00:04:05.680> yes<00:04:06.680> now<00:04:13.150> how<00:04:14.150> did<00:04:14.330> you<00:04:14.450> determine

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
this this yes now how did you determine

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.360 
this this yes now how did you determine
that<00:04:15.019> those<00:04:15.290> legs<00:04:15.590> are<00:04:15.800> supposed<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.220> be

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
that those legs are supposed to be

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.460 
that those legs are supposed to be
positioned<00:04:16.910> that<00:04:17.060> way<00:04:17.269> that<00:04:18.200> was<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.380> only

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
positioned that way that was the only

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.379 
positioned that way that was the only
way<00:04:18.709> that<00:04:18.889> I<00:04:18.980> could<00:04:19.040> get<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.459> level<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:23.060> was

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
way that I could get it level and I was

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:33.670 
way that I could get it level and I was
just<00:04:23.540> taking<00:04:24.139> a<00:04:24.230> guess<00:04:28.660> okay<00:04:29.660> so<00:04:31.930> well<00:04:32.930> seems

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
just taking a guess okay so well seems

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.280 
just taking a guess okay so well seems
to<00:04:33.889> be<00:04:34.040> in<00:04:34.460> one<00:04:34.820> piece<00:04:35.090> okay

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.129 

that's<00:04:39.830> it<00:04:40.070> right<00:04:40.220> there<00:04:40.610> okay<00:04:41.330> so<00:04:41.389> what<00:04:42.080> do

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
that's it right there okay so what do

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.310 
that's it right there okay so what do
you<00:04:42.229> say<00:04:42.470> is<00:04:42.740> it<00:04:42.979> does<00:04:43.190> this<00:04:43.340> product<00:04:43.669> pass

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
mustard or is this a flunk no this is a

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.690 
mustard or is this a flunk no this is a
flunk<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:48.139> think<00:04:48.410> this<00:04:48.560> is<00:04:48.740> a<00:04:48.770> one-time<00:04:49.340> deal

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700
