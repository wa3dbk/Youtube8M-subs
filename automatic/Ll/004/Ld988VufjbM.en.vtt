different types of fruit in them there

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.619 
different types of fruit in them there
are<00:00:43.350> even<00:00:43.500> some<00:00:43.739> types<00:00:44.519> that<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:44.850> not<00:00:45.239> fruit

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
but savory things like a meat in there

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.680 
but savory things like a meat in there
I'm<00:00:49.710> not<00:00:49.949> sure<00:00:50.010> exactly<00:00:50.670> how<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.940> would<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.539> that

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
I'm not sure exactly how I would do that

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.630 
I'm not sure exactly how I would do that
I<00:00:51.750> think<00:00:52.019> I'd<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.589> a<00:00:52.649> pre<00:00:52.980> cooked<00:00:53.160> meat<00:00:53.429> or

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
I think I'd have a pre cooked meat or

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.340 
I think I'd have a pre cooked meat or
you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.059> put<00:00:54.210> nothing<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.690> them<00:00:54.809> at<00:00:54.929> all<00:00:55.050> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
you can put nothing in them at all and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.009 
you can put nothing in them at all and
just<00:00:55.379> make<00:00:55.769> like<00:00:55.980> an<00:00:56.129> elephant<00:00:56.550> ear<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.780> just

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
just make like an elephant ear and just

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.590 
just make like an elephant ear and just
powder<00:00:58.589> sugar<00:00:58.980> them<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.640> cinnamon<00:01:00.390> sugar

they're great yeah you could try

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.750 
they're great yeah you could try
cranberries<00:01:03.420> blueberries<00:01:04.610> something<00:01:05.610> like

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
