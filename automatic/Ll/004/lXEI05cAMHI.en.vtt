for this I have mine set on f4 because

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.970 
for this I have mine set on f4 because
on<00:02:50.960> Jerry's<00:02:51.960> and<00:02:52.170> what<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.290> think<00:02:52.590> there's<00:02:52.860> this

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
on Jerry's and what I think there's this

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.760 
on Jerry's and what I think there's this
press<00:02:53.250> f10<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.820> closes<00:02:54.210> a<00:02:54.330> window

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
press f10 it closes a window

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.830 
press f10 it closes a window
where's<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.890> counter-strike<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.610> think<00:02:56.970> so

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
where's the counter-strike I think so

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.970 
where's the counter-strike I think so
it's<00:02:58.170> quite<00:02:58.410> annoying<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:59.490> so<00:02:59.760> change<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.210> f4

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
it's quite annoying that so change to f4

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.860
