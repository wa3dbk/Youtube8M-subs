boot very good this is still yet a very
warm

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
warm

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.540 
warm
for<00:01:46.320> both<00:01:46.470> food<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.040> spend<00:01:47.280> all<00:01:47.520> day

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
for both food that you can spend all day

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.730 
for both food that you can spend all day
in<00:01:47.880> absolutely<00:01:48.659> we<00:01:48.990> use<00:01:49.200> two<00:01:49.710> different

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
in absolutely we use two different

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.950 
in absolutely we use two different
technologies<00:01:50.550> for<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.240> first<00:01:51.510> one<00:01:51.720> is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
technologies for that the first one is

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.440 
technologies for that the first one is
the<00:01:52.229> bio<00:01:52.440> vent<00:01:52.740> liner<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.670> by<00:01:53.909> au<00:01:53.940> vent<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
the bio vent liner so by au vent is a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.120 
the bio vent liner so by au vent is a
technology<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.409> created<00:01:55.800> last<00:01:55.950> year

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
technology that we created last year

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.219 
technology that we created last year
which<00:01:56.700> helps<00:01:57.060> draw<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.479> moisture<00:01:57.720> away<00:01:58.110> from

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
which helps draw the moisture away from

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.859 
which helps draw the moisture away from
the<00:01:58.530> foot<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.950> helps<00:01:59.700> channel<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.450> moisture

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
the foot and helps channel that moisture

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.510 
the foot and helps channel that moisture
out<00:02:01.050> through<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.440> backs<00:02:01.650> and<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.979> sides<00:02:02.220> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
out through the backs and the sides and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.660 
out through the backs and the sides and
then<00:02:03.119> we<00:02:03.240> use<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.630> SCS<00:02:04.259> technology<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.190> solemn

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
then we use the SCS technology a solemn

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.210 
then we use the SCS technology a solemn
and<00:02:05.790> cushioning<00:02:06.180> system<00:02:06.240> which<00:02:07.140> fits<00:02:07.979> a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
and cushioning system which fits a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.390 
and cushioning system which fits a
little<00:02:08.490> bit<00:02:08.610> closer<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.330> foot<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:10.400> so

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
little bit closer to the foot and so

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.190 
little bit closer to the foot and so
therefore<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:12.390> going<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.660> be<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> little<00:02:12.959> bit

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
therefore it's going to be a little bit

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.360 
therefore it's going to be a little bit
warmer<00:02:13.530> too<00:02:13.709> nice<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.900> a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
warmer too nice and this is a

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.040 
warmer too nice and this is a
performance-oriented<00:02:17.480> boot<00:02:18.480> here<00:02:18.750> with<00:02:19.020> a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
performance-oriented boot here with a

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.940 
performance-oriented boot here with a

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
what a hundred 101 millimeter West yeah

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.160 
what a hundred 101 millimeter West yeah
it's<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.160> hundred<00:02:23.459> millimeter<00:02:23.820> last<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.930> the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
it's a hundred millimeter last in the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.080 
it's a hundred millimeter last in the
four<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.709> forefoot<00:02:26.100> but<00:02:26.640> we're<00:02:26.820> still

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
four in the forefoot but we're still

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.750 
four in the forefoot but we're still
creating<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.660> great<00:02:28.050> heel<00:02:28.380> pocket<00:02:28.680> okay<00:02:29.220> secure

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
creating a great heel pocket okay secure

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.940 
creating a great heel pocket okay secure
the<00:02:29.940> foot<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.690> it's<00:02:30.989> not<00:02:31.170> sliding<00:02:31.590> around

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
the foot so that it's not sliding around

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.070 
the foot so that it's not sliding around
when<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.340> customer<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.150> looking<00:02:33.630> for<00:02:34.050> a

is<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> little<00:02:39.150> more<00:02:39.300> forgiving<00:02:39.780> boot<00:02:39.989> than<00:02:40.260> say

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
is a little more forgiving boot than say
