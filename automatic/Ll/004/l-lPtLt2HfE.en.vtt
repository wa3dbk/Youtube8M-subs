00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 today I would like to talk about the bull with 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.250
 largest horns in the world 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.550
 concretely some horns that exceeded 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.360
 the 92 centimeters in diameter and that 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.070
 they were a huge weight for this animal 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.710
 has the guiness record this bull 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.310
 known as the arc for owning 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.199
 biggest horns in the world it says its 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.109
 owner says that the horns started 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.810
 to grow in later than normal but 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.420
 in a slow and systematic way until 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.850
 He died thus giving him the greatest 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.690
 horns that have never existed the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.730
 news is real that is not photoshop nor 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.950
 it's nothing like that, in fact 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.039
 find in a museum so if you want 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.379
 visit him can do today 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.680
 as I said the art as it is called 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.539
 this bull was the number one that has 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.350
 been and remains the number one in 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.690
 size with 92 25 centimeters in diameter 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.000
 not only are they long but also 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.250
 They are not thick enough 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.660
 It was preserved by a taxidermist 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.420
 after dying and belonged to a 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.690
 African race call and cold watusi 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.460
 although in reality he lived in the USA 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.400
 the most notable feature of this 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.470
 race is that they have very long horns and 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.300
 their size since they can weigh 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.740
 up to 730 kilograms is to say that the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.720
 owner of the art 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.460
 it was janis wolf 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.220
 who for having won the record 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.170
 guinness and receive as much publicity could 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.360
 help your foundation rescue 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.300
 animals 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.910
 a curiosity a curiosity really 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.100
 you can not get to understand how a 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.200
 organism can develop these 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.810
 horns more than anything because it does not have 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.310
 no type of biological effectiveness in the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.050
 environment in which you are going to have these 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.080
 horns will only hinder the 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.570
 existence of this being imagine charging 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.060
 with that tremendous weight every day what 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.910
 difficult that it must be no, although it is 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.399
 true that the bones of cattle 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.709
 bones of cattle not horns 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.410
 they usually weigh a lot horns of this 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.209
 would think enough kilos with what 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.780
 which should be taken into account that 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.550
 I should be carrying all that weight 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.580
 throughout his life during the part 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.560
 end of his life he did not die because of it 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.780
 died for having such big horns 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.330
 and so heavy but he died for 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.400
 aging to this day is still 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.830
 studying what was the cause of that 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.209
 about growth but has not yet 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.209
 reached no conclusion
