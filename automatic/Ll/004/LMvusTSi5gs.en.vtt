incredibly good one is playing for

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.800 
incredibly good one is playing for
Sunderland<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:05.909> he<00:01:06.000> joined<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.420> Liverpool

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
Sunderland then he joined for Liverpool

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.140

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
and after this fever he literally went

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.530 
and after this fever he literally went
down<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.519> like<00:02:35.610> 40<00:02:36.000> pace<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.329> he<00:02:36.420> was

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
completely unusable throughout all

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.100 
completely unusable throughout all
FIFA's<00:02:38.640> after<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.150> one<00:02:39.360> unfortunately<00:02:39.510> but

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
FIFA's after this one unfortunately but

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.750 
FIFA's after this one unfortunately but
you<00:02:40.470> know<00:02:40.590> still<00:02:40.829> a<00:02:40.860> fantastic<00:02:41.099> car<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.579> look

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
you know still a fantastic car to look

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.119 
you know still a fantastic car to look
at<00:02:41.849> on<00:02:42.000> FIFA<00:02:42.360> FIFA<00:02:42.840> 11<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.560> like<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.769> said<00:02:43.829> I

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
at on FIFA FIFA 11 and like I said I

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.069 
at on FIFA FIFA 11 and like I said I
think<00:02:44.370> p4<00:02:44.819> 11<00:02:45.090> cards<00:02:45.329> are<00:02:45.480> one<00:02:45.629> of<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.780> bests

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
think p4 11 cards are one of the bests

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.289

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
player and the final centre back is

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.960 
player and the final centre back is
going<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.590> be<00:02:49.650> 84<00:02:50.010> rated<00:02:50.310> team<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:50.670> seasons

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
less defending and yeah it looks like a

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.119 
less defending and yeah it looks like a
pretty<00:03:00.390> awesome<00:03:00.599> defense<00:03:01.260> but<00:03:01.590> let's<00:03:01.980> move

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
downing from FIFA 13 and I mean this is

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.479 
downing from FIFA 13 and I mean this is
so<00:03:22.169> unexpected<00:03:22.319> for<00:03:22.889> me<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:22.980> actually<00:03:23.250> thought

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
so unexpected for me I actually thought

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.710 
so unexpected for me I actually thought
they<00:03:23.639> had<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.819> much<00:03:24.000> better<00:03:24.180> winger<00:03:24.540> than

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
they had a much better winger than

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.479 
they had a much better winger than
downing<00:03:25.079> but<00:03:25.230> apparently<00:03:25.530> on<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.130> left<00:03:26.340> side

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
downing but apparently on the left side

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.250 
downing but apparently on the left side
they<00:03:26.669> haven't<00:03:26.970> had<00:03:27.090> anybody<00:03:27.359> better<00:03:27.720> than<00:03:27.810> 85

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
rated foot and he was actually really

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.119

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
good when he first when Liverpool but

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.440 
good when he first when Liverpool but
then<00:03:32.250> he<00:03:32.340> had<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.459> really<00:03:32.669> bad<00:03:32.879> season<00:03:33.269> where<00:03:33.389> he

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
then he had a really bad season where he

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.900 
then he had a really bad season where he
literally<00:03:33.690> had<00:03:33.900> no<00:03:34.260> no<00:03:34.859> goals<00:03:35.099> no<00:03:35.220> assists<00:03:35.760> and

absolutely fantastic Adam I think this

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.689 
absolutely fantastic Adam I think this
is<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.120> second<00:04:26.690> inform<00:04:27.110> on<00:04:27.440> FIFA<00:04:27.949> 11<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.580> it

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
is a second inform on FIFA 11 and it

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.040
