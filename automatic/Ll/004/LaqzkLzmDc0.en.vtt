rain is still up so I'm trying to take

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.450 
rain is still up so I'm trying to take

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
alligator he goes to the earthquake I

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.480 
alligator he goes to the earthquake I
was<00:01:19.380> thinking<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.799> he<00:01:19.920> probably<00:01:20.100> might<00:01:20.310> take

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
was thinking that he probably might take

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.219 
was thinking that he probably might take
advantage<00:01:20.610> go<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.299> head<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:22.080> just

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
advantage go for the head it's just

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.510 
advantage go for the head it's just
something<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.100> again<00:01:23.220> he

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
something like that but then again he

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.060 
something like that but then again he
probably<00:01:23.549> might<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.210> sturdy<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.530> might<00:01:25.860> not

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
probably might be sturdy so it might not

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.490 
probably might be sturdy so it might not
necessarily<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:26.520> advantageous<00:01:27.060> for<00:01:27.840> him<00:01:28.049> to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
necessarily be advantageous for him to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.219 
necessarily be advantageous for him to
go<00:01:28.650> for<00:01:28.950> or<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.850> move<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.600> would<00:01:30.780> inflict

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
go for or have a move that would inflict

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.560 
go for or have a move that would inflict
any<00:01:31.409> kind<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.650> record<00:01:31.770> damage<00:01:32.310> onto<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.909> um

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
any kind of record damage onto it so um

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.630 
any kind of record damage onto it so um
I'm<00:01:33.869> pretty<00:01:34.320> lucky<00:01:34.500> here<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.860> looked<00:01:35.100> out<00:01:35.310> so

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
I'm pretty lucky here I looked out so

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.310 
I'm pretty lucky here I looked out so
i'll<00:01:35.759> go<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.540> ice<00:01:36.659> punch<00:01:36.930> thinking<00:01:37.229> that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
i'll go for the ice punch thinking that

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.810 
i'll go for the ice punch thinking that
he<00:01:37.439> might<00:01:37.470> switch<00:01:38.070> out<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.460> he<00:01:38.579> didn't<00:01:38.759> go

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
he might switch out like he didn't go

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.460 
he might switch out like he didn't go
for<00:01:39.000> Rob<00:01:39.150> house<00:01:39.360> or<00:01:39.540> anything<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.960> I'm

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
for Rob house or anything like that I'm

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.530 
for Rob house or anything like that I'm
like<00:01:40.680> what<00:01:40.890> would<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.460> stay<00:01:41.670> with<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.970> agron

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
like what would you stay with the agron

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.690 
like what would you stay with the agron
so<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:42.990> got<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.380> earthquake<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.130> i<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.340> like

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
so I got that earthquake in i have like

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.130 
so I got that earthquake in i have like
Bruno<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.329> could<00:01:45.479> potentially<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
Bruno I could potentially have the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.350 
Bruno I could potentially have the
waterfall<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.920> something<00:01:47.729> else<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.090> want<00:01:48.240> for

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
waterfall and something else I want for

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.789 
waterfall and something else I want for
the<00:01:48.420> ice<00:01:48.540> punch<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.259> know<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> guess

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the ice punch but you know I guess

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.770 
the ice punch but you know I guess
whatever<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.549> over<00:01:50.820> predicted<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
whatever I just over predicted you and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.270 
whatever I just over predicted you and
you<00:01:51.899> shouldn't<00:01:52.200> necessarily<00:01:52.290> over<00:01:52.979> predict

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you shouldn't necessarily over predict

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
you shouldn't necessarily over predict
too<00:01:53.430> early<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.820> game<00:01:54.030> wishing<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.079> had

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
too early in the game wishing that I had

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.990 
too early in the game wishing that I had
the<00:01:55.380> stl<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> Aquajet<00:01:56.520> would<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:56.850> been<00:01:56.939> a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
the stl so the Aquajet would have been a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.510 
the stl so the Aquajet would have been a
one-shot<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.930> Excel<00:01:58.469> Gore<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:59.070> but

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
one-shot to this Excel Gore here but

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.010 
one-shot to this Excel Gore here but
that's<00:01:59.759> not<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.090> case<00:02:00.240> he<00:02:00.450> goes<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.750> Giga

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
that's not the case he goes to the Giga

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.530 
that's not the case he goes to the Giga
Drain<00:02:01.290> pretty<00:02:01.799> straightforward<00:02:02.610> actually<00:02:03.060> so

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
Drain pretty straightforward actually so

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.060 
Drain pretty straightforward actually so
I<00:02:03.570> was<00:02:03.719> thinking<00:02:03.810> about<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.439> my<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> grunt

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
I was thinking about going to my a grunt

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.410 
I was thinking about going to my a grunt
but<00:02:05.189> then<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.700> thing<00:02:05.850> gets<00:02:06.030> access

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
but then I know this thing gets access

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.510 
but then I know this thing gets access
to<00:02:06.479> focus<00:02:06.960> blast<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.799> kind<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> nice<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.250> I

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
to focus blast it's kind of nice that I

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.520 
to focus blast it's kind of nice that I
do<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.910> lot<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.209> priority<00:02:09.750> people<00:02:10.140> here<00:02:10.319> so

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
do have a lot of priority people here so

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.350 
do have a lot of priority people here so
I'm<00:02:10.800> thinking

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
I'm thinking

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.520 
I'm thinking
you<00:02:11.420> might<00:02:11.570> probably<00:02:11.720> want<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.080> switch<00:02:12.320> out

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
you might probably want to switch out

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.810 
you might probably want to switch out
now<00:02:12.800> because<00:02:13.130> he's<00:02:13.280> seen<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.550> sucker<00:02:13.730> punch

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
now because he's seen the sucker punch

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.880 
now because he's seen the sucker punch
before<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.540> I'll<00:02:14.750> switch<00:02:15.050> up<00:02:15.170> my<00:02:15.200> moves<00:02:15.500> on<00:02:15.710> him

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
before so I'll switch up my moves on him

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.860 
before so I'll switch up my moves on him
go<00:02:16.310> for<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.520> shadow<00:02:16.760> snake<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.300> I<00:02:17.540> was<00:02:17.810> like

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
go for the shadow snake and I was like

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.620 
go for the shadow snake and I was like
oh<00:02:18.170> my<00:02:18.410> gosh<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.920> stayed<00:02:19.220> in<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:20.180> know<00:02:20.330> but

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
oh my gosh you stayed in you know but

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.760 
oh my gosh you stayed in you know but
you<00:02:20.870> know<00:02:20.960> he<00:02:21.170> probably<00:02:21.290> could<00:02:21.590> have<00:02:21.620> had

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
you know he probably could have had

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.200 
you know he probably could have had
substance<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.430> never<00:02:22.580> could<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:23.000> never

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
substance of you never could you never

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.700 
substance of you never could you never
know<00:02:23.360> these<00:02:23.630> kind<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:23.870> things<00:02:23.960> so<00:02:24.590> he

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
know these kind of things so he

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.470 
know these kind of things so he
breathing<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.130> glide<00:02:25.310> girl<00:02:25.520> right<00:02:25.730> I'm<00:02:26.060> a

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.000 
breathing the glide girl right I'm a

to rules that means that he doesn't have
the<00:02:50.330> ability<00:02:50.810> immunity<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:51.770> you<00:02:51.830> know<00:02:52.160> I<00:02:52.190> could

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
the ability immunity so you know I could

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.610 
the ability immunity so you know I could
probably<00:02:52.459> um<00:02:52.850> accumulate<00:02:53.810> some<00:02:53.959> toxic<00:02:54.320> damage

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
probably um accumulate some toxic damage

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.430 
probably um accumulate some toxic damage
onto<00:02:54.860> it<00:02:55.040> but<00:02:55.550> fortunately<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.450> try<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.170> kind<00:02:57.350> of

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
onto it but fortunately I try to kind of

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.140 
onto it but fortunately I try to kind of
trick<00:02:57.709> them<00:02:57.890> into<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.400> know<00:02:58.489> thinking<00:02:58.940> that

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
trick them into you know thinking that

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.640 
trick them into you know thinking that
you<00:02:59.300> know<00:02:59.330> I'm<00:02:59.600> probably<00:02:59.780> fast<00:03:00.230> or<00:03:00.440> something

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
you know I'm probably fast or something

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.199 
you know I'm probably fast or something
like<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.770> because<00:03:00.980> Agron<00:03:01.580> can<00:03:01.760> potentially

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
like that because Agron can potentially

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.630 
like that because Agron can potentially
be<00:03:02.540> faster<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.650> lot<00:03:03.739> of<00:03:03.800> gligar<00:03:04.280> sets<00:03:04.520> that
