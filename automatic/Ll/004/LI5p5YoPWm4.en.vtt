00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
sway bar not coming off

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.350 
sway bar not coming off
is<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.710> Ford<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:11.550> their<00:00:11.700> infinite<00:00:12.059> wisdom

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
is that Ford in their infinite wisdom

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.740 
is that Ford in their infinite wisdom
decided<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.830> press<00:00:14.099> these<00:00:14.309> bolts<00:00:14.759> into<00:00:15.030> or

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
decided to press these bolts into or

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.099 
decided to press these bolts into or
press<00:00:15.990> or<00:00:16.199> spot<00:00:16.440> weld<00:00:16.650> them<00:00:17.400> into<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.539> support

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
press or spot weld them into the support

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.140 
press or spot weld them into the support
here<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:19.920> can't<00:00:20.310> get<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> ratchet<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
here so I can't get a ratchet on the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.670 
here so I can't get a ratchet on the
backside<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.840> even<00:00:22.199> if<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.350> could<00:00:22.380> get<00:00:22.650> a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
backside and even if I could get a

backside and even if I could get a
ratchet<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> backside<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:23.910> a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
ratchet on the backside it's just a

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.660 
ratchet on the backside it's just a
flathead<00:00:24.390> bolt<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.840> they<00:00:25.769> spin<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.460> I've<00:00:26.550> got

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
flathead bolt and they spin so I've got

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.240 
flathead bolt and they spin so I've got

not going to take the k-member out

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.670 
not going to take the k-member out
because<00:01:07.619> these<00:01:07.830> bolts<00:01:08.159> are<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:08.640> rotted

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
because these bolts are really rotted

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
millimeter six point socket alright they

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.030 
millimeter six point socket alright they
still<00:01:51.149> didn't<00:01:51.899> want<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.140> budge<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.590> let's<00:01:52.860> put

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
some heat to it and I'd not have to put

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.719 
some heat to it and I'd not have to put
some<00:01:54.810> heat<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:56.130> shield's<00:01:56.520> are<00:01:56.610> all

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
some heat to it and the shield's are all

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.490 
some heat to it and the shield's are all
cracked<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.299> rotted<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:58.520> also<00:01:59.520> got<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.500> ball

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
cracked and rotted I also got the ball

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.520 
cracked and rotted I also got the ball
joints<00:02:01.979> out<00:02:02.130> when<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.909> cut<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.360> end<00:02:03.600> link<00:02:04.380> on

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
joints out when I cut the end link on

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.709 
joints out when I cut the end link on
this<00:02:04.680> side<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:06.149> also<00:02:06.270> see<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
this side but you can also see the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.400 
this side but you can also see the
bushings<00:02:07.710> are<00:02:07.890> kind<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.780> worn<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.080> I'm<00:02:10.259> going

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
bushings are kind of worn so I'm going

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.750 
bushings are kind of worn so I'm going
to<00:02:10.440> replace<00:02:10.649> those<00:02:10.920> while<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.220> got<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.459> control

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
to replace those while I got the control

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.270 
to replace those while I got the control
arms

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
arms

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.200 
arms
and<00:02:12.520> eventually<00:02:13.420> when<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.810> pick<00:02:13.960> up<00:02:14.050> my

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
and eventually when I pick up my

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.570 
and eventually when I pick up my
sandblaster<00:02:16.210> I'm<00:02:16.270> gonna<00:02:16.420> blast<00:02:16.600> these<00:02:16.870> and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
sandblaster I'm gonna blast these and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.680 
sandblaster I'm gonna blast these and
paint<00:02:18.580> them<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:18.940> they<00:02:19.030> look<00:02:19.060> nice

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
paint them so they look nice

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.140 
paint them so they look nice
colossal<00:02:20.080> roads<00:02:20.530> around<00:02:20.650> here<00:02:20.860> in<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.880> winter

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
colossal roads around here in the winter

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.580 
colossal roads around here in the winter
are<00:02:22.330> gonna<00:02:22.450> make<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.990> mess<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.230> them<00:02:23.440> again

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590

anyway

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.560 
anyway
but<00:02:24.400> they'll<00:02:24.610> protect<00:02:24.940> them<00:02:25.180> for<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.360> little

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
but they'll protect them for a little

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.050 
but they'll protect them for a little
while<00:02:25.690> longer<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:27.610> same<00:02:27.820> with<00:02:27.970> the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
while longer and the same with the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.430 
while longer and the same with the
knuckles<00:02:28.420> probably<00:02:28.930> I'm<00:02:29.020> going<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.200> replace

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
knuckles probably I'm going to replace

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.130 
knuckles probably I'm going to replace

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
the bearings too and the springs will be

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.840 
the bearings too and the springs will be
new<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.620> calipers<00:02:33.070> will<00:02:33.160> all<00:02:33.220> be<00:02:33.370> new<00:02:33.550> I'm

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
new the calipers will all be new I'm

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.710 
going to try and paint everything on
this<00:02:35.080> build<00:02:35.350> so<00:02:36.010> that<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:37.030> stays<00:02:37.330> fresh<00:02:37.690> a

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
this build so that it stays fresh a

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.560 
this build so that it stays fresh a
