were choosing i'm going to add it to all
four<00:02:52.060> sides<00:02:52.300> what<00:02:52.960> you<00:02:53.050> can<00:02:53.200> also<00:02:53.350> do<00:02:53.740> is

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
four sides what you can also do is

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.890 
four sides what you can also do is
shrink<00:02:54.280> down<00:02:54.580> how<00:02:54.880> much<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.480> paper<00:02:55.630> is

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.630 
shrink down how much of the paper is
showing<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:56.710> there's<00:02:56.980> really<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.250> cool<00:02:57.460> way<00:02:57.610> to

showing so there's really a cool way to

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.490 
showing so there's really a cool way to
add<00:02:57.910> like<00:02:58.180> some<00:02:58.390> paper<00:02:58.630> strips<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.350> your

or<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.810> can<00:03:28.959> go<00:03:29.110> back<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:31.110> remove<00:03:32.110> it<00:03:32.290> from

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
or you can go back and remove it from

or you can go back and remove it from
any<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:32.980> sides<00:03:33.220> so<00:03:33.430> that<00:03:33.550> you<00:03:33.790> have<00:03:34.000> just

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
any of the sides so that you have just

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.210 
any of the sides so that you have just
the<00:03:34.450> RIP<00:03:34.630> on<00:03:34.870> one<00:03:35.200> side<00:03:35.440> if<00:03:35.620> you'd<00:03:35.770> like<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:35.950> try

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
the RIP on one side if you'd like to try

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.870

and<00:03:36.400> see<00:03:36.550> what<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:36.790> looks<00:03:36.850> like<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.730> there

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
and see what that looks like so there

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.090 
and see what that looks like so there
you<00:03:40.030> go<00:03:40.060> that's<00:03:40.630> pretty<00:03:40.990> simple<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.590> what<00:03:41.980> I'm

cutest can be and I'm going to add the
rip<00:03:59.770> feature<00:04:00.070> to<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:01.860> couple<00:04:02.860> of<00:04:02.980> sides<00:04:03.220> of<00:04:03.459> his

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
rip feature to a couple of sides of his

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.440 
rip feature to a couple of sides of his
picture<00:04:04.360> now<00:04:04.930> you'll<00:04:05.110> see<00:04:05.170> that<00:04:05.440> it's<00:04:06.450> got

picture now you'll see that it's got

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.090 
picture now you'll see that it's got
just<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.780> little<00:04:07.810> bit<00:04:08.110> of<00:04:08.200> riff<00:04:08.380> edge<00:04:08.590> here<00:04:08.920> and

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
just a little bit of riff edge here and

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.030 
just a little bit of riff edge here and
like<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.310> said<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.610> can<00:04:09.640> adjust<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:11.020> depth<00:04:11.830> of

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
like I said you can adjust the depth of

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.729 
like I said you can adjust the depth of
the<00:04:12.190> rip<00:04:12.930> so<00:04:13.930> that<00:04:14.080> you<00:04:14.170> get<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.350> little<00:04:14.530> bit

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
the rip so that you get a little bit

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.470 
the rip so that you get a little bit
more<00:04:14.860> pronounced<00:04:15.459> edge<00:04:15.670> and<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.180> can<00:04:16.330> also

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
more pronounced edge and you can also

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.870 
more pronounced edge and you can also
still<00:04:16.900> add<00:04:17.049> a<00:04:17.080> shadow<00:04:17.440> with<00:04:17.680> no<00:04:17.859> problem<00:04:18.280> so<00:04:18.760> it

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
still add a shadow with no problem so it

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.159 
still add a shadow with no problem so it
gives<00:04:18.970> you<00:04:19.120> a<00:04:19.150> little<00:04:19.270> bit<00:04:19.450> more<00:04:19.570> dimension<00:04:19.780> to

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
gives you a little bit more dimension to

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.370 
gives you a little bit more dimension to
your<00:04:20.200> page<00:04:21.270> we<00:04:22.270> can<00:04:22.419> also<00:04:22.570> go<00:04:22.840> back<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.230> rip

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
your page we can also go back and rip

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.100 
your page we can also go back and rip
the<00:04:23.560> top<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.240> then<00:04:25.240> you've<00:04:25.419> got<00:04:25.600> it<00:04:25.780> on<00:04:25.870> all

the top and then you've got it on all
the<00:04:26.650> sides<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:27.100> you<00:04:27.190> wanted<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.490> indict<00:04:27.880> to

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
the sides that you wanted to indict to

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.150 
the sides that you wanted to indict to
include<00:04:29.490> there<00:04:30.490> you<00:04:30.640> go<00:04:30.789> and<00:04:31.919> what's<00:04:32.919> kind<00:04:33.039> of

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
images and stacked papers so if I were

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.400 
images and stacked papers so if I were
to<00:04:49.430> do<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:49.700> rip<00:04:49.880> feature<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.570> just<00:04:50.840> do<00:04:51.050> on

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
to do the rip feature and just do on

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.170 
to do the rip feature and just do on
this<00:04:51.650> side<00:04:51.920> and<00:04:51.950> give<00:04:52.310> it<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.460> real<00:04:52.640> pronounced

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
this side and give it a real pronounced

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.780 
this side and give it a real pronounced
look<00:04:53.450> there<00:04:53.780> we<00:04:53.930> go<00:04:54.080> and<00:04:54.380> then<00:04:55.130> send<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:55.670> the

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
look there we go and then send it to the

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.770 
look there we go and then send it to the
back<00:04:57.490> it<00:04:58.490> gives<00:04:58.610> us<00:04:58.790> a<00:04:58.880> nice<00:04:59.060> way<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.270> add<00:04:59.510> some

back it gives us a nice way to add some

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.660 
back it gives us a nice way to add some
dimension<00:04:59.960> to<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.740> mats<00:05:00.980> that<00:05:01.160> we<00:05:01.370> have<00:05:01.520> on

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
dimension to the mats that we have on

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.700
