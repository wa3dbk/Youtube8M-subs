00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
gonna cost 500 gold so if you're a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.910 
gonna cost 500 gold so if you're a
really<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:51.059> cheap<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.350> am<00:00:52.680> I

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
really really cheap like I am I

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.590 
really really cheap like I am I
don't<00:00:53.460> know<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.879> really<00:00:54.120> want<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.360> get<00:00:54.449> it

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
don't know if you really want to get it

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.330 
don't know if you really want to get it
but<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.750> my<00:00:54.870> opinion<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.469> worth<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
but in my opinion it is worth it the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.279 
but in my opinion it is worth it the
transformation<00:00:57.149> lasts<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:57.750> around<00:00:57.840> five

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
transformation lasts for around five

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.869 
transformation lasts for around five
minutes<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.129> about<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.370> thirty<00:00:59.670> minute

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
minutes and it's about a thirty minute

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.420 
minutes and it's about a thirty minute
cooldown<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.010> long<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
cooldown so it's not that long of a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.070 
cooldown so it's not that long of a
transformation<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:03.989> you

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
transformation but it's what you

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.109 
transformation but it's what you
transform<00:01:04.619> into<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.100> find<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.729> really

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
transform into that I find really really

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300 
transform into that I find really really
cool<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.330> appealing<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.650> way<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.010> get
