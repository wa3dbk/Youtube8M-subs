00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.500
 The teacher's salary for you teaches 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.230
 in a single period you do not survive from 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.750
 You do not even need at least 32 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.119
 classes and then you end up having to pick up 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.160
 two or three periods to be able to supply 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.730
 this space is the great question of the lives of 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.910
 teachers are salaries and we study 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.009
 as much as the engineer and we do not 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.380
 win a third of the money earned our 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.540
 class hour is very low indeed the state 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.840
 de SÃ£o Paulo has one of the class hours 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.230
 the lowest in Brazil despite its 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.110
 the richest state in the country around the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.690
 whole state a huge lack of 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.460
 teachers have already seen cases of 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.230
 students stayed for a full year without 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.730
 teacher and the whole class between a 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.460
 substitute teacher different 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.750
 usually the subjects of mathematics 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:04.110
 it's physical all areas started the year 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.630
 there are no teachers there are no students 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.900
 is revolted because it is a career that 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.180
 financially it does not attract further 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.490
 the teachers of today they in 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.710
 which gives classes for 11 50 and 60 students 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.229
 children with dream schools that do not have 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.729
 away schools that do not have schools 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.619
 that do not have computers that do not 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.780
 have stuff we should have on 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.090
 minimum is a printer so that people 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.189
 You could not even at least 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.909
 different activity at school does not 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.860
 toner 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.240
 There is no sheet in the school if you want 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.460
 to do this you have to be your cable 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.009
 Money and take it to school. 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.100
 pupil totally dominated by schools 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.049
 that you go on a court there is no court 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.869
 you put in a classroom do not have 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.610
 floor fan that is working 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.070
 many schools do not even want to 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.890
 nor technology library offered 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.659
 by the state is obsolete then you go 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.950
 use the internet does not have or is very slow 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.950
 computers is not enough 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.960
 per room they give no support to the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.460
 neither the secretariat nor the school unit 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.300
 does not give any support so that people 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.950
 do a differentiated job that runs away 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.360
 Educational material on the board of 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.780
 education 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.780
 send to us 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.900
 continued progression exists yes we 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.430
 we are obliged to pass students from 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.070
 year unless they have some 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.110
 problem the student can not be 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.970
 approved two years in the same series 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.140
 teacher does not do this to punish more 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.850
 because he can not tell 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.290
 Clinton 's apology for not 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.910
 have to pay for the student to stay 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.090
 time at school and made it even more 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.040
 our job because now it's me who 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.660

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.190

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.390
 When it comes to my hand, it does not yet 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.380
 can neither read nor write 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:52.520
 teaching is not just being a partner to teaching 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:56.330
 the quality of your work is a 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.209
 decent work to work as a citizen and she 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.300
 has to be respected 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.660
 the way we deserve it while 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.430
 teachers that's what I want to talk to 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.680
 leave it to all fellow teachers 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.510
 what to see in an interview we do not 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.660
 give up education 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.470
 we're not one more who gave up 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.620
 because without education no country can 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.430
 progress towards the rights of citizenship 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.880
 is in the economy 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.880
