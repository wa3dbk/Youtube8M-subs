actually at the mo sec which is a mobile
security<00:01:16.200> conference<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.189> know<00:01:17.310> what

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
security conference and you know what

security conference and you know what
they<00:01:17.520> did<00:01:18.770> no<00:01:19.770> they<00:01:20.430> demoed<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.090> iOS<00:01:21.869> 8.3

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.770 
they did no they demoed the iOS 8.3
jailbreak<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.820> at<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.030> point<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.570> that

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
jailbreak so at this point we know that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.350 
jailbreak so at this point we know that
pangu<00:01:25.140> has<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> jailbreak<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.189> iOS<00:01:26.340> 8.3<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
pangu has a jailbreak for iOS 8.3 and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.569 
pangu has a jailbreak for iOS 8.3 and
possibly<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.080> working<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.500> 8.4<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:29.490> we

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
possibly it's working on 8.4 but we

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.800 
possibly it's working on 8.4 but we
really<00:01:29.790> don't<00:01:29.909> know<00:01:30.119> because<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> wasn't

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
really don't know because it wasn't

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.960

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
interpreted is WWDC is on Monday so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.860 
interpreted is WWDC is on Monday so
Apple<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.790> probably<00:02:21.090> going<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.329> release<00:02:21.569> iOS
