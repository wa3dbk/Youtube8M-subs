00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
weeks old so it's not an old tank but

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.880

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.580 
come as a surprise to a lot of you
considering<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.689> I've<00:01:54.810> used<00:01:54.960> fully<00:01:55.229> mature

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
considering that I've used fully mature

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.389 
considering that I've used fully mature
live<00:01:55.920> rock<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:57.329> also<00:01:58.229> used<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.829> product

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
live rock and I also used this product

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.300 
live rock and I also used this product
Dennett<00:01:59.850> roll<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.320> this<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.979> followed

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
Dennett roll and this I just followed

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.649 
Dennett roll and this I just followed
the<00:02:02.399> instructions<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.240> volume<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the instructions to the volume of the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.109 
the instructions to the volume of the
water<00:02:03.869> as<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.649> how<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.829> cycle<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.640> tank<00:02:05.820> at<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
water as to how to cycle the tank at the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.900 
water as to how to cycle the tank at the
start<00:02:06.420> now<00:02:06.689> I'm<00:02:07.680> unsure<00:02:07.950> whether<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.550> was<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
start now I'm unsure whether it was the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.760 
start now I'm unsure whether it was the
fact<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.479> fully<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.739> know

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
fact that it's just fully you know

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.740 
fact that it's just fully you know
mature<00:02:11.099> live<00:02:11.430> rock<00:02:11.640> or<00:02:11.819> it's<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.420> Dennett

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
mature live rock or it's this Dennett

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.410 
mature live rock or it's this Dennett
roll<00:02:12.900> as<00:02:13.020> well

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
roll as well

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.180 
roll as well
just<00:02:13.660> telling<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.020> what<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.319> did<00:02:14.680> there<00:02:15.040> can

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
just telling you what I did there can

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.330 
just telling you what I did there can
only<00:02:15.250> be<00:02:15.400> one<00:02:15.520> of<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.880> two<00:02:16.090> factors<00:02:16.420> there<00:02:17.340> you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
only be one of the two factors there you

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.190 
only be one of the two factors there you
know<00:02:18.459> no<00:02:18.670> water<00:02:19.030> was<00:02:19.390> brought<00:02:19.630> from<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.020> other

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
know no water was brought from the other

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.410 
know no water was brought from the other
tank<00:02:20.500> over<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:20.860> was<00:02:20.980> all<00:02:21.099> brand-new<00:02:21.550> water<00:02:21.940> but

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
tank over it was all brand-new water but

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.199 
tank over it was all brand-new water but
just<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.810> rock<00:02:23.080> was<00:02:24.010> brought<00:02:24.280> over<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.910> I

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
just the rock was brought over and I

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.880 
just the rock was brought over and I
used<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.630> Dennett<00:02:25.930> roll<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.319> start<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.770> off

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
used the Dennett roll to start it off

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.470 
used the Dennett roll to start it off
what<00:02:27.459> I<00:02:27.489> also<00:02:27.880> did<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:30.250> added<00:02:30.610> pretty<00:02:31.300> much

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
what I also did is I added pretty much

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
what I also did is I added pretty much
be<00:02:32.140> full<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.120> ended<00:02:34.360> 800<00:02:34.870> milliliters<00:02:35.140> of

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
be full and I ended 800 milliliters of

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.910 
be full and I ended 800 milliliters of
bio<00:02:35.709> pellets<00:02:36.160> at<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.400> start<00:02:37.319> just<00:02:38.319> got<00:02:38.800> that

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
bio pellets at the start just got that

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.590 
bio pellets at the start just got that
running<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.519> poured<00:02:39.880> some<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.510> the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
running and I poured some of the

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.229 
running and I poured some of the
denature<00:02:41.019> all<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.410> I<00:02:41.440> was<00:02:41.620> supposed<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.100> earn

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
denature all that I was supposed to earn

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.509 
denature all that I was supposed to earn
you<00:02:43.239> know<00:02:43.410> I've<00:02:44.410> used<00:02:44.440> in<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:44.980> tanker<00:02:45.280> poured

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
you know I've used in the tanker poured

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.059 
you know I've used in the tanker poured
it<00:02:45.610> into<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.080> these<00:02:47.080> would<00:02:47.319> be<00:02:47.530> actual

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
it into the these would be actual

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.090 
it into the these would be actual
chamber<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:49.120> reactor<00:02:49.690> when<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.410> started<00:02:50.950> to

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
chamber the reactor when I started to

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.220 
chamber the reactor when I started to
try<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.489> get<00:02:51.640> those<00:02:51.819> bacteria<00:02:52.690> going<00:02:52.959> all

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
try and get those bacteria going all

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.380 
try and get those bacteria going all
over<00:02:53.260> those<00:02:53.620> bio<00:02:53.830> pellets<00:02:54.250> easily<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:55.030> know<00:02:55.180> I

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
over those bio pellets easily you know I

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.390 
over those bio pellets easily you know I
think<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.840> even<00:02:55.959> left<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.769> bio<00:02:56.950> pellets<00:02:57.310> to

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
think I even left the bio pellets to

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.430 
think I even left the bio pellets to
kind<00:02:57.580> of<00:02:57.640> soak<00:02:57.970> in<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:58.269> for<00:02:58.569> a<00:02:58.630> bit<00:02:58.810> before<00:02:58.989> even

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
kind of soak in it for a bit before even

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.949 
kind of soak in it for a bit before even
turning<00:02:59.709> it<00:02:59.920> on<00:03:00.010> now<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:01.090> ask<00:03:01.330> me<00:03:01.540> why<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.690> did

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
turning it on now to ask me why I did

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.600 
turning it on now to ask me why I did
that<00:03:01.989> it's<00:03:02.319> just<00:03:02.530> in<00:03:02.650> my<00:03:02.769> head<00:03:02.980> I<00:03:03.040> just<00:03:03.220> thought

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
that it's just in my head I just thought

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.180 
that it's just in my head I just thought
you<00:03:03.910> know<00:03:04.060> makes<00:03:04.750> sense<00:03:05.049> there's<00:03:05.410> bacteria<00:03:06.069> in

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
you know makes sense there's bacteria in

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.030 
you know makes sense there's bacteria in
there<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:07.030> know<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.870> technically<00:03:08.440> it's

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
there I know that technically it's

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.130 
there I know that technically it's
supposed<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.459> be<00:03:09.580> you<00:03:09.880> know<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.239> nitrifying

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
supposed to be you know a nitrifying

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.170 
supposed to be you know a nitrifying
bacteria<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:12.100> can<00:03:12.280> turn<00:03:12.400> ammonia<00:03:12.970> into

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
bacteria that can turn ammonia into

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.300 
bacteria that can turn ammonia into
nitrite<00:03:13.750> into<00:03:14.190> nitrate<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.640> oh<00:03:16.829> you<00:03:17.829> know<00:03:18.010> I

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
nitrite into nitrate and oh you know I

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.039 
nitrite into nitrate and oh you know I
don't<00:03:18.640> know<00:03:18.820> what<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.120> what<00:03:19.450> this<00:03:19.630> exact

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
don't know what the what this exact

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.500 
don't know what the what this exact
bacteria<00:03:20.769> is<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.459> lives<00:03:22.060> on<00:03:22.209> these<00:03:22.329> bio

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
bacteria is that lives on these bio

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.140 
bacteria is that lives on these bio
pellets<00:03:22.900> but<00:03:23.079> I<00:03:23.109> did<00:03:23.440> that<00:03:23.709> anyway<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.820> so

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
pellets but I did that anyway and and so

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.509 
pellets but I did that anyway and and so
whether<00:03:25.660> that<00:03:25.840> helped<00:03:26.440> or<00:03:26.620> not<00:03:26.680> again<00:03:27.190> I<00:03:27.400> don't

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
whether that helped or not again I don't

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.860 
whether that helped or not again I don't
know<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:27.970> answer<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.540> any<00:03:28.660> of<00:03:28.750> these

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
know the answer to any of these

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.960 
know the answer to any of these
questions<00:03:29.079> I'm<00:03:29.530> just<00:03:29.620> telling<00:03:30.459> you<00:03:30.579> what<00:03:30.790> I've

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
questions I'm just telling you what I've

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.750 
questions I'm just telling you what I've
done<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.359> what<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.989> results<00:03:32.019> were<00:03:32.560> so<00:03:33.310> you

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
done and what the results were so you

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.880 
done and what the results were so you
know<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:33.910> did<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:35.109> literally<00:03:35.530> never

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
know I did that and I literally never

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.830 
know I did that and I literally never
saw<00:03:36.220> any<00:03:36.430> ammonia<00:03:36.820> there<00:03:37.150> wasn't<00:03:37.420> any<00:03:37.570> and

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
saw any ammonia there wasn't any and

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.420 
saw any ammonia there wasn't any and
there<00:03:38.530> was<00:03:38.680> no<00:03:38.859> nitrites<00:03:39.489> ever

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
there was no nitrites ever

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.149 
there was no nitrites ever
and<00:03:41.549> that<00:03:42.480> was<00:03:42.599> a<00:03:42.629> measured<00:03:43.439> every<00:03:43.799> day<00:03:43.980> over

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
and that was a measured every day over

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.530 
and that was a measured every day over
the<00:03:44.250> course<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.579> two<00:03:44.790> weeks<00:03:44.969> like<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.180> say<00:03:45.390> it's

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
the course of two weeks like I say it's

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.059 
the course of two weeks like I say it's
all<00:03:45.629> on<00:03:45.810> aquatic<00:03:46.109> log<00:03:46.469> you<00:03:46.650> can<00:03:46.829> see

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
all on aquatic log you can see

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.250 
all on aquatic log you can see
everything<00:03:47.549> if<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.790> want<00:03:47.939> to<00:03:48.000> know<00:03:48.260> and

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
everything if you want to know and

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.160 
everything if you want to know and
basically<00:03:50.189> you<00:03:50.849> know<00:03:50.879> I've<00:03:51.269> not<00:03:51.599> seen<00:03:51.930> them

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
basically you know I've not seen them

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.300 
basically you know I've not seen them
since

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
since

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.649 
since

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
so it's you know that that was that in

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.149 
so it's you know that that was that in
effect<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.230> then<00:03:58.290> what<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.530> started<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:58.920> do<00:03:59.040> is

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
a pinch of flake and then on Sundays

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.439 
a pinch of flake and then on Sundays
I've<00:04:35.070> got<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.310> algae<00:04:35.639> rings<00:04:35.849> going<00:04:36.060> on<00:04:36.270> and

behind<00:04:45.990> that<00:04:46.409> is<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:48.000> know<00:04:48.320> basically<00:04:49.320> you're

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
behind that is you know basically you're

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.050 
behind that is you know basically you're
using<00:04:50.039> that<00:04:50.250> denature<00:04:50.550> all<00:04:50.729> your<00:04:50.880> point

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
using that denature all your point

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.120 
using that denature all your point
bacteria<00:04:51.630> in<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.870> system<00:04:52.320> it's<00:04:52.470> like<00:04:52.650> we<00:04:52.860> give

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
bacteria in the system it's like we give

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.469 
bacteria in the system it's like we give
the<00:04:53.370> bacteria<00:04:54.060> something<00:04:54.539> to<00:04:54.720> you<00:04:55.380> know

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
the bacteria something to you know

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.570 
the bacteria something to you know
populates<00:04:57.479> so<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.110> did<00:04:58.500> I<00:04:58.530> gave<00:04:58.680> them<00:04:58.949> lots<00:04:59.250> and

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
populates so I did I gave them lots and

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.700 
populates so I did I gave them lots and
lots<00:04:59.760> and<00:04:59.940> lots<00:05:00.090> of<00:05:00.180> food<00:05:00.449> and<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:01.349> idea

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
lots and lots of food and the idea

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.159 
lots and lots of food and the idea
bandit<00:05:02.039> was<00:05:02.130> I'm<00:05:02.250> keeping<00:05:02.909> the<00:05:03.090> food<00:05:03.330> I<00:05:03.720> upped

monitor this for a couple of weeks I

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.550 
monitor this for a couple of weeks I
might<00:05:18.030> start<00:05:18.240> doing<00:05:18.509> repos<00:05:18.690> every<00:05:19.229> single

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
might start doing repos every single

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.810 
might start doing repos every single
night<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:20.300> so<00:05:21.300> you<00:05:21.870> know<00:05:21.990> as<00:05:22.199> in<00:05:22.680> my<00:05:22.889> I<00:05:23.220> am<00:05:23.639> just

you know this is what I'm going from

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.909 
you know this is what I'm going from
looking<00:05:36.300> for<00:05:36.449> zero<00:05:36.840> fat<00:05:37.110> and<00:05:37.320> well<00:05:37.440> phosphates

no<00:05:46.809> this<00:05:47.469> is<00:05:47.679> what<00:05:47.860> I'm<00:05:48.039> doing<00:05:48.279> it's<00:05:49.059> been<00:05:49.119> six

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
no this is what I'm doing it's been six

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.689 
no this is what I'm doing it's been six
weeks<00:05:49.689> with<00:05:50.649> the<00:05:50.799> way<00:05:50.919> I'm<00:05:51.069> feeling<00:05:51.459> I<00:05:51.549> would

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
weeks with the way I'm feeling I would

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.179 
weeks with the way I'm feeling I would
have<00:05:51.789> expected<00:05:52.269> to<00:05:52.539> see<00:05:52.659> more<00:05:53.069> nitrates<00:05:54.069> and

00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:54.189 
have expected to see more nitrates and

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:56.489 
have expected to see more nitrates and
phosphates<00:05:54.699> and<00:05:54.879> the<00:05:54.939> only<00:05:55.149> reason<00:05:55.569> here's

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:56.499 
phosphates and the only reason here's

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:58.109 
phosphates and the only reason here's
another<00:05:56.799> thing<00:05:57.039> that<00:05:57.219> I've<00:05:57.339> not<00:05:57.519> said<00:05:57.909> exactly

00:05:58.109 --> 00:05:58.119 
another thing that I've not said exactly

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:00.600 
another thing that I've not said exactly
as<00:05:58.629> well<00:05:58.809> you're<00:05:59.469> the<00:05:59.559> major<00:06:00.009> reason<00:06:00.489> why<00:06:00.579> I

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
as well you're the major reason why I

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.609 
as well you're the major reason why I
believe<00:06:00.849> that<00:06:01.089> this<00:06:01.419> is<00:06:01.479> happening<00:06:01.719> too<00:06:02.079> is<00:06:02.319> I

00:06:02.609 --> 00:06:02.619 
believe that this is happening too is I

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:04.619 
believe that this is happening too is I
am<00:06:02.860> being<00:06:03.099> religious<00:06:03.699> about<00:06:03.969> my<00:06:04.179> protein

head<00:06:25.779> pull<00:06:26.079> them<00:06:26.199> up<00:06:26.319> let's<00:06:26.619> put<00:06:27.429> some<00:06:27.610> new

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 
head pull them up let's put some new

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:30.029 
head pull them up let's put some new
ones<00:06:27.879> in<00:06:28.119> and<00:06:28.360> then<00:06:28.749> you<00:06:29.499> know<00:06:29.529> that's<00:06:29.860> what

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
ones in and then you know that's what

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:31.579 
ones in and then you know that's what
I'm<00:06:30.129> doing<00:06:30.399> so<00:06:30.550> it's<00:06:30.729> almost<00:06:31.029> like<00:06:31.239> the

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:31.589 
I'm doing so it's almost like the

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:34.259 
I'm doing so it's almost like the
organic<00:06:32.589> waste<00:06:32.860> in<00:06:33.099> the<00:06:33.219> tank<00:06:33.459> isn't<00:06:33.879> even

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:34.269 
organic waste in the tank isn't even

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.929 
organic waste in the tank isn't even
getting<00:06:34.449> a<00:06:34.659> chance<00:06:34.889> it's<00:06:35.889> either<00:06:36.069> that<00:06:36.429> it's

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:36.939 
getting a chance it's either that it's

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:38.459 
getting a chance it's either that it's
not<00:06:37.089> even<00:06:37.269> getting<00:06:37.479> a<00:06:37.539> chance<00:06:37.569> to<00:06:38.259> you<00:06:38.439> know

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:38.469 
not even getting a chance to you know

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:41.939 
not even getting a chance to you know
break<00:06:38.860> down<00:06:39.189> um<00:06:40.059> or<00:06:40.509> you<00:06:41.439> know<00:06:41.589> the<00:06:41.709> bio

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
break down um or you know the bio

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.049 
break down um or you know the bio
pellets<00:06:42.519> but<00:06:42.879> another<00:06:43.539> factor<00:06:44.199> also<00:06:44.679> is<00:06:45.309> the

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:46.059 
pellets but another factor also is the

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:47.999 
pellets but another factor also is the
despite<00:06:46.539> poly<00:06:46.809> reactor<00:06:47.259> I<00:06:47.289> mean<00:06:47.499> the<00:06:47.619> pump<00:06:47.829> on

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:48.009 
despite poly reactor I mean the pump on

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:52.169 
despite poly reactor I mean the pump on
it<00:06:48.039> is<00:06:48.249> huge<00:06:48.929> you<00:06:49.929> know<00:06:50.079> it<00:06:50.319> pumps<00:06:51.059> you<00:06:52.059> know

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:52.179 
it is huge you know it pumps you know

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:53.999 
it is huge you know it pumps you know
pumps<00:06:52.599> through<00:06:52.719> the<00:06:52.989> wall<00:06:53.199> really<00:06:53.589> so<00:06:53.769> you<00:06:53.860> can

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:54.009 
pumps through the wall really so you can

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:55.949 
pumps through the wall really so you can
see<00:06:54.159> they<00:06:54.309> are<00:06:54.339> flying<00:06:54.999> those<00:06:55.360> pellets<00:06:55.689> and

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:55.959 
see they are flying those pellets and

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:57.899 
see they are flying those pellets and
it's<00:06:56.409> turning<00:06:56.829> over<00:06:56.919> the<00:06:57.069> tank<00:06:57.309> volume<00:06:57.489> you

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:57.909 
it's turning over the tank volume you

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:59.819 
it's turning over the tank volume you
know<00:06:58.029> a<00:06:58.239> lot<00:06:58.599> of<00:06:58.779> times<00:06:58.989> this<00:06:59.259> again<00:06:59.649> this

00:06:59.819 --> 00:06:59.829 
know a lot of times this again this

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:03.029 
know a lot of times this again this
reactor<00:07:00.249> ISM<00:07:00.489> is<00:07:00.909> probably<00:07:01.659> five<00:07:02.050> maybe<00:07:02.709> more

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 
reactor ISM is probably five maybe more

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:05.399 
reactor ISM is probably five maybe more
in<00:07:03.219> fact<00:07:03.459> I<00:07:03.699> think<00:07:03.879> maybe<00:07:04.269> ten<00:07:04.629> five<00:07:04.989> to<00:07:05.169> ten

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:05.409 
in fact I think maybe ten five to ten

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:08.489 
in fact I think maybe ten five to ten
times<00:07:05.739> what<00:07:06.639> it's<00:07:06.819> recommended<00:07:07.629> for<00:07:07.839> this

00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:08.499 
times what it's recommended for this

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:11.189 
times what it's recommended for this
tank<00:07:08.889> so<00:07:09.249> I'm<00:07:09.489> killing<00:07:10.300> it<00:07:10.419> on<00:07:10.539> that<00:07:10.809> you<00:07:11.019> know

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 
tank so I'm killing it on that you know

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:14.309 
tank so I'm killing it on that you know
and<00:07:11.639> so<00:07:12.639> maybe<00:07:13.059> because<00:07:13.569> of<00:07:13.599> that<00:07:13.749> you<00:07:14.199> know

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 
and so maybe because of that you know

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.509 
and so maybe because of that you know
because<00:07:14.619> of<00:07:14.709> adding<00:07:14.919> all<00:07:15.039> the<00:07:15.129> bacteria

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:15.519 
because of adding all the bacteria

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:17.069 
because of adding all the bacteria
because<00:07:15.909> I'm<00:07:16.029> doing<00:07:16.300> what<00:07:16.419> I<00:07:16.449> did<00:07:16.569> at<00:07:16.959> the<00:07:17.050> very

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:17.079

00:07:24.369 --> 00:07:26.549 
believe I can feed this March and I'm
zero<00:07:24.669> nitrates<00:07:25.329> and<00:07:25.449> phosphate<00:07:25.959> now<00:07:26.409> we're

00:07:26.549 --> 00:07:26.559 
zero nitrates and phosphate now we're

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:29.489 
zero nitrates and phosphate now we're
going<00:07:26.679> to<00:07:26.769> see<00:07:26.979> aren't<00:07:27.159> we<00:07:27.309> you<00:07:27.579> know<00:07:28.499> my

going to see aren't we you know my
kwatak<00:07:29.979> log<00:07:30.129> is<00:07:30.249> monitoring<00:07:30.699> this<00:07:30.909> every<00:07:31.719> day

00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:31.749 
kwatak log is monitoring this every day

00:07:40.679 --> 00:07:40.689 
can get away with fish being a 450 liter

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:43.619 
can get away with fish being a 450 liter
of<00:07:40.959> fish<00:07:41.829> tank<00:07:42.129> when<00:07:42.339> having<00:07:42.669> zero<00:07:43.029> nitrates

00:07:43.619 --> 00:07:43.629 
of fish tank when having zero nitrates

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:47.100 
of fish tank when having zero nitrates
and<00:07:43.809> zero<00:07:44.139> phosphate<00:07:44.709> so<00:07:45.539> yeah<00:07:46.539> I<00:07:46.779> hope<00:07:46.929> you
