00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.940
 Mom must understand that she needs 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.310
 help 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.400
 good all be able to us God forbid everything to do 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.619
 as grandma said 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.420
 you have to pull on yourself you have to 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.640
 understand that you need help because 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.070
 that there are so many moments when you 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.740
 absolutely necessary when children get sick 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.700
 when the bath will be the attention of men or 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.250
 older children 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.340
 when some force majeure occur 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.770
 you need help and therefore you must 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.899
 either ask for help or if you 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.129
 will try to do without help 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.350
 help rides on ambulance car kva 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.320
 so moms need to learn first 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.480
 ask for help often we do not know how 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.879
 to do but it is absolutely necessary 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.289
 next we must learn to ask about 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.539
 aid more than once often do you think I'm under 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.460
 I will ask and help my husband once he 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.400
 did or did not want I will not anymore 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.930
 Generally but it is not correct if you 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.119
 will ask politely if you will 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.310
 ask more than once the probability 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.009
 getting this help it increases 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.110
 next when you get help very much 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.600
 it is important to organize it often 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.150
 sometimes grandma comes to help 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.670
 for example starting this dishwashing although 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.000
 whom the dishwasher is yes that is necessary 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.759
 Assistant teach you how to help 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.970
 guide and of course when you 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.560
 helped even no matter how you 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.770
 should thank 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.290
 sincerely from the bottom of my heart even if dad 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.350
 something not quite done went for a walk 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.170
 baby baby muddy come 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.060
 thank you, and then tell him 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.890
 perhaps what you need to do on 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.259
 walk so the child does not come alone 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.299
 a piece of dirt but thank you if you 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.909
 thank you will render 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.100
 help you need 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.899
 so ask for help instead of taking 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:10.129
 her and be able to organize important 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:12.410
 assistant because there is still mom 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.510
 who also need to take care of themselves if 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.910
 mom not take care of yourself will be bad 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.879
 the child has a dad from whom too 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.739
 depends and mom and child have older 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.129
 children maybe too which requires 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.129
 attention
