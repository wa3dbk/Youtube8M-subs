best probably co-op two player and pot
and<00:00:17.490> three<00:00:17.760> player<00:00:18.000> we<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.570> found<00:00:18.960> yet

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
and three player we have I found yet

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.140 
and three player we have I found yet
it's<00:00:19.949> basically<00:00:20.250> you're<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> be<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
it's basically you're going to be in the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.330 
it's basically you're going to be in the
biodome<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.109> you're<00:00:22.859> going<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.070> basically

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
biodome and you're going to basically

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.359 
biodome and you're going to basically
run<00:00:23.730> around<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.840> rock<00:00:25.590> formations<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.250> are

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
run around the rock formations that are

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.880 
run around the rock formations that are
in<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.550> middle<00:00:26.699> now<00:00:27.449> for<00:00:27.689> two<00:00:27.810> player<00:00:28.080> what

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
in the middle now for two player what

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.650 
in the middle now for two player what
there<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.340> actually<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> gap<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.539> middle

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
there is actually a gap in the middle

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.089 
there is actually a gap in the middle
and<00:00:30.960> if<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.199> time<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.470> right<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:32.070> have

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
and if you time it right you can have

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.639 
and if you time it right you can have
one<00:00:32.489> person<00:00:32.730> go<00:00:33.510> along<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.989> middle<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.380> have

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
one person go along the middle and have

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.200 
one person go along the middle and have
another<00:00:34.829> person<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.579> outside<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.059> their

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
another person on the outside of their

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.420 
another person on the outside of their
route<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:36.960> means<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.860> guys<00:00:38.010> will<00:00:38.250> never

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
route so that means you guys will never

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.490 
route so that means you guys will never
meet<00:00:38.700> up<00:00:38.879> at<00:00:39.030> any<00:00:39.239> time<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.960> start<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.320> have

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
meet up at any time you start to have

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.190 
meet up at any time you start to have
clear<00:00:40.860> communication<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.570> way<00:00:43.020> I'm

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
clear communication now the way I'm

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.590 
clear communication now the way I'm
doing<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.530> right<00:00:43.680> now<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.860> was<00:00:44.129> alone<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.850> with

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
doing this right now I was alone on with

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.029 
doing this right now I was alone on with
the<00:00:45.719> three<00:00:45.930> players<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.469> just<00:00:46.829> at<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the three players and just at the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.889 
the three players and just at the
beginning<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> round<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.360> so

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
beginning of the round and this so

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.709 
beginning of the round and this so
horribly<00:00:49.800> ended<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> loss<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.420> connection

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
horribly ended with a loss of connection

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.770 
horribly ended with a loss of connection
so<00:00:52.050> that's<00:00:52.230> why<00:00:52.850> it<00:00:53.850> doesn't<00:00:54.149> show<00:00:54.270> up<00:00:54.300> at<00:00:54.600> on

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
so that's why it doesn't show up at on

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.470 
so that's why it doesn't show up at on
the<00:00:54.960> leaderboards<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.949> hosts<00:00:56.270> collected<00:00:57.270> and

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the leaderboards the hosts collected and

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.020 
the leaderboards the hosts collected and
we<00:00:57.570> were<00:00:57.719> about<00:00:57.989> three<00:00:58.440> quarters<00:00:58.620> done<00:00:59.039> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
we were about three quarters done the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
we were about three quarters done the
easter<00:01:00.300> egg<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.989> basically<00:01:01.320> guys<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
easter egg but basically guys this is

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.570 
easter egg but basically guys this is
probably<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> easiest<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.120> best<00:01:04.580> strategy

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
probably the easiest and best strategy

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.969 
probably the easiest and best strategy
you<00:01:06.060> are<00:01:06.330> close<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> ak-47<00:01:07.680> new<00:01:07.799> year<00:01:07.950> oh

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
you are close to the ak-47 new year oh

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.340 
you are close to the ak-47 new year oh
so<00:01:08.159> close<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> teleporter<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.510> too

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
so close to the teleporter and too

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.160 
so close to the teleporter and too
easily<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:10.979> easily<00:01:11.400> get<00:01:11.600> ak-47<00:01:12.600> new<00:01:12.750> ammo

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
easily you can easily get ak-47 new ammo

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.890 
easily you can easily get ak-47 new ammo
by<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:14.000> running<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.180> route<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> couple<00:01:15.720> times

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
by just running the route a couple times

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.990 
by just running the route a couple times
without<00:01:16.049> killing<00:01:16.439> zombies<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.670> letting

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
without killing zombies and then letting

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.210 
without killing zombies and then letting
all<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> zombie<00:01:18.659> spawn<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.290> then<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:20.100> when

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
all the zombie spawn and then right when

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.890 
all the zombie spawn and then right when
you<00:01:20.340> believe<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.000> resume<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.659> spawned

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
you believe you have a resume be spawned

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.140 
you believe you have a resume be spawned
you<00:01:22.380> run<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.799> one<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.220> doors<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.000> go

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you run out one of the doors and go

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.940 
you run out one of the doors and go
straight<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.600> ak-47<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.860> about

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
straight to the ak-47 you and it's about

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.870 
straight to the ak-47 you and it's about
a<00:01:26.100> 20<00:01:26.939> second<00:01:27.330> run<00:01:27.570> or<00:01:28.140> probably<00:01:28.829> less<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:29.520> you

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
a 20 second run or probably less if you

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.510 
a 20 second run or probably less if you
think<00:01:30.210> about<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.659> don't<00:01:30.930> know<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.799> yeah<00:01:32.340> and

this<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.530> no<00:01:44.040> way<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
this but no way as you can see there the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.780 
this but no way as you can see there the
best<00:01:46.350> way<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> use<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.369> probably<00:01:47.549> having

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
best way to use this is probably having

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.060 
best way to use this is probably having
the<00:01:47.909> ak-47<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.079> Mustang<00:01:49.409> Sally's<00:01:49.770> or<00:01:49.890> any

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the ak-47 you and Mustang Sally's or any

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.170 
the ak-47 you and Mustang Sally's or any
other<00:01:50.280> gun<00:01:50.930> zap<00:01:51.930> guns<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.590> find<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.670> ever<00:01:53.909> do

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
other gun zap guns I find if you ever do

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.450 
other gun zap guns I find if you ever do
get<00:01:54.360> trapped<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> corner<00:01:55.140> which<00:01:55.560> happens

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
get trapped in a corner which happens

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.789 
get trapped in a corner which happens
probably<00:01:57.210> two<00:01:57.719> percent<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.170> time<00:01:58.380> because

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
probably two percent of the time because

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.959 
probably two percent of the time because
it's<00:01:59.250> such<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> wide<00:01:59.729> open<00:01:59.759> area<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.979> will

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
it's such a wide open area that you will

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.120 
it's such a wide open area that you will
get<00:02:03.210> cornered<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.049> because<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.740> zombies

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
get cornered in you because the zombies

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.550 
get cornered in you because the zombies
have<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.000> kill<00:02:06.240> animation<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.170> actually<00:02:07.320> get

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
have the kill animation you actually get

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.139 
have the kill animation you actually get
stuck<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.009> kill<00:02:08.220> animation<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.849> can't

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
stuck in the kill animation you can't

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.330 
stuck in the kill animation you can't
move<00:02:09.300> until<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.810> zoe<00:02:10.020> has<00:02:10.200> been<00:02:10.410> finished

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
move until that zoe has been finished

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.600 
move until that zoe has been finished
its<00:02:11.580> animation<00:02:11.970> of

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
its animation of

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.490 
its animation of
with<00:02:12.730> lightning<00:02:13.590> now<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.890> suggest<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.460> guys

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
with lightning now I suggest you guys

this hope you guys enjoyed this and this

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.870 
this hope you guys enjoyed this and this
is<00:02:22.990> probably<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.470> easiest<00:02:23.770> one<00:02:24.010> easiest

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
is probably the easiest one easiest

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.150 
is probably the easiest one easiest
route<00:02:25.000> yet<00:02:25.630> I<00:02:25.870> don't<00:02:26.410> know<00:02:26.530> if<00:02:26.680> anybody<00:02:26.980> else

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
route yet I don't know if anybody else

posted on this hosted this but hopefully
guys<00:02:29.980> will<00:02:30.160> enjoy<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.180> very<00:02:31.330> clear

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
guys will enjoy it this is very clear

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.130 
guys will enjoy it this is very clear
try<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.890> not<00:02:33.130> have<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.640> excavator<00:02:34.210> destroy

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
try and not have the excavator destroy

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.250 
try and not have the excavator destroy
the<00:02:35.320> biodome<00:02:35.770> or<00:02:36.580> else<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:37.060> does<00:02:37.360> come<00:02:37.630> become

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
the biodome or else it does come become

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.560 
the biodome or else it does come become
difficult<00:02:38.770> to<00:02:39.340> handle<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:40.060> zombies<00:02:40.420> because

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
difficult to handle the zombies because

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.150 
difficult to handle the zombies because
they<00:02:40.840> are<00:02:41.050> all<00:02:41.320> over<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.650> place<00:02:41.680> in<00:02:41.980> zero

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
they are all over the place in zero

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.130 
they are all over the place in zero
gravity<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.700> that's<00:02:43.510> basically<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.930> only

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
gravity and that's basically the only

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.710 
gravity and that's basically the only
pointer<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.620> can<00:02:44.890> have<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.510> you're<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:46.690> close

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
pointer I can have and you're so close

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.810 
pointer I can have and you're so close
to<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.080> teleporter<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.560> can<00:02:47.709> just<00:02:47.920> run<00:02:48.220> and

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
to the teleporter you can just run and

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.910 
to the teleporter you can just run and
gun<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.870> when<00:02:50.020> you<00:02:50.080> can<00:02:50.230> teleport<00:02:50.530> back<00:02:50.739> to

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
gun and when you can teleport back to

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.440 
gun and when you can teleport back to
this<00:02:50.980> one<00:02:51.190> you<00:02:51.340> just<00:02:51.400> run<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.880> gun<00:02:52.000> into<00:02:52.180> back

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
this one you just run and gun into back

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.000 
this one you just run and gun into back
here<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.250> yeah<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:54.940> hopefully<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.420> guys<00:02:55.540> will

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
here and yeah so hopefully you guys will

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.410 
here and yeah so hopefully you guys will
take<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.160> into<00:02:57.400> account<00:02:57.489> and<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.239> is

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
take this into account and this is

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.510 
take this into account and this is
probably<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.750> best<00:02:58.930> strategy<00:02:59.350> for<00:02:59.520> going

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
probably the best strategy for going

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.210 
probably the best strategy for going
high<00:03:00.670> rounds<00:03:01.350> alright<00:03:02.350> guys<00:03:02.530> talk<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.130> you

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
high rounds alright guys talk to you

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.180 
high rounds alright guys talk to you
later<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.670> by
