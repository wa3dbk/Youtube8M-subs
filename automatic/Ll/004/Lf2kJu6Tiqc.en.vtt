00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
where we're going to enter the block ids

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.490 
where we're going to enter the block ids
and<00:01:04.880> then<00:01:05.880> that's<00:01:06.630> what's<00:01:06.990> going<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.229> make<00:01:07.350> it

I'm<00:04:51.580> why<00:04:51.790> is<00:04:51.820> you<00:04:52.030> have<00:04:52.240> to<00:04:52.390> keep<00:04:52.570> changing<00:04:52.780> run

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
I'm why is you have to keep changing run

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.409 
I'm why is you have to keep changing run
distance<00:04:53.470> every<00:04:53.860> time<00:04:54.130> you<00:04:54.250> put<00:04:54.490> on<00:04:54.640> that<00:04:54.970> make

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
distance every time you put on that make

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.050 
distance every time you put on that make
some<00:04:55.600> load<00:04:55.840> at<00:04:56.110> once<00:04:56.470> like<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.490> good<00:04:57.850> actually

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060

I'll do an update tutorial so yeah and
let's<00:05:30.700> test<00:05:30.970> out<00:05:31.150> for<00:05:31.330> right<00:05:33.780> dig<00:05:34.780> yourself<00:05:35.260> in

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
let's test out for right dig yourself in

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.550 
let's test out for right dig yourself in
a<00:05:35.500> little<00:05:35.740> more<00:05:35.830> so<00:05:36.700> it's<00:05:36.880> nice<00:05:37.060> and<00:05:37.090> dark
