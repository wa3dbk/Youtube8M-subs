00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170 
hi this video is about spay lines and

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.800 
hi this video is about spay lines and
how<00:00:14.469> they're<00:00:14.709> cast<00:00:14.949> I<00:00:15.340> have<00:00:16.059> three<00:00:16.359> lines<00:00:16.510> with

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
how they're cast I have three lines with

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.330 
how they're cast I have three lines with
me<00:00:16.990> today<00:00:17.140> and<00:00:17.470> we're<00:00:17.710> going<00:00:17.890> to<00:00:17.980> take<00:00:18.189> those

out on the river and we're going to see

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.920 
out on the river and we're going to see
exactly<00:00:20.170> how<00:00:20.500> to<00:00:20.619> cast<00:00:20.890> them<00:00:21.420> first<00:00:22.420> this<00:00:22.630> line

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
exactly how to cast them first this line

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.609 
exactly how to cast them first this line
is<00:00:23.230> a<00:00:23.980> traditional<00:00:24.850> type<00:00:25.090> spay<00:00:25.450> line<00:00:25.690> it<00:00:25.900> is<00:00:26.020> 56

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619

range of 34 35 feet long and our last
line<00:00:58.210> is<00:00:58.510> a<00:00:59.070> Skagit<00:01:00.070> line<00:01:00.250> it<00:01:01.180> is<00:01:01.450> quite<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.020> bit

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
line is a Skagit line it is quite a bit

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.170 
line is a Skagit line it is quite a bit
shorter<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.829> head<00:01:03.070> is<00:01:03.340> in<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.789> neighborhood

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
shorter the head is in the neighborhood

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.719 
shorter the head is in the neighborhood
of<00:01:04.269> 25<00:01:04.750> feet<00:01:04.960> long<00:01:05.259> but<00:01:05.829> as<00:01:05.950> you<00:01:06.100> can<00:01:06.280> see<00:01:06.520> I

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
of 25 feet long but as you can see I

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.000 
of 25 feet long but as you can see I
have<00:01:07.030> a<00:01:07.060> sink<00:01:07.329> tip<00:01:07.509> attached<00:01:07.840> it's<00:01:08.560> designed

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
have a sink tip attached it's designed

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.090 
have a sink tip attached it's designed
for<00:01:09.130> turning<00:01:09.549> over<00:01:09.610> sink<00:01:10.000> tips<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:11.590> tip

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
for turning over sink tips and this tip

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.490 
for turning over sink tips and this tip
in<00:01:12.280> particular<00:01:12.610> is<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:13.000> 10<00:01:13.390> foot<00:01:13.540> long<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:14.080> we

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
in particular is a 10 foot long and we

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.430 
in particular is a 10 foot long and we
attach<00:01:14.740> our<00:01:14.950> mono<00:01:15.190> leader<00:01:15.700> to<00:01:16.060> there<00:01:16.440> these

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
attach our mono leader to there these

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.820 
attach our mono leader to there these
three<00:01:18.100> lines<00:01:18.340> are<00:01:18.670> cast<00:01:19.000> differently<00:01:19.570> this<00:01:20.560> is

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
three lines are cast differently this is

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.520 
three lines are cast differently this is
a<00:01:21.130> long<00:01:21.640> line<00:01:21.909> so<00:01:22.270> we<00:01:22.420> need<00:01:22.600> a<00:01:22.780> relatively<00:01:23.200> long

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
a long line so we need a relatively long

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.550 
a long line so we need a relatively long
casting<00:01:24.100> stroke<00:01:24.369> this<00:01:25.360> is<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.540> short<00:01:25.960> line<00:01:26.170> so

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
casting stroke this is a short line so

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.350 
casting stroke this is a short line so
we<00:01:26.680> need<00:01:26.830> a<00:01:26.860> shorter<00:01:27.369> casting<00:01:27.820> stroke<00:01:28.119> and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
we need a shorter casting stroke and

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.350 
we need a shorter casting stroke and
this<00:01:29.320> Skagit<00:01:30.070> head<00:01:30.220> requires<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.909> completely

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
this Skagit head requires a completely

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.700 
this Skagit head requires a completely
different<00:01:31.720> style<00:01:31.900> of<00:01:32.020> casting<00:01:32.439> which<00:01:32.590> is

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
different style of casting which is

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.010 
different style of casting which is
called<00:01:32.950> sustained<00:01:33.369> anchor<00:01:33.780> now<00:01:34.780> we're<00:01:34.900> gonna

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
called sustained anchor now we're gonna

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.240 
called sustained anchor now we're gonna
go<00:01:35.170> down<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.439> the<00:01:35.500> river<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:35.979> we're<00:01:36.100> going<00:01:36.220> to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
go down to the river and we're going to

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.100 
go down to the river and we're going to
demonstrate<00:01:36.400> all<00:01:36.970> three<00:01:37.360> for<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:37.990> you'll

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
demonstrate all three for you and you'll

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.310 
demonstrate all three for you and you'll
see<00:01:38.350> how<00:01:38.560> they're<00:01:38.799> used<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.400> how<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.320> casting

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
see how they're used and how the casting

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.740 
see how they're used and how the casting
strokes<00:01:41.640> change<00:01:42.640> depending<00:01:43.180> on<00:01:43.270> which<00:01:43.450> line

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
strokes change depending on which line

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.380 
strokes change depending on which line
we're<00:01:43.960> going<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.170> use<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.549> let's<00:01:45.970> get<00:01:46.090> suited

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
we're going to use so let's get suited

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.950 
we're going to use so let's get suited
up<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:46.630> get<00:01:46.780> going

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960

long<00:01:52.229> Dell's<00:01:52.740> ahead<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.580> ask<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.420> as<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> long

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
long Dell's ahead and ask this as a long

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.039 
long Dell's ahead and ask this as a long
line<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.500> need<00:01:55.650> to<00:01:55.920> move<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.520> line<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.570> get

anchor placed properly that requires a

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.199 
anchor placed properly that requires a
broad<00:02:03.600> movement<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.619> arms<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.130> body

notice how I'm using my body here to get
the<00:02:12.329> line<00:02:12.510> back<00:02:12.810> there's<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.739> transfer<00:02:14.310> of

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
the line back there's a transfer of
