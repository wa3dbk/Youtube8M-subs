00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.630 
game engine tutorial this video is going
to<00:00:18.140> cover<00:00:18.230> lighting<00:00:18.830> such<00:00:19.160> as<00:00:19.310> the<00:00:19.430> use<00:00:19.610> of

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
to cover lighting such as the use of

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.550 
to cover lighting such as the use of
blenders<00:00:20.180> various<00:00:20.570> light<00:00:20.810> entities<00:00:21.320> and

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
blenders various light entities and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.670 
blenders various light entities and
dynamic<00:00:22.040> shadows<00:00:22.900> so<00:00:23.900> let's<00:00:24.230> go<00:00:24.380> ahead<00:00:24.500> and

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
dynamic shadows so let's go ahead and

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.350 
dynamic shadows so let's go ahead and
start<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:25.490> first<00:00:25.730> thing<00:00:25.910> we're<00:00:26.090> going<00:00:26.240> to

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
start the first thing we're going to

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.679 
start the first thing we're going to
want<00:00:26.540> to<00:00:26.720> do<00:00:26.869> is<00:00:27.200> add<00:00:28.070> a<00:00:28.460> light<00:00:28.699> entity<00:00:29.210> which

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
want to do is add a light entity which

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.990 
want to do is add a light entity which
can<00:00:30.020> be<00:00:30.170> found<00:00:30.470> on<00:00:30.830> there<00:00:31.699> add<00:00:32.410> lamp<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:34.000> as

you can see there are five different

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.310 
you can see there are five different
types<00:00:36.890> of<00:00:37.250> lights<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:37.610> choose<00:00:37.910> from<00:00:38.199> for<00:00:39.199> now

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
types of lights to choose from for now

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.420 
types of lights to choose from for now
let's<00:00:39.559> go<00:00:39.680> ahead<00:00:39.710> and<00:00:39.980> add<00:00:40.129> a<00:00:40.160> point<00:00:40.489> light<00:00:42.430> now

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
let's go ahead and add a point light now

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.140 
let's go ahead and add a point light now

as<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:20.510> can<00:02:20.660> see<00:02:23.290> Hemi<00:02:24.290> lights<00:02:24.590> are<00:02:24.890> similar

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
as you can see Hemi lights are similar

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.150 
as you can see Hemi lights are similar
to<00:02:25.340> Sun<00:02:25.550> lights<00:02:26.020> however<00:02:27.020> they<00:02:27.410> also<00:02:27.620> project

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
to Sun lights however they also project

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.720 
to Sun lights however they also project
light<00:02:28.370> behind<00:02:28.850> them<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:30.070> it's<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.550> can

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
light behind them and it's that you can

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.000 
light behind them and it's that you can
use<00:02:31.940> them<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.300> create<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.600> pseudo<00:02:33.260> fake<00:02:33.620> AO

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.410 
the Hemi light is very weak and you can
as<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.280> can<00:02:43.460> see<00:02:43.580> I've<00:02:43.730> already<00:02:43.940> done<00:02:44.060> that

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
as you can see I've already done that

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.530 
as you can see I've already done that
for<00:02:44.480> this<00:02:44.750> scene<00:02:45.020> and<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:46.670> sort<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:46.940> lights<00:02:47.300> the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
for this scene and it sort of lights the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.650 
for this scene and it sort of lights the
back<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.170> objects<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.680> little<00:02:48.890> bit<00:02:49.660> area

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
back of the objects a little bit area

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.270 
back of the objects a little bit area
lights<00:02:50.900> are<00:02:51.080> sort<00:02:51.320> of<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.500> combination<00:02:51.770> of

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
lights are sort of a combination of

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.030 
lights are sort of a combination of
point<00:02:52.610> lights<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.090> spot<00:02:53.330> lights<00:02:53.680> they<00:02:54.680> emit

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
point lights and spot lights they emit

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.640 
point lights and spot lights they emit
light<00:02:55.280> like<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:55.580> point<00:02:55.910> light<00:02:56.150> but<00:02:56.990> only<00:02:57.320> in<00:02:57.440> one

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
light like a point light but only in one

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.340 
light like a point light but only in one
direction<00:02:57.910> they<00:02:58.910> can<00:02:58.970> also<00:02:59.239> be<00:02:59.480> resized<00:02:59.870> into

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
direction they can also be resized into

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.120 
direction they can also be resized into
different<00:03:00.650> shapes<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:03.470> they<00:03:03.620> act<00:03:03.770> sort<00:03:04.040> of

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
different shapes so they act sort of

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.220 
different shapes so they act sort of
like<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.310> light<00:03:04.580> emitting<00:03:04.970> surface<00:03:08.230> however

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
like a light emitting surface however

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.440 
like a light emitting surface however
they<00:03:09.680> are<00:03:09.800> currently<00:03:10.160> broken<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.120> current

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
they are currently broken in the current

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.090 
they are currently broken in the current
build<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.840> blender<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.410> I'm<00:03:12.500> not<00:03:12.680> sure<00:03:12.920> when

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
build of blender and I'm not sure when

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.430 
build of blender and I'm not sure when
they're<00:03:13.250> going<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.550> be<00:03:13.730> fixed<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.780> is<00:03:15.230> being

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
they're going to be fixed it is being

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.340 
they're going to be fixed it is being
worked<00:03:15.739> on<00:03:15.950> however<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.700> it's<00:03:17.350> pretty

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
worked on however and it's pretty

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.650 
worked on however and it's pretty
exciting<00:03:18.739> here's<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.459> here's<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:20.000> screenshot<00:03:20.420> of

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
exciting here's a here's a screenshot of

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.460 
exciting here's a here's a screenshot of
what<00:03:20.989> they'll<00:03:21.140> eventually<00:03:21.350> be<00:03:21.650> able<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.130> do

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.530 

now<00:03:27.470> for<00:03:28.040> dynamic<00:03:28.550> lights<00:03:28.790> there<00:03:29.240> are<00:03:29.360> two

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
now for dynamic lights there are two

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.910 
now for dynamic lights there are two
kinds<00:03:29.959> of<00:03:30.020> lights<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.380> support<00:03:30.890> that

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
kinds of lights that support that

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.460 
kinds of lights that support that
currently<00:03:32.800> spotlights<00:03:33.800> and<00:03:34.099> Sun<00:03:34.640> lights<00:03:35.470> I'll

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
currently spotlights and Sun lights I'll

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.250 
currently spotlights and Sun lights I'll
start<00:03:36.980> with<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.250> spotlight<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.810> go<00:03:38.989> ahead<00:03:39.110> and

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
start with the spotlight so go ahead and

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.220 
start with the spotlight so go ahead and
turn<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.190> on<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.819> I'm<00:03:41.660> going<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:41.989> go<00:03:42.140> ahead

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
turn that on and I'm going to go ahead

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.900 
turn that on and I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:42.410> delete<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.890> Hemi<00:03:43.100> light<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.550> make<00:03:43.700> the

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
and delete the Hemi light to make the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.990 
and delete the Hemi light to make the
effect<00:03:44.239> easier<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:44.989> see<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:49.130> enable<00:03:49.610> shadow

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
effect easier to see so to enable shadow

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.870 
effect easier to see so to enable shadow
all<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.200> have<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.500> do<00:03:51.620> is<00:03:51.860> simply<00:03:52.220> hit<00:03:52.670> the

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
all you have to do is simply hit the

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.089 
all you have to do is simply hit the
shadow<00:03:54.190> checkbox<00:03:55.420> under<00:03:56.420> properties<00:03:57.099> there

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
shadow checkbox under properties there

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.820 
shadow checkbox under properties there
we<00:03:58.220> go<00:03:58.340> as<00:03:58.550> you<00:03:58.580> can<00:03:58.730> see<00:03:59.060> it<00:03:59.930> projects<00:04:00.590> a

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
we go as you can see it projects a

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.900 
we go as you can see it projects a
dynamic<00:04:01.870> shadow<00:04:02.870> on<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:04.610> object<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:06.910> the

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
dynamic shadow on the object and the

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.420 
dynamic shadow on the object and the
shadow<00:04:08.150> shape<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:09.069> based<00:04:10.069> on<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.549> location<00:04:11.150> of

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
shadow shape is based on the location of

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.640 
shadow shape is based on the location of
the<00:04:13.430> projecting<00:04:13.970> lamp<00:04:14.239> so<00:04:14.959> if<00:04:15.140> you<00:04:15.290> have<00:04:15.500> it

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
the projecting lamp so if you have it

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.349 
the projecting lamp so if you have it
low<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:16.250> projects<00:04:16.579> it<00:04:16.700> far<00:04:16.880> if<00:04:17.000> you<00:04:17.120> have<00:04:17.269> it

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
low it projects it far if you have it

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:24.610 
low it projects it far if you have it
high<00:04:18.430> it<00:04:19.430> shortens<00:04:22.540> also<00:04:23.540> this<00:04:23.930> is<00:04:24.080> a<00:04:24.110> common

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
high it shortens also this is a common

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.500 
high it shortens also this is a common
issue<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:25.160> you<00:04:25.370> can<00:04:25.520> usually<00:04:25.669> fix<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.360> by

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
issue and you can usually fix that by

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.280 
issue and you can usually fix that by
chain<00:04:26.800> increasing<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.979> clip<00:04:28.250> start<00:04:29.290> moving

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
chain increasing the clip start moving

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.490 
chain increasing the clip start moving
it<00:04:30.410> forward<00:04:30.680> slightly

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.450 

now<00:04:38.260> sunlights<00:04:39.260> on<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.740> other<00:04:39.860> hand<00:04:40.100> instead

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
now sunlights on the other hand instead

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.580 
now sunlights on the other hand instead
of<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:41.060> shadow<00:04:41.630> being<00:04:42.020> based<00:04:42.350> on<00:04:42.530> the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
of the shadow being based on the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.350 
of the shadow being based on the
location<00:04:44.290> sunlights<00:04:45.290> project<00:04:45.740> a<00:04:45.920> shadow<00:04:46.880> that

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
location sunlights project a shadow that

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.940 
location sunlights project a shadow that
is<00:04:47.420> uniform<00:04:48.260> and<00:04:48.560> shape<00:04:50.440> enable<00:04:51.440> shadow<00:04:51.620> with

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
is uniform and shape enable shadow with

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.800 
is uniform and shape enable shadow with
the<00:04:51.980> little<00:04:52.370> check<00:04:52.550> mark<00:04:52.790> as<00:04:53.000> you<00:04:53.780> can<00:04:53.960> see<00:04:55.810> it

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
the little check mark as you can see it

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:08.420 
the little check mark as you can see it
creates<00:04:57.350> a<00:04:57.590> square<00:04:57.650> shadow

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.510 

that<00:05:09.430> is<00:05:09.580> not<00:05:09.879> affected<00:05:10.659> by<00:05:11.439> where<00:05:11.740> the

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
that is not affected by where the

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.219 
that is not affected by where the
sunlight<00:05:12.909> is<00:05:13.060> so<00:05:13.330> this<00:05:13.479> is<00:05:13.629> how<00:05:13.780> like<00:05:14.110> an

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
sunlight is so this is how like an

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.869 
sunlight is so this is how like an
actual<00:05:14.500> Sun<00:05:14.830> would<00:05:15.009> cast<00:05:15.280> light<00:05:16.000> it<00:05:16.300> is<00:05:17.879> still

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:18.879 
actual Sun would cast light it is still

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:23.850 
actual Sun would cast light it is still
defined<00:05:19.620> to<00:05:20.620> limited<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:22.240> a<00:05:22.270> square<00:05:22.780> based<00:05:23.650> on

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
defined to limited to a square based on

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.260 
defined to limited to a square based on
where<00:05:24.039> the<00:05:24.159> thing<00:05:24.340> is<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:24.669> that's<00:05:24.789> to<00:05:25.030> save

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
where the thing is and that's to save

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.600 
where the thing is and that's to save
memory<00:05:25.680> so<00:05:26.680> you<00:05:26.710> kind<00:05:27.069> of<00:05:27.159> have<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:27.520> be<00:05:27.639> careful

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
memory so you kind of have to be careful

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.670 
memory so you kind of have to be careful
with<00:05:30.610> Sun<00:05:30.849> lights<00:05:31.060> you<00:05:31.900> can<00:05:32.080> change<00:05:32.289> that<00:05:32.500> by

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
with Sun lights you can change that by

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.700 
with Sun lights you can change that by
changing<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:33.129> frustum<00:05:33.520> size<00:05:34.469> however<00:05:35.469> that

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
changing the frustum size however that

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.189 
changing the frustum size however that
will<00:05:35.889> lower<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.550> quality<00:05:37.120> which<00:05:37.719> of<00:05:37.990> course

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
will lower the quality which of course

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.869 
will lower the quality which of course
you<00:05:38.319> can<00:05:38.469> increase<00:05:39.159> the<00:05:39.340> quality<00:05:39.520> by

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:39.879 
you can increase the quality by

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:41.490 
you can increase the quality by
increasing<00:05:40.449> the<00:05:40.539> size<00:05:40.569> of<00:05:40.900> the<00:05:40.960> shadow<00:05:41.229> map

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
increasing the size of the shadow map

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.339 
increasing the size of the shadow map
but<00:05:42.340> that<00:05:42.520> can<00:05:42.729> it<00:05:42.849> get<00:05:43.030> expensive<00:05:43.479> on<00:05:43.930> system

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
but that can it get expensive on system

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:49.379 
but that can it get expensive on system
resources<00:05:44.740> very<00:05:45.099> quickly<00:05:47.789> using<00:05:48.789> blenders

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
resources very quickly using blenders

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.330 
resources very quickly using blenders
lighting<00:05:49.780> system<00:05:50.199> you<00:05:50.440> can<00:05:50.620> set<00:05:50.860> up<00:05:50.889> very

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
lighting system you can set up very

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.149 
lighting system you can set up very
complicated<00:05:52.060> scenes<00:05:52.449> the<00:05:53.289> best<00:05:53.560> way<00:05:53.770> to<00:05:53.800> learn

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
complicated scenes the best way to learn

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:56.459 
complicated scenes the best way to learn
is<00:05:54.490> to<00:05:54.699> experiment<00:05:55.240> with<00:05:55.539> various<00:05:55.930> setups<00:05:56.289> to

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469 
is to experiment with various setups to

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:00.119 
is to experiment with various setups to
find<00:05:56.710> what<00:05:56.949> works<00:05:58.469> that's<00:05:59.469> it<00:05:59.680> for<00:05:59.860> this<00:05:59.949> video

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:00.129 
find what works that's it for this video

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:04.229 
find what works that's it for this video
thanks<00:06:00.909> for<00:06:00.969> watching<00:06:01.090> and<00:06:01.569> have<00:06:01.750> a<00:06:01.779> nice<00:06:01.960> day
