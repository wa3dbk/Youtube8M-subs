00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
attack power quite a bit and it's going

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.130 
attack power quite a bit and it's going
to<00:04:44.620> gain<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:45.340> couple<00:04:45.760> of<00:04:45.970> new<00:04:46.120> attributes<00:04:46.750> going

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
to gain a couple of new attributes going

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.640 
to gain a couple of new attributes going
from<00:04:47.320> a<00:04:47.410> green<00:04:47.710> to<00:04:48.210> legendary<00:04:49.350> weapon<00:04:50.350> and

from a green to legendary weapon and

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.940 
from a green to legendary weapon and
then<00:04:51.550> yes<00:04:52.360> it<00:04:52.660> does<00:04:52.930> morph<00:04:53.200> twice<00:04:53.530> it's

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
then yes it does morph twice it's

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.730 
then yes it does morph twice it's
actually<00:04:54.460> going<00:04:54.610> to<00:04:54.670> go<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:55.150> an<00:04:55.870> exotic<00:04:56.290> Auto

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
actually going to go to an exotic Auto

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.620 
actually going to go to an exotic Auto
rifle<00:04:57.070> so<00:04:57.460> it's<00:04:57.610> actually<00:04:57.790> going<00:04:58.120> to<00:04:58.210> go<00:04:58.330> from

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
rifle so it's actually going to go from

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.210 
rifle so it's actually going to go from
a<00:04:58.720> green<00:04:59.970> common<00:05:00.970> rarity<00:05:01.960> weapon<00:05:02.410> to<00:05:02.980> an

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
a green common rarity weapon to an

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.150 
a green common rarity weapon to an
exotic<00:05:03.840> weapon<00:05:04.840> and<00:05:05.080> at<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:05.680> point<00:05:05.980> the

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
exotic weapon and at this point the

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.010 
exotic weapon and at this point the
weapon<00:05:06.310> is<00:05:06.580> also<00:05:07.150> now<00:05:07.570> going<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:07.900> be<00:05:07.990> called

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
weapon is also now going to be called

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.690 
weapon is also now going to be called
necrochasm<00:05:09.010> and<00:05:09.520> we'll<00:05:09.970> also<00:05:10.240> deal<00:05:10.930> arc

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
necrochasm and we'll also deal arc

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.000 
necrochasm and we'll also deal arc
damage<00:05:12.700> so<00:05:13.510> it's<00:05:14.080> not<00:05:14.290> going<00:05:14.440> to<00:05:14.500> gain<00:05:14.680> any

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
damage so it's not going to gain any

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.510 
damage so it's not going to gain any
additional<00:05:15.790> attributes<00:05:16.540> going<00:05:17.080> from

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
additional attributes going from

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.330 
additional attributes going from
legendary<00:05:18.520> to<00:05:18.970> exotic<00:05:19.930> but<00:05:20.680> now<00:05:20.950> the<00:05:21.010> weapon

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
legendary to exotic but now the weapon

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.440 
legendary to exotic but now the weapon
actually<00:05:21.820> becomes<00:05:22.510> an<00:05:22.750> arc<00:05:23.230> damage<00:05:24.450> primary

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
actually becomes an arc damage primary

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.110 
actually becomes an arc damage primary
which<00:05:25.960> is<00:05:26.140> pretty<00:05:26.380> rare<00:05:26.680> in<00:05:26.980> destiny<00:05:27.550> I<00:05:27.760> know

which is pretty rare in destiny I know

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.210 
which is pretty rare in destiny I know
up<00:05:28.270> until<00:05:28.570> this<00:05:28.690> point<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:29.170> obviously<00:05:30.040> the

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
up until this point the obviously the

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.400 
up until this point the obviously the

kinetic<00:05:41.800> damage<00:05:42.280> and<00:05:42.490> then<00:05:42.610> there<00:05:42.790> are<00:05:42.820> a<00:05:43.030> few

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
kinetic damage and then there are a few

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.880 
kinetic damage and then there are a few
special<00:05:44.350> cases<00:05:44.740> like<00:05:45.280> fate<00:05:45.669> bringer<00:05:46.210> and
