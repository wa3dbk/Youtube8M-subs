but it is a copy of this power HD I
don't<00:00:26.269> know<00:00:26.359> I'll<00:00:26.749> put<00:00:26.900> it<00:00:26.990> in<00:00:27.079> the

description I found the exact rebrand of

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.330 
description I found the exact rebrand of
this<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:31.759> original<00:00:32.770> putting<00:00:33.770> present<00:00:34.100> servo

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
this the original putting present servo

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.729 
this the original putting present servo
for<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:34.579> price<00:00:34.789> it<00:00:35.660> was<00:00:35.719> like<00:00:35.930> 37<00:00:36.289> dollars

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
for the price it was like 37 dollars

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.319 
for the price it was like 37 dollars
shipped<00:00:37.719> to<00:00:38.719> my<00:00:38.840> door<00:00:39.579> 37<00:00:40.579> bucks<00:00:40.730> yeah<00:00:41.059> it's

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
shipped to my door 37 bucks yeah it's

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.479 
shipped to my door 37 bucks yeah it's
this<00:00:41.449> in<00:00:41.629> a<00:00:41.690> cheap<00:00:41.899> one<00:00:42.109> I'm<00:00:42.350> like<00:00:42.949> super<00:00:43.309> dirty

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
this in a cheap one I'm like super dirty

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.170 
this in a cheap one I'm like super dirty
but<00:00:43.910> like<00:00:44.239> yeah<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:45.469> clone<00:00:45.739> that's<00:00:46.190> being

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
but like yeah the clone that's being

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.619 
but like yeah the clone that's being
copied<00:00:47.449> from<00:00:47.690> is<00:00:47.870> like<00:00:48.019> an<00:00:48.140> $80.00<00:00:48.710> servo<00:00:49.629> so

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
copied from is like an $80.00 servo so

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.959 
copied from is like an $80.00 servo so
it<00:00:50.780> is<00:00:50.899> pretty<00:00:51.109> high<00:00:51.289> performance<00:00:51.920> it<00:00:52.460> is<00:00:52.519> made

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
it is pretty high performance it is made

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.479 
it is pretty high performance it is made
for<00:00:55.719> kind<00:00:56.719> of<00:00:56.750> 1/8<00:00:57.019> scale<00:00:57.199> buggies<00:00:57.859> or<00:00:58.100> short

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
for kind of 1/8 scale buggies or short

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.250 
for kind of 1/8 scale buggies or short
course<00:00:58.760> trucks<00:00:59.530> 1/10<00:01:00.530> scale<00:01:00.620> wanting<00:01:01.250> scale

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
course trucks 1/10 scale wanting scale

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.170 
course trucks 1/10 scale wanting scale
so<00:01:03.260> track<00:01:04.010> start<00:01:04.250> lists<00:01:04.520> it<00:01:04.640> as<00:01:04.670> their

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
so track start lists it as their

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.620 
so track start lists it as their

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.440 
you the spec this is the TS 900 there
are<00:01:12.470> several<00:01:12.740> different<00:01:13.220> ones<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:13.730> just

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
are several different ones I just

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.910 
are several different ones I just
checked<00:01:14.750> on<00:01:14.870> hobbyking<00:01:15.380> right<00:01:15.560> now<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:15.860> these

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
checked on hobbyking right now and these

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.480 
checked on hobbyking right now and these
are<00:01:15.980> just<00:01:16.370> went<00:01:16.670> on<00:01:16.760> a<00:01:16.790> stock<00:01:18.190> but<00:01:19.190> I<00:01:19.280> will<00:01:19.430> be

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
are just went on a stock but I will be

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.250 
are just went on a stock but I will be
picking<00:01:19.700> up<00:01:19.850> some<00:01:20.030> other<00:01:20.150> variations<00:01:21.080> of

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
picking up some other variations of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.280 
picking up some other variations of
their<00:01:21.500> servos<00:01:21.890> to<00:01:22.190> test<00:01:22.790> and<00:01:23.150> give<00:01:23.720> reviews<00:01:24.110> in

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
their servos to test and give reviews in

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.080 
their servos to test and give reviews in
the<00:01:24.380> coming<00:01:24.770> days<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.220> this<00:01:25.760> is<00:01:25.850> going<00:01:25.970> to<00:01:26.030> be

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
the coming days so this is going to be

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.120 
the coming days so this is going to be
going<00:01:26.240> into<00:01:26.480> this<00:01:26.810> truck<00:01:27.110> here<00:01:27.470> with<00:01:28.010> these

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
going into this truck here with these

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.110 
going into this truck here with these
big<00:01:28.340> six-packs<00:01:28.820> on<00:01:29.090> here<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:30.550> I<00:01:31.550> want<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:31.970> push

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
big six-packs on here and I want to push

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.880 
big six-packs on here and I want to push
it<00:01:32.270> around<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.720> just<00:01:32.810> see<00:01:32.960> what<00:01:33.080> it<00:01:33.110> does<00:01:33.320> I'm

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
it around and just see what it does I'm

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.440 
it around and just see what it does I'm
gonna<00:01:34.010> hook<00:01:34.190> it<00:01:34.340> right<00:01:34.400> up<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.670> pack<00:01:35.000> voltage

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
gonna hook it right up to pack voltage

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.520 
gonna hook it right up to pack voltage
is<00:01:35.630> 7<00:01:35.900> point<00:01:36.080> 4<00:01:36.230> volts<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:38.600> I<00:01:39.020> ran<00:01:39.230> it<00:01:39.350> from

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
is 7 point 4 volts and I ran it from

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.150 
is 7 point 4 volts and I ran it from
there<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:40.070> we're<00:01:40.280> gonna<00:01:40.370> see<00:01:40.640> how<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.240> holds<00:01:41.510> up

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
there so we're gonna see how it holds up

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.130 
there so we're gonna see how it holds up
so<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.280> specs<00:01:43.550> on<00:01:43.760> this<00:01:43.910> year<00:01:44.210> are<00:01:44.420> very

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
so the specs on this year are very

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.220 
so the specs on this year are very
impressive<00:01:45.980> actually

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
impressive actually

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.660 
impressive actually
give<00:01:48.230> you<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.440> little<00:01:48.620> sick<00:01:49.010> I'll<00:01:49.430> give<00:01:49.580> you

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
give you a little sick I'll give you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.690 
give you a little sick I'll give you
something<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.000> read<00:01:50.240> over<00:01:50.480> that<00:01:52.750> 18.6<00:01:53.830> 252<00:01:54.830> at

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
something to read over that 18.6 252 at

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.560 
something to read over that 18.6 252 at
seven<00:01:56.030> point<00:01:56.150> four<00:01:56.420> point<00:01:57.380> zero<00:01:57.500> nine<00:01:58.480> so<00:01:59.480> you

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
seven point four point zero nine so you

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.730 
seven point four point zero nine so you
could<00:01:59.780> imagine<00:01:59.870> it<00:02:00.200> would<00:02:00.260> be<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.410> little<00:02:00.530> bit

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
could imagine it would be a little bit

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.920 
could imagine it would be a little bit
they<00:02:00.980> say<00:02:01.160> it's<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.340> little<00:02:01.550> bit<00:02:01.670> under<00:02:01.970> reading

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
they say it's a little bit under reading

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.450 
they say it's a little bit under reading
so<00:02:03.230> it'll<00:02:03.410> probably<00:02:03.560> in<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.010> point<00:02:04.190> zero

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
so it'll probably in the point zero

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.319 
so it'll probably in the point zero

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
nice way to hang them up pit all that it

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.880 
nice way to hang them up pit all that it
comes<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.000> nice<00:02:33.120> little<00:02:33.269> plastic<00:02:33.750> case<00:02:36.890> so

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
comes to the nice little plastic case so

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.300 
comes to the nice little plastic case so
I<00:02:37.950> just<00:02:38.160> slides<00:02:38.459> over<00:02:38.700> there<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.830> then<00:02:41.099> yeah

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
I just slides over there and then yeah

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:50.470 
I just slides over there and then yeah
the<00:02:41.459> case<00:02:41.640> which<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:49.019> there<00:02:49.260> she<00:02:49.500> is

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
the case which and there she is

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.420 
the case which and there she is
very<00:02:51.480> impressive<00:02:51.900> all<00:02:52.319> metal<00:02:52.860> case<00:02:55.430> racing

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
very impressive all metal case racing

very impressive all metal case racing
the<00:02:56.489> light<00:02:56.670> actually<00:02:56.910> it's<00:02:57.329> a<00:02:57.420> little<00:02:57.599> smaller

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
the light actually it's a little smaller

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.990 
the light actually it's a little smaller
than<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:58.079> thought<00:02:58.110> really<00:02:58.890> light<00:02:59.190> feels<00:02:59.760> very

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
than I thought really light feels very

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.789 
than I thought really light feels very
quality<00:03:00.569> well-made<00:03:06.410> yeah<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:08.370> then<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.940> get

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
quality well-made yeah and then you get

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.160 
quality well-made yeah and then you get
several<00:03:10.799> different<00:03:10.950> horns<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.900> audio

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
several different horns and the audio

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.720 
several different horns and the audio
yada<00:03:13.560> kinda<00:03:13.980> looks<00:03:14.099> like<00:03:14.160> some<00:03:14.400> cheap

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
yada kinda looks like some cheap

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.729 
yada kinda looks like some cheap
hardware<00:03:15.540> they<00:03:15.690> should<00:03:15.870> have<00:03:15.989> included<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.590> my

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
hardware they should have included in my

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.629 
hardware they should have included in my

aluminum<00:03:21.030> horn<00:03:21.470> just<00:03:22.470> who's<00:03:22.650> gonna<00:03:22.799> put<00:03:23.040> a

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
aluminum horn just who's gonna put a

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.349 
aluminum horn just who's gonna put a
piece<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.370> junk<00:03:23.519> on<00:03:23.700> something<00:03:24.030> like<00:03:24.150> this

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
piece of junk on something like this

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.530 
piece of junk on something like this
right<00:03:25.579> that<00:03:26.579> looks<00:03:26.700> very<00:03:26.850> nice<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.359> one's

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
right that looks very nice this one's

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.059 
right that looks very nice this one's
one<00:03:27.720> on<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.989> higher<00:03:28.200> end<00:03:28.500> there's<00:03:28.769> another

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
one on the higher end there's another

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.789 
one on the higher end there's another
one<00:03:29.400> with<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.299> little<00:03:30.389> bit<00:03:30.480> more<00:03:30.690> torque<00:03:31.049> but

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
one with a little bit more torque but

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.809 
one with a little bit more torque but
it's<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:31.950> little<00:03:32.069> bit<00:03:32.190> slower<00:03:32.609> so<00:03:34.700> this<00:03:35.700> is

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
it's a little bit slower so this is

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.330 
it's a little bit slower so this is
going<00:03:36.090> up<00:03:36.180> against<00:03:36.450> something<00:03:37.130> not<00:03:38.130> even

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
going up against something not even

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.099 
going up against something not even
close<00:03:38.609> to<00:03:38.639> this<00:03:39.090> it's<00:03:39.420> uh<00:03:41.720> Tower<00:03:42.720> Pro<00:03:43.079> I

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
close to this it's uh Tower Pro I

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.229 
close to this it's uh Tower Pro I
believe<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.970> yeah

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
believe it is yeah

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.030 
believe it is yeah
Tower<00:03:45.810> Pro<00:03:47.120> mg<00:03:48.120> 906<00:03:48.870> bar<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:49.680> has<00:03:49.829> been<00:03:49.980> a

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
Tower Pro mg 906 bar and this has been a

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.470 
Tower Pro mg 906 bar and this has been a
not<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.459> little<00:03:50.670> servo<00:03:50.910> they're<00:03:51.120> dirt<00:03:51.450> cheap

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
not that little servo they're dirt cheap

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.330 
not that little servo they're dirt cheap
don't<00:03:52.290> get<00:03:52.440> me<00:03:52.530> wrong<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.859> still<00:03:53.010> even<00:03:53.100> on<00:03:53.250> the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
don't get me wrong I still even on the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.039 
don't get me wrong I still even on the

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
but the little Tower Pro they can all

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.610 
but the little Tower Pro they can all
look<00:03:56.970> pretty<00:03:57.090> good<00:03:57.359> for<00:03:57.959> just<00:03:57.989> beating<00:03:58.530> on

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
look pretty good for just beating on

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.589 
look pretty good for just beating on
them<00:03:58.799> but<00:03:59.790> I'm<00:04:00.030> looking<00:04:00.239> for<00:04:00.359> something<00:04:00.569> a
