00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello how are you welcome to a new 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.370
 video in this video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.800
 finished products in terms of solar 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.960
 and other good very fast especially in 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.820
 those that least interest but good is 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.560
 that I have collected enough products and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.290
 how can I make a video just of this 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.239
 well here I know that she does not 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.189
 Interested but the best for the summer 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:29.430
 coming I give you some idea I start with 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.160
 a lip balm that is this from 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.010
 mercadona I think it's short care is a 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.350
 protective lip protector 15 and nothing 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.170
 Well it is a cocoa it is quite moisturizing 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.850
 and I really like it reminds me of the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.900
 typical of the hipo sanz and good because 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.370
 It also has a little factor of 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.650
 solar protection so it's fine 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.190
 I'm going to show you two of this 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.469
 felipe is factor 50 plus 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.469
 I bought this one a couple of years ago and 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.199
 It was matifying but even though it was not 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.670
 had oils I think it had no oil 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.739
 wait I've left my skin very oily 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.950
 I did not like anything for the face was the 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.540
 first well pharmacy cream that I 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.610
 I bought for the face thinking about then 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.470
 that that I have oily skin and I do not 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.240
 I liked nothing so in the end I gave it to 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.880
 me to my mother who does not have skin so 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.039
 fat and neither good nor what 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.630
 they used as much as I did at the end as 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.360
 I had two years using it for 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.159
 body but I would not repeat with this this 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.350
 how to teach is a mini size but as 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.580
 I liked it a lot I wanted to teach you 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.470
 it's rock called soleil protection 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.470
 and it's factor 50 plus 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.930
 it's a super small mini size but I 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.440
 He liked it a lot because he was very absorbed 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.050
 all right 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.310
 It seemed you did not have anything on your skin 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.760
 also has a protection failure 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.160
 pretty high solar and I like it a lot 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.230
 surely when I finish those of use 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.120
 usually the joker that I have left 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.410
 very much because maybe I encourage myself with 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.270
 this but good first I have to spend 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.670
 the others now I will move quickly 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.000
 to all the corporals I teach you these 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.430
 three of the same range of mercadona 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.470
 very plus these two spray this in 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.630
 cream format the truth is that those of 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.459
 spray do not finish convincing me what 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.820
 they buy in my house and when I end up using 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.650
 because I know I'm leaving here 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.230
 what I have taken away from him 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.690
 This spray has just spray me 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.250
 like coming out here and it does not make me 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.350
 very funny but good at home what 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.660
 buy and we end up using this is the 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.430
 15 of 30 in general is also about 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.230
 all of the 30 do not me and I do not burn myself 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.510
 like but I liked in this format 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.850
 in cream because I do not know in the end 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.470
 it's much easier to throw your hand 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.600
 and extend less than throw it in the spray 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.560
 because you have to extend it like that so 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.690
 good 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.330
 I recommend this more than this now 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.400
 I teach this mini toya that I got from 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.730
 a promotion in a pharmacy is from the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.220
 durex mark in factor 30 and it's like the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.370
 Dry oil stretched pretty well 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.680
 It was like oil but it did not leave the skin 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.810
 too sticky and good is factor 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.030
 30 as I say and it's not bad but 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.739
 come on I always go body gives me a 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.110
 little more equal and throw to mercadona because 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.120
 it's the cheapest in the face I already spend 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.400
 more money to make them for my kind of 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.500
 skin another this same style as oil 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.380
 dry is this that has seen it totally 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.850
 empty or totally empty that is 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.250
 has erased the letters is of the brand 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.870
 levi's and me and it's mazuelas they sell it 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.610
 in mazuelas the truth is that it is 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.950
 pretty good I think it's a super pot 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.870
 comfortable because it's not too big and 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.549
 when enough in the protection 30 and 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.110
 Well, I liked it, 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.209
 that enhances tanning although neither 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.769
 I have noticed too much situation other 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.209
 body oil that has also been 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.160
 erased the letters I do not know what I've done 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.260
 this function with the boats that are going 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.170
 erased all these bavaria was of 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.170
 20 protection and it smelled very good coconut 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.790
 yes but I do not know this kind of oils 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.799
 this was dry, that was also a 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.269
 texture when you applied it is 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.420
 they absorbed very quickly and did not let you 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.579
 feel fat but I do not like them anymore 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.230
 maybe more oil type oil than 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.599
 this oil dry because when you're 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.700
 more brunette I put my sunscreen 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.640
 and then I'm pouring oil for 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.959
 enhance the tan on top but I 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.670
 I think with this I would not repeat area of 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.650
 the mother as I tell you about protection 20 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.109
 Even if you do not see anything now, I teach you 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.470
 this one that is 20 brand protection 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.300
 havana are and this then implantation 20 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.419
 to be protected 20 I have not burned 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.510
 and it has come to me quite well it was very 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.760
 liquid and it's not bad but I'm telling you 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.740
 that this one I think they bought it 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.050
 brother in any position or something in the 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.550
 on some beach I do not know where and I hit 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.139
 always market shot was not the last 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.010
 that I teach you for the body and that 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.750
 super delighted is this 50 plus 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.520
 transparent of mercadona that is like a 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.220
 spray format and I think it's super 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.919
 comfortable because it 's totally liquid 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.390
 although then it has the texture a bit 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.580
 oily 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.200
 sprays you and does not even 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.120
 it's almost missing, although good 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.040
 it always happened a little bit but I do not know 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.460
 I find it super comfortable if for children 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.620
 small to catch and because you do like this and it's going 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.320
 as it opens up quite then you embrace 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.610
 a lot of area and it seems very very 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.250
 comfortable plus that has a protection 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.680
 50 plus for the body and good price 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.630
 I think it was about six euros or seven and 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.280
 This one has enchanted me and surely 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.560
 repeat next year finish the 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.990
 this hair protector also from 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.090
 mercadona and this neither fÃº nor fa esta lo lo 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.680
 I had from last year and this year I have 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.050
 preferred to throw me conditioners 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.000
 liquid or some the panther bicrim and 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.800
 other but good is not bad but 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.900
 I prefer a conditioner 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.640
 liquid because this does not hydrate me so much 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.220
 like the other and I teach you already to 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.590
 finish two after sun the first one this 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.270
 of bavaria that came with me with the 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.080
 oil that you have taught before is of 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.819
 rosehip 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.650
 and I did not like it very much because it cost 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:51.289
 that came out a lot in a super cream 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.719
 Thick very moisturizing smell very good but 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.949
 came not sell gift if not 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:57.020
 I think I'll buy it for that because it 's 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.490
 too thick and I prefer it 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.879
 better in vietnam to help shower a 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.620
 oil a lighter cream for 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:06.830
 spread the best and already to finish the 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:10.129
 video end with after sun this after 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.379
 aloe mercadona deliplus sad 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:14.659
 like a green aloe vera gel 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:17.930
 simply without the truth is that it is 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:19.610
 Pretty cool smells really good and goes 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.960
