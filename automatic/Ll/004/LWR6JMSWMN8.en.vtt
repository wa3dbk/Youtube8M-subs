00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.670
 and that youtube speaks to them mentally 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.450
 each other with a boxing of my 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.640
 display for playstation3 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.550
 That's how my people get it. 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.550
 mercadolibre at the cost of 6 thousand 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.470
 pesitos 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.900

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.820
 go make the dollar conversion a 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.060
 dollar is worth 14 pesos then to me 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.370
 It cost 6 thousand pesos 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.360
 and well we bring it here it is helping me 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.520
 my little woman to record and enjoy 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.490
 we add the video the water part of the 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.650
 heard separately for when I was 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.630
 editing I did not like how you heard and 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.210
 so why good does my wife give 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.600
 a lot of laughter and out there we missed a 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.000
 little bit of TV music and that's why 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.930
 I had to avoid the audio wool and here 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.210
 as we see it brings the usb cable so that it does not 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.590
 there are traps this server is very stage 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:30.130
 3 this game come free is the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.530
 motorstorm apocalypse in 3-d let's 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.180
 try it after they did not try it on this 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:41.230
 little box brings what is the 3d glasses 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:45.570
 the lenses to see our 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:48.540
 3d screen 3 out of the usb charger 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.909
 a velvet cover and glasses 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.159
 in half glasses they are nothing more is 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.740
 totally like futurists and stockings 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.890
 rare 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.370
 if these appointments but I like it pleases me 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.120
 I like it they look good to me very well 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.670
 except for your best opinion and good let's continue 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.820
 with the revised as I say again 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.290
 the voice has already been mounted because the audio 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.960
 that came out in the video I did not like and 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.420
 I had music out there watching boy 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.190
 woman laughed a lot and I did not like it very much 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.760
 how it looked is good here we bring the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.299
 power cable 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.860
 the power cable and of course this 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.209
 because I do not want them to think that they steal me 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.730
 the video of another person 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.730
 that is the base of the screen 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.489
 in fact here nothing else will bring us the 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.920
 review the subsequent unboxing extract 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.930
 checked on the screen that my point of 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.269
 view has been very good performance 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.209
 well this is where I gave it sitting on the 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.880
 screen that was going to be stuck in the 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.230
 base 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.880
 and well let's take out the filling what 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.050
 we expected these are instructive that 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.680
 There is no need to lose, there is always 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.680
 take them into account 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.720
 and in my life, what is good comes to me 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.629
 screen this screen I see the headquarters 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.210
 in black but I got it a color 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:13.940
 as gray 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:17.790
 from the brand sony display playstation3 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.490
 and in case you were asked if it is 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.910
 compatible with component cables 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.620
 and with the hdmi cables if you 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.740
 like you can connect what can 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.630
 connect to the monitor 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.450
 good that it serves as a monitor 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.480
 computer with the xbox and with the play 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.820
 station 3 and also if you do not 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.220
 you will like it so you can connect up to 3 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:46.800
 wii consoles with your hdmi cable or with the 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.080
 current component that was all that is 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.850
