room's kind of not that great in

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.330 
room's kind of not that great in
lighting<00:00:19.390> and<00:00:19.649> it's<00:00:20.649> being<00:00:20.890> remotely

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
lighting and it's being remotely

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.019 
lighting and it's being remotely
triggered<00:00:21.640> by<00:00:21.790> this<00:00:21.849> thing<00:00:23.640> I'll<00:00:24.640> put<00:00:24.820> a<00:00:24.849> link

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
triggered by this thing I'll put a link

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.400 
triggered by this thing I'll put a link
in<00:00:25.149> the<00:00:25.210> sidebar<00:00:25.390> if<00:00:25.689> you<00:00:25.810> want<00:00:26.169> to<00:00:26.230> know<00:00:26.290> what

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
down so first picture and then I feel

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.000 
down so first picture and then I feel
really<00:00:55.480> careful<00:00:56.020> not<00:00:56.140> to<00:00:56.260> move<00:00:56.350> my<00:00:56.560> head<00:00:56.800> at

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
really careful not to move my head at

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.000 
really careful not to move my head at
all<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.550> then<00:00:57.790> I'll<00:00:57.910> pile<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:59.710> I'm<00:00:59.829> waiting

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
all and then I'll pile now I'm waiting

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.420 
all and then I'll pile now I'm waiting
for<00:01:00.130> the<00:01:00.370> flash<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:01.560> recycle<00:01:02.560> and<00:01:02.980> it's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
for the flash to recycle and it's

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.399 
for the flash to recycle and it's
recycled<00:01:03.760> so<00:01:04.119> now<00:01:04.629> my<00:01:04.869> eyes<00:01:05.019> are<00:01:05.079> gonna<00:01:05.290> go

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
recycled so now my eyes are gonna go

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:14.060 
recycled so now my eyes are gonna go
down<00:01:07.710> okay<00:01:08.710> so<00:01:09.159> now<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:11.260> have<00:01:11.290> both<00:01:11.890> of<00:01:12.250> my

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
down okay so now we have both of my

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.440 
down okay so now we have both of my
exposures<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:15.280> I<00:01:15.460> didn't<00:01:15.790> move<00:01:15.880> my<00:01:16.060> hand<00:01:16.330> a

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
exposures and I didn't move my hand a

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.580 
exposures and I didn't move my hand a
little<00:01:16.600> bit<00:01:16.800> um<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:19.570> I<00:01:19.900> think<00:01:20.049> we<00:01:20.440> can

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
little bit um but I think we can

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.710 
little bit um but I think we can
probably<00:01:20.740> get<00:01:20.979> around<00:01:21.159> that<00:01:21.340> in<00:01:21.430> Photoshop<00:01:21.720> so

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
probably get around that in Photoshop so

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.090 
probably get around that in Photoshop so
let's<00:01:22.900> go<00:01:23.020> with<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.260> computer<00:01:23.620> and<00:01:23.770> let's

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
let's go with the computer and let's

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.789 
let's go with the computer and let's
check<00:01:24.610> these<00:01:24.760> out<00:01:25.229> all<00:01:26.229> right<00:01:26.409> so<00:01:26.530> now<00:01:26.620> we're

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
check these out all right so now we're

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.039 
check these out all right so now we're
on<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:26.950> computer<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:28.270> here's<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.870> ten

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
on the computer so here's the ten

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.649 
on the computer so here's the ten
pictures<00:01:29.260> and<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:30.729> were<00:01:30.790> a<00:01:30.940> little<00:01:31.270> bit<00:01:31.510> off

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
pictures and they were a little bit off

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.730 
pictures and they were a little bit off
but<00:01:32.200> oh<00:01:32.530> well<00:01:33.510> so<00:01:34.510> I'm<00:01:34.600> just<00:01:34.720> gonna<00:01:34.810> put<00:01:35.380> I<00:01:35.590> just

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
but oh well so I'm just gonna put I just

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.480 
but oh well so I'm just gonna put I just
dragged<00:01:36.220> both<00:01:36.460> of<00:01:36.610> them<00:01:36.700> in<00:01:37.619> okay<00:01:38.619> I'm<00:01:39.159> going

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
dragged both of them in okay I'm going

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.469 
dragged both of them in okay I'm going
to<00:01:39.869> select<00:01:40.869> this<00:01:41.440> picture<00:01:41.729> ctrl<00:01:42.729> a<00:01:42.909> and<00:01:43.180> then

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
to select this picture ctrl a and then

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.350 
to select this picture ctrl a and then
ctrl<00:01:43.930> C<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.170> copy<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.729> get<00:01:45.729> rid<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:46.000> that<00:01:46.150> and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
ctrl C to copy it get rid of that and

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.810 
ctrl C to copy it get rid of that and
then<00:01:46.420> just<00:01:47.110> paste<00:01:47.229> it<00:01:47.710> on<00:01:47.890> this<00:01:48.159> other<00:01:48.580> picture

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
then just paste it on this other picture

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.140 
then just paste it on this other picture
now<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:49.810> can<00:01:49.960> see<00:01:50.140> they<00:01:50.350> are<00:01:50.380> off<00:01:51.000> quite<00:01:52.000> a<00:01:52.030> bit

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
now you can see they are off quite a bit

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.109 
now you can see they are off quite a bit
actually<00:01:52.540> I<00:01:52.810> move<00:01:53.140> my<00:01:53.290> head<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.770> lot<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.700> that's

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
actually I move my head a lot and that's

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.039 
actually I move my head a lot and that's
kind<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.390> bad<00:01:55.950> arm<00:01:56.950> but<00:01:57.729> we'll<00:01:57.970> probably<00:01:58.810> find

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
kind of bad arm but we'll probably find

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.789 
kind of bad arm but we'll probably find
a<00:01:59.200> way<00:01:59.320> around<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:02.229> go<00:02:02.470> down<00:02:02.590> here<00:02:02.619> and

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
a way around it so you go down here and

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.670 
a way around it so you go down here and
you<00:02:02.920> create<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.250> mask<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:05.110> top<00:02:05.290> layer<00:02:05.470> and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
you create a mask on the top layer and

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.699 
you create a mask on the top layer and
then<00:02:06.460> you<00:02:06.520> do<00:02:07.299> a<00:02:07.330> black<00:02:08.170> paint<00:02:08.709> brush<00:02:09.360> soft

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
then you do a black paint brush soft

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.030 
then you do a black paint brush soft
kind<00:02:11.709> of<00:02:11.829> big<00:02:12.629> then<00:02:13.629> lets<00:02:13.810> off<00:02:13.989> so<00:02:14.590> what<00:02:14.919> we're

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
kind of big then lets off so what we're

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.110 
kind of big then lets off so what we're
going<00:02:15.159> to<00:02:15.219> have<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.459> do<00:02:15.579> we're<00:02:15.790> gonna<00:02:15.849> have<00:02:16.029> to

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
going to have to do we're gonna have to

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.559 
going to have to do we're gonna have to
move

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
move

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.479 
move
this<00:02:16.870> picture<00:02:17.319> arm<00:02:18.480> up<00:02:19.769> so<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:20.920> matches<00:02:21.249> the

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
this picture arm up so it matches the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.399 
this picture arm up so it matches the
one<00:02:21.730> underneath<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.299> a<00:02:22.359> little<00:02:22.540> bit<00:02:22.719> okay<00:02:23.049> now

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
one underneath it a little bit okay now

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.860 
one underneath it a little bit okay now
we're<00:02:23.650> gonna<00:02:23.709> draw<00:02:24.180> see<00:02:25.180> now<00:02:25.329> it<00:02:25.510> kind<00:02:25.689> of<00:02:25.719> goes

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
we're gonna draw see now it kind of goes

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.379 
we're gonna draw see now it kind of goes
a<00:02:25.900> little<00:02:26.139> bit<00:02:26.379> better<00:02:26.639> so<00:02:27.639> maybe<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.299> a

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:28.389 
a little bit better so maybe it's a

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.030 
a little bit better so maybe it's a
little<00:02:28.420> bit<00:02:28.749> more<00:02:28.900> up<00:02:29.139> and<00:02:29.379> then<00:02:29.769> we're<00:02:29.950> gonna

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
little bit more up and then we're gonna

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.559 
little bit more up and then we're gonna
draw<00:02:30.400> yeah

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
draw yeah

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.559 
draw yeah
and<00:02:31.950> now<00:02:32.950> that's<00:02:33.189> that's<00:02:33.849> about<00:02:34.000> right

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
and now that's that's about right

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.550 
and now that's that's about right
so<00:02:34.840> but<00:02:35.769> there<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.069> a<00:02:36.099> little<00:02:36.459> bit<00:02:36.639> of<00:02:36.849> a<00:02:37.560> little

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
so but there is a little bit of a little

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.190 
so but there is a little bit of a little
bit<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.799> something<00:02:39.129> right<00:02:39.250> there<00:02:39.519> I<00:02:40.139> want<00:02:41.139> to

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
bit of something right there I want to

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.849 
bit of something right there I want to
fix<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.709> up<00:02:41.889> there<00:02:42.459> we<00:02:42.579> go<00:02:43.829> and<00:02:44.829> now

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
fix that up there we go and now

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.809 
fix that up there we go and now
obviously<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:47.620> can<00:02:47.799> get<00:02:47.919> better<00:02:48.159> results

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
obviously you can get better results

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.830 
obviously you can get better results
with<00:02:48.909> this<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.329> is<00:02:49.510> kind<00:02:49.719> of<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.900> bad<00:02:50.500> result

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
with this this is kind of a bad result

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.770 
with this this is kind of a bad result
look<00:02:52.840> at<00:02:52.900> that<00:02:53.109> okay<00:02:53.290> well<00:02:53.769> I<00:02:54.449> did<00:02:55.449> kind<00:02:55.689> of

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
look at that okay well I did kind of

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.899 
look at that okay well I did kind of
mess<00:02:55.900> up<00:02:56.159> because<00:02:57.159> I<00:02:57.189> moved<00:02:57.489> my<00:02:57.639> head<00:02:59.909> don't

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
mess up because I moved my head don't

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.759 
mess up because I moved my head don't
look<00:03:01.090> at<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.269> there<00:03:01.449> we<00:03:01.540> go<00:03:01.689> now<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.620> doesn't

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
look at that there we go now it doesn't

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.250 
look at that there we go now it doesn't
look<00:03:02.949> all<00:03:03.099> that<00:03:03.129> bad<00:03:06.209> okay<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:07.750> there's<00:03:08.169> your

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
look all that bad okay so there's your

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.099 
look all that bad okay so there's your
crazy<00:03:08.889> wacky<00:03:09.219> picture<00:03:09.790> if<00:03:10.689> you<00:03:10.750> want<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.019> do

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
crazy wacky picture if you want to do

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.110 
crazy wacky picture if you want to do
some<00:03:11.260> other<00:03:11.349> stuff<00:03:11.469> to<00:03:11.859> it<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:15.069> could<00:03:15.340> flatten

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
some other stuff to it you could flatten

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.879 
some other stuff to it you could flatten
the<00:03:16.299> image<00:03:16.329> so<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.870> just<00:03:17.049> combines<00:03:17.560> those<00:03:17.829> two

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
the image so it just combines those two

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.729 
the image so it just combines those two
and<00:03:18.549> then<00:03:19.180> we<00:03:19.359> should<00:03:19.540> probably<00:03:19.959> crop<00:03:20.409> it<00:03:20.590> down

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
and then we should probably crop it down

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.659 
and then we should probably crop it down
here<00:03:21.459> let's<00:03:22.030> make<00:03:22.209> it<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.449> square<00:03:23.489> just<00:03:24.489> like

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
here let's make it a square just like

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:31.589 
here let's make it a square just like
that<00:03:25.199> crop<00:03:26.280> okay<00:03:27.280> so<00:03:27.849> now<00:03:29.430> um<00:03:30.430> what<00:03:31.329> else<00:03:31.359> can

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
that crop okay so now um what else can

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.839 
that crop okay so now um what else can
we<00:03:31.720> do<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.139> we<00:03:32.319> could<00:03:32.470> maybe<00:03:32.799> dodge<00:03:33.280> that

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
we do to it we could maybe dodge that

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.369 
we do to it we could maybe dodge that
little<00:03:34.120> area<00:03:34.419> cuz<00:03:34.599> it's<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.810> little<00:03:34.840> bit<00:03:35.139> dark

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
little area cuz it's a little bit dark

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.979 
little area cuz it's a little bit dark
in<00:03:35.530> there<00:03:35.849> so<00:03:36.849> maybe<00:03:37.209> let's<00:03:37.449> dodge<00:03:37.720> the

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
in there so maybe let's dodge the

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.479 
in there so maybe let's dodge the
mid-tones<00:03:38.439> with<00:03:39.419> protec<00:03:40.419> tones<00:03:40.689> on<00:03:41.019> about<00:03:41.489> 50%

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
mid-tones with protec tones on about 50%

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.249 
mid-tones with protec tones on about 50%
and<00:03:45.419> that<00:03:46.419> makes<00:03:46.629> it<00:03:46.720> a<00:03:46.810> little<00:03:46.930> bit<00:03:47.079> better

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:47.259 
and that makes it a little bit better

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:51.839 
and that makes it a little bit better
what<00:03:48.159> up<00:03:48.340> we<00:03:48.609> can<00:03:48.759> also<00:03:49.000> dodge<00:03:49.750> just<00:03:50.259> the<00:03:50.849> iris

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
what up we can also dodge just the iris

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.449 
what up we can also dodge just the iris
I<00:03:53.009> want<00:03:54.009> to<00:03:54.099> protect<00:03:54.489> tones<00:03:54.729> off<00:03:55.090> at<00:03:55.659> about<00:03:56.459> 37%

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
I want to protect tones off at about 37%

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:04.439 
I want to protect tones off at about 37%
and<00:03:59.430> yeah<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:01.209> get<00:04:01.359> the<00:04:01.389> idea<00:04:03.359> trying<00:04:04.359> to

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
and yeah you get the idea trying to

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.099 
and yeah you get the idea trying to
think<00:04:04.599> of<00:04:04.659> some<00:04:04.810> other<00:04:04.870> things<00:04:05.169> we<00:04:05.290> could<00:04:05.409> do

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
think of some other things we could do

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:14.069 
think of some other things we could do
we<00:04:08.109> could<00:04:08.430> multiply<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.909> and<00:04:10.949> mask<00:04:11.949> out<00:04:13.079> these

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
we could multiply it and mask out these

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:19.319 
we could multiply it and mask out these
areas<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:14.919> then<00:04:15.370> we'll<00:04:15.549> call<00:04:15.699> it<00:04:15.819> done<00:04:18.329> okay

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
areas and then we'll call it done okay

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.250 
areas and then we'll call it done okay
here<00:04:19.989> we<00:04:20.049> go

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.120
