then on top of that that's important
this<00:00:56.729> conditional<00:00:57.239> :<00:00:57.510> topic<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.229> switched<00:00:58.830> on

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
this conditional : topic we switched on

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.170 
this conditional : topic we switched on
his<00:00:59.190> back<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.030> he<00:01:00.920> accepted<00:01:01.920> Authority<00:01:02.180> try

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
his back and he accepted Authority try

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.789 
his back and he accepted Authority try
to<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.449> around<00:01:03.510> top<00:01:03.900> of<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.170> moment<00:01:04.470> at<00:01:04.769> that

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
to get around top of that moment at that
