00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
much water got sucked into this other

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.660 
much water got sucked into this other
light<00:00:15.170> after<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.260> got<00:00:16.410> done<00:00:17.070> with<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.310> cold

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
light after it got done with that cold

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.099 
light after it got done with that cold
water<00:00:17.880> testing<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.660> wanted<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.990> demonstrate

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
water testing so I wanted to demonstrate

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.109 
water testing so I wanted to demonstrate
to<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:20.189> basically<00:00:20.340> all<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.699> did<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:21.029> I

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
to you and basically all I did was I

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.330 
to you and basically all I did was I
took<00:00:21.150> off<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:22.439> outer<00:00:22.560> ring<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.160> that's

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
took off the the outer ring and that's

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.590 
took off the the outer ring and that's
it<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.640> haven't<00:00:23.910> done<00:00:23.970> anything<00:00:24.180> more

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
it I haven't done anything more

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.230 
it I haven't done anything more
by<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.869> way<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.529> voids<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.010> warranty<00:00:26.240> me

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
by the way that voids the warranty me

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.500 
by the way that voids the warranty me
doing<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.840> voids<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> warranty<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.510> I'm

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
doing this voids the warranty so I'm

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.400 
doing this voids the warranty so I'm
going<00:00:32.090> to<00:00:33.090> my<00:00:33.210> nail<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.690> hit<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> seal<00:00:34.200> there

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
going to my nail and hit the seal there

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.360 
going to my nail and hit the seal there
we<00:00:34.559> go<00:00:34.710> okay<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:36.469> as<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.680> see<00:00:37.739> there's

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
we go okay and as you can see there's

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.440 
we go okay and as you can see there's
already<00:00:39.000> big<00:00:39.510> water<00:00:39.750> droplets<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:41.450> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
already big water droplets on the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.720 
already big water droplets on the
backside<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.020> okay<00:00:43.860> that's<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
backside of that okay that's the the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.619 
backside of that okay that's the the
front<00:00:44.940> lens<00:00:45.200> so<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.260> put<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.710> aside<00:00:47.480> this<00:00:48.480> is

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
front lens so to put that aside this is

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.779 
front lens so to put that aside this is
the<00:00:48.780> type<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:48.989> ring<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.710> used<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:52.789> sorry

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the type of ring that is used and sorry

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.240 
the type of ring that is used and sorry
the<00:00:53.879> camera<00:00:54.149> takes<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.480> little<00:00:54.600> bit<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.840> focus

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
the camera takes a little bit to focus

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.240 
the camera takes a little bit to focus
it's<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.399> square<00:00:56.940> Oh<00:00:57.239> ring<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.469> where

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
it's a square Oh ring like that where

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.340 
it's a square Oh ring like that where
the<00:00:59.579> lens<00:00:59.820> actually<00:01:00.239> sits<00:01:00.570> inside<00:01:00.899> this

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the lens actually sits inside this

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.130 
the lens actually sits inside this
little<00:01:01.649> lip<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.190> then<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.359> backside<00:01:03.840> has<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
little lip and then the backside has a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.820 
little lip and then the backside has a
like<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.299> double<00:01:06.299> lip<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:07.170> seals<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.650> against

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
like a double lip that seals up against

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.020 
like a double lip that seals up against
the<00:01:07.979> housing<00:01:10.040> but<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> reflectors<00:01:11.640> are<00:01:11.850> not

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the housing but the reflectors are not

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:20.490 
the housing but the reflectors are not
contained<00:01:12.510> they<00:01:13.020> are<00:01:13.260> loose<00:01:14.180> okay

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.459

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
yeah yeah this one did just as well as

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.319 
yeah yeah this one did just as well as
the<00:01:24.560> other<00:01:24.679> one<00:01:24.799> okay<00:01:25.039> me<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.000> I<00:01:26.090> can't<00:01:28.329> okay

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
the other one okay me so I can't okay

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:30.459 
the other one okay me so I can't okay
this<00:01:29.539> is<00:01:29.600> gonna<00:01:29.689> be<00:01:29.780> kind<00:01:29.929> of<00:01:29.960> difficult<00:01:30.020> I

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
this is gonna be kind of difficult I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:31.959 
this is gonna be kind of difficult I
want<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:30.829> to<00:01:30.920> see<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.340> exact<00:01:31.670> amount<00:01:31.909> of

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
want you to see the exact amount of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:37.330 
want you to see the exact amount of
water<00:01:32.149> that's<00:01:32.420> in<00:01:32.689> there<00:01:34.240> there<00:01:35.240> we<00:01:35.360> go<00:01:36.340> that

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
water that's in there there we go that

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.050 
water that's in there there we go that
is<00:01:37.700> how<00:01:37.729> much<00:01:37.939> water<00:01:38.179> gets<00:01:38.390> sucked<00:01:38.689> in<00:01:38.810> here

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
is how much water gets sucked in here

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:50.469 
is how much water gets sucked in here
after<00:01:41.060> that<00:01:41.209> one<00:01:41.450> test<00:01:41.750> okay<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:49.000> is<00:01:50.000> not

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
after that one test okay that is not

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.630 
after that one test okay that is not
conducive<00:01:50.959> to<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.409> long-term<00:01:51.979> durability<00:01:52.399> of

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
conducive to the long-term durability of

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.120 
conducive to the long-term durability of
a<00:01:52.759> light<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.470> if<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:54.530> look<00:01:54.649> at<00:01:54.739> some<00:01:54.860> one<00:01:55.039> of

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
a light and if you look at some one of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.109 
a light and if you look at some one of
my<00:01:55.189> other<00:01:55.280> videos<00:01:55.640> you'll<00:01:55.849> see<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:58.090> yeah<00:01:59.090> that

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
my other videos you'll see it yeah that

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.209 
my other videos you'll see it yeah that
that's<00:01:59.869> not<00:02:00.170> conducive<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.829> long-term

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
that's not conducive to the long-term

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:02.589 
that's not conducive to the long-term
durability<00:02:01.579> of<00:02:01.789> a<00:02:01.879> light<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.239> if<00:02:02.299> you<00:02:02.390> look<00:02:02.509> at

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.599 
durability of a light and if you look at

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:03.699 
durability of a light and if you look at
my<00:02:02.659> other<00:02:02.750> video<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.079> see<00:02:03.259> that<00:02:03.289> it<00:02:03.590> actually

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
my other video to see that it actually

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.059 
my other video to see that it actually
does<00:02:03.920> fail<00:02:04.390> eventually<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.739> bottom<00:02:07.009> of

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
does fail eventually and the bottom of

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.400 
does fail eventually and the bottom of
the<00:02:07.159> light<00:02:07.340> is<00:02:07.549> where<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.200> where<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.259> wire

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
the light is where the where the wire

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.809 
the light is where the where the wire
the<00:02:09.739> power<00:02:09.950> wires<00:02:10.160> come<00:02:10.399> in<00:02:10.519> so<00:02:10.640> you're<00:02:10.729> gonna

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
the power wires come in so you're gonna

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.309 
the power wires come in so you're gonna
get<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.030> cross<00:02:11.299> circuit<00:02:11.660> right<00:02:11.810> across<00:02:12.079> that

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
get a cross circuit right across that

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.990 
get a cross circuit right across that
it's<00:02:13.160> actually<00:02:13.400> probably<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.670> good<00:02:13.760> thing<00:02:13.940> that

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
it's actually probably a good thing that

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.460 
it's actually probably a good thing that
I<00:02:14.120> turned<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.540> off<00:02:14.629> before<00:02:14.930> they<00:02:15.170> got<00:02:15.290> dunked

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470
