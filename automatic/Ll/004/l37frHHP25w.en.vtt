00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 good afternoon my name is alexander 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.640
 milovanov 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.899
 I am a dancer and teacher Hasla in 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.500
 dance club movement in the city 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.500
 Moscow 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.360
 I have been doing this for more than 8 years 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.450
 I had a lot of time to accumulate 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.580
 theoretical and practical experience 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.480
 how can you effectively teach 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.390
 dance hustle 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.010
 a person without special training 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.650
 teach him to dance is not only convenient 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.769
 but also beautiful including prepare it 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.090
 to our amateur competitions 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.880
 actually this issue will 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.559
 video tutorial is dedicated to my data 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.600
 video tutorials are not positioned as 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.370
 commercial product and are assumed 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.590
 as information material on 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.260
 keep free of charge therefore 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.329
 what if you paid some money for 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.940
 this video is likely you cheated 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.250
 if you go back to the subject of video tutorials 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.989
 a little more specifically then this manual 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.620
 will be useful in several categories 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.840
 people firstly experienced dancer with 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.969
 level probably from middle to class and 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.980
 higher that is the level that 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.350
 allows you to perceive technical 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.090
 dance information visually and 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.670
 logically at least at some level 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.740
 of course using the video is impossible 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.830
 give a person a physical feel 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.650
 what should happen in the body as it should 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.960
 tighten your leg muscles or how to hold 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.060
 frame in pair but nonetheless I 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.560
 I will try these things as much as possible 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.720
 comment in detail and 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.759
 demonstrate the second category 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.100
 people who benefit will be interested 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.710
 this is a teacher who want 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.200
 to figure out how to teach your 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.390
 student learning system in the studio and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.729
 logic of the technical base which 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.280
 taught to students ideally should 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.590
 make up some complete logical 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.689
 structure in this structure should not 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.060
 there should be no gaps 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.579
 there should be no questions on which 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.590
 Technology can not give an answer and certainly 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.470
 there should be no more contradictions like 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.909
 inside the technical theory itself and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.759
 between theory and practice 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.740
 when one is actually taught 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.890
 something completely different is being danced 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.420
 technical base offered by me 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.819
 Great for her 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.970
 basis build all studio training 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.370
 hasla from the very basics and down to 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.400
 learning dance experience 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.409
 grades b or even in this way 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.200
 This manual is not a tutorial for 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:23.540
 beginners this technical video for those 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.659
 who already knows the basics 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.540
 has experience but wants to dance better and 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.430
 understand your dance better finally 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.920
 last question you want 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.810
 light up the intro than it 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.650
 video tutorial is different from those 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.260
 numerous 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.390
 training videos that were released in 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.959
 hassle over the past few years she 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.420
 distinguished by the quality of all that 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.120
 I don't understand the meaning here 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.849
 video tutorials in which the demonstration 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.700
 competitive figures are at the level not 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.010
 allowing me to pass even the first round 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.190
 it is also not clear how to talk about 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.599
 interaction and logic of figures 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.640
 pronouncing one rhythmic pattern and 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.609
 immediately performing the figure in a completely 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.489
 a friend is finally strange to me when 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.349
 teacher and even on video can not 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.650
 demonstrate that technique and that 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:18.109
 the logic that they themselves are taught therefore in 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.900
 This textbook doesnâ€™t 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.290
 I will analyze each in detail 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.440
 basic figure on specific aspects 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.799
 technology 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.799
 rhythmic interaction most frequent 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.889
 errors and problem and to show that 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.870
 my vision really works 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.750
 I will show her figures more precisely 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.730
 not only me i drew some of the most 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.579
 strong pairs of their students from different 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.660
 classes that show that vision 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:49.250
 technology is the logic of the figures that I teach and 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.639
 by their example they will demonstrate that 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.660
 it all really exists and works 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.970
 certainly some separate 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.639
 technical aspects I will show 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.220
 but I will try to minimize this 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:04.370
 this introductory part is complete and 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.840
 we are waiting for the first lesson of the main rhythm of disco 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.840
 Foxy and its features
