00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello then instead together some of the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:09.000
 my favorite products during my 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.370
 summer period there are several but 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.120
 these are the ones that really for me 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.609
 make the difference let's start right away 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.400
 we all know there are now I believe 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.550
 that every brand has its mascara 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.680
 waterproof and there are versions of the 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.150
 original mask the version 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.850
 waterproof but sometimes we don't want to 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.070
 we want to keep loving so much 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.489
 our mascara and honestly not 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.829
 we want to buy the la version 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.079
 waterproof version for these people is 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.320
 for all those girls who don't have 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.950
 the waterproof version of their mask 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.300
 favorite I find that the Chinese laces 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.360
 be absolutely perfect by now 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.390
 already for some years and of anastasis 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.100
 beverly hills famous for all 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.830
 products and started with the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.729
 eyebrows now a complete line of 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.420
 make up these leave genius like 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:17.450
 work think of the monkey as a 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:20.909
 top coat as a finish for eyelashes 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.909
 makes your mascara any 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.290
 even non-waterproof mascara 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:30.689
 waterproof so water resistant 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.659
 has an effect creates you a pool is one 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.070
 film on the lashes and keeps 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.650
 also prolongs the life of the mascara is 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.520
 absolutely a gel is not possible 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.869
 see a transparent gel anyway 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.990
 I'm losing the voice it's a gel 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.470
 transparent that dries the next 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.829
 product definitely a must during the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.600
 summer period but it is certainly useful 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.600
 for all those people who have one 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.549
 oily skin or one 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:09.239
 a fat c area this is of benefit ed 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:12.270
 is the of the professional line I love very much 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:18.080
 their their primer and what is a license 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:22.200
 on the blog what is a stick is a stick a 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.900
 creamy that applies directly not 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.459
 glossy do not polish absolutely opaque 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.260
 when it is passed over the face and makes the 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.319
 dull skin so I find it is 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.860
 absolutely fantastic even if you don't 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:41.250
 use the if you're not even using makeup 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.700
 you only know maybe during the day 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.130
 we tend to be lucid from some 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.450
 in short, the effect is not always the 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.730
 best so I find this to be 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.890
 also the fact that it is the form and the 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.110
 measures are those of a of a 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.370
 lip balm finds it perfect from 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:07.200
 put in your bag quick touch and go 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.120
 a short while ago appointed anastasi for the queen 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.350
 of the eyebrows so let's talk about the 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.040
 eyebrows 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:18.359
 I don't know if this is a product that is 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.950
 still in circulation or if it has been 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.950
 a limited edition 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.760
 it seems to me that it is only an edition 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.620
 limited, however, if you see it around 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.350
 take it because I find it to be 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.489
 absolutely fantastic and debora ed 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.950
 a pencil is a braille a brawn liner 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.200
 of those that do not temper themselves, they turn around 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.980
 come out you have to be very careful because 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.370
 very thin very thin sheets 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.010
 it will be precisely because it does not break 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.930
 and it is a matter for eyebrows 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.810
 waterproof there are only two 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.410
 however I find that the version miss 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.620
 darker have absolutely shades 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.519
 perfect for those like me with hair 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.049
 dark 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.329
 I happen to have some post that 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.240
 takes different directions and this instead 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.720
 in rieti 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.840
 to fix I apply it and then assume it with 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.120
 the brush and it is waterproof 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.540
 I also applied it during the 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.630
 warmer days really don't stay 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.860
 there it settles down really well 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:30.100
 we continue with a product that is of it 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:33.510
 cosmetics and dell acc cream with bronze 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.570
 to the protection 50 here here 50 then 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.850
 fantastic during the period 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.160
 summer when in fact we don't want 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.950
 putting so many things is a product 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:51.510
 unique because moisturizing cream a 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:54.640
 protection protection 50 and some 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.250
 bronze inside therefore from even a little 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.950
 of a bit of color I find it is have 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.860
 really good coverage an opacity 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:06.370
 very good on the skin so for me it is 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.750
 definitely one of my products 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.580
 favorite 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:15.840
 we continue with the lay line there are two 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:20.800
 buffalo waterproof vamp eyeliner products 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:23.160
 I like it very much, this is true there 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.820
 they are different colors 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.650
 this is black is the number 001 mi 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.040
 first of all like the application I find 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.960
 that has very clean application e 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.150
 be easy to apply 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.960
 especially because if chivu or for whom 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:44.230
 wants a line not very thin has one 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.230
 media line a pin up style line is ed 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:52.480
 so it's absolutely waterproof 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:56.200
 excellent also the lipstick do not know if 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.030
 these maytals are limited edition 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.670
 they came out in different colors 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.550
 this is a very cute one of pink 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.340
 and these are also waterproof 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.060
 so if you want to go to the sea maybe 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.950
 just put a little lipstick on me 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.800
 the look is clear with the goggles 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.409
 perfect to put only one 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.909
 aspect that highlights 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:21.419
 the tan I find this to be 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:23.340
 perfect and is the shade for lips yes 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.849
 let it dry for a minute and then yes 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:30.470
 apply the top cop above which renders the 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:33.120
 water lipstick the latest product is 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.770
 I certainly like using a fixer 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.620
 a weight of gold for make-up can be 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:44.340
 diego dalla palma is sprayed on the face 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:46.340
 when the makeup is finished and usually 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.810
 I prefer to use it for occasions 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:53.550
 I find the details not fantastic 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:56.520
 I know for a wedding when it is due 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.229
 keep the perfect makeup and maybe 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.780
 you can't touch it 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:04.199
 during the summer it is a product 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.509
 which I suggest even more is a 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:09.419
 I like this fixer in general 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:13.110
 a lot but there are several 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:16.289
 brand cm urban decay all have gods 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.719
 absolutely valid fixers and yes 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:21.840
 I find that in the summer certainly 

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:26.639
 surely at least I personally use them 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:29.969
 a little more if maybe I'm all 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:33.270
 day away and all day out d 

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:35.969
 winter, however, I do not use it in summer perhaps 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:38.090
 I prefer to spray it a little bit but 

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:41.130
 also to refresh makeup 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:44.940
 refresh your face both things 

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:48.870
 spray it during the day or not 

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:52.440
 leaves the shiny face dries on 

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:55.440
 face is there again 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.419
 lots of waterproof product products 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.960
 it is long held products that help the 

00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:02.159
 trick to stay perfect throughout 

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.740
 the day 

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:08.940
 these are definitely my favorites 

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:11.610
 so I wanted to show them to you and how 

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.650
 as usual you could know if there are such 

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:16.349
 are your favorite products during 

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:19.879

00:08:16.349 --> 00:08:19.879
