00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
anyway this is the first video here this

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.349 
anyway this is the first video here this
is<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.689> idea<00:00:25.609> trying<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.730> explain<00:00:27.060> this

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
is just the idea trying to explain this

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.230 
is just the idea trying to explain this
to<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.170> then<00:00:28.500> we'll<00:00:29.039> go<00:00:29.279> from<00:00:29.460> there<00:00:29.760> so

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
to you and then we'll go from there so

to you and then we'll go from there so
hopefully<00:00:30.900> there'll<00:00:31.109> be<00:00:31.430> maybe<00:00:32.430> three<00:00:32.520> or

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
hopefully there'll be maybe three or

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.900 
hopefully there'll be maybe three or
four<00:00:32.969> videos<00:00:33.149> about<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:34.579> we're<00:00:35.579> gonna<00:00:35.730> see

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
four videos about this we're gonna see

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.990 
four videos about this we're gonna see
how<00:00:36.059> far<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.630> diverge<00:00:37.260> our<00:00:37.649> eyes<00:00:38.070> okay

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
how far we can diverge our eyes okay

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.180 
how far we can diverge our eyes okay
that<00:00:39.239> means<00:00:39.390> separate<00:00:40.050> our<00:00:40.379> eyes<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:41.100> know

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
that means separate our eyes you know

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.490 
that means separate our eyes you know
the<00:00:41.219> opposite<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.760> crossing<00:00:42.360> your<00:00:42.480> eyes<00:00:42.660> you

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the opposite of crossing your eyes you

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.459 
the opposite of crossing your eyes you
know<00:00:43.649> diverge<00:00:44.280> or<00:00:44.870> spread<00:00:45.870> out<00:00:46.050> your<00:00:46.260> eyes

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
know diverge or spread out your eyes

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.180 
know diverge or spread out your eyes
okay<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.550> what<00:00:47.700> I've<00:00:47.820> got<00:00:47.850> here<00:00:48.770> is<00:00:49.770> I've<00:00:49.950> got

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
okay so what I've got here is I've got

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.040 
okay so what I've got here is I've got
two<00:00:52.969> white<00:00:53.969> circles<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> guess<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.930> could

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
two white circles so I guess you could

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.160 
two white circles so I guess you could
call<00:00:55.079> them<00:00:55.379> okay<00:00:56.420> I'm<00:00:57.420> using<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.870> program

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
call them okay I'm using a program

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.139 
call them okay I'm using a program
called<00:00:58.410> orphaned<00:00:59.129> view<00:00:59.399> by<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.640> way<00:00:59.789> but

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
called orphaned view by the way but

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.979 
called orphaned view by the way but
anyway<00:01:00.570> just<00:01:00.750> two<00:01:01.440> circles<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.750> I'm<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:03.930> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
to take a ruler and measure it and like

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.229 
to take a ruler and measure it and like
I<00:03:51.810> say<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.079> is<00:03:52.260> my<00:03:52.290> first<00:03:52.709> video<00:03:52.980> here<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:53.639> you

I don't have the other camera set up but
I'm<00:04:11.609> I'm<00:04:11.879> measuring<00:04:12.629> this<00:04:12.989> with<00:04:13.199> a<00:04:13.230> real<00:04:13.530> ruler

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
I'm I'm measuring this with a real ruler

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.699 
I'm I'm measuring this with a real ruler
so<00:04:14.459> about<00:04:14.879> four<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.269> a<00:04:15.359> half<00:04:15.389> inches<00:04:15.870> so<00:04:16.079> what

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
so about four and a half inches so what

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.759 
so about four and a half inches so what
I<00:04:16.739> did<00:04:16.979> is<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.780> went<00:04:18.780> from<00:04:18.900> about<00:04:19.349> two<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.709> a

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
I did is I went from about two and a

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.219 
I did is I went from about two and a
half<00:04:19.829> inches<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.849> four<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.659> half<00:04:21.690> inches

half inches to four and a half inches
separation<00:04:23.039> and

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
separation and

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.420 
separation and
that's<00:04:26.039> I<00:04:26.520> would<00:04:26.699> call<00:04:26.909> my<00:04:27.259> maximum

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
that's I would call my maximum

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.719 
that's I would call my maximum
comfortable<00:04:29.430> amount<00:04:29.909> of<00:04:31.129> divergence<00:04:32.129> oh<00:04:32.250> oh<00:04:32.460> I

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
comfortable amount of divergence oh oh I

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.570 
comfortable amount of divergence oh oh I
need<00:04:32.909> to<00:04:32.939> measure<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.419> distance<00:04:34.580> okay

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
need to measure the distance okay

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.779 
need to measure the distance okay
where's<00:04:35.939> my<00:04:36.210> other<00:04:37.580> yardstick<00:04:38.580> here

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
where's my other yardstick here

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.529 
where's my other yardstick here
somewhere<00:04:39.150> okay<00:04:39.360> here<00:04:40.080> we<00:04:40.169> go<00:04:40.259> okay<00:04:40.650> now<00:04:41.610> this

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
somewhere okay here we go okay now this

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.600 
somewhere okay here we go okay now this
is<00:04:42.599> approximate<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.949> know<00:04:44.039> we<00:04:44.189> can<00:04:44.310> get<00:04:44.430> down

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
is approximate you know we can get down

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.369 
is approximate you know we can get down
to<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.819> nitty-gritty<00:04:45.090> later<00:04:45.569> but<00:04:46.490> I<00:04:47.900> am<00:04:48.900> real

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
to the nitty-gritty later but I am real

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:54.050 
to the nitty-gritty later but I am real
close<00:04:50.009> to<00:04:50.400> being<00:04:51.500> three<00:04:52.500> feet<00:04:52.919> away<00:04:53.189> from<00:04:53.460> my

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
close to being three feet away from my

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.330 
close to being three feet away from my
monitor<00:04:55.009> okay

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
monitor okay

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.010 
monitor okay
that's<00:04:56.810> 1224<00:04:57.810> yep<00:04:58.500> three<00:04:59.280> feet<00:04:59.659> so<00:05:00.659> when<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:00.900> sat

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
that's 1224 yep three feet so when I sat

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.230 
that's 1224 yep three feet so when I sat
back<00:05:01.469> and<00:05:01.530> relaxed<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.370> did<00:05:02.550> this<00:05:02.699> experiment

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
back and relaxed and did this experiment

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.159 
back and relaxed and did this experiment
I<00:05:03.539> was<00:05:03.659> about<00:05:03.930> three<00:05:04.349> feet<00:05:04.940> away<00:05:05.940> from<00:05:06.930> these

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
I was about three feet away from these

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.129 
I was about three feet away from these
dots<00:05:08.030> so<00:05:09.030> we<00:05:09.270> should<00:05:09.509> be<00:05:09.539> able<00:05:09.719> to<00:05:09.840> come<00:05:10.110> up

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
dots so we should be able to come up

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.939 
dots so we should be able to come up
with<00:05:11.509> you<00:05:12.509> know<00:05:12.629> an<00:05:12.870> angle<00:05:13.319> or<00:05:13.440> something<00:05:13.770> here

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
with you know an angle or something here

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.070 
with you know an angle or something here
to<00:05:14.039> figure<00:05:14.219> out<00:05:14.460> how<00:05:14.909> far<00:05:15.180> I<00:05:15.479> can<00:05:15.719> comfortably

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
to figure out how far I can comfortably

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.070 
to figure out how far I can comfortably
diverge<00:05:16.830> my<00:05:17.099> eyes<00:05:17.340> okay<00:05:18.270> so<00:05:18.419> anyway<00:05:18.900> this<00:05:18.990> is

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
diverge my eyes okay so anyway this is

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.809 
diverge my eyes okay so anyway this is
the<00:05:19.139> first<00:05:19.379> video<00:05:19.590> and<00:05:22.310> we'll<00:05:23.310> go<00:05:23.490> on<00:05:23.669> from

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:23.819 
the first video and we'll go on from

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:26.840 
the first video and we'll go on from
here<00:05:23.909> see<00:05:24.389> what<00:05:24.509> happens
