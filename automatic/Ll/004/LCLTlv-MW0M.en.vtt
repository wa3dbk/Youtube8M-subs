00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.749 
even the coast but still in the Pacific
Northwest<00:01:21.860> you<00:01:22.860> don't<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> luxury<00:01:23.430> of

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
Northwest you don't get the luxury of

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.320 
Northwest you don't get the luxury of
having<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.390> full<00:01:24.600> moon<00:01:25.430> being<00:01:26.430> her<00:01:26.759> clarity

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
having the full moon being her clarity

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.319 
having the full moon being her clarity
all<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.869> time<00:01:28.080> usually<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.710> cloudy<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.520> it

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
all the time usually it's cloudy so it

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.270 
all the time usually it's cloudy so it
really<00:01:30.780> adds<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:32.130> extra<00:01:33.259> magical

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
really adds that extra magical

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.230 
really adds that extra magical
perspective<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.670> because<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.119> not

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
perspective to it because it's not

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880 
perspective to it because it's not
something<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.810> happens<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.320> time<00:01:37.439> so

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
something that happens all the time so

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.980 
something that happens all the time so
you<00:01:37.979> don't<00:01:38.009> take<00:01:38.430> advantage<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
you don't take advantage of the

special<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:56.329> when<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.469> really

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
special and when you do that it really

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.889 
special and when you do that it really
really<00:01:59.579> makes<00:01:59.939> things<00:02:00.210> even<00:02:00.390> more<00:02:00.540> magical

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
really makes things even more magical

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.690 
really makes things even more magical
makes<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.590> feel<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.890> tune<00:02:02.130> with<00:02:02.310> them<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
makes you feel in tune with them and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.670 
makes you feel in tune with them and
allows<00:02:02.969> your<00:02:03.210> energy<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.810> connect<00:02:04.170> with<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.500> it

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
allows your energy to connect with in it

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.499 
allows your energy to connect with in it
and<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.340> think<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.909> extremely

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
and I think that it's extremely

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.359 
and I think that it's extremely
important<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.049> do<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.770> when<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.160> talks

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
important to do that so when it talks

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.680 
important to do that so when it talks
about<00:02:08.489> cleansing<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.209> content

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
about cleansing and content
