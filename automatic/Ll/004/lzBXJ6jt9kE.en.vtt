00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.299
Hello! This is Cynthia Sue Larson with RealityShifters.com. For the last sixteen years, I've been publishing first-hand reports of reality

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.640
shifts, quantum jumps, alternate histories,
alternate memories, and pretty much

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.230
whatever way you want to describe this huge phenomenon in which it looks like

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.679
reality is literally changed from one
thing to another with no physically

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:35.500
classically understood mechanism for
what just transpired. So today, I'm

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.200
planning to present a couple of
phenomenon that have come to public

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.980
attention recently:

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:51.199
namely the Berenstain Bears spelled
either B-e-r-e-n-s-t-A-i-n or s-t-E-i-n. I remember it

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.070
with the "ein" from my childhood, and that
has created quite a bit of recent news

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.329
media coverage. Not just me, but lots of
people are talking about this. It

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.189
showed up recently on MTV, Seventeen
magazine, and a number of other places along

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.630
with something called the "Mandela Effect," which started being reported pretty

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.460
widely back in 2011, when a website was created to talk about that.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.260
That was Fiona Broome's website. These
stories about people remembering things

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.510
differently than what the official story
is--with Nelson Mandela, the official

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.860
story is that he passed away just a
couple of years ago.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.600
However, people like myself and
presumably Fiona Broome and lots of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.509
other people, remember Nelson Mandela
passed away while he was incarcerated.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.350
I've done an article and a video on
this, and I have talked about it lots of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.229
times over the years, so those two
experiences--the Berenstain Bears and Nelson

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.330
Mandela--those are two really big news stories recently having to do with reality

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.780
shifts / quantum jumps--but mostly alternate histories, where people just are noticing

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.880
something is different. The Berenstain
Bears I'm talking about look like a

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.750
little family of bears. If they ring a
bell for you, you might have memories from

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.739
your childhood as well--I would love to hear about it. In addition to those pretty big

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.060
example: Berenstain Bears and Nelson Mandela, there's something else that I believe

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.890
will soon be coming into public
awareness and that is America's

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.280
Thanksgiving Thursday. Over the last
couple of years, I've been noticing

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.610
increasing reports coming through my
newsletter and my website, RealityShifters,

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.829
talking about people who do remember
that when they went through school, like I

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.519
remember, Thanksgiving was always on the third Thursday of every November. It

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.350
makes a big difference to me personally,
because I created International Aura

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.340
Awareness Day with a colleague, and when we chose that day, we specifically made

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.079
sure we were avoiding the Thanksgiving
day travel weekend when nobody would be

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.750
wanting to celebrate International Aura
Awareness day, so we chose the fourth

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.060
Thursday of November to avoid the third
Thursday Thanksgiving. Now, apparently, if

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.230
you check online and check history books, you'll see that in this current reality--

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.620
at least at the time and date that I'm
recording this, and for the moment--

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.599
Thanksgiving supposedly has "always been" on fourth Thursday of November. So

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.830
are three examples. The reason I am mentioning this to you, and the reason I look pretty calm

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.790
about it is that I'm not one of those people who says, "Now I can't sleep at night." I've been

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.379
following this phenomenon pretty
intensively for sixteen years. You get

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.409
used to it a little bit, to the point
that when I woke up this morning and had

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.860
my morning cup of coffee, and I read the
New York Times front-page article that

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.930
Oliver Sacks had passed away today,
August 30th, I thought, "Wait a minute! I

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.680
just read the obituary two weeks ago!"  In fact, I didn't need to read the article,

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.579
because I had read it so recently--including seeing a photo of Robin Williams with

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:15.670
Robert DeNiro from the movie "Awakenings,"
which is based on Oliver Sacks' life, that I

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.289
didn't need to read that whole news story
again. So this is the kind of thing

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:25.210
that happens pretty much every day to
me, so it's not just a one-time thing

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.870
of, "Wow! Look at the Berenstain Bears!"
or, "Oh my goodness! Nelson Mandela died

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.400
again?!"  Now it's Oliver Sacks is dying
again. That's what I woke up to. And then

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.880
it's also experiences such as earrrings
like this. So in my everyday life--

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.349
I'm mentioning the earring here in
particular because I was wearing it on

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:51.710
one of the days--it was Friday--at the
Foundations of Mind conference. There was a

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.030
dialogue of worldviews being held at UC
Berkeley. I'd had lunch that day and

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.139
spoken with a fellow colleague, Dr.
Beverly Rubik. She told me about how

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.340
when her dog had passed away and she
buried it, she'd heard bells ringing. So

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.479
that was at lunch time during the
conference. That same day, Friday, I was

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:16.160
walking to my car, and I was with a
friend when I noticed my earring was not in my ear.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.620
I should have two of them that match,  obviously, but I had lost one.  So I waved her on and said, "Let me

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.320
take a look for this."  I went into a
meditative state, which is something you

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.820
can do when reality does change this much around a person, so it is useful.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:37.910
I became quite relaxed, energized, and
grounded, and felt like I was walking

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.520
with my dog who had passed away a few months ago. I'd been talking with Beverly about

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.290
my dog--that's why she told me about hers. When she told me that she'd heard bells

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.360
ringing when her dog died, I thought, "That would be amazing! I never did hear

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.340
something like that." So I am imagining that my dog is with me, and he's good at finding lost

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.600
things. I thought, "Well, I need help
now," and I hear the Campanile bells on

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.650
the UC campus ringing, which is amazing! Because there is beautiful music right when I happened to

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.320
be there, looking for this earring. I don't
find the earring, although I spent about

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.320
20 to 30 minutes in a beautiful state of
love and blissed-out, happy, meditative awareness, which

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.420
felt terrific. I felt like I had an
experience to walk my dog again. So I met

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.840
up with friends and went to the reception
for the Foundations of Mind conference,

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.450
which was wonderful. I got to see Beverly again. And then I went home, and when I got home,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:37.380
I changed my clothing and put on my nightgown. And what I found fall out of my clothing,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.690
in a place that there's no way it could
have been, was this earring. So now I have

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.590
both earrings back. And part of that
process that I've written about so many

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.540
times over the years--when you need to
find something that's lost, it can show

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.700
up even when there's no way that it
really could be there. This is what I

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.940
call evidence of Quantum Logic in the
natural world, which is the paper that I

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.419
presented at the conference, and the idea
behind all of this quantum logic--you

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:09.870
might think in terms of Ockham's Razor--William of Ockham, for example, is what that

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:16.720
saying is based on. It comes from
this phrase in Latin:

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.980
"Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate." What that translates to is: "entities should not be

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.340
multiplied unnecessarily." I was looking
that up, and

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.770
came to find out that now there's a myth
apparently, about this being Ockham's

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.060
razor at all, because even though his
words were cited so many times by so

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.930
many ancient scholars, that nobody can
currently find the original proof that

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.410
he wrote those words to begin with. 
This is the perfect closing for this wonderful

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:48.860
subject, which is all about quantum logic
being fundamental in the natural world.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.790
So when you realize the past and
present can change, and

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:58.100
they often, then you can know that
it's up to us to bring conscious

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.580
attention and awareness to what truly
matters most to us. So until next time,

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.640
keep asking, "How good can it get?" This is Cynthia Sue Larson with RealityShifters.com
