00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.520
 here we are with this new video today 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.649
 guys are here with this new video 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.330
 particular at night this time at 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.429
 contrary to the last on call of duty 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.110
 because I am like 3 am I have to 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.490
 being able to do this blog 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.220
 by tomorrow to be able to reassemble the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.380
 video let me have it in time I will talk to you 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.029
 today of technical destinies has already dealt with 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.890
 very nice to dress a couple of days ago 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.810
 so I will treat you a little in a way 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.029
 particular since in any case we are 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.519
 have both been involved in one 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.730
 beautiful evening Monday evening for 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.290
 try and record the game live 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.510
 and therefore also capture the gameplay and 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.129
 being able to propose it that evening there I have 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.020
 I said something different then 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.149
 let's try a little live 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.730
 improvised put the microphone in his pocket 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.620
 which in the shirt and tom and on 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.870
 camcorder and then you will see in the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.910
 background images also my face 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.890
 cannes and probably during the video 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.690
 you will not be even some reaction that 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.340
 outside of what I then do 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.910
 I will tell throughout this 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.469
 video 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.020
 I will therefore try to talk to you about things 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.739
 that struck me particularly 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.809
 most of this title 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.750
 first of all the thing that has me most 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.909
 impressed is because I still had way 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.409
 to investigate with a couple of 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.380
 developers who were there 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.600
 at the event is the new concept of this 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.009
 destiny that mixes the single very well 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.140
 player with multiplayer indeed 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.000
 we tried to play a campaign 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.740
 by yourself, start doing everything wrong 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.630
 some mission and then a moment 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.600
 to the other they could interact with i 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.460
 our online companions and make them become 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.409
 the single player and multiplayer do 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.180
 become a coop so much 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.369
 snapshots indeed I played from before 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.530
 only then are he also adds grace and 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.259
 eni battle and we did the same 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.780
 mission by adding each other to each other 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.790
 even when a game alone anyway 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.920
 and during its path while walking 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.810
 for the map other players online 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.549
 the whole world that maybe travel 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.409
 its the same path that they make the 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.299
 depending on the moment I am in that part 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.830
 of the flower map given ghana distance 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.479
 that anyway that I noticed the appeal 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.369
 which is something really in the middle 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.430
 a couple are really trying 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.080
 in a month and all this is really a lot 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.940
 nice very interesting though 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.100
 however one can still play 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.840
 quietly without being disturbed 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.370
 from other users because anyway if you 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.650
 You don't want to interact. You don't have to 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.610
 do it beyond the compa obviously 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.880
 there is also the whole section of 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.620
 multiplayer player versus player that is 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.459
 team challenges is not ready type a 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.170
 domain 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.750
 where you can safely play in 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:31.250
 tim against other online players ori e 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.250
 lifeless care I was 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.359
 he's there under the cock 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.390
 but go to die 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.310
 at the gameplay level it is a title that 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.230
 very much remembers the style of halo i 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.260
 colors are still very lively and the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.730
 graphics really impact us when 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.560
 they have to be tried they have remained a little mouth 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.360
 all open to your cock that that 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.560
 really nice graphics 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.300
 as regards the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.860
 configuration of the various characters yes 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.660
 can choose while types of 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.110
 characters at the beginning that are the 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.150
 warrior the sorcerer magician and the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.069
 footballer or has a ter as it was written 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.420
 in English at that time from ethan hunt 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.800
 i was whitelock my titan character 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.120
 because all three are bad 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.920
 however of the very characteristics 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.860
 different from each other for example 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.840
 the warrior what I chose 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.650
 it was called titan and the ship a big one 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.470
 ability to shoot with those weapons 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.060
 rifles while maybe one more sorcerer 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.470
 magical abilities because in this game 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.150
 there is also reason in life 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.150
 of life specials that you can 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.380
 unlock during the campaign 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.299
 you can customize the adventure 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.340
 the whole character is for how much 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.530
 regards the physical aspect the appearance the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.440
 face and physical characteristics both 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.530
 also for the development of skills that 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.510
 can earn throughout history 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.489
 as I told you at the beginning the maps are 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.160
 really the kids places so for 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.760
 to be able to cover them in a much longer time 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.799
 short 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.359
 you can use vehicles at the beginning 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.310
 I didn't understand where the vehicles were 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.019
 because I saw gabbo that darted at me 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.479
 right to left then a certain point me 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.000
 I realized that the vehicle could be a car 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.460
 create you can go to the menu with the key 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.320
 central and call your vehicle 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.169
 so that you can drive instantly 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.240
 and travel large and large routes 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.310
 parts of the map in a short time too 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.229
 because this saying let's remember it is a 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.169
 fps openworld so the maps will be 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.220
 really immense to go there just in 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.630
 I go around with vehicles 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.090
 in most cases where you don't 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.220
 never comes where we need to get there and then 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.440
 search for missions and take them to 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.150
 term either by themselves or with 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.710
 help from friends or any other 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.180
 online player you want to invite 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.980
 in their own game for how long 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.810
 it's about the actual gameplay I have it 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.540
 found quite particular beyond 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.600
 of the super magic jumps is worth that yes 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.670
 they can launch with particular powers 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.930
 unlockable during the upgrade 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.600
 of your character 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.040
 I noticed that at the target level i 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.320
 travel is a bit difficult 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.630
 initially to get carried away since 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.160
 when you're at speed when you run 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.110
 for example, turn right left 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.270
 with mine it slows down compared to when 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.650
 one is still and one can perhaps admire more 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.450
 quickly then brittle 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.400
 surely it will be something to which 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.080
 you will have to get used to the time 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.240
 first times because it is not very easy 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.560
 intuitive though still once 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.660
 already after half an hour of play we were 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.400
 by playing you could easily 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.430
 manage have mastery of 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.430
 situation 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.819
 if I'm not mistaken 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.090
 all in all I have to say that he plays 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.050
 particularly impressed that it could 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.750
 to be really very interesting 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.819
 also because in any case it is a development that 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.069
 the producers have now lasted four years 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.289
 bungie guys are 94 years there 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:05.569
 they hold so much is a title of 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.699
 prominent for activision together with the call of 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:10.819
 duty advanced warfare and then 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:12.139
 surely you can close something 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:13.639
 very particular 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.349
 we can all see him later 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.629
 to see you too probably i 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.789
 owners of playstation 4 because from 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:21.470
 Friday morning Thursday evening until 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.539
 Monday there will be the possibility of having 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.000
 access to the open alfa the same 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:27.590
 in other words we have tried 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.690
 at the event here in los angeles then 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.699
 probably those who want can already from 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:35.449
 this weekend put your hands on the game 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:37.840
 and make some of my own how 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:37.840
 truzzo 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.379
 It is on the corner 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.379
 all 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:48.089
 I can understand 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.910
 is a game of damage in the end I do not see 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.560
 said this guy for today too 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.270
 all video excerpts you enjoyed i 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.090
 tried to put some nice clips 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.190
 some small reactions a bit of mine 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.510
 thoughts in short this game in the case 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.830
 something more was not good 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.540
 also the cable wine that came out a 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.430
 couple of days ago on his channel then 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.320
 if you want to pass see it also on 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.850
 channel, however, of all guys who are 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.980
 really doing everything possible to do 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.780
 come all the videos we manage to 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.760
 do and all the news that we can 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.050
 give you this experience of the pd 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.090
 letters that really something 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.890
 fantastic I remind you there was a nice me 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.390
 like a little comment below and there 

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.580
 see you soon with so many others 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.740

 but not all of them next time 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.160
