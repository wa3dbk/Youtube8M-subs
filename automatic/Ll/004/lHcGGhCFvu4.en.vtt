00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
move down to Rend so basically this is

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.090 
move down to Rend so basically this is
going<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.030> make<00:00:54.210> enemies<00:00:54.510> bleed<00:00:55.199> which<00:00:55.890> is

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
going to make enemies bleed which is

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.860 
going to make enemies bleed which is
very<00:00:56.309> important<00:00:56.789> let's<00:00:57.120> move<00:00:57.360> down<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> this

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
very important let's move down to this

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.490 
very important let's move down to this
one<00:00:58.079> now<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> most<00:01:00.469> helpful<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
one now so this is the most helpful and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.219 
one now so this is the most helpful and
useful<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.460> health<00:01:03.149> regeneration<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.080> is

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
useful for health regeneration this is

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.980 
useful for health regeneration this is
called<00:01:04.470> bloodlust<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.700> basically<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
called bloodlust so basically for the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.620 
called bloodlust so basically for the
amount<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.500> time<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.000> character<00:01:09.420> bleeds

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
amount of time that the character bleeds

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.899 
amount of time that the character bleeds
for<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.080> are<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.650> receive<00:01:10.979> health<00:01:11.580> so

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
for you are going to receive health so

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.149 
for you are going to receive health so
we're<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> add<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.869> 5<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:14.070> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
we're going to add that to 5 so it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.240 
we're going to add that to 5 so it
regenerates<00:01:14.760> 4%<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.689> max<00:01:15.930> health<00:01:16.229> per<00:01:16.650> second

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
regenerates 4% of max health per second

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.810 
regenerates 4% of max health per second
of<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.750> bleeding<00:01:18.750> enemy<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.470> basically<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.159> long

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
of a bleeding enemy so basically as long

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.039 
of a bleeding enemy so basically as long
as<00:01:21.000> you're<00:01:21.150> making<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.420> enemy<00:01:21.659> bleed<00:01:21.900> and

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
as you're making the enemy bleed and

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:22.940 
as you're making the enemy bleed and
jumping<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.350> his<00:01:22.439> face

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
jumping in his face

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.880 
jumping in his face
you<00:01:23.759> will<00:01:23.970> almost<00:01:24.299> never<00:01:24.600> run<00:01:25.200> down<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.409> health

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
you will almost never run down of health

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.300 
you will almost never run down of health
so<00:01:26.670> anyways<00:01:26.939> let's<00:01:27.150> move<00:01:27.240> over<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:28.310> tier

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
so anyways let's move over to tier

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.069 
so anyways let's move over to tier

very high target so basically guys let's
take<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.140> look<00:01:46.320> at<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.770> game<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.210> when

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
take a look at this in game so when

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.639 
take a look at this in game so when
you're<00:01:48.540> actually<00:01:48.780> attacking<00:01:48.869> an<00:01:49.470> enemy

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
you're actually attacking an enemy

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.200 
you're actually attacking an enemy
you're<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.310> want<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.520> jump<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.030> you're

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
you're going to want to jump and you're

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.760 
you're going to want to jump and you're
always<00:01:51.360> going<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.810> want<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.140> dash<00:01:52.320> towards

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
always going to want to dash towards

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410 
always going to want to dash towards
them<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.100> start<00:01:53.369> knifing<00:01:53.729> them<00:01:53.850> off<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.240> bat

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
them and start knifing them off the bat

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.940 
them and start knifing them off the bat
because<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.049> want<00:01:55.290> them<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> start<00:01:55.740> bleeding

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
because you want them to start bleeding

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.530 
because you want them to start bleeding
so<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.340> always<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:56.850> health<00:01:57.060> regeneration

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
so you always have health regeneration
