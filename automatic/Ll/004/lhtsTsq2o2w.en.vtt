00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
fuel LED red LEDs that will start

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.540 
fuel LED red LEDs that will start
flashing<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.470> blinking<00:01:04.500> when<00:01:04.980> you<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.430> too

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
system and the dashboard is exactly the

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.620 
system and the dashboard is exactly the
same<00:01:47.440> like<00:01:47.680> in<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.070> 80s<00:01:48.820> so<00:01:49.210> you<00:01:49.300> can<00:01:49.420> say

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
same like in the 80s so you can say

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.680 
same like in the 80s so you can say
projected<00:01:49.990> media<00:01:50.200> as<00:01:50.290> well<00:01:50.820> screen<00:01:51.820> is<00:01:52.120> same

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
projected media as well screen is same

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.230 
projected media as well screen is same

of<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.810> doubt<00:02:59.960> which<00:03:00.710> I<00:03:00.980> read<00:03:01.160> life<00:03:01.400> can<00:03:01.610> make<00:03:01.760> is

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
of a doubt which I read life can make is

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.170 
of a doubt which I read life can make is
the<00:03:02.030> driving<00:03:02.240> much<00:03:02.510> more<00:03:02.690> comfortable<00:03:04.180> that

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
the driving much more comfortable that

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.670 
the driving much more comfortable that
is<00:03:05.630> faced<00:03:05.990> in<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.170> back<00:03:06.290> there's<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.560> lot
