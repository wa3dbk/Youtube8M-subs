00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:06.410
 we were talking from below that you know has 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:09.049
 presented the most common mistakes to the 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.480
 time to make a diet the most error 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:15.599
 common is doctor what do you think d 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.810
 or even in the circle of people who 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.090
 works with me different institutions 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.009
 you know there is a material going through everything 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.380
 that has to do with a treatment 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.869
 to spend but always the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.210
 He asks what he thinks of and things appear 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.400
 new innovative things but they are new 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.589
 they are novel they are picturesque and they are 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.629
 recontra trout but not all look that 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:40.079
 it costs so much money it must be 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.489
 well, it's not good or it's all 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.800
 treatments to lose weight is the son of 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.170
 you will look for antibiotics in some 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.489
 Argentine society of infectology there 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.780
 are the list of antibiotics that 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.300
 exist then you say good 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.149
 appeared my land said that there is one 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.489
 new and where did your good day say it 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.449
 that there is 19 good not there is where the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.269
 error is the search for a solution 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.910
 magic or secret or that it appeared that 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.350
 they say that some people use it and that some 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.390
 it does them good but nobody knows who 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.640
 says he wants are few or who 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.340
 it makes them well said which we pass on to 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.500
 next point one of the problems is 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.920
 eliminate the hydrates are excluded 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.680
 pasta 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.990
 the bread the potato the sweet potato or the corn 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.970
 it happens to you totally that increases the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.530
 anxiety that gives compulsive response or 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.509
 be the people have more desire to eat 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.119
 the 4 completely eliminates a food 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.830
 thing that you can do for 12 days but it's 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.740
 a thing that what can not sustain 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.880
 when you eat pasta without salads 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.100
 for example eat the pasta without 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.590
 pre-salad or vegetable salad 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.570
 or add very greasy sauces like 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.700
 we were talking last week the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.430
 pasta itself is not what produces a 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.680
 obesity 300 calories per each for each 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.900
 plate after what one adds no 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.010
 measure the oil a spoonful of dessert 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.440
 it's 90 calories 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.540
 then measure carefully at the time of 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.090
 spice up a very common mistake I 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.970
 I start to crack a good salad that 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.040
 churrasco how many fats of churrasco and 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.290
 how much oil would the salad say because 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.920
 I can go from 400 to 500 calories according to 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.750
 says with salad up to 1,000 or 1,200 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.670
 depends on the size of the steak the quality of 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.560
 fat that the steak has 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.849
 and the amount of oil says and the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.100
 amount of oil that I put to 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.020
 will launch another error 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.340
 all integral products are light 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.740
 in the level of interior products are 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.990
 beneficial because they are rich in fiber and 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.910
 they give more anxiety but they have almost the same 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.230
 calories than refined products or 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.110
 it is important to measure your consumption 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.480
 get more acidic but if you eat the 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.640
 same amount because you're still giving 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.350
 because people are programmed by volume 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.910
 not by society remember that a 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.610
 person who has the problem of 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.680
 overweight is not usually handled with the 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.300
 satiety is usually handled with what you 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.670
 they serve with what tempts you with what 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.410
 is in sight but satiety is 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.740
 a clockwork mechanism that is a 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.870
 little bit chewed and eat 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.100
 fast chew little eat fast do not you 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.560
 record what you are eating because 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.200
 It takes 15 minutes to get to the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.480
 instruction to the brain perform one or 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.400
 two meals per day is reached with more 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.590
 hungry that food increases insulin in 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.540
 the blood and by increasing the disunited as 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.060
 response to that meal increases the 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.700
 amount of fat pretend to go down very 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.860
 fast if it goes down abruptly it's 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.100
 difficult to hold it and then it turns to 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.630
 climb bashar progressively is better 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.470
 progressively is not that there is no 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.780
 go down 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.170
 the faster it gets off very much 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.140
 time that more makes the effect possible 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.490
 bounce here we have good a fake 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.410
 Attribution to messages happens 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.770
 They are good but they have been from Ghassan 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.110
 relax, you can tone, you can do 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.120
 get the fluid out of your legs but in 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.010
 yes they do not lose weight the same as the sashes 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.230
 is that they get when an activity 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.300
 physics more in summer maybe they know how to lose 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.650
 more liquid but the liquid is not fat 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.840
 those who are fat have fat and do not 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.650
 they have swelling does the activity 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.990
 physical 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.270
 think that only with physical activity one 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.740
 You can lose weight but you have to remember 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.810
 that two separate chicken have 400 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.140
 calories just as in walking one hour 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.820
 more or less it is exactly the same if 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.620
 we continue doing what you have always done 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.600
 continue its having done what 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.310
 you have always obtained to get something 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.700
 different you have to start doing 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.700
 something different good thank you 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.120
 pause
