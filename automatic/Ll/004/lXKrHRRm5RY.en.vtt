00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.670 

you<00:01:58.980> count<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.400> out<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.700> one<00:02:00.350> two<00:02:01.760> three<00:02:03.440> okay

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
instead of the second half of the fourth

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:15.290 
instead of the second half of the fourth
bar<00:03:00.990> for<00:03:01.990> example<00:03:02.050> of<00:03:02.380> this<00:03:04.530> three

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
gonna do this little thing so we're

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.200 
gonna do this little thing so we're
going<00:05:27.210> into<00:05:27.420> this<00:05:27.570> e<00:05:27.840> seven<00:05:28.730> but<00:05:29.730> we<00:05:29.760> started

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
going into this e seven but we started

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.130 
going into this e seven but we started
for<00:05:30.360> what<00:05:30.540> a<00:05:30.570> step<00:05:30.960> above<00:05:32.690> so<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:33.720> whole<00:05:33.930> thing

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
for what a step above so the whole thing

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:43.010 
for what a step above so the whole thing
sounds<00:05:34.290> like<00:05:34.470> this<00:05:41.210> now<00:05:42.210> you<00:05:42.270> can<00:05:42.540> also<00:05:42.690> do

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
sounds like this now you can also do

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.700 
sounds like this now you can also do
this<00:05:43.170> instead<00:05:43.740> of<00:05:45.860> you<00:05:46.860> can<00:05:47.010> do
