thing<00:00:23.099> we<00:00:23.189> need<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.369> do<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:23.700> the<00:00:23.820> all-access

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
thing we need to do with the all-access

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.550 
thing we need to do with the all-access
is<00:00:24.810> do<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> factory<00:00:26.160> reset<00:00:26.929> this<00:00:27.929> ensures<00:00:28.410> that

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
is do a factory reset this ensures that

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.259 
is do a factory reset this ensures that
we're<00:00:28.830> all<00:00:28.980> working<00:00:29.369> from<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.759> same<00:00:29.939> place

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
we're all working from the same place

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.630 
we're all working from the same place
and<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:31.320> also<00:00:31.349> happens<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.309> factory

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
and it also happens that the factory

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.250 
and it also happens that the factory
reset<00:00:32.790> settings<00:00:33.360> are<00:00:33.480> pretty<00:00:33.510> close<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.110> what

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
reset settings are pretty close to what

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.430 
reset settings are pretty close to what
we<00:00:34.290> need<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:34.769> the<00:00:34.860> RG<00:00:35.129> 16<00:00:35.780> to<00:00:36.780> do<00:00:36.900> this<00:00:37.140> first

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
we need for the RG 16 to do this first

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.340

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
you have other MIDI effects processes

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.770 
you have other MIDI effects processes
you<00:03:31.790> could<00:03:31.940> use<00:03:32.090> those<00:03:32.269> switches<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.750> control

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
you could use those switches to control

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.140 
you could use those switches to control
the<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.859> other<00:03:34.010> processor<00:03:34.640> instead<00:03:36.970> now<00:03:37.970> that

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
the the other processor instead now that

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.940 
the the other processor instead now that
we've<00:03:38.239> done<00:03:38.390> this<00:03:38.630> we<00:03:38.989> can<00:03:39.109> exit<00:03:39.440> setup<00:03:39.650> mode

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
we've done this we can exit setup mode

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.729 
we've done this we can exit setup mode
pressing<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.120> second<00:03:41.480> button<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:41.930> now<00:03:42.709> we

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
pressing the second button and now we

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.170 
pressing the second button and now we
can<00:03:43.010> test<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.310> make<00:03:43.459> sure<00:03:43.519> that<00:03:43.819> these<00:03:43.940> buttons

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
can test to make sure that these buttons

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.509 
can test to make sure that these buttons
are<00:03:44.450> actually<00:03:44.569> controlling<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.290> RG<00:03:45.620> 16<00:03:46.069> so

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
are actually controlling the RG 16 so

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.509 
are actually controlling the RG 16 so
let's<00:03:46.700> turn<00:03:46.880> on<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.090> first<00:03:47.389> loop<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:49.310> third

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
let's turn on the first loop the third

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.990 
let's turn on the first loop the third
loop<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:50.510> fifth<00:03:50.750> loop<00:03:51.019> and<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:52.130> a<00:03:52.160> flute<00:03:53.260> and

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
loop the fifth loop and the a flute and

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.580 
loop the fifth loop and the a flute and
looking<00:03:56.000> at<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.150> RG<00:03:56.420> 16<00:03:56.810> you<00:03:57.019> can<00:03:57.139> see<00:03:57.350> that

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
looking at the RG 16 you can see that

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.770 
looking at the RG 16 you can see that
that's<00:03:57.769> exactly<00:03:58.250> what<00:03:58.370> we've<00:03:58.519> done<00:03:58.780> we've

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
that's exactly what we've done we've

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.210 
that's exactly what we've done we've
turn<00:04:00.019> down<00:04:00.170> those<00:04:00.350> loops<00:04:02.769> now<00:04:03.769> that<00:04:03.920> we've<00:04:04.040> set

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
turn down those loops now that we've set

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.620 
turn down those loops now that we've set
up<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.400> instant<00:04:04.760> access<00:04:04.880> buttons<00:04:05.359> we<00:04:05.510> can

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
up the instant access buttons we can

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.080 
up the instant access buttons we can
start<00:04:05.870> setting<00:04:06.049> up<00:04:06.200> our<00:04:06.350> presets<00:04:06.910> we'll<00:04:07.910> set

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
start setting up our presets we'll set

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.780 
start setting up our presets we'll set
up<00:04:08.120> three<00:04:08.389> presets<00:04:08.870> for<00:04:09.019> this<00:04:09.170> demonstration

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
up three presets for this demonstration

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.129 
up three presets for this demonstration
the<00:04:10.790> first<00:04:11.030> one<00:04:11.269> we<00:04:11.510> just<00:04:11.690> want<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:11.930> have<00:04:12.049> the

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
the first one we just want to have the

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:13.900 
the first one we just want to have the
chorus<00:04:12.410> pedal<00:04:12.709> on<00:04:12.859> so<00:04:13.280> we'll<00:04:13.400> press<00:04:13.549> number

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
chorus pedal on so we'll press number

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.170 
chorus pedal on so we'll press number
one<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:15.190> then<00:04:16.190> we'll<00:04:16.400> turn<00:04:16.549> on<00:04:16.729> our<00:04:16.880> chorus

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
one and then we'll turn on our chorus

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.879 
one and then we'll turn on our chorus
pedal<00:04:17.479> which<00:04:17.630> happens<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.139> be<00:04:18.289> in<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.680> fifth

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
pedal which happens to be in the fifth

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.030 
pedal which happens to be in the fifth
loop

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.090 

and<00:04:23.870> then<00:04:24.870> all<00:04:24.990> we<00:04:25.080> have<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.320> do<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.560> save<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.920> is

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
and then all we have to do to save it is

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.180 
and then all we have to do to save it is
press<00:04:26.400> second<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.060> then<00:04:28.020> 15<00:04:28.860> or<00:04:29.070> ctrl<00:04:29.460> store

press second and then 15 or ctrl store

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.350 
press second and then 15 or ctrl store
so<00:04:32.190> now<00:04:32.340> it's<00:04:32.490> remembered<00:04:32.910> that<00:04:33.090> for<00:04:33.270> the

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
so now it's remembered that for the

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.270 
so now it's remembered that for the
first<00:04:33.570> preset<00:04:34.050> we<00:04:34.290> want<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.590> call<00:04:35.010> up<00:04:35.160> the

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
first preset we want to call up the

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.250 
first preset we want to call up the
chorus<00:04:35.580> pedal<00:04:35.760> now<00:04:36.690> we'll<00:04:36.810> go<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:36.960> number<00:04:37.230> two

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
chorus pedal now we'll go to number two

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.760 
chorus pedal now we'll go to number two
and<00:04:38.720> for<00:04:39.720> this<00:04:39.840> one<00:04:40.080> let's<00:04:40.290> say<00:04:40.440> we<00:04:40.590> want<00:04:40.740> to

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
and for this one let's say we want to

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.190 
and for this one let's say we want to
have<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:40.980> vibe<00:04:41.190> pedal<00:04:41.550> on<00:04:41.720> that<00:04:42.720> happens<00:04:43.050> to

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
have the vibe pedal on that happens to

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.230 
have the vibe pedal on that happens to
be<00:04:43.290> in<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.500> second<00:04:43.860> loop<00:04:44.010> so<00:04:44.880> we'll<00:04:45.000> turn<00:04:45.120> on

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
be in the second loop so we'll turn on

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.710 
be in the second loop so we'll turn on
the<00:04:45.330> second<00:04:45.690> loop<00:04:46.100> press<00:04:47.100> second<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:47.760> then

the second loop press second and then

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.260 
the second loop press second and then
ctrl<00:04:49.080> store<00:04:52.370> next<00:04:53.370> we'll<00:04:53.610> do<00:04:53.730> a<00:04:53.760> third<00:04:54.060> preset

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
ctrl store next we'll do a third preset

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.100 
ctrl store next we'll do a third preset
and<00:04:57.980> for<00:04:58.980> this<00:04:59.070> one<00:04:59.310> what<00:04:59.490> we'll<00:04:59.610> do<00:04:59.790> is<00:05:00.240> turn

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
and for this one what we'll do is turn

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.920 
and for this one what we'll do is turn
on<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:01.590> compressor<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:03.330> delay<00:05:03.600> pedal

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
on the compressor and the delay pedal

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.800 
on the compressor and the delay pedal
the<00:05:04.200> compressor<00:05:04.680> is<00:05:04.800> in<00:05:04.920> the<00:05:05.010> first<00:05:05.220> loop<00:05:05.460> and

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
the compressor is in the first loop and

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.250 
the compressor is in the first loop and
the<00:05:06.810> delay<00:05:07.050> pedal<00:05:07.350> is<00:05:07.440> in<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.620> eighth<00:05:09.260> once

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
the delay pedal is in the eighth once

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.390 
the delay pedal is in the eighth once
again<00:05:10.410> we'll<00:05:10.710> store<00:05:10.980> it

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.220 

now<00:05:17.400> that<00:05:17.580> we've<00:05:17.700> set<00:05:17.910> up<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:18.150> presets<00:05:18.630> for

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
now that we've set up the presets for

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.870 
now that we've set up the presets for
the<00:05:19.320> audio<00:05:19.590> loops<00:05:19.860> now<00:05:20.100> let's<00:05:20.310> do<00:05:20.490> it<00:05:20.640> for<00:05:20.760> the

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
the audio loops now let's do it for the

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.180 
the audio loops now let's do it for the
other<00:05:20.910> side<00:05:21.270> of<00:05:21.390> the<00:05:21.480> RG<00:05:21.780> 16<00:05:22.230> the<00:05:22.800> one<00:05:22.980> that's

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
other side of the RG 16 the one that's

then we see our chorus pedal is still
coming<00:06:08.520> out<00:06:08.640> as<00:06:08.850> before<00:06:09.270> and<00:06:09.570> for<00:06:10.350> this<00:06:10.470> one<00:06:10.620> we

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
coming out as before and for this one we

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.050 
coming out as before and for this one we
just<00:06:10.920> want<00:06:11.100> to<00:06:11.190> keep<00:06:11.340> the<00:06:11.460> clean<00:06:11.670> channel

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
just want to keep the clean channel

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.440 
just want to keep the clean channel
active<00:06:12.420> so<00:06:12.840> we'll<00:06:12.990> leave<00:06:13.110> all<00:06:13.290> of<00:06:13.440> these<00:06:13.560> off

we'll<00:06:15.450> move<00:06:15.570> to<00:06:15.630> number<00:06:15.960> 2<00:06:16.200> and<00:06:17.420> as<00:06:18.420> you<00:06:18.570> see<00:06:18.750> we

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
we'll move to number 2 and as you see we

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.660 
we'll move to number 2 and as you see we
have<00:06:18.900> the<00:06:19.140> vibe<00:06:19.290> pedal<00:06:19.650> up<00:06:19.830> coming<00:06:20.190> up<00:06:20.310> as<00:06:20.490> we

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
have the vibe pedal up coming up as we

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.610 
have the vibe pedal up coming up as we
programmed<00:06:21.180> before<00:06:21.300> but<00:06:21.990> this<00:06:22.110> time<00:06:22.320> we<00:06:22.440> want

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
programmed before but this time we want

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.230 
programmed before but this time we want
to<00:06:22.710> have<00:06:22.860> the<00:06:23.040> overdrive<00:06:23.490> channel<00:06:23.520> of<00:06:23.970> the<00:06:24.090> amp

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
to have the overdrive channel of the amp

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.660 
to have the overdrive channel of the amp
on<00:06:24.450> so<00:06:24.750> we'll<00:06:24.870> press<00:06:25.020> number<00:06:25.350> one<00:06:25.560> and<00:06:25.830> hold

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:26.670 
on so we'll press number one and hold

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.860 
on so we'll press number one and hold
down<00:06:26.880> right<00:06:27.710> and<00:06:29.120> now<00:06:30.120> we've<00:06:30.330> memorized<00:06:30.510> that

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
down right and now we've memorized that

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.600 
down right and now we've memorized that
we<00:06:30.930> want<00:06:31.110> to<00:06:31.200> both<00:06:31.440> turn<00:06:31.740> on<00:06:31.890> this<00:06:32.070> pedal<00:06:32.430> and

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
we want to both turn on this pedal and

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.370 
we want to both turn on this pedal and
this<00:06:32.790> amp<00:06:33.060> channel<00:06:33.510> when<00:06:33.720> we<00:06:33.810> press<00:06:34.050> number

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
this amp channel when we press number

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.370 
this amp channel when we press number
two<00:06:35.180> now<00:06:36.180> we'll<00:06:36.300> go<00:06:36.420> to<00:06:36.450> patch<00:06:36.720> number<00:06:37.080> three

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
two now we'll go to patch number three

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.570 
two now we'll go to patch number three
and<00:06:37.880> for<00:06:38.880> this<00:06:39.030> one<00:06:39.240> we<00:06:40.230> have<00:06:40.440> the<00:06:41.130> compressor

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
and for this one we have the compressor

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.100 
and for this one we have the compressor
in<00:06:41.670> the<00:06:41.760> delay<00:06:42.030> on<00:06:42.060> already<00:06:42.480> and<00:06:42.750> we're<00:06:42.990> going

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
in the delay on already and we're going

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.780 
in the delay on already and we're going
to<00:06:43.140> want<00:06:43.290> to<00:06:43.380> turn<00:06:43.500> on<00:06:43.650> everything<00:06:44.190> we're

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790 
to want to turn on everything we're

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.400 
to want to turn on everything we're
going<00:06:44.880> to<00:06:44.970> turn<00:06:45.150> on<00:06:45.270> the<00:06:45.420> drive<00:06:45.660> the<00:06:46.200> more

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
going to turn on the drive the more

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.010 
going to turn on the drive the more
