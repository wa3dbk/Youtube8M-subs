in<00:00:10.200> competition<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.250> do<00:00:11.849> snatch<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
in competition you do snatch and the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.150 
in competition you do snatch and the
clean<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.460> jerk<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:14.940> they're<00:00:15.120> two<00:00:15.299> different

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
clean and jerk so they're two different

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160 
clean and jerk so they're two different
kind<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.250> events<00:00:17.670> or<00:00:17.820> disciplines<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.990> have

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
kind of events or disciplines you have

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.560 
kind of events or disciplines you have
three<00:00:19.410> attempts<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.130> each<00:00:20.340> discipline<00:00:21.300> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
three attempts for each discipline a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.650 
three attempts for each discipline a
snatch<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.400> more<00:00:23.640> technically<00:00:24.330> difficult

snatch of the more technically difficult

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.700 
snatch of the more technically difficult
you<00:00:25.529> start<00:00:26.090> from<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.240> floor<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.439> wide

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
you start from the floor you have a wide

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.950 
you start from the floor you have a wide
grip<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.970> way<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.510> pull<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> weight

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
grip and the way you pull the weight

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.930 
grip and the way you pull the weight
above<00:00:31.349> your<00:00:31.500> head<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.920> catch<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.700> full

above your head and catch it in a full
squat<00:00:33.329> position<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.440> it's<00:00:34.620> literally<00:00:35.070> from

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
squat position so it's literally from

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.770 
squat position so it's literally from
the<00:00:35.399> floor<00:00:35.730> straight<00:00:36.059> above<00:00:36.210> your<00:00:36.360> head<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the floor straight above your head and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.690 
the floor straight above your head and
then<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:36.989> stand<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:42.950> clean<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.129> jerk<00:00:44.370> you

and<00:00:51.059> then<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.870> jerk<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.640> pushing<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.699> weight

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
and then the jerk is pushing the weight

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:05.999 
and then the jerk is pushing the weight
above<00:00:54.059> your<00:00:54.180> head

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.160 

until<00:01:07.009> normally<00:01:07.580> tower<00:01:07.790> lifters<00:01:08.600> kind<00:01:09.049> of

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
until normally tower lifters kind of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.719 
until normally tower lifters kind of
unformed<00:01:10.540> just<00:01:11.540> by<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.780> confidence<00:01:12.590> in<00:01:12.950> the

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
unformed just by the confidence in the

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.490 
unformed just by the confidence in the
technique<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:14.540> they'll<00:01:14.780> take<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.200> from<00:01:15.380> the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
technique so they'll take it from the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.160 
technique so they'll take it from the
floor<00:01:15.710> nice<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.009> slow<00:01:16.520> they<00:01:16.759> won't<00:01:17.020> wrench<00:01:18.020> it

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
floor nice and slow they won't wrench it

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.380 
floor nice and slow they won't wrench it
off<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.439> floor<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:18.920> it'll<00:01:19.640> be<00:01:19.790> quite<00:01:20.000> quick

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
off the floor and it'll be quite quick

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.779 
off the floor and it'll be quite quick
and<00:01:20.659> powerful<00:01:20.840> through<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.590> middle<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:22.310> then

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
and powerful through the middle and then

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.460 
and powerful through the middle and then
obviously<00:01:22.970> when<00:01:23.360> they<00:01:23.509> receive<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.049> barb<00:01:24.259> of

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
obviously when they receive the barb of

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.380 
obviously when they receive the barb of
the<00:01:24.649> head<00:01:24.890> that<00:01:25.399> arms<00:01:25.700> will<00:01:25.820> be<00:01:25.850> locked<00:01:26.149> out

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
the head that arms will be locked out

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.320 
the head that arms will be locked out
and<00:01:26.720> they'll<00:01:27.229> be<00:01:27.409> very<00:01:27.590> kind<00:01:27.950> of<00:01:28.330> staggering

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
and they'll be very kind of staggering

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.029 
and they'll be very kind of staggering
around<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:30.020> stuff<00:01:30.259> so<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:30.590> would<00:01:30.680> be<00:01:30.799> quite<00:01:31.009> a

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
around and stuff so it would be quite a

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.730 
around and stuff so it would be quite a
solid<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:31.700> dynamic

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.219 

whenever<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.700> bars<00:01:37.909> above<00:01:38.330> your<00:01:38.479> head<00:01:38.630> your

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
whenever the bars above your head your

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.109 
whenever the bars above your head your
elbows<00:01:39.680> have<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.040> be<00:01:40.130> locked<00:01:40.369> out<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:40.940> if

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
elbows have to be locked out so if

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.000 
elbows have to be locked out so if
there's<00:01:41.330> any<00:01:41.479> movement<00:01:41.960> in<00:01:42.080> your<00:01:42.229> elbows<00:01:42.680> then

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
there's any movement in your elbows then

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.219 
there's any movement in your elbows then
that's<00:01:43.190> a<00:01:43.310> no<00:01:43.490> lift<00:01:43.760> when<00:01:44.720> you're<00:01:44.869> cleaning

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
that's a no lift when you're cleaning

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.020 
that's a no lift when you're cleaning
which<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:46.040> where<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.310> catch<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.670> bar<00:01:46.820> on<00:01:46.909> your

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
which is where you catch the bar on your

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.030 
which is where you catch the bar on your
chest<00:01:47.270> if<00:01:47.510> your<00:01:47.960> elbows<00:01:48.350> touch<00:01:48.619> your<00:01:48.830> knees

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
chest if your elbows touch your knees

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.749 
chest if your elbows touch your knees
then<00:01:49.460> that's<00:01:49.970> a<00:01:50.240> no<00:01:50.570> lift<00:01:51.100> at<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.340> end<00:01:52.490> of<00:01:52.670> the

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
then that's a no lift at the end of the

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.940 
then that's a no lift at the end of the
lift<00:01:53.000> if<00:01:53.210> your<00:01:53.450> feet<00:01:53.720> aren't<00:01:54.050> parallel<00:01:54.409> and<00:01:54.770> in

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
lift if your feet aren't parallel and in

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.830 
lift if your feet aren't parallel and in
line<00:01:55.130> with<00:01:55.310> each<00:01:55.430> other<00:01:55.790> when<00:01:56.420> you<00:01:56.540> put<00:01:56.750> the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
line with each other when you put the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.620 
line with each other when you put the
bar<00:01:57.020> down<00:01:57.050> then<00:01:57.740> that's<00:01:58.040> an<00:01:58.190> Olaf<00:01:58.630> obviously

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
bar down then that's an Olaf obviously

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.389 
bar down then that's an Olaf obviously
if<00:01:59.869> you<00:02:00.020> drop<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.409> bar<00:02:00.590> or<00:02:00.890> put<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.250> down

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
if you drop the bar or put it down

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.010 
if you drop the bar or put it down
before<00:02:01.850> they<00:02:02.060> give<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.540> signal

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
before they give you the signal

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.520 
before they give you the signal
that's<00:02:03.830> an<00:02:04.100> Olaf
