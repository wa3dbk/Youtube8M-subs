it's<00:01:36.049> going<00:01:36.140> to<00:01:36.200> be<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.499> exact<00:01:36.829> same<00:01:37.100> outcome

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
it's going to be the exact same outcome

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.450 
it's going to be the exact same outcome
is<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.700> first<00:01:37.999> fight<00:01:38.210> yes<00:01:38.719> I<00:01:38.750> agree<00:01:39.289> not<00:01:40.219> just

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
is the first fight yes I agree not just

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.330 
is the first fight yes I agree not just
because<00:01:40.609> I<00:01:41.030> know<00:01:41.530> Mario<00:01:42.530> very<00:01:42.770> well<00:01:42.979> I<00:01:43.219> think

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
because I know Mario very well I think

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.669 
because I know Mario very well I think
if<00:01:44.000> I<00:01:44.149> didn't<00:01:44.390> know<00:01:44.479> Margaret<00:01:44.659> of<00:01:44.899> my<00:01:45.079> opinion

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679
