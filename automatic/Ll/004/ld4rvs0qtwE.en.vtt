video<00:00:13.800> because<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.490> had<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> question<00:00:15.150> about

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
video because I had a question about

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.079 
video because I had a question about
when<00:00:16.259> I<00:00:16.289> took<00:00:16.439> him<00:00:16.769> on<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.009> airplane<00:00:17.130> how<00:00:17.699> did

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:18.089 
when I took him on the airplane how did

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:23.089 
when I took him on the airplane how did
that<00:00:18.239> work<00:00:18.449> out<00:00:21.259> focus<00:00:22.259> is<00:00:22.529> not<00:00:22.710> enough<00:00:22.890> light

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
that work out focus is not enough light

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:31.519 
that work out focus is not enough light
in<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.369> um<00:00:27.499> okay<00:00:28.499> so<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:29.899> took<00:00:30.899> him<00:00:31.259> on<00:00:31.409> an

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
in you um okay so I took him on an

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.930 
in you um okay so I took him on an
airplane<00:00:31.829> and<00:00:33.559> he<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.679> full<00:00:35.100> body<00:00:35.340> silicone

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
airplane and he is a full body silicone

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.459 
airplane and he is a full body silicone
so<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.239> will<00:00:36.420> only<00:00:36.480> apply<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:36.899> full-body

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
so this will only apply for full-body

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.220 
so this will only apply for full-body
silicone<00:00:38.070> because<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.750> haven't<00:00:39.750> taken<00:00:40.019> a

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
silicone because I haven't taken a

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.110 
silicone because I haven't taken a
reborn<00:00:40.649> because<00:00:41.190> reborns<00:00:41.730> are<00:00:41.850> different

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
reborn because reborns are different

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.479 
reborn because reborns are different
because<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.469> full<00:00:43.769> why<00:00:43.890> silicone<00:00:44.339> you

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
because like so full why silicone you

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.040 
because like so full why silicone you
can<00:00:44.670> see<00:00:44.910> everything<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.539> them<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:45.809> can't

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
can see everything in them they can't

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.560 
can see everything in them they can't
come<00:00:46.230> apart<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.730> actually<00:00:47.910> easier<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
come apart so it's actually easier to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.549 
come apart so it's actually easier to
take<00:00:48.839> a<00:00:48.870> full<00:00:49.109> body<00:00:49.320> silicone<00:00:49.829> um<00:00:51.170> although<00:00:52.170> I

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
take a full body silicone um although I

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.630 
take a full body silicone um although I
imagine<00:00:52.679> they'd<00:00:53.070> probably<00:00:53.249> do<00:00:53.519> the<00:00:53.609> same

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
imagine they'd probably do the same

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.029 
imagine they'd probably do the same
thing<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> reborn<00:00:54.629> but<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.620> might<00:00:55.829> get<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
thing for a reborn but you might get a

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.079 
thing for a reborn but you might get a
little<00:00:56.159> bit<00:00:56.370> more<00:00:56.489> trouble<00:00:56.820> because<00:00:56.879> they

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
little bit more trouble because they

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.020 
little bit more trouble because they
can't<00:00:57.300> tell<00:00:57.510> what's<00:00:57.719> inside<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.230> them<00:00:58.409> but

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
can't tell what's inside of them but

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.549 
can't tell what's inside of them but
okay<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.089> I<00:01:00.239> took<00:01:00.600> him<00:01:00.749> and<00:01:00.929> I<00:01:00.960> was<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.289> nervous

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
okay so I took him and I was so nervous

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.329 
okay so I took him and I was so nervous
I<00:01:02.159> was<00:01:02.519> like<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:03.470> had<00:01:04.470> him<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.739> bag<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.280> my

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
I was like I had him in a bag for my

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.010 
I was like I had him in a bag for my
carry-on<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.119> was<00:01:06.240> hoping<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.659> would<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:06.930> be

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
carry-on so I was hoping I would just be

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.389 
carry-on so I was hoping I would just be
able<00:01:07.079> to<00:01:07.200> put<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> bag<00:01:07.560> through<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> scanner

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
able to put the bag through the scanner

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.399 
able to put the bag through the scanner
but<00:01:09.299> before<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> put<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.020> back<00:01:10.140> through<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
but before I put the back through the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.630 
but before I put the back through the
scanner<00:01:10.649> because<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> didn't<00:01:11.130> want<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.280> scare

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
scanner because I didn't want to scare

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.420 
scanner because I didn't want to scare
them<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.090> said<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.649> doll<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.130> there<00:01:14.280> that
