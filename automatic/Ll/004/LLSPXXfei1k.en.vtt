00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.069 
a dance class I thought it was a
prerequisite<00:03:39.329> girl<00:03:40.329> I<00:03:40.450> just<00:03:40.720> put<00:03:40.870> her<00:03:40.930> in

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
prerequisite girl I just put her in

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.530 
prerequisite girl I just put her in
dance<00:03:41.290> but<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.890> really<00:03:42.519> think<00:03:42.730> from<00:03:42.970> day<00:03:43.120> one

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
dance but I really think from day one

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.400 
dance but I really think from day one
you<00:03:43.660> would<00:03:43.750> have<00:03:43.840> known<00:03:43.989> that<00:03:44.019> Abby<00:03:44.380> was

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
you would have known that Abby was

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.810 
you would have known that Abby was
probably<00:03:44.799> not<00:03:45.010> what<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.310> want<00:03:45.519> your<00:03:45.640> daughter

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
probably not what you want your daughter

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.400 
probably not what you want your daughter
to<00:03:45.970> kind<00:03:46.269> of<00:03:46.329> have<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.570> face<00:03:46.750> every<00:03:47.079> day<00:03:47.230> she

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
to kind of have to face every day she

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.599 
to kind of have to face every day she
goes<00:03:47.530> well<00:03:47.650> she<00:03:47.799> wasn't<00:03:47.950> her<00:03:48.160> teacher<00:03:48.370> when

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
goes well she wasn't her teacher when

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.370 
goes well she wasn't her teacher when
she<00:03:48.730> was<00:03:48.850> little<00:03:49.030> she<00:03:49.390> only<00:03:49.720> started<00:03:50.109> dancing

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
she was little she only started dancing

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.050 
she was little she only started dancing
first<00:03:50.620> she<00:03:50.769> was<00:03:50.890> older<00:03:51.190> but<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.790> know<00:03:51.910> what<00:03:52.030> I

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
first she was older but you know what I

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.380 
first she was older but you know what I
think<00:03:52.450> that<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.840> show<00:03:53.109> really<00:03:53.680> I<00:03:54.459> I<00:03:54.940> think<00:03:55.269> it

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
think that the show really I I think it

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.920 
think that the show really I I think it
put<00:03:55.570> a<00:03:55.810> lot<00:03:55.989> of<00:03:56.370> positive<00:03:57.569> emphasis<00:03:58.569> on<00:03:58.720> dance

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
put a lot of positive emphasis on dance

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.059 
put a lot of positive emphasis on dance
as<00:03:59.110> well<00:03:59.260> because<00:03:59.530> there's<00:03:59.680> kids<00:03:59.920> all<00:04:00.010> over

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
as well because there's kids all over

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.780 
as well because there's kids all over
the<00:04:00.280> world<00:04:00.400> who<00:04:00.940> inspired

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
the world who inspired

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.580 
the world who inspired
be<00:04:01.879> like<00:04:02.060> these<00:04:02.239> guys<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.780> think<00:04:02.810> it's<00:04:03.200> inspired

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
be like these guys I think it's inspired

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.949 
be like these guys I think it's inspired
a<00:04:03.709> lot<00:04:03.829> of<00:04:03.890> kids<00:04:04.189> to<00:04:04.430> go<00:04:04.579> dance

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.449 

if<00:04:08.959> there<00:04:09.650> are<00:04:09.769> a<00:04:09.799> lot<00:04:10.010> of<00:04:10.040> other<00:04:10.219> dance

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
if there are a lot of other dance

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.770 
if there are a lot of other dance
teachers<00:04:10.849> out<00:04:11.000> there<00:04:11.090> so<00:04:11.359> why<00:04:11.480> didn't<00:04:11.750> you

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
teachers out there so why didn't you

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.039 
teachers out there so why didn't you
just<00:04:11.930> move<00:04:12.109> quicker<00:04:12.849> sooner<00:04:13.849> did<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.120> say<00:04:14.299> two

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
just move quicker sooner did you say two

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.960 
just move quicker sooner did you say two
years<00:04:15.079> didn't<00:04:15.530> new<00:04:15.620> ones<00:04:15.829> yeah<00:04:16.190> he's<00:04:16.729> gotta

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
years didn't new ones yeah he's gotta

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.640 
years didn't new ones yeah he's gotta
started<00:04:17.389> well<00:04:17.690> I<00:04:17.720> think<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:18.229> we<00:04:18.350> were<00:04:18.470> just

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
started well I think that we were just

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.050 
started well I think that we were just
sort<00:04:18.889> of<00:04:18.949> watching<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:19.609> seeing<00:04:19.820> what<00:04:19.940> was

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
sort of watching and seeing what was

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.849 
sort of watching and seeing what was
best<00:04:20.269> for<00:04:20.389> Chloe<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:20.810> when<00:04:21.169> it<00:04:21.259> was<00:04:21.380> time<00:04:21.650> we

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
best for Chloe and when it was time we

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.620 
best for Chloe and when it was time we
knew<00:04:22.039> it<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.340> we<00:04:22.430> moved<00:04:22.610> on<00:04:22.789> and<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:26.030> can't<00:04:26.449> see

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
knew it and we moved on and I can't see

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.960 
knew it and we moved on and I can't see
that<00:04:26.750> you<00:04:26.870> could<00:04:27.020> be<00:04:27.199> a<00:04:27.229> good<00:04:27.470> dance<00:04:27.860> teacher<00:04:28.220> I

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
that you could be a good dance teacher I

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.620 
that you could be a good dance teacher I
think<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.300> learned<00:04:29.449> a<00:04:29.660> lot<00:04:29.810> from<00:04:29.870> her<00:04:30.289> but<00:04:31.630> maybe

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
think I learned a lot from her but maybe

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.909 
think I learned a lot from her but maybe
she<00:04:32.870> didn't<00:04:33.080> tell<00:04:33.229> me<00:04:33.259> the<00:04:33.470> best<00:04:33.650> way

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919

she didn't tell me the best way
