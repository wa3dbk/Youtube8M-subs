00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.580
 for that style and here I bring you the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.109
 images as they remember that I can not 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.300
 have the trailer because if we do not 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.160
 would catch the copyright and that nobody 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.050
 like it so let's show some 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.609
 How many pictures do I bring? 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.199
 maximum possible images 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.670
 they also know that the icc has it 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.800
 down here in the description so what 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.449
 can check and see but you really are 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.130
 images have to be commented already 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.559
 that this trailer is simply 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.000
 incredible this trailer is sincerely 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.590
 of the best trailers I've seen of 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.629
 mega blond pokemon and alpha sapphire and 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.129
 Believe me you will love it but good 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.410
 let's start directly to see 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.780
 these images first of all in the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.360
 trailer we started to see a bit already 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.760
 some rather old images we started 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.579
 to see all the new evolutions to 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.039
 Mega Audino Mega Salamis Mega Achievement 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.079
 mega star and everything normal to mega goal 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.879
 gross the three initials in their form 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.079
 evolutionary media we can see them so 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.420
 you can see that it's a start a bit 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.880
 slow as we start seeing these 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.189
 images which obviously all 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.039
 we do after this we begin to see 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.719
 back to the three initials we 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:14.939
 shows its statisticians their 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.369
 information how much they weigh how much they measure 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.110
 what kind are they so they can see that 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.850
 the trailer is already a bit slow but 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.369
 after this the trailer starts to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.130
 put too interesting since we 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.509
 they begin to show images knowing 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.130
 actually play the title I think it 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.110
 so call me I think I'll put it like that 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.789
 knowing the new play completely 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.130
 since you can see that they start to 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.720
 show surfing images that can 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.580
 see what looks amazing when we're 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.950
 under the water with a small waimer 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.599
 now it is an amazing animation 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.670
 also when we are in the desert 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.860
 when we are in this city when 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.890
 we are on a route you can see that all 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.899
 the images are simply incredible 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.090
 honestly the one I liked the most was 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.619
 when we were under water the wine 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.479
 sea ​​looks amazing 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.610
 We bring our little viewer under the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.950
 water the animation just is not 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.349
 I could ask for a little more since 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.899
 this game every time I see it is exceeded 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:09.179
 more and they give me an incredible desire to 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.280
 have in your hands although remember that 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.770
 barely reaches 21 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.510
 and the game comes out to have the guide here 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.640
 in the channel after these little 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.640
 images shows us the five leaders 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.500
 from gym to erico to this normal to 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.390
 candela and other two that reminds us 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.310
 exactly the name but these also 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.470
 they already knew each other is nothing so new 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.600
 but after this the trailer 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.430
 start to put too interesting 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.890
 since in my opinion this is where the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.420
 trailer really gains a lot of strength 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.000
 first of all you can see that we are 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.890
 at the base of magma and team aqua 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.540
 respectively in each version 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.720
 after this we can see here the 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.670
 magma leader which obviously can 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.440
 see that he needs a retocadita 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.950
 there you can see that afterwards we 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.209
 we found in this in this cave where 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.910
 appears the team aqua which are the 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.430
 good inside the sapphire pokemon I say 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.340
 ruby pokemon the aqua team is the good and 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.930
 inside sapphire pokemon the team ruby ​​is 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.519
 the good so you can see that here we 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.440
 we found in this little battle 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.720
 after this the bringing begins at 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.280
 put too interesting so if 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.720
 did not see the trailer I recommend you 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.360
 go also to the link of this 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.730
 description since there is the trailer 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.950
 which sincerely looks more 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.200
 incredible is amazing is the trailer 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.120
 we can see cay see who is in his 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.540
 normal way after we can also see 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.209
 to this 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.579
 to this degree don that also begins to 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.650
 win the primo genia way so it's inside 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.840
 of the trailer we can see how it is that 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.180
 these already legendary pokémon begin 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.680
 to win the form primo genia and not 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.719
 could ask nothing more to the animation 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.340
 because it is amazing 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:44.290
 after that obviously we can see 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.790
 here as you can see a small picture 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.799
 where the two are already in the form 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.930
 primigenia are jumping they want us 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.700
 attacking something that style and perhaps 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.769
 this is where our battle begins 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.260
 against them in order to capture the 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.329
 Masters ball in sight and then here 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.489
 we can see how they start with their 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.900
 new respective attacks and after 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.579
 this trailer starts to calm down a 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.069
 little bit since after so much euphoria 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.019
 that has this trailer we start to see 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.900
 something a little simpler here I already 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.209
 seen the super secret bases the 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.829
 contests explain his coquette a 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.109
 question do you think that some picacho 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.820
 flirtatious have some competitive use already 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.289
 Remember that each picket will have 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.479
 some movement in particular so 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.610
 I think at least some will have a use 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.949
 competitive but honestly I still do not know 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.419
 which is after this already having 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.490
 again put a bit interesting and 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.600
 that we continue to show more images 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.330
 here you can see that we are 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.360
 in the parakeet in the space center 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.310
 in the city ​​he created polis from now out 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.110
 of the gym already inside the gym 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.720
 acropolis city and animations 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.730
 they are simply more than amazing 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.320
 animations are amazing 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.630
 after this we can continue to see 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.280
 more images of the game jumping on the 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.290
 bicycle can see that we are by 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.720
 catch a pikachu honestly I do not know 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.520
 if it's a game mission or is it some 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.410
 new way to find some anibal 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.050
 Bo for that style is something strange but 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.670
 I would like to know at once 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.010
 what is going to be done with that tail 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.450
 of the picacho that we are about to catch here 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.550
 with bruno we can also say with 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.870
 now we are on the bike we can 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.210
 see in the following image that already 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.100
 we are witnessing the part where the 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.630
 submarine of aqua team starts to 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.610
 submerge that on this occasion you can see 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.670
 which is a giant server this 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.680
 submarine is amazing the truth also 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.600
 after this we will see the last 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.760
 images to what is this last farm 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.830
 in forgiveness that is where they show us the 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.940
 home I think that same the end what 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.280
 I remember pretty watching the games 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.860
 where the character see the bicycle and 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.330
 then wake god takes off like a jet 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.840
 can see that it captures the image where 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.880
 just 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.130
 wait and you see the image that is going to 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.050
 supersonic speed that I hope you 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.540
 I really liked this video, I hope 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.979

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.960

 It gives you a lot of information we can know 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.510
 the game completely since we can 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.740
 see us under the water in the 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.210
 desert on the bicycle in the cities 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.190
 we can see that we are in a lot of 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.900
 places and the truth is this trailer is not 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.120
