what<00:00:11.990> we'll<00:00:12.140> do<00:00:12.230> now<00:00:12.440> is<00:00:12.470> we'll<00:00:12.740> take<00:00:12.950> a<00:00:12.980> walk

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
what we'll do now is we'll take a walk

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.580 
what we'll do now is we'll take a walk
through<00:00:13.280> a<00:00:13.640> version<00:00:14.300> one<00:00:14.540> of<00:00:14.570> big<00:00:15.170> Scioto

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
through a version one of big Scioto

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.280 
through a version one of big Scioto
we're<00:00:16.340> going<00:00:16.460> to<00:00:16.520> go<00:00:16.640> through<00:00:17.000> and<00:00:17.390> I'll<00:00:17.930> play

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 
we're going to go through and I'll play

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.960 
we're going to go through and I'll play
through<00:00:18.500> the<00:00:18.619> phrasing<00:00:19.250> and<00:00:19.490> we'll<00:00:19.700> look<00:00:19.820> at

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
through the phrasing and we'll look at

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.690 
through the phrasing and we'll look at
the<00:00:20.060> fingering<00:00:20.630> of<00:00:20.869> a<00:00:21.560> beach<00:00:21.860> section<00:00:22.460> and

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
the fingering of a beach section and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.820 
the fingering of a beach section and
then<00:00:23.300> some<00:00:23.570> of<00:00:23.690> the<00:00:23.810> nuances<00:00:24.380> that<00:00:24.440> we<00:00:24.650> might

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
then some of the nuances that we might

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.200 
then some of the nuances that we might
add<00:00:25.010> into<00:00:25.430> it<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:25.759> that'll<00:00:26.480> lead<00:00:26.630> us<00:00:26.660> up<00:00:26.960> to<00:00:27.169> a

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
add into it and that'll lead us up to a

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.550 
add into it and that'll lead us up to a
backing<00:00:29.210> track<00:00:29.240> which<00:00:30.050> will<00:00:30.169> be<00:00:30.290> the<00:00:30.410> next

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
backing track which will be the next

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.679 
backing track which will be the next
clip<00:00:30.950> but<00:00:31.669> we'll<00:00:31.790> start<00:00:32.000> off<00:00:32.180> taking<00:00:32.480> a<00:00:32.540> look

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
clip but we'll start off taking a look

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.600 
clip but we'll start off taking a look
at<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.870> a<00:00:32.900> section<00:00:33.500> of<00:00:33.650> version<00:00:34.040> one<00:00:34.220> a<00:00:34.250> big

Scioto I'll play through it once at
sixty<00:00:38.570> six<00:00:38.870> beats<00:00:39.200> per<00:00:39.470> minute<00:00:39.800> and<00:00:39.920> then

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
sixty six beats per minute and then

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.410 
sixty six beats per minute and then
we'll<00:00:40.430> come<00:00:40.579> back<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:40.880> take<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.090> look<00:00:41.150> at<00:00:41.360> the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.060 

let's<00:01:44.780> take<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:44.990> look<00:01:45.200> at<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.409> fingering<00:01:45.890> as

let's take a look at the fingering as

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
written I would stay with the fingering

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.680 
written I would stay with the fingering
that<00:01:54.350> matches<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.070> second<00:01:55.580> position<00:01:56.090> G<00:01:56.450> major

if we stay there there's real we can

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.460 
if we stay there there's real we can
cover<00:02:05.850> everything<00:02:06.300> that<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.720> version<00:02:06.990> asks

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
cover everything that this version asks

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.840 
cover everything that this version asks
us<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.590> do<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.280> don't<00:02:08.399> have<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.700> move

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
us to do and we don't have to move

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.750 
us to do and we don't have to move
around<00:02:09.000> at<00:02:09.300> all<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.380> here<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.680> is<00:02:10.800> sixty-six

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
around at all so here it is sixty-six

you

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.360 

now<00:03:19.780> you'll<00:03:19.930> notice<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.290> all<00:03:20.950> of<00:03:21.220> the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
now you'll notice that all of the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.190 
now you'll notice that all of the
fingered<00:03:21.880> notes<00:03:22.090> all<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.510> fretted<00:03:22.930> notes

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
fingered notes all the fretted notes

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.530 
fingered notes all the fretted notes
came<00:03:23.800> out<00:03:24.010> of<00:03:24.160> that<00:03:24.310> second<00:03:24.820> position<00:03:25.180> scale

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
came out of that second position scale

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.260 
came out of that second position scale
but<00:03:26.290> anytime<00:03:26.560> or<00:03:27.130> most<00:03:27.400> of<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.610> times<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:28.060> I

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
but anytime or most of the times that I

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.690 
but anytime or most of the times that I
could<00:03:28.330> reference<00:03:28.750> an<00:03:29.230> open<00:03:29.620> string<00:03:29.920> I've<00:03:30.310> done

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
could reference an open string I've done

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.690 
could reference an open string I've done
that<00:03:30.970> it's<00:03:31.960> it's<00:03:32.410> more<00:03:32.620> efficient<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.340> it's

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
that it's it's more efficient and it's

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.790 
that it's it's more efficient and it's
more<00:03:33.880> open<00:03:34.060> sounding<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.140> doesn't<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.680> know

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
more open sounding it doesn't you know

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.650 
more open sounding it doesn't you know
you're<00:03:36.310> not<00:03:36.370> having<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.670> fret<00:03:36.910> every<00:03:37.150> note<00:03:37.360> so

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
you're not having to fret every note so

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.630 
you're not having to fret every note so
your<00:03:37.780> fingers<00:03:38.080> aren't<00:03:38.290> as<00:03:38.380> tied<00:03:38.620> up<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.100> it

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
your fingers aren't as tied up and it

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.880 
your fingers aren't as tied up and it
just<00:03:39.850> doesn't<00:03:40.030> sound<00:03:40.240> as<00:03:40.450> closed<00:03:40.840> or<00:03:41.380> choked

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
just doesn't sound as closed or choked

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.860 
just doesn't sound as closed or choked
so<00:03:42.250> we<00:03:42.430> can<00:03:42.670> make<00:03:42.850> use<00:03:42.880> of<00:03:43.120> those<00:03:43.420> open<00:03:43.780> strings

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
so we can make use of those open strings

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.720 
so we can make use of those open strings
whenever<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.650> get<00:03:44.740> a<00:03:44.800> chance<00:03:45.070> it's<00:03:45.400> always

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
whenever you get a chance it's always

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.110 
whenever you get a chance it's always
always<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.300> plus

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.630 

let's<00:03:51.020> go<00:03:51.170> through<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:51.470> again<00:03:51.560> this<00:03:52.010> time<00:03:52.310> I'm

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
let's go through it again this time I'm

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.580 
let's go through it again this time I'm
going<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:53.000> start<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:53.599> stop<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:53.870> little<00:03:54.200> bit<00:03:54.349> and

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
going to start and stop a little bit and

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.830 
going to start and stop a little bit and
and<00:03:55.010> when<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.340> hit<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.730> point<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.390> I<00:03:56.420> think<00:03:56.569> we

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
and when I hit a point that I think we

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.740 
and when I hit a point that I think we
might<00:03:57.050> want<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.349> add<00:03:57.530> something<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:58.220> this<00:03:59.150> PDF

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
might want to add something to this PDF

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.330 
might want to add something to this PDF
that<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.020> have<00:04:00.260> in<00:04:00.380> front<00:04:00.560> of<00:04:00.709> you<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.160> I

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
that you have in front of you and I

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.160 
that you have in front of you and I
would<00:04:01.400> recommend<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:02.180> have<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.630> printed

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
would recommend that you have a printed

detail to your chart there it's a real

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.240 
detail to your chart there it's a real
bare-bones<00:04:11.690> chart<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.470> that's<00:04:12.890> on<00:04:13.069> purpose

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
bare-bones chart and that's on purpose

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.770 
bare-bones chart and that's on purpose
because<00:04:13.489> I<00:04:13.670> wanted<00:04:13.880> to<00:04:13.970> cover<00:04:14.180> some<00:04:14.599> of<00:04:14.630> these

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
because I wanted to cover some of these

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.330 
because I wanted to cover some of these
things<00:04:15.050> that<00:04:15.200> you<00:04:15.410> can<00:04:15.530> add<00:04:15.709> to<00:04:15.739> make<00:04:16.130> this

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
things that you can add to make this

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.659 
things that you can add to make this
more<00:04:16.730> of<00:04:16.760> your<00:04:17.030> own<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:17.980> and<00:04:18.980> you<00:04:19.370> know<00:04:19.459> little

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
more of your own and and you know little

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.000 
more of your own and and you know little
nuances<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.480> makes<00:04:20.690> that<00:04:21.079> starts<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.889> build

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
nuances that makes that starts to build

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.680 
nuances that makes that starts to build
towards<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.610> arrangement<00:04:23.120> that<00:04:23.150> you<00:04:23.270> that

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
towards the arrangement that you that

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.930 
towards the arrangement that you that
you'll<00:04:23.840> be<00:04:23.960> working<00:04:24.110> on<00:04:24.440> for<00:04:24.470> yourself<00:04:25.040> so<00:04:25.880> I'm

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
you'll be working on for yourself so I'm

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.280 
you'll be working on for yourself so I'm
going<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.090> kick<00:04:26.270> it<00:04:26.419> off<00:04:26.570> with<00:04:28.660> that<00:04:29.660> look<00:04:29.990> the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
going to kick it off with that look the

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.909 
going to kick it off with that look the
triplet<00:04:30.740> that<00:04:30.950> lead-in<00:04:31.760> I'd<00:04:32.540> like<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:33.290> use

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
triplet that lead-in I'd like to use

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.840 
triplet that lead-in I'd like to use
that<00:04:33.950> line<00:04:34.520> as<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:34.880> hammer-on<00:04:36.639> so<00:04:37.639> I'm<00:04:37.700> only

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
that line as a hammer-on so I'm only

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.080 
that line as a hammer-on so I'm only
picking<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.479> open<00:04:38.810> string<00:04:39.169> and<00:04:39.970> then<00:04:40.970> I'm

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
picking the open string and then I'm

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:48.290 
picking the open string and then I'm
hammering<00:04:41.450> on<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.780> next<00:04:42.050> two<00:04:42.229> notes

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.880 

each<00:04:49.300> time<00:04:49.600> I<00:04:49.630> come<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:50.290> I'm<00:04:50.440> using<00:04:50.680> that

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
each time I come to it I'm using that

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.440 
each time I come to it I'm using that
same<00:04:50.950> idea<00:04:52.950> so<00:04:53.950> I'm<00:04:54.100> picking<00:04:54.280> down<00:04:54.610> on<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.270> D

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
same idea so I'm picking down on the D

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:12.689 
same idea so I'm picking down on the D
string<00:04:55.720> and<00:04:56.580> then<00:04:57.580> up<00:04:57.790> on<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.120> G

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.919 

right<00:05:13.699> here's<00:05:13.909> another<00:05:14.179> point<00:05:14.449> we<00:05:14.629> could<00:05:14.809> look

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:14.929 
right here's another point we could look

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:19.410 
right here's another point we could look
at

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.000 

when<00:05:20.320> we<00:05:20.440> play<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.860> three<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.250> five<00:05:21.490> with<00:05:22.150> the

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
when we play the three to five with the

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:29.730 
when we play the three to five with the
instead<00:05:24.010> of<00:05:24.130> just<00:05:24.340> picking<00:05:24.520> both<00:05:24.850> nerves<00:05:28.740> you

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
instead of just picking both nerves you

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.580 
instead of just picking both nerves you
could<00:05:29.920> hammer<00:05:30.130> on<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.520> five<00:05:34.260> and<00:05:35.260> then<00:05:35.560> the

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
could hammer on the five and then the

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.480 
could hammer on the five and then the
next<00:05:35.710> phrase<00:05:36.160> the<00:05:36.400> three<00:05:36.640> to<00:05:36.760> open<00:05:38.400> you<00:05:39.400> could

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
next phrase the three to open you could

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:48.570 
next phrase the three to open you could
always<00:05:39.670> do<00:05:39.850> a<00:05:39.880> pull<00:05:40.120> off<00:05:40.270> there

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:59.670 

Oh

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.490 

and<00:06:00.580> see<00:06:00.760> what<00:06:00.880> I<00:06:00.910> did<00:06:01.000> there<00:06:01.120> I<00:06:01.570> doubled<00:06:02.290> up<00:06:02.350> on

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
and see what I did there I doubled up on

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:09.409 
and see what I did there I doubled up on
the<00:06:02.560> note<00:06:03.960> so<00:06:04.960> I<00:06:04.990> played<00:06:05.320> that<00:06:05.850> 3<00:06:07.710> Rd<00:06:08.710> note<00:06:08.949> and

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
the note so I played that 3 Rd note and

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.960 
the note so I played that 3 Rd note and
then<00:06:10.419> I<00:06:10.600> hit<00:06:11.320> it<00:06:11.440> again<00:06:11.770> to<00:06:12.190> put<00:06:12.400> the<00:06:12.520> 5<00:06:12.760> into

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
then I hit it again to put the 5 into

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:22.240 
then I hit it again to put the 5 into
motion

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.910 

notice<00:06:23.250> how<00:06:23.400> kept<00:06:23.700> the<00:06:24.060> two<00:06:24.300> in<00:06:24.510> place<00:06:24.740> okay<00:06:25.770> I

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:25.920 
notice how kept the two in place okay I

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.000 
notice how kept the two in place okay I
kept<00:06:26.100> the<00:06:26.220> a<00:06:26.840> that<00:06:27.840> allows<00:06:28.140> you<00:06:28.470> to<00:06:28.590> get<00:06:28.710> a<00:06:28.770> more
