00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
any camera right off the bat see the

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.770 
any camera right off the bat see the
little<00:02:35.379> thing<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.129> says<00:02:36.310> shutter<00:02:37.209> speed<00:02:37.569> if

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
little thing that says shutter speed if

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.540 
little thing that says shutter speed if
you<00:02:38.080> raise<00:02:38.379> that<00:02:38.650> number<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:39.220> make<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.400> longer

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
you raise that number to make it longer

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.820 
you raise that number to make it longer
whenever<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.569> take<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.780> picture<00:02:41.110> now<00:02:41.379> your

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
whenever you take a picture now your

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
camera will be on for several seconds

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.680 
camera will be on for several seconds
taking<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:45.010> picture<00:02:45.400> for<00:02:45.819> that<00:02:46.030> amount<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.629> time

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
taking a picture for that amount of time

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
now this is really cool because what you

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.610 
now this is really cool because what you
can<00:02:48.760> do<00:02:48.910> is<00:02:49.060> take<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.300> light<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.019> then<00:02:50.290> move<00:02:50.500> it

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
can do is take a light and then move it

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.259 
can do is take a light and then move it
around<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.980> frame<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:51.519> can<00:02:52.000> actually

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
around the frame and you can actually

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.990 
around the frame and you can actually
record<00:02:52.660> like<00:02:53.230> trails<00:02:53.260> with<00:02:53.769> that<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.190> people

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
record like trails with that and people

a<00:03:01.090> flashlight<00:03:01.450> around<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.290> then<00:03:02.379> it's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
a flashlight around and then it's

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.679 
a flashlight around and then it's
done<00:03:02.829> well<00:03:03.159> actually<00:03:03.370> it's<00:03:03.849> a<00:03:03.939> whole<00:03:04.120> art<00:03:04.420> form

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
in and of itself because there are

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.119 
in and of itself because there are
dozens<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.329> different<00:03:07.900> types<00:03:08.409> of<00:03:08.650> lights<00:03:08.980> that
