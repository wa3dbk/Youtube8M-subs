never put a build-up video out on that
on<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.820> channel<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:30.570> fairly<00:00:31.019> simple

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
on the channel but it's fairly simple

the update on that the bill did make it

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.910 
the update on that the bill did make it
through<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.289> actually<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> lot<00:00:49.710> stronger

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920

build is nearly done being tested I have
a<00:00:55.350> little<00:00:55.620> more<00:00:55.829> finalization<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.550> go<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.789> that

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
a little more finalization to go on that

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.689 
a little more finalization to go on that
but<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:58.079> video<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.530> all<00:00:58.949> about<00:00:58.980> registering

knocked<00:03:10.900> back<00:03:11.170> stunned<00:03:11.890> or<00:03:12.190> days<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.820> that's

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
knocked back stunned or days and that's

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.190 
knocked back stunned or days and that's
going<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.120> happen<00:03:13.269> a<00:03:13.480> lot<00:03:13.660> with<00:03:13.840> this<00:03:13.959> build

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
going to happen a lot with this build

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.259 
going to happen a lot with this build
and<00:03:14.440> there<00:03:15.220> is<00:03:15.340> no<00:03:15.489> internal<00:03:15.850> cooldown<00:03:16.090> on

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
and there is no internal cooldown on

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.819 
and there is no internal cooldown on
this<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:16.750> can<00:03:16.780> stack<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.440> lot<00:03:17.709> of

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
this so you can stack a lot of

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.350 
this so you can stack a lot of
vulnerability<00:03:18.310> very<00:03:18.489> quickly<00:03:18.760> with<00:03:19.060> just

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
auto attacks on the mace and finally

a little bit but it is

this<00:07:13.919> new<00:07:13.979> flavor<00:07:14.340> the<00:07:15.210> old<00:07:15.630> version<00:07:15.960> of<00:07:16.350> red

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.650 
this new flavor the old version of red

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.980 
this new flavor the old version of red
assume<00:07:16.949> is<00:07:17.220> not<00:07:17.910> quite<00:07:18.300> as<00:07:18.479> powerful<00:07:18.660> as<00:07:18.900> it

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990 
assume is not quite as powerful as it

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.990 
assume is not quite as powerful as it
used<00:07:19.169> to<00:07:19.289> be<00:07:19.440> there<00:07:20.039> are<00:07:20.250> probably<00:07:20.610> some

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 
used to be there are probably some

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.909 
used to be there are probably some
variations<00:07:21.600> of<00:07:21.720> it<00:07:21.870> that<00:07:22.139> will<00:07:22.320> still<00:07:22.620> make<00:07:22.770> it

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 
variations of it that will still make it

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:24.560 
variations of it that will still make it
work<00:07:23.070> with<00:07:23.310> the<00:07:23.460> ex<00:07:23.610> Orton<00:07:24.000> longbow<00:07:24.360> I

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:24.570

personally<00:07:25.440> prefer<00:07:25.800> this<00:07:26.250> new<00:07:26.520> version<00:07:26.699> over

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.210 
personally prefer this new version over

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.340 
personally prefer this new version over
the<00:07:27.300> previous<00:07:27.449> version<00:07:27.720> because<00:07:28.080> you<00:07:28.199> have<00:07:28.320> a

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:28.350 
the previous version because you have a

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.839 
the previous version because you have a
lot<00:07:28.500> more<00:07:28.620> control<00:07:28.889> over<00:07:29.100> your<00:07:29.280> opponent<00:07:29.729> and

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:29.849 
lot more control over your opponent and

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:32.330 
lot more control over your opponent and
it<00:07:30.419> really<00:07:30.810> taps<00:07:31.110> into<00:07:31.289> that<00:07:31.590> hybrid<00:07:32.099> power

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 
it really taps into that hybrid power

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.879 
it really taps into that hybrid power
