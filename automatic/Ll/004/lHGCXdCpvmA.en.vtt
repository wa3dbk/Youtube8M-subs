underneath<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.990> scales<00:01:49.290> these<00:01:49.530> two<00:01:49.770> screws

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
underneath the scales these two screws

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.660 
underneath the scales these two screws
are<00:01:50.430> holding<00:01:50.970> holding<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> scale<00:01:53.280> on

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
are holding holding just the scale on

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.280 
are holding holding just the scale on
the<00:01:54.119> bottom<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.810> take<00:01:55.020> out<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the bottom so you can take out the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.749 
the bottom so you can take out the
scales<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.799> actually<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.159> whole<00:01:56.399> life<00:01:56.579> is

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
scales and actually the whole life is

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.490 
scales and actually the whole life is
still<00:01:56.969> functioning<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.960> titanium

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
still functioning you have the titanium

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.590 
still functioning you have the titanium
liners<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.130> are<00:01:59.549> actually<00:01:59.850> pretty<00:02:00.360> decent

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
liners that are actually pretty decent

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.929 
liners that are actually pretty decent
thickness<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:02.159> looks<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.670> my

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
thickness on this that looks like my

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.300 
thickness on this that looks like my
guess<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.360> about<00:02:03.509> Paul<00:02:03.990> what<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.320> about<00:02:04.890> point

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
guess is about Paul what is about point

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.710 
guess is about Paul what is about point
O<00:02:05.990> points<00:02:06.990> 7.8<00:02:07.459> something<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.759> they're

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
O points 7.8 something like that they're

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.080 
O points 7.8 something like that they're
actually<00:02:09.869> pretty<00:02:10.200> decent<00:02:10.730> and

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
actually pretty decent and

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.030 
actually pretty decent and
it's<00:02:12.750> not<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.050> lightest<00:02:13.410> night<00:02:13.590> but<00:02:13.739> it's<00:02:13.890> not

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
it's not the lightest night but it's not

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.070 
it's not the lightest night but it's not
heavy<00:02:14.430> at<00:02:14.640> all<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:15.120> an<00:02:15.360> expert<00:02:15.720> fect<00:02:15.930> size

for<00:02:16.379> me<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.650> know<00:02:16.680> i<00:02:16.920> look<00:02:17.129> at<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.519> look<00:02:17.879> at

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
for me you know i look at that look at

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.160 
for me you know i look at that look at
that<00:02:18.120> bleh<00:02:18.720> look<00:02:19.080> at<00:02:19.170> those<00:02:19.319> grinds<00:02:21.170> beautiful

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
that bleh look at those grinds beautiful

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.140 
that bleh look at those grinds beautiful
hand<00:02:22.379> upside<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:22.890> finish<00:02:23.280> beautiful<00:02:23.970> grounds

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
hand upside and finish beautiful grounds

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.240 
hand upside and finish beautiful grounds
now<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.930> comes<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.440> category<00:02:25.800> where<00:02:26.220> I

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
now this comes to the category where I

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.430 
now this comes to the category where I
say<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.879> some<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.180> these<00:02:27.330> customized<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.230> like

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
say that some of these customized I like

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.180 
say that some of these customized I like
are<00:02:28.860> actually<00:02:29.129> hollow<00:02:29.580> ground<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:31.230> don't

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
are actually hollow ground and I don't

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.940 
are actually hollow ground and I don't
mind<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.670> because<00:02:32.849> it<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.569> just<00:02:33.629> so<00:02:34.049> so<00:02:34.650> they're

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
mind it because it it just so so they're

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.940 
mind it because it it just so so they're
not<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:35.670> damn<00:02:35.970> nice<00:02:36.209> but<00:02:37.170> at<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.379> same<00:02:37.650> time

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
not so damn nice but at the same time

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.680 
not so damn nice but at the same time
yes<00:02:38.400> they<00:02:38.580> are<00:02:38.610> hollow<00:02:39.000> grind<00:02:39.269> but<00:02:39.510> that

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
yes they are hollow grind but that

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.390 
yes they are hollow grind but that
actually<00:02:39.900> pretty<00:02:40.349> nice<00:02:40.530> hollow<00:02:40.830> brines<00:02:41.190> are

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
actually pretty nice hollow brines are

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.030 
actually pretty nice hollow brines are
very<00:02:41.700> shell<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.170> know<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.799> closer

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
very shell so it's you know the closer

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.890 
very shell so it's you know the closer
you<00:02:44.220> get<00:02:44.549> with<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.910> hollow<00:02:45.060> grind<00:02:45.329> to<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.510> to

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
you get with the hollow grind to the to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.770 
you get with the hollow grind to the to
the<00:02:45.930> flat<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.650> better<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:47.010> going<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.280> cut<00:02:47.780> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
the flat the better is going to cut the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.390 
the flat the better is going to cut the
less<00:02:49.019> fighting<00:02:49.319> force<00:02:49.769> there's<00:02:50.069> going<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.370> be

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
less fighting force there's going to be

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.240 
less fighting force there's going to be
and<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:51.209> one<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.540> pretty<00:02:51.780> nice<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.410> just<00:02:53.099> the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
and this one is pretty nice and just the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.550 
and this one is pretty nice and just the
grinds<00:02:54.000> on<00:02:54.090> these<00:02:54.299> things<00:02:54.599> are<00:02:54.810> just<00:02:54.840> insanely

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
grinds on these things are just insanely

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.809 
grinds on these things are just insanely
beautiful<00:02:55.860> look<00:02:56.370> at<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:58.220> really<00:02:59.220> really

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
beautiful look at that really really

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.789 
beautiful look at that really really
cool<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.360> enjoy<00:03:00.720> using<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.230> actually<00:03:01.620> do

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
cool and I enjoy using this actually do

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.039 
cool and I enjoy using this actually do
care<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.340> I'm<00:03:02.670> lucky<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.480> far<00:03:03.720> didn't

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
care this I'm lucky that so far didn't

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.720 
care this I'm lucky that so far didn't
put<00:03:04.200> many<00:03:04.440> scratches<00:03:04.769> on<00:03:05.160> it's<00:03:05.310> just<00:03:05.579> some

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
put many scratches on it's just some

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.580 
put many scratches on it's just some
microscopic<00:03:06.209> things<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.959> can<00:03:07.140> probably

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
microscopic things that you can probably

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.850 
microscopic things that you can probably
barely<00:03:07.920> even<00:03:08.190> see<00:03:08.579> in<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.849> video<00:03:09.200> but<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.500> just

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
barely even see in the video but it just

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.430 
barely even see in the video but it just
just<00:03:11.310> sure<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.940> use<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.420> it's<00:03:12.780> really<00:03:13.319> nice

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
just sure to use this it's really nice

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.729 
just sure to use this it's really nice
life<00:03:13.769> very<00:03:14.760> comfortable<00:03:15.060> actually<00:03:15.739> only

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
life very comfortable actually only

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.410 
life very comfortable actually only
thing<00:03:17.069> is<00:03:17.220> actually<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.910> chancel<00:03:18.269> ever

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
thing is actually in the chancel ever

grip<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.560> fully<00:03:19.950> predicts<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:20.609> real<00:03:20.880> a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
grip that the fully predicts in real a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.720 
grip that the fully predicts in real a
little<00:03:21.630> bit<00:03:21.780> but<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.380> know<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.590> say<00:03:23.069> that<00:03:23.430> it's

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
little bit but you know to say that it's

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.309 
little bit but you know to say that it's
just<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:24.239> kind<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.569> ridiculous<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:25.290> know

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
just it's kind of ridiculous you know

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.140 
just it's kind of ridiculous you know
it's<00:03:25.560> not<00:03:25.739> like<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:26.190> do<00:03:26.400> use<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.850> knives<00:03:27.000> like

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
it's not like I do use the knives like

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.580 
it's not like I do use the knives like
this<00:03:27.359> one<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.569> need<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.810> cut<00:03:27.989> something<00:03:28.200> really

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
this one I need to cut something really

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.650 
this one I need to cut something really
hard<00:03:28.769> I<00:03:28.980> go<00:03:29.430> into<00:03:29.609> this<00:03:29.880> group<00:03:30.150> because<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.510> is

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
hard I go into this group because it is

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.210 
hard I go into this group because it is
the<00:03:30.810> easiest<00:03:31.139> you<00:03:31.290> can<00:03:31.470> put<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.680> most<00:03:31.889> force

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
the easiest you can put the most force

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.039 
the easiest you can put the most force
so<00:03:32.910> when<00:03:33.090> you're<00:03:33.180> cutting<00:03:33.329> something<00:03:33.630> really

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
so when you're cutting something really

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.229 
so when you're cutting something really
hard<00:03:34.200> it's<00:03:34.859> kind<00:03:35.069> of<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.310> safest<00:03:35.730> way<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:35.940> cut

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
hard it's kind of the safest way to cut

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.839 
hard it's kind of the safest way to cut
stuff<00:03:36.569> actually<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:38.280> very<00:03:38.519> effective
