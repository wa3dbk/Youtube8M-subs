00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
split through volume push-pull the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.420 
split through volume push-pull the
single<00:00:57.539> coil<00:00:57.719> out<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.859> all<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.460> all<00:00:59.579> you<00:01:00.390> have

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
five combinations kind of run the range

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.630 
five combinations kind of run the range
between<00:01:05.810> Telecaster<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.840> strat<00:01:07.560> not<00:01:08.220> exactly
