 Colombia and the import of food 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.640
 It has been a day that is important 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.350
 highlight has passed calmly here 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.920
 we show you a balance of the day 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.920
 today's 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.510
 Carlos Velandia is a potato grower 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:09.650
 from the center of the country ensures 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.970
 that if the peasant is tired already 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.770
 lose that the peasant is turning over 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.130
 to the big cities because of this from the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.990
 large displacements and see that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.610
 we will have so much money that we will not 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.229
 we're going to have to eat because the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.700
 peasant is no longer a producer if he is not 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.860
 consumer arrived in Bogota 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.590
 representing 27 regions of Colombia 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.390
 according to them there is rejected an agrarian pact 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.250
 signed last year with which he 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.470
 conjured the national agricultural strike in that 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.720
 today according to them they have not been 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.700
 fulfilled one thing of sitting down to talk 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.280
 but another thing is that resources 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.200
 arrive in the territories they assure that 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.690
 his fight is for the defense of the earth 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.040
 agriculture is not subsidy only the 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.250
 agro is defending life in those 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.560
 territories the agro is to defend the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.479
 natural resources at this time the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.070
 mining policy is damaging the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.380
 territories to frost peasants and 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.420
 indigenous people why we protest without 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.100
 However, some protesters did not have 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.929
 clear why they were protesting as 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.290
 evidenced today in the champion's coliseum 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.509
 you come to support what 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.679
 and 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.679
 what is it that comes to do 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.720
 the agrarian strike and others tried 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.000
 avoid talking until it is 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.590
 forbidden to do that kind of people because 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.390
 is forbidden so is my job that 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.670
 they have to do that they are the spokespersons of 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.140

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.920

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.360
 the representatives of this strike have 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.129
 drafted a new list of requests 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.569
 which will be presented by the president of 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.980

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.450

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.670
 again a national strike will enter 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.439

 noted that the civilian government has 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.670
 fulfilled the commitments to the 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.019
 farmers assured that what is needed 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.370

 not everything is fulfilled not everything can be 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.610
 meet in the short term but the 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:11.599
 inventory on the fulfillment of those 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.730
 commitments is highly positive and 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.430
 I have instructed the ministers 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.200
 to continue that dialogue continue 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.250
 in that process 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.410
 and information and conversation with 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.830
 different agricultural sectors and 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:31.170
 farmers 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.170
 the fulfillment of what was agreed 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.950
 in news snail the news have 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.900
 context to the manifestations of the 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.120
 farmers have had a figure that 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.790
 it stands out every time that protests and 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.560
 negotiations is about Cesar Pachon to 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.239
 who has been seen even with the 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.159
 mayor gustavo petro in his speeches 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.530
 against the revocation of the institution 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.470
 what to be a prominent leader a segment 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.849
 of the peasants now he rejects that 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.079
 does not represent us when before the 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.480
 congress showed the crisis 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.310
 agricultural sector, its image was strengthened 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.019
 the August strike but once 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.450
 installed the dialogue tables 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.540
 pachón wanted to be political caudillo say 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.579
 his old friends got excited 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.220
 that all the Colombian people were with 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.840
 him and decided nothing less than to jump in 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.760
 the presence the republica take advantage 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.039
 questions no longer face me as of 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.410
 Senator, I do not think I could be 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.060
 Minister of Agriculture when he accepted 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.190
 that to participate in a table 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.440
 dialogue of agreement must have 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.410
 left flag or I'll stick it to you 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.960
 mobile as I said I have a line 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.200
 direct with cuba pachón accepted that yes 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.790
 I aspire but he explained 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.320
 we collected the signatures but the 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.180
 antidemocracy the country did not allow 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.190
 because he asked us for more than 2 billion 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.840
 of pesos to back those signatures 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.270
 its detractors affirm that pachón is 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.530
 was left with 500 pesos of each package 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.470
 the growers sold him to 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.360
 Caesar government defended that he with the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.130
 brother get to handle that program 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.290
 purchasing potatoes and that 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.250
 keep the money to each of the 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.650
 peasants and then do not render accounts 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.270
 that his brother picked up the money does not look 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.680
 my brother what he did can be taken care of 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.600
 to organize all the logistics on 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.660
 the whole issue of cargo and transport 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.010
 money transports and routes the money is 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.080
 picked up with the line mates 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.390
 from paper to from boyacá and right there 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.280
 he invested in that very same subject 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.260
 the other fact that divided the papers 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.780
 was the faction decision to accompany 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.820
 a gustavo petro caused laughter cause 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.130
 uneasiness caused sadness 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.010
 stand on the balcony with petro to name 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.990
 of all Colombian farmers 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:40.500
 another disappointment has gone to Havana not 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.330
 no mister accusers no longer then there if not 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.099
 He did not leave the country or never 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.319
 the course of the papers can be defined 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.699
 next Wednesday if both groups 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:49.800
 They decide to accept the invitation of the 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.389
