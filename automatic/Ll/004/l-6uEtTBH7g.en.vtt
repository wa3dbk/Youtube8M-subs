00:00:00.628 --> 00:00:01.835
 In this video I want 

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:05.202
 to work with rules and numbers. 

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:07.524
 In particular, rules by which we move from 

00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:10.903
 one number to the next number in a row. 

00:00:10.903 --> 00:00:13.596
 Here, in this pink color, 

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:18.263
 I'm going from 4 to 25, up to 46, to 67. 

00:00:18.263 --> 00:00:20.393
 What is the rule here? 

00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:22.831
 How did I get from 4 to 25? 

00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:25.502
 and can I get the same way from 25 to 46 

00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:30.308
 and from 46 to 67? I could do much more. 

00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:31.887
 Well, there are several possible approaches. 

00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:33.986
 I see 4 and 25, let's think, 

00:00:33.986 --> 00:00:38.026
 25 obviously is not a multiple of 4. 

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:43.026
 Another way to get from 4 to 25 is to add 21. 

00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:48.041
 Let's check if it adds 21, 4 plus 21 is 25. 

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:51.052
 If you have to go from 25 to 46, 

00:00:51.052 --> 00:00:53.025
 I'll add 21 again. 

00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:55.835
 It seems that to get from one number to the next 

00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:57.483
 just add ... 

00:00:57.483 --> 00:00:59.573
 I wrote 12 inadvertently, 21. 

00:00:59.573 --> 00:01:02.684
 I just add 21 again and again. 

00:01:02.684 --> 00:01:07.166
 Then 46 plus 21 is 67. 

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:11.159
 And if I have to go on, if I add 21 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.110
 I will get 89. 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.110
 If I add 21 to it, I'll get 110. 

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:22.955
 I could keep going. 

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:27.157
 I could add 21 again and again. 

00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:31.522
 The rule here is that I add 21. 

00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:34.471
 And what is the rule for the row here in green? 

00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:36.607
 At first I am tempted to say 

00:01:36.607 --> 00:01:40.276
 3 plus 3 is 6. 

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:43.480
 But then I do not add 3 to get there 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.290
 from 6 to 12, add 6. 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.147
 And then, to get from 12 to 24, 

00:01:48.147 --> 00:01:51.096
 I do not add 6, I add 12. 

00:01:51.096 --> 00:01:54.463
 So each time I add 2 times more. 

00:01:54.463 --> 00:01:58.389
 But perhaps the easier rule is, 

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:59.884
 Another way to get from 3 to 6 is 

00:01:59.884 --> 00:02:03.738
 not add 3, but multiply by 2. 

00:02:03.738 --> 00:02:06.501
 So multiply by 2 to go from 3 to 6 

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:10.030
 and if I multiply by 2 again, I will switch from 6 to 12. 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.818
 6 times 2 is 12. 

00:02:11.818 --> 00:02:14.929
 If I multiply 2 again, I will get to 24. 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:19.457
 2 times 12 is 24. I could go on and on. 

00:02:19.457 --> 00:02:23.520
 2 times 24 is 48, 96, I could go on and on. 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.353
 The rule here is not the addition of a particular number, 

00:02:26.353 --> 00:02:30.927
 but is the multiplication of each member by a given number, 

00:02:30.927 --> 00:02:33.760
 2 in this case to move to the next member. 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.102
 3 times 2 is 6, 6 times 2 is 12, 12 times 2 is 24. 

00:02:38.102 --> 00:02:40.076
 Okay, let's look at the last line. 

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.908
 The first two articles here are the same, 3 and 6. 

00:02:42.908 --> 00:02:46.117
 The first two numbers here. 

00:02:46.117 --> 00:02:47.833
 I could guess that the rule is a multiplication of 2, 

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:51.223
 but then, to move from 6 to 9, I do not multiply by 2. 

00:02:51.223 --> 00:02:53.429
 But probably just add 3 here. 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:55.937
 So from 3 to 6, I just added 3. 

00:02:55.937 --> 00:02:59.327
 Then from 6 to 9, add 3 again. 

00:02:59.327 --> 00:03:02.276
 And then from 9 to 12, add 3 again. 

00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:03.506
 So in that line it really seems 

00:03:03.506 --> 00:03:06.432
 just add 3 each time. 

00:03:06.432 --> 00:03:09.633
 The whole thing is seeing there is something I can do, 

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:12.142
 what I can do over and over again, 

00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:13.814
 to move from one number to 

00:03:13.814 --> 00:03:16.786
 the next number in a similar row. 

00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:18.637
 What you need to make sure, even if you think, 

00:03:18.637 --> 00:03:20.480
 that you know how to get from the first number to the second number, 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.175
 you have to make sure that the same way, 

00:03:22.175 --> 00:03:24.961
 when you move from the second to the third 

00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:27.074
 and from the third to the fourth. 

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:28.258
 We did it here. 

00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:31.323
 In the first row of numbers we just add 21 each time. 

00:03:31.323 --> 00:03:33.274
 In this we multiply by 2 each time. 

00:03:33.274 --> 00:03:37.083
 In this we add 3 each time.
