think it is the box he gave me I was

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
think it is the box he gave me I was
like<00:01:50.709> oh<00:01:51.709> she's<00:01:52.189> got<00:01:52.369> no<00:01:52.549> pistol<00:01:53.000> either<00:01:53.149> so

like oh she's got no pistol either so

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.559 
like oh she's got no pistol either so
the<00:01:54.500> suppressed<00:01:54.920> mp5<00:01:55.609> might<00:01:55.939> be<00:01:56.149> a<00:01:56.179> good<00:01:56.359> want

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
the suppressed mp5 might be a good want

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.419 
the suppressed mp5 might be a good want
to<00:01:56.689> go<00:01:56.840> with<00:01:57.079> because<00:01:57.319> if<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.099> put<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.340> on

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
to go with because if you put it on

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.059 
to go with because if you put it on
first<00:01:58.640> fire<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.539> named<00:02:00.079> for<00:02:00.110> headshots<00:02:00.500> it's

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
first fire and named for headshots it's

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.089 
first fire and named for headshots it's
quiet<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:02.239> m4a1<00:02:02.989> suppressed<00:02:03.470> is<00:02:03.649> probable

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
quiet the m4a1 suppressed is probable

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.600 
quiet the m4a1 suppressed is probable
definite<00:02:05.469> but<00:02:06.469> then<00:02:06.649> I<00:02:06.829> think<00:02:07.099> the<00:02:07.159> campfire

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
definite but then I think the campfire

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.089 
definite but then I think the campfire
skills<00:02:07.939> might<00:02:08.179> be<00:02:08.299> useful<00:02:08.420> or<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.769> extra

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
skills might be useful or the extra

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.039 
skills might be useful or the extra
