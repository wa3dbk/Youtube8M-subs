that like that the entire team just
pretty<00:00:37.920> much<00:00:38.070> falls<00:00:38.370> apart<00:00:38.760> because<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.600> not

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
pretty much falls apart because it's not

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.350 
pretty much falls apart because it's not
there's<00:00:40.410> not<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.590> decent<00:00:41.010> medic<00:00:41.280> able<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.120> heal

enough people be a bright time and uber

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.510 
enough people be a bright time and uber
and<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.239> am<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.629> generally<00:00:46.289> really<00:00:46.980> bad<00:00:47.219> at<00:00:47.370> it

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the second reason is because I really

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.400 
the second reason is because I really
really<00:00:52.440> don't<00:00:53.390> coordinate<00:00:54.390> with<00:00:54.899> people<00:00:55.350> i

really don't coordinate with people i

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.369 
really don't coordinate with people i
dislike<00:00:56.600> i<00:00:59.030> basically<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.359> I'm<00:01:00.870> playing<00:01:01.079> with

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.660 
dislike i basically if I'm playing with
somebody<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.739> i<00:01:01.920> dislike<00:01:02.160> i<00:01:02.520> will

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
somebody that i dislike i will

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.969 
somebody that i dislike i will
intentionally<00:01:03.000> go<00:01:03.960> against<00:01:04.320> them<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.739> hope

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
intentionally go against them and hope

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.070 
intentionally go against them and hope
that<00:01:05.250> they<00:01:05.400> die<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> lot<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.630> because<00:01:06.780> I'm<00:01:07.049> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that they die a lot just because I'm a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.380 
that they die a lot just because I'm a
horrible<00:01:07.380> person<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.880> think<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.270> they

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
at the med

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.550 
at the med
being<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:13.860> medic<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:15.270> think<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.290> people

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
being a medic and I think that people

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.390 
being a medic and I think that people
who<00:02:17.100> do<00:02:17.700> enjoy<00:02:18.240> playing<00:02:18.780> as<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.200> medic<00:02:19.710> can

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
who do enjoy playing as the medic can

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.520 
who do enjoy playing as the medic can
play<00:02:21.000> medic<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.690> they're<00:02:21.840> quite<00:02:22.050> good<00:02:22.080> at<00:02:22.410> it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
play medic and they're quite good at it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.520 
play medic and they're quite good at it
and<00:02:22.680> they<00:02:22.800> manage<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.160> do<00:02:23.850> awesome<00:02:24.780> things<00:02:24.930> and

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
and they manage to do awesome things and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.560 
and they manage to do awesome things and
I<00:02:25.860> think<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.220> anybody<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.910> cannot<00:02:27.180> be<00:02:27.330> a

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
I think that anybody that cannot be a

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.190 
I think that anybody that cannot be a
decent<00:02:28.020> medic<00:02:28.620> then<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.130> salute<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.090> guys<00:02:30.330> so
