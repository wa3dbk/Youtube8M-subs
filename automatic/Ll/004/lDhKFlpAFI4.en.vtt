run<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.689> one<00:02:20.870> if<00:02:21.019> you<00:02:21.110> decide<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:22.159> laser

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
run the one if you decide to laser

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.330 
run the one if you decide to laser
scanner<00:02:22.760> track<00:02:23.090> instead<00:02:23.329> of<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.599> old<00:02:23.629> GPS<00:02:24.340> the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
scanner track instead of the old GPS the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.460 
scanner track instead of the old GPS the
laser<00:02:25.610> scanning<00:02:26.090> can<00:02:26.420> get<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.930> accuracy

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
laser scanning can get the accuracy

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.470 
laser scanning can get the accuracy
right<00:02:27.739> down<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.340> within<00:02:28.760> centimeters

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
right down to within centimeters

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.170 
right down to within centimeters
depending<00:02:29.900> on<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.079> laser<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:30.709> use<00:02:31.180> GPS

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
depending on the laser that you use GPS

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.949 
depending on the laser that you use GPS
it's<00:02:32.900> still<00:02:33.260> well<00:02:34.220> even<00:02:34.849> the<00:02:34.940> best<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.510> GPS

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
it's still well even the best of the GPS

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.800 
it's still well even the best of the GPS
systems<00:02:36.409> a<00:02:36.620> good<00:02:36.980> for<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.459> meter<00:02:37.730> or<00:02:37.879> so<00:02:38.000> it's

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
systems a good for a meter or so it's

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.720 
systems a good for a meter or so it's
not<00:02:39.019> going<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.260> give<00:02:39.349> you<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.500> axial<00:02:40.010> accuracy

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
not going to give you the axial accuracy

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.849 
not going to give you the axial accuracy
across<00:02:40.879> your<00:02:41.329> trap<00:02:41.599> it's<00:02:42.349> still<00:02:42.620> going<00:02:42.769> to

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
across your trap it's still going to

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.220 
across your trap it's still going to
have<00:02:43.010> great<00:02:43.519> there<00:02:43.819> so<00:02:44.060> over<00:02:44.510> heals<00:02:44.750> all<00:02:44.989> hand

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
things like camber and this you would go

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.149

a camera with the laser scan that they

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.160 
a camera with the laser scan that they
give<00:03:00.739> you<00:03:00.829> a<00:03:00.859> point<00:03:01.129> that<00:03:01.400> are<00:03:01.700> maybe<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.720> moons

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
give you a point that are maybe of moons

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.430 
give you a point that are maybe of moons
of<00:03:03.290> points<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:03.980> then<00:03:04.579> I<00:03:04.819> literally<00:03:05.810> just<00:03:05.959> code

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
of points and then I literally just code

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.949 
of points and then I literally just code
all<00:03:06.950> strapped<00:03:07.310> in<00:03:07.340> order<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.879> lay<00:03:08.329> down<00:03:08.359> a<00:03:08.599> crap

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
all strapped in order to lay down a crap

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.589 
all strapped in order to lay down a crap
out<00:03:09.139> of<00:03:09.170> those<00:03:09.349> points<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:11.180> tractors

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
out of those points and the tractors

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.800 
out of those points and the tractors
comes<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:12.019> life<00:03:12.220> okay<00:03:13.220> so<00:03:13.280> what<00:03:14.269> sort<00:03:14.420> of<00:03:14.480> costs

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
comes to life okay so what sort of costs

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.809 
comes to life okay so what sort of costs
are<00:03:14.900> involved<00:03:15.109> in<00:03:15.349> this<00:03:15.639> depends<00:03:16.639> on<00:03:16.730> the

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
are involved in this depends on the

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.449 
are involved in this depends on the
laser<00:03:17.000> scanner<00:03:17.389> you<00:03:17.569> want<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.810> use<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.430> a

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
laser scanner you want to use this is a

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.900 
laser scanner you want to use this is a
proof<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.269> concept<00:03:20.919> trial<00:03:21.919> for<00:03:22.220> me<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:22.609> I

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
proof of concept trial for me so I

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.670 
proof of concept trial for me so I
pretty<00:03:23.540> much<00:03:23.629> use<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:24.109> cheapest<00:03:24.470> laser

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
pretty much use the cheapest laser

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.259 
pretty much use the cheapest laser
scanner<00:03:25.099> I<00:03:25.220> could<00:03:25.519> which<00:03:25.669> is<00:03:25.849> in<00:03:26.120> the

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
scanner I could which is in the

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.349 
scanner I could which is in the
thousands<00:03:26.690> of<00:03:26.840> Thor's<00:03:27.579> but<00:03:28.579> you<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:29.150> can

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
thousands of Thor's but you you can

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.610 
thousands of Thor's but you you can
spend<00:03:30.099> ten<00:03:31.099> thousand<00:03:31.489> dollars<00:03:31.819> more<00:03:32.319> hiring<00:03:33.319> a
