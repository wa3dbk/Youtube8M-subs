00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
however the problem is that because so

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.340 
however the problem is that because so
tightly<00:01:50.550> knit<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.060> there's<00:01:51.540> only<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.110> have

no means of flanking there is no other
approaches<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.350> can<00:01:58.530> get<00:01:58.710> through<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.310> it's

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
approaches you can get through so it's

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.540 
approaches you can get through so it's
really<00:02:00.150> about<00:02:00.900> playing<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.770> terrain<00:02:02.250> and

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
really about playing the terrain and

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.670 
really about playing the terrain and
working<00:02:03.420> your<00:02:03.450> way<00:02:03.630> down<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:04.080> enemy<00:02:04.290> tanks

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
working your way down the enemy tanks

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.130 
working your way down the enemy tanks
and<00:02:04.830> rolling<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.580> out<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.880> very<00:02:06.210> slow<00:02:06.720> and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
and rolling it out and very slow and

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.710 
and rolling it out and very slow and
meticulous<00:02:08.100> fight<00:02:08.759> whoever<00:02:09.239> does<00:02:09.509> more

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
meticulous fight whoever does more

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.600 
meticulous fight whoever does more
shooting<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.380> more<00:02:10.590> accurate<00:02:11.040> shooting<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
shooting and more accurate shooting and

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.210 
shooting and more accurate shooting and
is<00:02:12.090> more<00:02:12.300> careful<00:02:12.750> with<00:02:12.870> their<00:02:13.050> tanks<00:02:13.500> HP<00:02:13.980> is

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
is more careful with their tanks HP is

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.479 
is more careful with their tanks HP is
usually<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
usually the

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.530 
usually the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
so entire tumor cells in this area a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.660 
so entire tumor cells in this area a
reason<00:02:21.989> why<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.230> does<00:02:22.500> because<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.159> tiger<00:02:23.459> 2

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
reason why it does because the tiger 2

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.080 
reason why it does because the tiger 2
is<00:02:25.189> does<00:02:26.189> best<00:02:26.609> honestly<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.810> mid<00:02:28.590> range<00:02:29.090> you

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
is does best honestly in mid range you

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.030 
is does best honestly in mid range you
can't<00:02:30.420> snap<00:02:30.719> the<00:02:30.870> tank<00:02:31.109> at<00:02:31.230> long<00:02:31.409> range<00:02:31.739> but

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
can't snap the tank at long range but

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.179 
can't snap the tank at long range but
the<00:02:32.189> tiger<00:02:32.519> 2<00:02:32.730> s<00:02:32.790> got<00:02:33.000> such<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.269> high<00:02:33.480> HP<00:02:33.689> cool

the tiger 2 s got such a high HP cool

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.699 
the tiger 2 s got such a high HP cool

especially<00:06:09.980> when<00:06:10.490> I'm<00:06:10.580> tired<00:06:10.940> like<00:06:11.570> I<00:06:11.720> was

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
especially when I'm tired like I was

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.980 
especially when I'm tired like I was
playing<00:06:12.260> this<00:06:12.470> game<00:06:12.710> I<00:06:13.060> have<00:06:14.060> a<00:06:14.090> tendency<00:06:14.450> to

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
playing this game I have a tendency to

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.190 
playing this game I have a tendency to
be<00:06:15.200> overly<00:06:15.730> aggressive<00:06:16.730> in<00:06:17.020> critical<00:06:18.020> moments

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
be overly aggressive in critical moments

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.170 
be overly aggressive in critical moments
and<00:06:18.680> that's<00:06:19.130> going<00:06:19.250> to<00:06:19.310> separate<00:06:19.700> good<00:06:19.940> games

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
and that's going to separate good games

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.880 
and that's going to separate good games
from<00:06:20.270> free<00:06:20.540> drinks<00:06:20.840> I've<00:06:20.960> already<00:06:21.140> had<00:06:21.500> a

from free drinks I've already had a
really<00:06:22.340> excellent<00:06:22.670> game<00:06:22.970> have<00:06:23.150> gotten<00:06:23.450> five

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
really excellent game have gotten five

really excellent game have gotten five
kills<00:06:24.050> at<00:06:24.710> this<00:06:24.920> time<00:06:25.160> it<00:06:25.610> should<00:06:25.850> really

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
kills at this time it should really

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.960 
kills at this time it should really
would<00:06:26.210> be<00:06:26.330> wise<00:06:26.600> of<00:06:26.780> me<00:06:26.840> to<00:06:27.650> play<00:06:28.550> a<00:06:28.580> little<00:06:28.760> bit

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
would be wise of me to play a little bit

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.310 
would be wise of me to play a little bit
more<00:06:29.060> conservatively<00:06:29.600> and<00:06:29.720> move<00:06:30.080> back<00:06:30.290> to

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
more conservatively and move back to

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.960 
more conservatively and move back to
cover<00:06:30.650> after<00:06:30.860> killing<00:06:31.190> that<00:06:31.370> artillery<00:06:31.700> piece

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
cover after killing that artillery piece

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.810 
cover after killing that artillery piece
