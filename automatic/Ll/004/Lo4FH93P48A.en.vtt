00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.640
 moment I find them much appreciate 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.310
 many and girls cut in a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.750

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.879
 good I find right now lemons 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.489
 a little bit of red onions and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.550
 sunflower seeds that I soaked 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.420
 before and a lawyer 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.120

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.180
 I take the salad leaves we can 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.880
 put them like that of course whole if 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.409
 you like me I like having 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.060
 small pieces anyway because 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.060
 it's more convenient to just eat 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.700
 I'm going to cut my corn and become 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.260
 simpler 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.810
 three knives and cut like this so 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.410
 it jumps a little in a bowl but we do 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.410
 that in a bowl 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.280

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.630
