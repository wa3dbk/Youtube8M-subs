00:00:51.469 --> 00:01:00.809
 here the main thing is stupid zerg most 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.570
 the main thing is the main thing in this boss 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.549

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.729

 miles of attack him very strong therefore 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.630
 much damage you won't get from this here 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.940
 the main thing is to escape 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:57.750

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.990
