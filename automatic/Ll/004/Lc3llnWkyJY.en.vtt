 and it is precisely this that is currently falling apart from a school and helium 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.630
 internal Hoofddorp from 11 meters 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.350
 m he is also determined if the moment there that means this preference went 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.410
 because after all, something more separate appiah counts it more 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.420
 and a half-blood the pop band Olympic champion 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.080
