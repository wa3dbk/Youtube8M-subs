00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
hi - so today I'm going to do it to do

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.310 
hi - so today I'm going to do it to do
about<00:00:07.010> getting<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.040> max<00:00:08.990> performance<00:00:09.990> from

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
about getting the max performance from

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.060 
about getting the max performance from
your<00:00:11.269> graphic<00:00:12.269> cards<00:00:12.599> with<00:00:12.780> catalyst<00:00:13.710> control

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
your graphic cards with catalyst control

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.109 
your graphic cards with catalyst control
center<00:00:14.429> because<00:00:14.759> some<00:00:15.599> people<00:00:15.929> get<00:00:16.640> lower<00:00:17.640> fps

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
center because some people get lower fps

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.410 
center because some people get lower fps
maybe<00:00:18.660> because<00:00:18.869> they<00:00:19.199> don't<00:00:19.410> up<00:00:20.090> plug<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
maybe because they don't up plug in the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.060 
maybe because they don't up plug in the
laptop<00:00:21.600> 20<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:23.250> play<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> video<00:00:23.789> game<00:00:24.060> or<00:00:25.070> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
the rep did the right configuration for

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.690 
the rep did the right configuration for
the<00:00:33.300> graphic<00:00:33.719> cards<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.550> catalyst<00:00:35.550> control

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700

go anyway so we said I get the same from

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.100 
go anyway so we said I get the same from
15<00:00:49.789> 5000<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.500> ain't<00:00:52.739> until<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.550> 1780<00:00:54.480> Balram

and getting 25 - 25 PS why thanks so the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.920 
and getting 25 - 25 PS why thanks so the
reason<00:01:10.740> might<00:01:10.950> be<00:01:10.979> because<00:01:11.479> in<00:01:12.479> catalyst

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
reason might be because in catalyst

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.070 
reason might be because in catalyst
control<00:01:13.080> center<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.939> didn't<00:01:17.780> put<00:01:18.780> this

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
control center you didn't put this

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.969 
control center you didn't put this
option<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.890> max<00:01:20.610> performance<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:22.350> maximize

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
option on max performance to maximize

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.719 
option on max performance to maximize
your<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:24.229> actual<00:01:25.229> FPS<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.979> get<00:01:26.159> from<00:01:26.460> your

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
your the actual FPS you get from your

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:34.690 
your the actual FPS you get from your
game<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.560> use<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.360> full<00:01:33.079> full-on

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
game you have to use the full full-on

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.200 
game you have to use the full full-on
capacitive<00:01:35.720> computer<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.829> say<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:38.970> on

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
capacitive computer so just say this on

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.300 
capacitive computer so just say this on
maximize<00:01:39.930> performance<00:01:40.229> when<00:01:40.829> plugging<00:01:41.130> in

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
maximize performance when plugging in

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.999 
maximize performance when plugging in
and<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.360> way<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:43.439> doesn't<00:01:43.680> matter

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and on that way it doesn't matter

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.749 
and on that way it doesn't matter
because<00:01:44.189> no<00:01:45.119> play<00:01:45.360> plays<00:01:46.130> without<00:01:47.130> getting

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the computer plugins it's a really bad

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.389 
the computer plugins it's a really bad

application will get low FPS you like
for<00:02:21.390> example<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:24.150> take<00:02:24.959> on<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:26.520> top<00:02:28.069> daughter

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
for example I take on the top daughter

for example I take on the top daughter
you<00:02:31.739> say<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.099> on<00:02:33.050> high<00:02:34.050> performance<00:02:34.310> or<00:02:36.530> if<00:02:37.530> you

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
you say it on high performance or if you

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.690 
you say it on high performance or if you
don't<00:02:37.860> see<00:02:38.129> it<00:02:38.510> see<00:02:39.510> here<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.050> just<00:02:40.260> go<00:02:40.530> to

don't see it see here you just go to

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.630 
don't see it see here you just go to
