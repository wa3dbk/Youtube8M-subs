me it took about two to three minutes

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.330

these sort of basic things and so after

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.070

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
that in the interview

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.680 
that in the interview
my<00:01:52.770> visa<00:01:53.040> was<00:01:53.190> issued<00:01:53.580> within<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.300> two<00:01:54.510> days

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
my visa was issued within like two days

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.040 
my visa was issued within like two days
so<00:01:55.470> from<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:56.010> first<00:01:56.700> day<00:01:56.970> of<00:01:57.210> applicant<00:01:57.840> this

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
so from the first day of applicant this

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.290 
so from the first day of applicant this
application<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.830> me<00:01:59.130> getting<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.760> visa<00:01:59.940> from

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
application to me getting the visa from

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.830 
application to me getting the visa from
the<00:02:01.040> American<00:02:02.040> Center<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.610> was<00:02:02.850> about<00:02:03.150> all

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the American Center it was about all

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.860 
the American Center it was about all
together<00:02:04.380> around<00:02:05.130> 15<00:02:05.520> days<00:02:05.760> so<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:06.510> a<00:02:06.660> very

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
together around 15 days so it's a very

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.300 
together around 15 days so it's a very
quick<00:02:07.110> process<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> don't<00:02:08.010> think<00:02:08.190> it's

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
quick process so I don't think it's

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.970 
quick process so I don't think it's
anything<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.670> worry<00:02:08.760> about
