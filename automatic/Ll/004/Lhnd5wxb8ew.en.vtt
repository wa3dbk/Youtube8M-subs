00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
remake of it for the PSP to make it no

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.090 
remake of it for the PSP to make it no
portable<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.410> whatnot<00:00:13.710> but<00:00:13.920> then<00:00:14.929> you<00:00:15.929> know

since they're not going to do it I took

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.800 
since they're not going to do it I took
it<00:00:19.410> upon<00:00:19.740> myself<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:20.160> make<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> PSP

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
it upon myself to make it for the PSP

it upon myself to make it for the PSP
anyways<00:00:22.500> what<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.740> did<00:00:22.949> was<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.340> took<00:00:23.369> my<00:00:23.670> old

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
anyways what I did was I took my old

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.040 
anyways what I did was I took my old
battery<00:00:24.980> took<00:00:25.980> pin<00:00:26.519> five<00:00:26.789> out<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.630> EPROM

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
battery took pin five out of the EPROM

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.950 
battery took pin five out of the EPROM
chip<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.560> had<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.130> battery<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.779> I<00:00:30.779> went

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
chip that had this battery and I went

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.540 
chip that had this battery and I went
ahead<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.410> bought<00:00:31.590> another<00:00:31.619> battery<00:00:32.219> because

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
ahead and bought another battery because

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.840 
ahead and bought another battery because
once<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.630> take<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:36.829> v<00:00:37.829> pin<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.399> EEPROM

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
once you take the v pin of the EEPROM

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.819 
once you take the v pin of the EEPROM
out<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.450> pretty<00:00:40.140> much<00:00:40.230> becomes<00:00:40.530> useless

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
out it just pretty much becomes useless

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.840 
out it just pretty much becomes useless
anyways<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:42.270> put<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.989> here<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.500> you

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
anyways you put this in here and you

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.790 
anyways you put this in here and you
take<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.149> three<00:00:45.629> point<00:00:45.980> seven<00:00:46.980> one<00:00:47.280> m33

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
take the three point seven one m33

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.110 
take the three point seven one m33
firmware<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> downloaded<00:00:50.670> which<00:00:50.969> is

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
firmware that I downloaded which is

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.310 
firmware that I downloaded which is
about<00:00:51.360> 130<00:00:51.780> megabytes<00:00:53.090> put<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.329> here<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:55.079> my

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
about 130 megabytes put it in here on my

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.040 
about 130 megabytes put it in here on my
one<00:00:55.530> gig<00:00:55.739> memory<00:00:55.920> stick<00:00:56.420> put<00:00:57.420> both<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.870> in

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
one gig memory stick put both of this in

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.130 
one gig memory stick put both of this in
here<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:59.000> the<00:01:00.000> process<00:01:01.879> makes<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.329> your

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
here and the process makes it so your

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.429 
here and the process makes it so your
PSP<00:01:04.470> has<00:01:04.949> three<00:01:05.580> point<00:01:05.850> seven<00:01:06.510> one<00:01:06.780> m33

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
PSP has three point seven one m33

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.390 
PSP has three point seven one m33
firmware<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.270> were<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> let's

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
firmware so I were to do that so let's

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.030 
firmware so I were to do that so let's
check<00:01:11.580> out<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> results<00:01:12.409> put<00:01:13.409> my<00:01:13.530> new<00:01:13.680> battery

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
check out the results put my new battery

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.770 
check out the results put my new battery
in<00:01:18.170> close<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.380> up

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:33.700 

we<00:01:23.780> close<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.110> lights<00:01:30.789> anyways<00:01:31.789> I<00:01:32.750> will<00:01:33.500> be

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
we close the lights anyways I will be

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:42.690 
we close the lights anyways I will be
put<00:01:33.920> my<00:01:34.070> that's<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.850> memory<00:01:35.210> chip<00:01:35.450> here<00:01:35.659> too

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.859 

anyways<00:01:44.710> that<00:01:45.710> was<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:47.119> hard<00:01:47.360> part

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
anyways that was the hard part

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.169

as<00:02:16.760> an<00:02:16.970> ISO<00:02:17.450> file<00:02:17.890> then<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.160> convert<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:20.000> ISO

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
as an ISO file then you convert the ISO

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.349 
as an ISO file then you convert the ISO
file<00:02:20.780> into<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.530> dot<00:02:22.370> PBB<00:02:23.269> data<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:26.239> will

file into a dot PBB data and you will

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.259 
file into a dot PBB data and you will
get<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.070> that<00:02:28.070> makes<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.519> compatible<00:02:28.940> with
