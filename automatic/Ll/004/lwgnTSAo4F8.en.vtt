00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
over the past few years at one point and

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.230 
over the past few years at one point and
even<00:01:43.690> lit<00:01:44.229> guys<00:01:44.470> on<00:01:44.650> fire<00:01:44.950> it<00:01:45.580> exploded

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
even lit guys on fire it exploded

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.480 
even lit guys on fire it exploded
shrapnel<00:01:46.930> and<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:47.800> know<00:01:47.890> we<00:01:48.040> spent<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.460> very

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
shrapnel and you know we spent a very

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.300 
shrapnel and you know we spent a very
long<00:01:48.880> time<00:01:49.710> manipulating<00:01:50.710> you<00:01:50.860> know<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.100> best

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
long time manipulating you know the best

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.550

way<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:52.180> a<00:01:52.210> play<00:01:52.630> with<00:01:52.659> this<00:01:52.990> weapon<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.500> I

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
way to a play with this weapon and I

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.410 
way to a play with this weapon and I
think<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:53.979> we've<00:01:54.159> definitely<00:01:54.610> found<00:01:54.880> the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
think that we've definitely found the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.960 
think that we've definitely found the
bullet<00:01:55.630> storminess<00:01:56.229> of<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.610> charge

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
bullet storminess of it and the charge

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.960 
bullet storminess of it and the charge
shot<00:01:58.240> for<00:01:58.630> this<00:01:58.780> gun<00:01:59.050> is<00:01:59.290> actually<00:02:00.190> a<00:02:00.399> cannon

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
shot for this gun is actually a cannon

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.790 
shot for this gun is actually a cannon
ball<00:02:01.119> that<00:02:01.330> bounces<00:02:01.780> in<00:02:01.840> place<00:02:02.229> that<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:02.679> can

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
ball that bounces in place that you can

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.669 
ball that bounces in place that you can
also<00:02:03.039> interact<00:02:03.640> with<00:02:04.060> so<00:02:04.750> once<00:02:05.110> it's<00:02:05.259> bounced

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
also interact with so once it's bounced

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.560 
also interact with so once it's bounced
once<00:02:05.920> if<00:02:06.160> you<00:02:06.280> hold<00:02:06.520> down<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.820> trigger<00:02:07.030> it'll

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
once if you hold down the trigger it'll

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.990 
once if you hold down the trigger it'll
continue<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:08.050> bounce<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:08.950> can<00:02:09.190> do

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
continue to bounce and so you can do

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.390 
continue to bounce and so you can do
that<00:02:10.119> around<00:02:10.269> corners<00:02:10.810> or<00:02:11.080> try<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.010> flank<00:02:12.220> the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
that around corners or try to flank the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.520 
that around corners or try to flank the
enemy<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.760> interesting<00:02:13.180> ways<00:02:13.390> this<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.380> also

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
enemy and interesting ways this is also

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.930 
enemy and interesting ways this is also
one<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.980> first<00:02:15.160> levels<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.550> we<00:02:15.670> started

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
one of the first levels that we started

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.729 
one of the first levels that we started
toying<00:02:16.180> with<00:02:16.450> kicking<00:02:16.840> guys<00:02:17.080> over<00:02:17.380> ledges

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
toying with kicking guys over ledges

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.520 
toying with kicking guys over ledges
when<00:02:18.640> when<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.000> first<00:02:19.209> prototype<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.140> you

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
when when I first prototype it and you

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.440 
when when I first prototype it and you
know<00:02:20.620> adding<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.040> scream<00:02:21.430> as<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.910> guys<00:02:22.060> fly

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
know adding the scream as the guys fly

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.330 
know adding the scream as the guys fly
down<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:23.019> then<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.260> became<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.560> core<00:02:24.010> game

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
down and then that became a core game

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.360 
down and then that became a core game
mechanic<00:02:24.760> we<00:02:24.940> wanted<00:02:25.269> levels<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.890> had<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.100> lot

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
mechanic we wanted levels that had a lot

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.160 
mechanic we wanted levels that had a lot
of<00:02:27.400> ledges<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.090> she<00:02:28.360> could<00:02:28.480> kick<00:02:28.720> guys<00:02:28.930> off

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
of ledges that she could kick guys off

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.890 
of ledges that she could kick guys off
of<00:02:29.410> if<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:30.010> chose<00:02:30.300> now<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:31.360> can<00:02:31.600> see<00:02:31.810> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
of if you so chose now you can see the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.770 
of if you so chose now you can see the
balance<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.380> a<00:02:32.830> cannon<00:02:33.040> ball<00:02:33.220> game<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:34.269> bounces

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
balance of a cannon ball game it bounces

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.690 
balance of a cannon ball game it bounces
in<00:02:34.930> place<00:02:35.140> multiple<00:02:35.650> times<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.160> allows<00:02:36.519> you

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
in place multiple times and allows you

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.370 
in place multiple times and allows you
to<00:02:36.880> kick<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.299> me<00:02:37.600> shit<00:02:37.810> around<00:02:38.079> in<00:02:38.290> at
