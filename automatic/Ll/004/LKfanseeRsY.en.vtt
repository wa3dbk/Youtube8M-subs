been<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> toughest<00:00:35.880> war<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:36.660> not<00:00:36.840> not

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200

pushovers either the advancing DC faces

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.100 
pushovers either the advancing DC faces
so<00:00:40.760> in<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.969> base<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.450> know<00:00:42.510> there<00:00:42.750> was<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> giant

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
so in this base I know there was a giant

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.880 
so in this base I know there was a giant
bomb<00:00:43.379> here<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.360> there<00:00:45.360> are<00:00:45.510> Tesla's<00:00:46.320> let's

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
bomb here and there are Tesla's let's

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.910 
bomb here and there are Tesla's let's
see<00:00:47.010> there's<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:48.079> there's<00:00:49.079> one<00:00:49.320> here

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
see there's one here there's one here

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.410 
see there's one here there's one here
there's<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:51.170> here<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.500> here<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:54.210> would

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
there's one here and one here that would

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.959 
there's one here and one here that would
make<00:00:54.780> me<00:00:54.930> assume<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> other<00:00:56.489> giant

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
make me assume that the other giant

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.340 
make me assume that the other giant
bombs<00:00:57.149> are<00:00:57.360> probably<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.879> here

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
bombs are probably here here and here

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.660 
bombs are probably here here and here
this<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> guess<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.340> know<00:01:02.370> that's

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
this is a guess but you know that's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.250 
this is a guess but you know that's
probably<00:01:03.090> where<00:01:03.570> they<00:01:03.660> are<00:01:03.809> that's<00:01:03.989> pretty

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
probably where they are that's pretty

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.399 
probably where they are that's pretty
much<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.439> only<00:01:04.589> spots<00:01:04.979> left<00:01:05.189> um<00:01:06.020> game<00:01:07.020> plan<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
much the only spots left um game plan is

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.070 
much the only spots left um game plan is

he<00:01:35.100> gets<00:01:35.310> out<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.460> probably<00:01:35.700> delay<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.119> wizard

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
he gets out I probably delay this wizard

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.760 
he gets out I probably delay this wizard
but<00:01:36.689> once<00:01:36.869> he<00:01:36.990> starts<00:01:37.290> working<00:01:37.470> his<00:01:37.619> way<00:01:37.650> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
but once he starts working his way to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.530 
but once he starts working his way to
that<00:01:37.890> Tesla<00:01:38.340> i'll<00:01:38.759> drop<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.060> Whizzer<00:01:39.329> down

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that Tesla i'll drop the Whizzer down

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.090 
that Tesla i'll drop the Whizzer down
here<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.869> create<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.259> part<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> funnel

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
here to create this part of the funnel

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.730 
here to create this part of the funnel
so<00:01:41.509> fun<00:01:42.509> will<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.750> created<00:01:43.170> probably<00:01:43.500> wizard

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so fun will be created probably wizard

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.609 
so fun will be created probably wizard
here<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.820> Queen<00:01:45.180> let<00:01:45.840> them<00:01:46.020> start<00:01:46.290> working

facts for this I'm gonna have a jump

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.410 
facts for this I'm gonna have a jump
spell<00:01:50.220> here<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.520> king<00:01:51.000> should<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.299> already

needed and then I'm going to come in

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.190 
needed and then I'm going to come in
basically<00:02:05.939> probably<00:02:06.659> like<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> two<00:02:06.990> finger

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
this which over here in this wizard

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.770 
this which over here in this wizard
versus<00:04:36.430> those<00:04:36.610> hogs<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.240> Queen<00:04:37.509> there<00:04:37.750> I

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.469 
versus those hogs and the Queen there I
think<00:04:38.020> everything<00:04:38.470> is<00:04:38.680> going<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:38.919> clean<00:04:39.190> up

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479
