00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.200
 god people these battles tractor that 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.350
 find themselves today for a 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.780
 new video a bit peculiar 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.120
 since this time it's on ipod and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.190
 iphone 5 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.640
 so it's not about minecraft is neither 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.159
 other video games so today I 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.640
 will show you how to activate and 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:24.319
 especially how to disable voiceover 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.239
 since it is rather difficult 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:29.009
 disable to the savior so for 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.149
 activate it is simple you know you 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:36.629
 go to settings help in general 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:40.710
 you go down and you do 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.530
 accessibility and there in you have 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.449
 voiceover 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.579
 and there the little button there you drag it 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.170
 in the box 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.129
 and then he starts talking 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.559
 he says it's activated he's gonna 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.749
 ask for something the first time so 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.179
 now for the buttons it will take 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:02.670
 when you press it once for 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.130
 normally the initiate he will read it to you 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.360
 so you have to press twice 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.290
 this one kind of back 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.790
 accessibility here to go back in 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.670
 general and to return to the settings 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.170
 so now we're going to leave especially do not 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.530
 do not close the settings now 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:29.010
 doing that and leaving it like this 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.660
 like that good you know so here 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.760
 now that you want to enter 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:39.420
 somewhere for example the app store here 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.180
 you are you click once and he goes 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.850
 he'll just read you tell you what 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.010
 that it is so you sting twice 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.330
 to enter for example and now 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.020
 to disable it is the thing 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.450
 difficult 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.010
 you make adjustments once and will you 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:00.110
 the settings so twice so after 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.110
 general twice 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.440
 and now that's where it's 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.880
 becomes difficult 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.830
 you need the three fingers 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.830
 three fingers to slide down 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.560
 so you have to pick something from the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.210
 skin there you have you have come down 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.130
 the same thing for the pages here it's 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.770
 the same thing if you need to 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.870
 three fingers to slide the page ok good 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:36.080
 I'm not going to do it now we're going 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:41.370
 return to flute setting 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.230
 here you go back a setting was not 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.340
 apologized to web because I was trying 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:51.090
 to click on our party but you 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:55.910
 can click here below but we will 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.960
 come back there go back there 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.550
 here 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.310
 click on settings and twice 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.900
 as we had stayed here we no longer 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.780
 need to go back down when we left 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.330
 to show you the stuff of the pages 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:18.450
 so opportunities and that's the income 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:23.640
 good general twice and now with 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:28.709
 three fingers you must get off that 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.620
 I do not leave his skis 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.239
 annoying voiceover 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.560
 good apart from that you can click on the 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.600
 battery for him to tell you how much 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.680
 you have it on ipod touch especially 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.390
 because there is not the trick of 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.800
 percentage 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.570
 you have to pick something like that 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.769
 for because it's selected on the 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.209
 gall normally and you click two 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:51.440
 times he will go back on the real so 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:54.210
 here is click once on accessibility 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:02.600
 then twice 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:08.340
 the voice over once no here twice 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.200
 and then once here and now 2 and 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.390
 here you have to disable voiceover 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:18.060
 and there you come back as normally and 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.670
 that's how you have your savior 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.450
 disabled does it serve more to 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.360
 nothing voiceover 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.720
 if you know well the magnet well 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.000
 otherwise as the majority of times it is 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.040
 most of the time it is rather 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.540
 annoying I advise you to 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.310
 disable good after you do that 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.900
 you want so it was battle 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.300
