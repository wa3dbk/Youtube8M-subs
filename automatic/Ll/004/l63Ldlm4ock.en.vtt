00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.660
 hello you love i have a little one 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:13.340
 rallye for you and that's about it 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.650
 this maybelline green new town make up 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.980
 I do not know if we know that already 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.230
 with certainty I have times 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.300
 just got to test how 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.189
 That's because I think you know 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.189
 just get used to this normal way of 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.300
 make up these liquid make ups but so 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.860
 a look is relatively new and 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.210
 does not know as I thought 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.769
 then I'll just give it a try 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.660
 I got the color of 40 it 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.329
 is it really tragic even today 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.340
 today I do not wear as today 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.840
 I do not wear it I have that 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.859
 Definitely two weeks at a stretch now 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.550
 used to tell you how that is 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:58.460
 So I think that that at the 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.909
 price that costs 12 euro 45 I think 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.330
 here in the dm thus around the 12 to 13 euro each 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.670
 on where you probably think I and 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.880
 Of course a good price actually 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.280
 So a bit much 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:20.030
 of course, if you stop the foam from 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:22.400
 this is something new and yes ne 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.890
 of course something cool new like that and but 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.830
 Nevertheless, I find just under 13 euros for one 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.610
 make up what goes pretty fast 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:35.060
 because I think by this totally 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.680
 These mountains are water and you develop 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.420
 feels that on the hand and it comes 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.340
 Hold relatively many products from mine 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.810
 opinion of where to stop in hindsight 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.220
 still a lot of facial tissues 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.780
 So I have to delete april 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.020
 relatively fast, yes then I would think 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.210
 always half full with me maybe if 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.700
 It is used regularly for three months 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.460
 maybe two will be enough 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.720
 but not above all 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.950
 I do n't know how to do it 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.030
 it wears on for example with a 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.050
 brush or with the fingers 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.550
 depending on what you want for the brush 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.840
 Of course, it also uses a lot 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.780
 Product, of course, not something like that 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.070
 especially i have got it in the beginning 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.420
 I plotted the times with hands 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.560
 because I thought now let's see 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.690
 look how I like the not so 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.920
 Apply with your hands optimally 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.790
 so really is really good 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.170
 to work in and brush with me 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.400
 that in the last weeks actually like that 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.870
 made that I thought come then 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.840
 if they still work a bit before 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.700
 especially here at the hairline and also 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.260
 as a bit fade and so 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.490
 I prefer the brush 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.780
 one can put oneself for the above 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.130
 so hold for the whole face for the 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.410
 You can really cover your hands 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.700
 but then use it when it's right 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.460
 I find that work with the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.770
 brush a bit more pleasantly like that 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.860
 I can say that the cover power is for 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.569
 So it was enough for me , that's not enough 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.670
 maskenhaft but I still want that 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.560
 it is not like a same tinted one 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.440
 day cream so should cover already 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.069
 and it does so it has one right 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.980
 so nice to have a kind of glow 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.380
 So a really nice sound and 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.900
 perfect for me and also around 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.630
 to cover any skin and riding 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.730
 that was good too 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.830
 and so I can do something about that 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.690
 I only recommend, however, as I said 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.280
 I look at the price decline 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.260
 no pimple open got that's 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.459
 a big plus because I like it very much 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.459
 sensitive skin has something pimple 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.750
 like and something terms and therefore can 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.390
 I recommend it only if people too 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.849
 You can have problems with your skin 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.330
 also on the back of the hand show how 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:44.840
 this is the way to work first 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.670
 shake her there so that by the way 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.849
 this important miserly course 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.160
 up here in the lid and then 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:57.680
 you really have to be careful with the 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.060
 dosage I stop times our 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.280
 variety right on paper has the 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.550
 really look a really fat and 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.170
 then you can work that in 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.300
 Of course, that's a lot if mine 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:13.569
 palm but as you can see i hope 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.569
 you see, it really covers that very well 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:26.330
 super blend and is everything 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.910
 really such a low one I find it 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.650
 is really unfair looks so synonymous 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:36.050
 moisture so it does not feel that way 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:40.160
 Dust-dry looks and so as well 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.750
 you can see it is beautiful 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.910
 So I can only say that it 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.580
 really a great a great make up 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.450
 The product is and what I am too 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.870
 would recommend if you can 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:57.260
 said just under 13 euros or okay for me 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.090
 and then it's really a good one 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.490
 product what I think I can 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.330
 I do not say anything negative though I do 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.470
 have at the moment halt all nose here so to 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.690
 very dry places 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.680
 and that will stop at the make-up 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.090
 sometimes seen that I stop here then 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.740
 got so dry spot but 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.330
 I have all that right now 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.920
 not last days because 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.140
 I mean my nose is still full 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.880
 extra still with an extra cream 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.960
 and I had that 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.060
 not so much if you really 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.800
 I know dry skin parts 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.510
 not if that's so good then so 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.669
 it's always normal skin 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.790
 really great really a good one 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.520
 Product product there are 50 milliliters 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.650
 but as I said I can you 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.160
 Let's say how long I about it 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.960
 I got there when I leaved it 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.330
 said now I can use up video 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.280
 then tell you how 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.930
 long you get around it because 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.080
 I know how many times I used and 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.000
 so and yes so i can just from 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.480
 feeling yes say that when I say so 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.400
 shaking and shaking it like two three 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:05.360
 months will come so I think 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.760
 sometimes with patrice fotofinish or matt 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.870
 I'll come to my roomster on the left 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.030
 Half a year off when I do that 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:16.640
 really regular and therefore used 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:20.180
 So every day and asked the topic 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.660
 foundation which ones on my today 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:33.130
 have that in 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:38.330
 this astor skin match foundation in 103 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:41.570
 Looks like she looks like that 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.970
 I get from the anja area 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.290
 with her to visit her so here to me 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.320
 color is not for me at all 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.420
 this people do not use you times 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:54.290
 I'll try that again for that 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.610
 and I greet you and so join 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.630
 mine is not yellowness I find 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:02.840
 So for me it's really good 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:04.370
 yes, but I'm from time to time mine 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.080
 not another for a household 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.170
 too much to get used to a product 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.340
 I know, there is and is like 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.660

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.180
