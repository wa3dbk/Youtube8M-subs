Twitter about Instagram is how addicted

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.480 
Twitter about Instagram is how addicted
they<00:01:27.749> are<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:28.859> that's<00:01:28.979> what<00:01:29.159> really<00:01:29.310> excites

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
they are and that's what really excites

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.069 
they are and that's what really excites
us<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.359> feel<00:01:30.569> like<00:01:30.659> we've<00:01:30.840> created

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
us because we feel like we've created

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.109 
us because we feel like we've created
something<00:01:31.619> that's<00:01:31.799> easy<00:01:32.069> to<00:01:32.429> use<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.969> it's

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
something that's easy to use and it's

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.029 
something that's easy to use and it's
simple<00:01:33.600> right<00:01:33.959> I<00:01:34.229> think<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.799> thing<00:01:35.009> that

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
simple right I think the thing that

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.889 
simple right I think the thing that
makes<00:01:35.249> us<00:01:35.490> stand<00:01:35.670> apart<00:01:36.029> is<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.450> removed

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
makes us stand apart is that we removed

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.289 
makes us stand apart is that we removed
extraneous<00:01:37.619> features<00:01:37.859> right<00:01:38.399> and<00:01:38.700> and

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
extraneous features right and and

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.389 
extraneous features right and and
focused<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.929> what<00:01:40.170> matters<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.889> so<00:01:41.069> go

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
focused on what matters and so go

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.639 
focused on what matters and so go
through<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> specific<00:01:42.179> sure<00:01:42.779> so<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.259> focused

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
through the specific sure so we focused

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.830 
through the specific sure so we focused
on<00:01:43.770> speed<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.219> upload<00:01:44.579> right<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.119> lot<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.539> people

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
jump in speed for us so we're really

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.459 
jump in speed for us so we're really
excited<00:02:05.819> about<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.539> small<00:02:06.899> things<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.289> we

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
excited about the small things that we

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.350 
excited about the small things that we
concentrate<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.399> make<00:02:08.520> user<00:02:08.789> experience

concentrate on to make user experience

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.530 
concentrate on to make user experience
that<00:02:09.479> much<00:02:09.660> better

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
that much better

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.900 
that much better
specifically<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.750> filters<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.560> have<00:02:13.160> seen<00:02:13.430> so

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
specifically the filters I have seen so

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.560 
specifically the filters I have seen so
many<00:02:15.520> applications<00:02:16.520> that<00:02:16.700> allow<00:02:16.820> for<00:02:17.030> filters

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
many applications that allow for filters

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.810 
many applications that allow for filters
and<00:02:17.780> most<00:02:18.020> people<00:02:18.320> completely<00:02:19.040> ignore<00:02:19.580> them

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
and most people completely ignore them

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.640 
and most people completely ignore them
but<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.330> swear<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.600> don't<00:02:20.840> think<00:02:20.990> anybody<00:02:21.350> sends

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
but I swear I don't think anybody sends

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.860 
but I swear I don't think anybody sends
out<00:02:21.740> an<00:02:21.860> Instagram<00:02:22.340> without<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.700> filter<00:02:22.970> why<00:02:23.810> do

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
out an Instagram without a filter why do

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.360 
out an Instagram without a filter why do
you<00:02:24.050> think<00:02:24.230> people<00:02:24.320> love<00:02:24.680> them<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:24.950> much<00:02:25.100> so

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
you think people love them so much so

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.790 
you think people love them so much so
two<00:02:25.880> things<00:02:26.480> one<00:02:26.660> is<00:02:26.810> about<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.200> third<00:02:27.530> of<00:02:27.650> our

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
two things one is about a third of our

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.380 
two things one is about a third of our
photos<00:02:28.130> don't<00:02:28.370> have<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.640> filter<00:02:28.970> which<00:02:29.210> is

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
photos don't have a filter which is

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.970 
photos don't have a filter which is
really<00:02:29.660> interesting<00:02:29.810> though<00:02:30.380> they<00:02:30.560> may<00:02:30.710> use<00:02:30.950> a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
really interesting though they may use a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.980 
really interesting though they may use a
filter<00:02:31.280> in<00:02:31.490> another<00:02:31.730> application<00:02:31.970> simply<00:02:32.690> not

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
filter in another application simply not

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.930 
filter in another application simply not
you<00:02:33.230> know<00:02:33.350> filter<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.770> internally<00:02:34.250> I<00:02:34.400> think

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
you know filter it internally I think

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.520 
you know filter it internally I think
that<00:02:35.090> people<00:02:35.240> use<00:02:35.510> our<00:02:35.660> filters<00:02:36.050> because<00:02:36.350> one

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
that people use our filters because one

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.350 
that people use our filters because one
we<00:02:36.680> put<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.890> lot<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.340> effort<00:02:37.670> into<00:02:37.820> making<00:02:37.940> them

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
we put a lot of effort into making them

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.450 
we put a lot of effort into making them
good<00:02:38.600> right<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.140> think<00:02:39.350> there's<00:02:39.710> you<00:02:39.980> know<00:02:40.010> a

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
good right I think there's you know a

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.510 
good right I think there's you know a
subjective<00:02:41.300> quality<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:42.020> our<00:02:42.520> judgement

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
subjective quality to our judgement

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.250 
subjective quality to our judgement
about<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.940> filters<00:02:44.270> I<00:02:44.480> think<00:02:44.690> we're<00:02:44.870> really

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
about the filters I think we're really

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.110 
about the filters I think we're really
excited<00:02:45.650> about<00:02:45.860> how<00:02:46.010> hard<00:02:46.430> we've<00:02:46.610> worked<00:02:46.640> on

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
excited about how hard we've worked on

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.480 
excited about how hard we've worked on
that<00:02:47.290> secondly<00:02:48.290> is<00:02:48.500> we<00:02:48.710> put<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.040> as<00:02:49.160> part<00:02:49.430> of

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
that secondly is we put it as part of

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.430 
that secondly is we put it as part of
the<00:02:49.640> flow<00:02:49.880> it's<00:02:50.150> not<00:02:50.330> an<00:02:50.510> extra<00:02:50.870> option<00:02:51.110> it's

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
the flow it's not an extra option it's

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.710 
the flow it's not an extra option it's
simply<00:02:51.740> presented<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.910> you<00:02:53.090> in<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.420> upload

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
simply presented to you in the upload

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.600 
simply presented to you in the upload
process<00:02:53.990> and<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.470> think<00:02:54.500> that's<00:02:54.860> what<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.490> know

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
process and I think that's what you know

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.920 
process and I think that's what you know
makes<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:55.970> lot<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.120> people<00:02:56.480> try<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:56.750> out

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
makes a lot of people try it out

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.160 
makes a lot of people try it out
initially<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.650> use<00:02:57.800> it<00:02:58.570> then<00:02:59.570> very<00:02:59.720> lastly

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
initially and use it then very lastly

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.690 
initially and use it then very lastly

do I think on the web people are

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.840 
do I think on the web people are
typically<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.710> little<00:03:21.920> more<00:03:22.190> lenient<00:03:22.400> because

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
typically a little more lenient because

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.630 
typically a little more lenient because
it<00:03:23.000> is<00:03:23.150> easy<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.630> iterate<00:03:24.140> um<00:03:24.350> do<00:03:25.100> fewer<00:03:25.550> things

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
it is easy to iterate um do fewer things

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.990 
it is easy to iterate um do fewer things
but<00:03:26.300> do<00:03:26.450> that<00:03:26.630> fewer<00:03:27.110> things<00:03:27.380> better<00:03:27.850> focus<00:03:28.850> on

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
but do that fewer things better focus on

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.640 
but do that fewer things better focus on
the<00:03:29.180> details<00:03:29.540> of<00:03:29.720> what<00:03:29.930> matters<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.560> those

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
the details of what matters and those

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.900 
the details of what matters and those
few<00:03:30.920> things<00:03:31.070> and<00:03:31.280> I<00:03:31.340> think<00:03:31.580> you'll<00:03:31.730> succeed

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
few things and I think you'll succeed

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.420 
few things and I think you'll succeed
all<00:03:32.600> right<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:32.870> just<00:03:33.440> very<00:03:33.620> lastly<00:03:34.100> so<00:03:34.250> what

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
all right so just very lastly so what

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.130 
all right so just very lastly so what
would<00:03:34.580> be<00:03:34.700> examples<00:03:35.240> of<00:03:35.330> details<00:03:35.750> that<00:03:35.900> matter

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
would be examples of details that matter

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.660 
would be examples of details that matter
I<00:03:36.230> know<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.440> specified<00:03:37.040> for<00:03:37.250> yours

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
I know you specified for yours

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.120 
I know you specified for yours
but<00:03:38.090> for<00:03:38.270> global<00:03:38.690> issues<00:03:39.050> on<00:03:39.260> on<00:03:39.620> all<00:03:39.860> apps

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
but for global issues on on all apps

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.340 
but for global issues on on all apps
right<00:03:40.730> well<00:03:41.270> I<00:03:41.300> mean<00:03:41.570> simply<00:03:41.840> things<00:03:42.140> like

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
right well I mean simply things like

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.620 
right well I mean simply things like
speed<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:42.860> error<00:03:43.400> cases<00:03:43.910> right<00:03:44.180> like<00:03:44.390> if<00:03:44.540> you

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
speed and error cases right like if you

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.730 
speed and error cases right like if you
can't<00:03:44.870> connect<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.320> network

start crashing right there all sorts of
little<00:04:03.410> details<00:04:03.920> that<00:04:04.040> matter<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.670> really

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
little details that matter and really

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.850 
little details that matter and really
it's<00:04:05.090> up<00:04:05.210> to<00:04:05.360> the<00:04:05.510> specific<00:04:06.020> application<00:04:06.650> but

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
it's up to the specific application but

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.560 
it's up to the specific application but
what<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.010> would<00:04:07.220> do<00:04:07.400> is<00:04:07.580> take<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:07.910> step<00:04:08.180> back<00:04:08.360> and

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
what I would do is take a step back and

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.850 
what I would do is take a step back and
list<00:04:08.750> out<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.080> three<00:04:09.350> things<00:04:09.590> that<00:04:09.800> really

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
list out the three things that really

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.550 
list out the three things that really
matter<00:04:10.280> for<00:04:10.610> your<00:04:10.670> app<00:04:10.850> and<00:04:11.690> make<00:04:11.990> sure<00:04:12.170> every

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
matter for your app and make sure every

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.260 
matter for your app and make sure every
detail<00:04:12.950> about<00:04:13.130> those<00:04:13.400> three<00:04:13.670> things<00:04:13.700> matters

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
detail about those three things matters

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.479 
detail about those three things matters
for<00:04:14.480> us<00:04:14.540> it<00:04:14.780> was<00:04:14.930> speed<00:04:15.400> distribution<00:04:16.400> to

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
for us it was speed distribution to

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.789 
for us it was speed distribution to
other<00:04:16.580> networks<00:04:17.060> and<00:04:17.390> speed<00:04:17.900> of<00:04:18.020> upload<00:04:18.380> right

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
other networks and speed of upload right

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.830 
other networks and speed of upload right
those<00:04:19.460> things<00:04:19.760> mattered<00:04:20.120> so<00:04:20.330> much<00:04:20.390> that<00:04:20.750> we

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
those things mattered so much that we

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.510 
those things mattered so much that we
made<00:04:21.020> sure<00:04:21.049> we<00:04:21.260> nailed<00:04:21.650> them<00:04:21.859> and<00:04:22.070> I<00:04:22.130> think

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
made sure we nailed them and I think

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.710 
made sure we nailed them and I think
that<00:04:22.669> if<00:04:22.790> you<00:04:22.880> read<00:04:23.060> out<00:04:23.210> your<00:04:23.240> three

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
that if you read out your three

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.480 
that if you read out your three
things<00:04:23.900> you<00:04:24.740> know<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:24.920> can<00:04:25.130> be<00:04:25.250> very

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
things you know you can be very

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.090 
things you know you can be very
