00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 will buy a new car like to give 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.549
 stretched and still want to save money. 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.970
 at the time of the post 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.010
 watch and the corn tips jefferson 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.440
 telling us that he's going to buy a 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.410
 car but does not know if it chooses between 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.960
 version with manual or automatic transmission and 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.010
 wants to know which is the best in consumption and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.740
 performance 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.920
 it is jefferson consensus that the changes 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.660
 consumes more fuel 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.070
 deliver a more modest performance of the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.080
 that the manuals 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.930
 on the other hand there are the exchange rates 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.360
 modern robots that allow even a 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.829
 better performance than the manual and 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.320
 lower consumption 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.230
 are the automated changes with double 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.170
 clutch like those of audi porsche and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.379
 Ford for example they bring together the best of 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.110
 two types of automatic quick or 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.039
 manuals and still have the lowest 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.079
 consumption 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.460
 Of course if you look for more 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.520
 pleasure at the wheel 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.620
 do not hesitate choose the manual but 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.799
 I assure you that the automated double 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.110
 clutch will give you the same pleasure with 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.409
 the advantage of in the traffic it works 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.689
 alone decreasing zero car stress 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.390
 You need to calibrate your tire every 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.990
 vehicle must have tire pressure 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.430
 routinely checked 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.990
 regardless of whether it is a zero or 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.420
 used grandpa's money 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.460
 in fact the new ones even require a 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.920
 because the concessionaires 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.350
 They usually do not give much ball to this. 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.659
 delivery the car anyway 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.700
 the correct tire pressure as indicated 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.320
 in the owner's manual and is 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.659
 fundamental for the correct 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.790
 dynamic behavior of the car with 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.250
 brakes more efficient curves more 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.409
 more comfort when rolling 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.020
 besides saving fuel and the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.290
 tire also remember that the tire 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.509
 calibrated is more difficult to drill 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.590
 already davi says he would like to wash 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.079
 the seats of your car but do not know how 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.540
 davi from the fabric of the seats is a 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.969
 cover that lines the structure to wash 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.459
 home counseling using products 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.360
 dry cleaning and can be purchased 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.630
 in hypermarkets and specialized stores 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.540
 to apply the product to 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.480
 and wipe with a dry cloth but have 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.890
 washing stations that do this service 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.170
 dismantling the seats for washing and 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.310
 dry them or that results in a job 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.310
 better done
