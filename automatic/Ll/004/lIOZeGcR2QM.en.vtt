00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hey this is Corbeau so someone wrote in

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.170 
hey this is Corbeau so someone wrote in
and<00:00:03.720> wanted<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.170> see<00:00:04.440> what<00:00:05.190> my<00:00:05.310> level<00:00:05.609> 12<00:00:05.879> mine

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
and wanted to see what my level 12 mine

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.570 
and wanted to see what my level 12 mine
was<00:00:06.390> like<00:00:06.629> so<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:06.960> thought<00:00:07.259> I'd<00:00:07.410> show<00:00:08.400> him<00:00:08.550> a

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
was like so I thought I'd show him a

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.350 
was like so I thought I'd show him a
little<00:00:08.610> bit<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:10.490> starting<00:00:11.490> outside<00:00:11.639> this

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
little bit of that starting outside this

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.010 
little bit of that starting outside this
is<00:00:12.509> at<00:00:12.630> my<00:00:12.780> big<00:00:12.960> treehouse<00:00:14.179> and<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.750> kind

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
is at my big treehouse and this is kind

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.609 
is at my big treehouse and this is kind
of<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.170> center<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.500> my<00:00:16.770> world<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:18.350> this<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.470> my

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
of the center of my world so this is my

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.279 
of the center of my world so this is my
main<00:00:19.859> mind<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.490> moment<00:00:20.960> one<00:00:21.960> thing<00:00:22.170> I'd

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
main mind for the moment one thing I'd

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.460 
main mind for the moment one thing I'd
recommend<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.890> having<00:00:23.090> two<00:00:24.090> deep<00:00:24.689> mine<00:00:25.140> shaft

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
recommend is having two deep mine shaft

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.339 
recommend is having two deep mine shaft
like<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:26.510> because<00:00:27.510> then<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.869> freefall

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
like this because then you can freefall

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.139 
like this because then you can freefall
at<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.619> bottom<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.359> if<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.570> put<00:00:31.040> opposing<00:00:32.149> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
at the bottom and if you put opposing a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.650 
at the bottom and if you put opposing a
little<00:00:33.800> ladder<00:00:34.800> bitch<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.520> either<00:00:35.850> side<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.630> a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
little ladder bitch on either side to a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.860 
little ladder bitch on either side to a
part<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:38.010> pretty<00:00:38.489> much<00:00:38.730> impossible<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.570> fall

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
part it's pretty much impossible to fall

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.470 
part it's pretty much impossible to fall
and<00:00:40.200> not<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.190> ladder<00:00:41.370> catch<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.910> you

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and not have the ladder catch you you

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.400 
and not have the ladder catch you you
have<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.719> fall<00:00:42.930> right<00:00:43.410> dead<00:00:43.800> between<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.489> two

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
have to fall right dead between the two

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.610 
have to fall right dead between the two
the<00:00:46.410> two<00:00:46.440> blocks<00:00:46.860> two<00:00:47.309> dies<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:49.320> know<00:00:49.440> that

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the two blocks two dies so you know that

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.130 
the two blocks two dies so you know that
that<00:00:50.250> pretty<00:00:50.520> much<00:00:50.640> enables<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.989> get

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that pretty much enables you to to get

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
that pretty much enables you to to get
to<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> bottom<00:00:52.530> really<00:00:53.039> fast<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
to the bottom really fast so this is the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.729 
to the bottom really fast so this is the
main<00:00:56.699> level<00:00:57.120> 12<00:00:57.480> mine<00:00:57.859> I've<00:00:58.859> got<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.250> car

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
main level 12 mine I've got a little car

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.429 
main level 12 mine I've got a little car
-<00:01:01.739> another<00:01:01.949> older<00:01:02.550> mine<00:01:03.019> under<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> plinth

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
- another older mine under a plinth

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.660 
- another older mine under a plinth
another<00:01:05.309> area<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:07.040> this<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.460> pretty

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
another area and this is just a pretty

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.710 
another area and this is just a pretty
basic<00:01:08.850> little<00:01:09.510> booster<00:01:09.930> system<00:01:11.240> this<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:12.450> is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
basic little booster system this one is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.010 
basic little booster system this one is
a<00:01:12.750> little<00:01:12.990> bit<00:01:13.229> different<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:15.020> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
a little bit different in that it's the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.080 
a little bit different in that it's the
cars<00:01:16.500> derail<00:01:16.979> at<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> end<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.580> don't<00:01:17.640> want<00:01:17.939> them

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
cars derail at the end I don't want them

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.730 
cars derail at the end I don't want them
running<00:01:18.119> continuously<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.049> lot<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.530> people

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
running continuously a lot of people

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.210 
running continuously a lot of people
have<00:01:19.890> them<00:01:20.040> loop<00:01:21.320> but<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.590> go<00:01:22.740> too<00:01:22.830> far

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
have them loop but if you go too far

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.039 
have them loop but if you go too far
away<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:24.180> game<00:01:24.420> will<00:01:24.720> actually<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:27.479> car<00:01:27.750> will

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
away the game will actually the car will

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.020 
away the game will actually the car will
fall<00:01:28.290> out<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.680> memory<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.340> too<00:01:29.549> far<00:01:29.759> away

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
fall out of memory if it's too far away

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.960 
fall out of memory if it's too far away
from<00:01:30.090> where<00:01:30.689> your<00:01:30.900> character<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.790> and<00:01:32.790> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
from where your character is and that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.359 
from where your character is and that
would<00:01:33.119> happen<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.630> case<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.130> car

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
would happen in this case so the the car

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.520 
would happen in this case so the the car
couldn't<00:01:35.670> loop<00:01:35.880> around<00:01:36.060> indefinitely<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.500> I

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
couldn't loop around indefinitely so I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.830 
couldn't loop around indefinitely so I
have<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.520> know<00:01:38.610> come<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> complete<00:01:39.509> stop

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
have it you know come to a complete stop

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.620 
have it you know come to a complete stop
at<00:01:40.799> either<00:01:41.040> end<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.670> then<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:42.119> just<00:01:42.299> push

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
at either end and then I can just push

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.460 
at either end and then I can just push
it<00:01:42.659> back<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.380> go<00:01:43.740> back<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.140> a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
it back on to go back so it's this is a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.639 
it back on to go back so it's this is a
manual<00:01:47.479> restart<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.689> guess<00:01:49.140> you'd<00:01:49.380> call<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:51.649> so

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
manual restart I guess you'd call it so

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.819 
manual restart I guess you'd call it so
this<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.829> an<00:01:53.220> older<00:01:53.460> area<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.880> my<00:01:54.030> mind<00:01:54.829> but

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
this is an older area of my mind but

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.060 
this is an older area of my mind but
back<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.189> main<00:01:56.340> mind<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:57.630> level<00:01:58.320> 12<00:01:58.619> that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
back to the main mind so level 12 that

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.429 
back to the main mind so level 12 that
means<00:01:59.100> it's<00:01:59.610> 12<00:02:00.119> blocks<00:02:00.509> above<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.229> very

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
means it's 12 blocks above the very

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.080 
means it's 12 blocks above the very
bottom<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.640> game

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
bottom of the game

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.230 
bottom of the game
that's<00:02:03.630> important<00:02:04.049> because<00:02:04.079> lava<00:02:04.920> spawns<00:02:05.759> at

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
that's important because lava spawns at

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.110 
that's important because lava spawns at
I<00:02:06.840> believe<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:08.310> 10<00:02:08.729> level<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:11.340> means<00:02:11.970> you

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
I believe the 10 level so this means you

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.910 
I believe the 10 level so this means you
can<00:02:12.300> safely

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
can safely

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.080 
can safely
explore<00:02:14.520> areas<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.180> lava<00:02:15.500> without<00:02:16.500> actually

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
explore areas with lava without actually

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.809 
explore areas with lava without actually
you<00:02:18.090> know<00:02:18.180> being<00:02:18.800> having<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:20.010> pour<00:02:20.280> over<00:02:20.670> you

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
you know being having it pour over you

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.690 
you know being having it pour over you
if<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.120> accidentally<00:02:21.690> break<00:02:21.959> something<00:02:22.700> so

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
if you accidentally break something so

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.280 
if you accidentally break something so
you<00:02:23.790> can<00:02:23.819> see<00:02:24.150> down<00:02:24.450> below<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.110> very

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
you can see down below is the very

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.050 
you can see down below is the very
bottom<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.800> map<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.520> dug<00:02:26.730> all<00:02:26.940> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
bottom of the map so I just dug all the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.449 
bottom of the map so I just dug all the
way<00:02:27.120> down<00:02:27.300> till<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.630> get<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.930> counted<00:02:28.440> up<00:02:28.560> 12

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
way down till I get that counted up 12

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.410 
way down till I get that counted up 12
and<00:02:29.850> then<00:02:31.459> built<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.520> floor<00:02:32.790> started<00:02:33.120> mining

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
and then built the floor started mining

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.150 
and then built the floor started mining
from<00:02:33.480> here<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:37.110> think<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.560> my<00:02:37.830> most

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
from here so I think this is my most

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.449 
from here so I think this is my most
active<00:02:38.430> shaft<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:39.930> do<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.590> three<00:02:41.190> blocks

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
active shaft so I do this three blocks

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.600 
active shaft so I do this three blocks
high<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.300> when<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.959> car<00:02:43.459> which<00:02:44.459> I'll

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
high so when I have a car which I'll

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.250 
high so when I have a car which I'll
probably<00:02:44.730> at<00:02:45.000> some<00:02:45.330> point<00:02:45.480> put<00:02:45.810> in<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.989> track

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
probably at some point put in a track

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.400 
probably at some point put in a track
and<00:02:46.500> have<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.860> car<00:02:47.540> then<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.630> can<00:02:48.810> get<00:02:49.020> in<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.320> out

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
and have a car then I can get in and out

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.560 
and have a car then I can get in and out
of<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.650> car<00:02:49.890> without<00:02:50.340> hurting<00:02:50.910> myself<00:02:51.060> while

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
of the car without hurting myself while

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.930 
of the car without hurting myself while
the<00:02:51.690> cars<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.140> track<00:02:52.440> if<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.580> only<00:02:53.730> have<00:02:53.910> a

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
the cars on the track if you only have a

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.340 
the cars on the track if you only have a
two<00:02:54.930> block<00:02:55.200> high<00:02:56.300> corridor<00:02:57.300> then<00:02:57.600> if<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.989> are

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
two block high corridor then if you are

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.920 
two block high corridor then if you are
in<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.650> car<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.250> get<00:02:59.880> out<00:03:00.030> you'll<00:03:00.360> take<00:03:00.690> damage

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
in a car and get out you'll take damage

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.630 
in a car and get out you'll take damage
because<00:03:01.470> your<00:03:01.620> head<00:03:01.830> will<00:03:02.010> be<00:03:02.160> up<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.489> this

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
because your head will be up in this

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.920 
because your head will be up in this
area<00:03:03.570> stone<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:05.370> yeah<00:03:05.700> my<00:03:05.940> technique<00:03:06.330> is<00:03:06.540> just

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
area stone so yeah my technique is just

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.320 
area stone so yeah my technique is just
to<00:03:07.110> oh<00:03:07.140> yeah<00:03:07.500> here<00:03:07.980> we<00:03:08.100> can<00:03:08.250> see<00:03:08.430> some<00:03:08.790> some

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
to oh yeah here we can see some some

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.729 
to oh yeah here we can see some some
lava<00:03:09.600> at<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:10.380> level<00:03:10.560> 10<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:12.410> so<00:03:13.410> maybe<00:03:13.620> this

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
lava at that level 10 and so maybe this

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.310 
lava at that level 10 and so maybe this
is<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:13.950> level<00:03:14.280> 11<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.820> looks<00:03:15.000> like<00:03:15.239> but<00:03:15.780> close

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
is a level 11 it looks like but close

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.479 
is a level 11 it looks like but close
enough<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:19.470> lava<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.829> of<00:03:19.980> course<00:03:20.190> great

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
enough so lava is of course great

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.259 
enough so lava is of course great
because<00:03:20.970> diamonds<00:03:22.190> spawn<00:03:23.190> around<00:03:23.430> lava<00:03:23.850> red

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
because diamonds spawn around lava red

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.090 
because diamonds spawn around lava red
stones<00:03:24.540> bonds<00:03:24.930> around<00:03:25.110> lava<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:28.290> looks<00:03:28.590> like<00:03:28.829> I

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
stones bonds around lava it looks like I

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.100 
stones bonds around lava it looks like I
probably<00:03:29.519> discovered<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.150> big<00:03:30.329> cave<00:03:30.600> system

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
probably discovered a big cave system

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.539 
probably discovered a big cave system
here<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.850> I've<00:03:33.630> mined<00:03:34.230> all<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:35.010> don't

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
here and I've mined all of this I don't

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.400 
here and I've mined all of this I don't
generally<00:03:35.910> mined<00:03:36.360> coal<00:03:36.660> much<00:03:36.989> because<00:03:37.290> I

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
generally mined coal much because I

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.319 
generally mined coal much because I
don't<00:03:37.769> really<00:03:37.920> use<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:39.860> but<00:03:40.860> yeah<00:03:41.280> I've<00:03:42.150> got

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
don't really use it but yeah I've got

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.180 
don't really use it but yeah I've got
piles<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.930> redstone<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:43.560> don't<00:03:43.769> always<00:03:43.950> mind

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
piles of redstone so I don't always mind

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.470 
piles of redstone so I don't always mind
that<00:03:44.340> either<00:03:45.530> but<00:03:46.530> yet<00:03:46.739> so<00:03:46.980> that's<00:03:47.910> that's

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
that either but yet so that's that's

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.720 
that either but yet so that's that's
really<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.680> trick<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.160> build<00:03:50.610> up

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
really the the trick to it build up

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.120 
really the the trick to it build up
twelve<00:03:51.090> from<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.420> bottom<00:03:51.750> one<00:03:52.739> little<00:03:52.950> tip

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
twelve from the bottom one little tip

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.940 
twelve from the bottom one little tip
I'll<00:03:53.310> say<00:03:53.549> to<00:03:53.610> help<00:03:54.329> prevent<00:03:55.200> getting<00:03:55.380> lost<00:03:55.709> in

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
I'll say to help prevent getting lost in

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.050 
I'll say to help prevent getting lost in
big<00:03:56.100> cave<00:03:56.370> systems

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
big cave systems

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.180 
big cave systems
I<00:03:57.200> always<00:03:58.200> carry<00:03:58.530> around<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.890> bunch<00:03:59.070> of

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
I always carry around a bunch of

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.280 
I always carry around a bunch of
redstone<00:03:59.579> torches<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.390> place<00:04:00.660> them<00:04:00.989> so

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
redstone torches and place them so

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.210 
redstone torches and place them so
they're<00:04:02.130> pointing<00:04:02.640> towards<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.930> way<00:04:04.079> out<00:04:04.320> so

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
they're pointing towards the way out so

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.370 
they're pointing towards the way out so
as<00:04:05.489> I'm<00:04:05.730> going<00:04:05.970> of<00:04:06.269> course<00:04:06.420> I'm<00:04:06.660> planting

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
as I'm going of course I'm planting

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.229 
as I'm going of course I'm planting
regular<00:04:07.890> torches<00:04:08.280> but<00:04:08.459> periodically<00:04:09.060> I'll

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
regular torches but periodically I'll

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.960 
regular torches but periodically I'll
plant<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.870> redstone<00:04:10.620> torch<00:04:10.890> pointing<00:04:11.579> towards

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
plant a redstone torch pointing towards

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.000 
plant a redstone torch pointing towards
ya<00:04:12.150> here's<00:04:12.359> another<00:04:12.600> one<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:13.019> had<00:04:13.500> planted<00:04:13.799> a

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
ya here's another one I had planted a

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.250 
ya here's another one I had planted a
long<00:04:14.160> time<00:04:14.340> ago<00:04:14.579> pointing<00:04:15.540> me<00:04:15.720> in<00:04:15.959> that

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
long time ago pointing me in that

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.650 
long time ago pointing me in that
direction<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.640> further<00:04:17.880> we<00:04:18.120> go<00:04:18.299> in<00:04:18.479> we

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
direction so the further we go in we

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.729 
direction so the further we go in we
could<00:04:18.810> probably<00:04:18.989> see<00:04:19.260> more<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.680> more

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
could probably see more and more

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.560 
could probably see more and more
redstone<00:04:20.280> torches<00:04:20.640> pointing<00:04:21.150> me<00:04:21.239> at<00:04:21.269> our<00:04:21.450> way

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
redstone torches pointing me at our way

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.640 
redstone torches pointing me at our way
out<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:24.270> this<00:04:24.390> one<00:04:24.599> is<00:04:24.720> either<00:04:24.900> incorrectly

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
out so this one is either incorrectly

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.490 
out so this one is either incorrectly
placed<00:04:25.919> or<00:04:26.640> what's<00:04:26.880> more<00:04:27.090> likely

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
placed or what's more likely

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.490 
placed or what's more likely
I<00:04:28.910> think<00:04:29.910> there<00:04:30.090> are<00:04:30.210> multiple<00:04:30.900> ways<00:04:31.050> out<00:04:31.350> in

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
I think there are multiple ways out in

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:39.200 
I think there are multiple ways out in
this<00:04:31.669> in<00:04:32.669> this<00:04:34.280> this<00:04:35.280> cave<00:04:35.550> system<00:04:36.320> but<00:04:38.210> yeah

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
this in this this cave system but yeah

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.390 
this in this this cave system but yeah
so<00:04:39.510> that's<00:04:39.780> that's<00:04:40.590> really<00:04:40.950> all<00:04:41.100> there<00:04:41.220> is<00:04:41.280> to

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
so that's that's really all there is to

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.990 
so that's that's really all there is to
it<00:04:41.730> I<00:04:42.300> tend<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.020> mine<00:04:43.490> really<00:04:44.490> in<00:04:44.730> one

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
it I tend to mine really in one

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.480 
it I tend to mine really in one
direction<00:04:46.040> and<00:04:47.040> then<00:04:48.050> every<00:04:49.050> ten<00:04:49.770> blocks<00:04:50.130> I'll

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
direction and then every ten blocks I'll

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.050 
direction and then every ten blocks I'll
I'll<00:04:50.790> go<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.240> either<00:04:51.419> end<00:04:51.720> so<00:04:54.440> where<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.530> it

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
I'll go to either end so where is it

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.909 
I'll go to either end so where is it
okay<00:04:57.060> so<00:04:57.120> here's<00:04:57.419> my<00:04:57.480> main<00:04:57.810> mineshaft

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
okay so here's my main mineshaft

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.760 
okay so here's my main mineshaft
here's<00:04:59.820> where<00:05:00.270> we<00:05:00.419> started<00:05:00.810> so<00:05:01.020> basically

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
here's where we started so basically

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.260 
here's where we started so basically
every<00:05:02.070> ten<00:05:02.310> blocks<00:05:02.610> I'll<00:05:03.479> cut<00:05:03.840> a<00:05:04.550> path<00:05:05.550> ten

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
every ten blocks I'll cut a path ten

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.159 
every ten blocks I'll cut a path ten
deep<00:05:06.540> in<00:05:06.780> so<00:05:07.680> these<00:05:07.889> kind<00:05:08.190> of<00:05:08.280> side<00:05:08.520> cuts<00:05:09.169> are

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
deep in so these kind of side cuts are

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.920 
deep in so these kind of side cuts are
just<00:05:10.229> a<00:05:10.500> good<00:05:10.680> way<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.889> you<00:05:11.639> know<00:05:11.760> keep<00:05:12.660> from

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
just a good way to you know keep from

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.420 
just a good way to you know keep from
missing<00:05:13.320> something<00:05:13.710> as<00:05:13.889> you're<00:05:14.100> as<00:05:14.370> you're

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
missing something as you're as you're

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.670 
missing something as you're as you're
tunneling<00:05:14.910> in<00:05:15.210> a<00:05:15.270> straight<00:05:15.540> line<00:05:15.570> because<00:05:16.560> the

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
tunneling in a straight line because the

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.270 
tunneling in a straight line because the
odds<00:05:16.830> that<00:05:17.280> there's<00:05:17.780> a<00:05:18.780> vein<00:05:19.380> of<00:05:19.650> something<00:05:20.130> is

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
odds that there's a vein of something is

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.870 
odds that there's a vein of something is
pretty<00:05:20.790> small<00:05:22.070> that<00:05:23.070> you<00:05:23.220> wouldn't<00:05:23.520> hit<00:05:23.700> with

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
pretty small that you wouldn't hit with

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.800 
pretty small that you wouldn't hit with
one<00:05:24.090> of<00:05:24.120> those<00:05:24.500> corridors<00:05:25.500> I<00:05:26.430> make<00:05:27.240> you<00:05:27.720> know

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
one of those corridors I make you know

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.250 
one of those corridors I make you know
at<00:05:28.020> some<00:05:28.200> point<00:05:28.410> go<00:05:28.590> back<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:30.080> carve<00:05:31.080> another

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
at some point go back and carve another

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.790 
at some point go back and carve another
one<00:05:31.740> in<00:05:31.830> the<00:05:31.919> middle<00:05:32.160> of<00:05:32.280> these<00:05:32.910> ten<00:05:33.270> but<00:05:33.800> the

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
one in the middle of these ten but the

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.320 
one in the middle of these ten but the
odds<00:05:34.919> are<00:05:35.100> there's<00:05:35.340> there's<00:05:35.700> really<00:05:35.760> nothing

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
odds are there's there's really nothing

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.850 
odds are there's there's really nothing
in<00:05:36.419> there<00:05:36.660> and<00:05:36.960> I'm<00:05:37.140> certainly<00:05:37.470> going<00:05:37.620> to<00:05:37.710> hit

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
in there and I'm certainly going to hit

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.420 
in there and I'm certainly going to hit
all<00:05:38.039> the<00:05:38.160> big<00:05:38.370> cave<00:05:38.669> systems<00:05:39.210> by<00:05:39.919> by<00:05:40.919> having<00:05:41.340> a

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
all the big cave systems by by having a

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.140 
all the big cave systems by by having a
little<00:05:41.610> side<00:05:41.940> corridor<00:05:42.900> every<00:05:43.200> ten<00:05:43.880> so<00:05:44.880> that's

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
little side corridor every ten so that's

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.110 
little side corridor every ten so that's
it<00:05:45.360> I<00:05:45.539> hope<00:05:45.720> this<00:05:45.990> was<00:05:46.289> helpful<00:05:46.770> to<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:47.789> person

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
it I hope this was helpful to the person

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.550 
it I hope this was helpful to the person
who<00:05:48.240> wanted<00:05:48.600> to<00:05:48.660> hear<00:05:49.080> about<00:05:49.169> it

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
who wanted to hear about it

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.280 
who wanted to hear about it
