he's<00:01:30.869> has<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> nice<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.799> circling<00:01:32.340> actually

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
he's has a nice for circling actually

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.950 
he's has a nice for circling actually
managed<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.180> slip<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.600> group<00:01:33.840> of

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
managed to get slip that group of

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.899 
managed to get slip that group of
zerglings<00:01:34.229> past<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.920> will<00:01:35.400> he<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.700> able<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
zerglings past and will he be able to

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.100 
zerglings past and will he be able to
run<00:01:36.090> them<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.689> actually<00:01:36.930> would<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.079> a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
run them in that actually would be a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.660 
run them in that actually would be a
very<00:01:37.320> smart<00:01:37.619> move<00:01:37.740> i<00:01:37.890> think<00:01:38.100> if<00:01:38.189> he<00:01:38.280> could<00:01:38.430> get

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
very smart move i think if he could get

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.399 
very smart move i think if he could get
like<00:01:38.909> 12<00:01:39.210> zerglings<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.750> two<00:01:39.900> flashes<00:01:40.259> base

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
like 12 zerglings in two flashes base

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.499 
like 12 zerglings in two flashes base
like<00:01:40.920> i<00:01:41.009> said<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.490> counter-attack<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
like i said for a counter-attack that

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.880 
like i said for a counter-attack that
could<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:42.720> very<00:01:42.810> smart<00:01:43.140> flash<00:01:43.439> move<00:01:43.740> me<00:01:43.829> out

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
could be very smart flash move me out

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.620 
could be very smart flash move me out
with<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> large<00:01:44.460> mid-game<00:01:44.880> force<00:01:45.210> though<00:01:45.420> of

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
with a large mid-game force though of

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.330 
with a large mid-game force though of
medic<00:01:46.170> marines<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> center<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.250> I

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
medic marines in the center and I

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.249 
medic marines in the center and I
believe<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.579> +1<00:01:47.970> upgraded<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.689> attack<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
believe that +1 upgraded for attack and

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.510 
believe that +1 upgraded for attack and
that's<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.680> very<00:01:50.130> very<00:01:50.310> difficult

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
that's going to be very very difficult

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.020 
that's going to be very very difficult
for<00:01:51.020> for<00:01:52.430> effort<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.520> deal<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:53.850> right<00:01:53.970> now

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
for for effort to deal with right now

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.560 
for for effort to deal with right now
without<00:01:54.390> any<00:01:54.689> lurkers<00:01:55.079> out<00:01:55.969> just<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.210> sunken

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
without any lurkers out just to sunken

without any lurkers out just to sunken
colonies<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.079> fact<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.380> don't<00:01:58.439> know<00:01:58.590> where<00:01:58.799> his

colonies in fact I don't know where his
lurkers<00:01:59.250> are<00:01:59.399> he<00:01:59.520> needs<00:01:59.729> those<00:01:59.820> lurkers<00:02:00.270> if

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
lurkers are he needs those lurkers if

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.179 
lurkers are he needs those lurkers if
he's<00:02:00.810> been<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.259> building<00:02:01.649> EULA's<00:02:01.920> he's

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
to take out this macaroon forest but at

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.339 
to take out this macaroon forest but at
the<00:02:20.670> cost<00:02:20.849> of<00:02:21.060> almost<00:02:21.269> all<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.689> its<00:02:21.840> mute<00:02:22.049> lists

be willing to make the trade here

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.559 
be willing to make the trade here
although<00:02:26.579> his<00:02:26.730> forest<00:02:26.970> does<00:02:27.090> get<00:02:27.269> taken<00:02:27.540> down

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569

here<00:02:37.739> from<00:02:38.010> effort<00:02:38.430> that's<00:02:38.849> what<00:02:39.120> he<00:02:39.180> was

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
here from effort that's what he was

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.429 
here from effort that's what he was
planning<00:02:39.420> all<00:02:39.689> along<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.079> fortunately

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
planning all along and fortunately

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.699 
planning all along and fortunately
Korean<00:02:40.739> observers<00:02:41.159> didn't<00:02:41.370> show<00:02:41.519> us<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:42.709> so

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
Korean observers didn't show us that so

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.309 
Korean observers didn't show us that so
perhaps<00:02:44.099> I'm<00:02:44.430> wrong<00:02:44.670> about<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.810> voice<00:02:46.049> inside

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
perhaps I'm wrong about the voice inside

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.319 
perhaps I'm wrong about the voice inside
of<00:02:46.590> his<00:02:46.680> head<00:02:46.829> perhaps<00:02:47.069> Avery<00:02:47.549> was<00:02:47.700> saying<00:02:47.909> go

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
of his head perhaps Avery was saying go

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.930 
of his head perhaps Avery was saying go
for<00:02:48.690> big<00:02:48.870> air<00:02:50.690> yeah<00:02:51.690> use<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.889> big<00:02:53.040> air<00:02:53.280> but

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
for big air yeah use the big air but

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.280 
for big air yeah use the big air but
bigger<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.389> course<00:02:54.599> is<00:02:54.780> most<00:02:55.019> vulnerable

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
bigger of course is most vulnerable

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.440 
bigger of course is most vulnerable

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:03.780 
I'm not sure exactly that means I think

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.369 
I'm not sure exactly that means I think
he's<00:07:04.490> putting<00:07:05.490> himself<00:07:05.610> in<00:07:05.969> a<00:07:06.060> group<00:07:06.360> and<00:07:06.569> i

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:07.379 
he's putting himself in a group and i

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:09.020 
he's putting himself in a group and i
think<00:07:07.979> the<00:07:08.129> other<00:07:08.159> players<00:07:08.520> might<00:07:08.699> be<00:07:08.819> able<00:07:08.879> to

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
think the other players might be able to

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.519 
think the other players might be able to
choose<00:07:09.330> whether<00:07:09.569> the<00:07:09.750> face<00:07:09.960> them<00:07:10.110> or<00:07:10.199> not<00:07:10.319> i'm

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:10.529 
choose whether the face them or not i'm

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:11.929 
choose whether the face them or not i'm
not<00:07:10.740> exactly<00:07:11.009> sure<00:07:11.219> what<00:07:11.400> that<00:07:11.430> means<00:07:11.639> but<00:07:11.789> uh

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:11.939 
not exactly sure what that means but uh

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:13.309 
not exactly sure what that means but uh
i<00:07:12.240> think<00:07:12.449> that<00:07:12.659> is<00:07:12.779> something<00:07:12.930> like<00:07:13.169> that

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 
i think that is something like that

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:14.929 
i think that is something like that
