00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.279
 Hey guys, beauty here is the 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.620
 gu ranking and welcome to 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.870
 first video of safe wars advance 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.850
 Beast here on the channel already ahead for you 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.820
 It's just that I was not online I was just 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.530
 testing some modalities knowing 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.750
 the maps and I recommend that you do 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.440
 this is also after all was everything you 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.030
 will play 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.070
 you have to train for a while 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.280
 the more you know about the 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.590
 maps there is better you will be able to 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.750
 turn and during online matches 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.449
 but finally this map and that was playing 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.449
 it's called a recovery card that I 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:40.899
 I quite liked it 's small size for 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:45.100
 medium to PRTM play well fluid it 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:48.309
 much but very fast and I found 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.379
 very nice this map those responsible 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.019
 consistent with at least the currency 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.059
 mode of dominich a project with a 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.559
 problem to speak the word modality 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.519
 that we are here until the second 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.519
 comment 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:04.560
 but ultimately it is beyond those responsible for 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.270
 consistent at least in this modality 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.539
 I was playing classic or 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.100
 It 's at this game you do not 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.780
 will be able to see the football of both 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.530
 those tests you can be in the air are 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.880
 kind of like a one-off slide done in the air 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.590
 useful for you to escape an enemy 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.369
 mainly fields that remained 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.259
 cantol this way avoid this much 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.780
 irritation it is calmer to 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.399
 to escape from these people and 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.259
 edit a little the frustration of dying 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.689
 because there are those players who do not have 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.329
 very good way that really this 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.549
 game that requires a little more than 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.439
 skill is on the reflex part 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.490
 At least I believe it will be so. 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.630
 more ahead and well, I'm going to 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.509
 description of the class you are using 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.189
 there is even for who to play in that 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.170
 map and the first few times I recommend 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.840
 Do you use a cursing cuss? 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.869
 just as she was using her name 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.969
 k f 5 is one of the first and one arrivance 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.700
 is excellent has a very good range if 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.100
 I'm not mistaken or better at achieving 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.850
 present in the class of 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.740
 machines and what was using it 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.350
 uses technical inserts a stock is going 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.090
 of max soccer so do not run too far 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.140
 from what has already been seen a black ops 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.569
 two and neither confident goal x is inside 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.550
 than we already know the pigs 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.010
 are also known all account 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.410
 using this match were flec jack 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.730
 pra gives me a greater boost is defending 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.610
 with light white explosives to allow 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.890
 that spex faster drive theme 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.019
 all in the first batch 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.239
 The second batch is using flash and 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.880
 allows you to be 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.900
 faster and used exchanges but also 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.420
 more efficient way is also 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.250
 shown in other captors and also 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.380
 using tanks does not improve the 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.750
 your aim you do not have an instability 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.510
 when it takes a shot and it helps 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.650
 enough to win the streets a thousand faithful 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.739
 and the equipment you were using 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.930
 it was sintex, that's it, too. 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.030
 We know but I do not believe that 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.549
 made none of it with them and gameplay 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.049
 further ahead I'll be exploring everything 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.519
 it was possible this game showing 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:19.709
 including tips on demonstrating weapons 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.870
 and some techniques that possibly 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.560
 They will show up there I hope to learn. 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:29.160
 and in this game I also show 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.560
 You the nuclear bomb money, right? 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.049
 I believe you already know more nuclear 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.970
 now you can also pick up the ones that 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.280
 those that come with flex cars ie 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.630
 it is not only those who use the weapon 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.840
 count for nuclear 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.320
 however for the dn is dna pump bomb 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.840
 dna let's talk this way is the 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.609
 that we have similar there in the engine did 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.489
 How do you love and who's in the cockpit? 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.850
 blushes this sim is software that you 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.530
 You can only catch the ones with the gun and 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.319
 It's 30 kills. 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.420
 is for you can achieve this the 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.079
 strike that kills everyone who is 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.130
 present at the start but does not end 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.460
 whatever that will change if you are playing 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.650
 but everyone is giving a glare on the map 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.780
 At least everyone I shot was a 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.489
 green cord leaves your vision half 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.709
 dazed as if you had taken a 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.740
 flash right in the face then she comes back to 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.480
 normal and this powder or be clarified 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.480
 to get a baby off the map too 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.040
 it returns to its normal coloration 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.890
 unlike the for 3 model with a 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.410
 reddish tint and heartbreak safe 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.720
 who destroys the colors come back to 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.060
 normal and this facilitates gameplay because 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.680
 I particularly nice shopping malls 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:47.170
 flower garden coloring in the adrian and 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.910
 come personal is your first video I hope 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.200
 that is enlightening to you in 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.820
 I'll soon be talking more 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.130
 specifically on clicks as well. 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.130
 sniper you can see there how little 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.500
 more complicated to do a little more 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.320
 I do not depend either, this does not have to 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.850
 find the bodies that facilitated the use 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.450
 of this type of weapon 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.550
 I'll tell you soon, this is it too. 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.840
 man is more difficult or has just 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.070
 first contact I had 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.050
 difficulty 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.120

 video is also to give me a review and 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.830
 evaluate is good and can improve 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.210
 increasingly 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.620

 Thanks. I said it and I hug.
