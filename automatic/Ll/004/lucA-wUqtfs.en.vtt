00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
that is something to be understood

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.570 
that is something to be understood

because in fact canta canta got in this
kind<00:02:23.210> of<00:02:23.270> explanation<00:02:24.020> bring<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:25.010> the

kind of explanation bring to you the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.220 
kind of explanation bring to you the
concept<00:02:25.760> of<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.120> country<00:02:26.540> classical<00:02:27.080> the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
concept of this country classical the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.960 
concept of this country classical the
one<00:02:27.440> with<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.800> terroir<00:02:28.220> with<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.550> very

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
one with the terroir with a very

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.110 
one with the terroir with a very
definitive<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.930> world<00:02:30.170> instead<00:02:30.950> Chianti<00:02:31.640> is

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
definitive the world instead Chianti is

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.720 
definitive the world instead Chianti is
a<00:02:32.180> wine<00:02:32.570> with<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.380> style<00:02:33.830> it's<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.280> style<00:02:34.550> of

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
a wine with a style it's a style of

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.000 
a wine with a style it's a style of
making<00:02:34.940> wine<00:02:35.240> yet<00:02:35.600> Sangiovese<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.680> grown

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
making wine yet Sangiovese that is grown

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.390 
making wine yet Sangiovese that is grown
around<00:02:38.000> pisa<00:02:38.480> or<00:02:38.960> rather<00:02:39.110> it's<00:02:39.410> around<00:02:39.980> siena

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
around pisa or rather it's around siena

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.610 
around pisa or rather it's around siena
so<00:02:40.640> it's<00:02:40.790> more<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.420> style<00:02:41.810> often<00:02:42.290> these

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
so it's more of a style often these

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.250 
so it's more of a style often these
wines<00:02:42.980> are<00:02:43.250> blended<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.120> not<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.140> much

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
wines are blended and not so much

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.510 
wines are blended and not so much
important<00:02:45.710> is<00:02:45.860> given<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.430> original

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
important is given to the original

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.000 
important is given to the original
terroir<00:02:47.330> from<00:02:48.110> where<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.530> wine<00:02:48.740> is<00:02:48.890> produced

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
terroir from where the wine is produced

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.910 
terroir from where the wine is produced
instead<00:02:49.700> for<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.090> Chianti<00:02:50.480> Classico<00:02:50.920> the

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
instead for the Chianti Classico the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.680 
instead for the Chianti Classico the
classical<00:02:52.490> scene<00:02:52.670> yes<00:02:52.790> that's<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.450> region

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
classical scene yes that's the region

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.170 
classical scene yes that's the region
and<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.290> terroir<00:02:54.740> is<00:02:55.070> very<00:02:55.400> very<00:02:55.700> important

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
and the terroir is very very important

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.270 
and the terroir is very very important
so<00:02:56.300> that<00:02:56.330> really<00:02:56.840> sets<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.410> two<00:02:57.590> wines<00:02:57.860> at<00:02:58.250> a

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
so that really sets the two wines at a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.560 
so that really sets the two wines at a
different<00:02:58.760> level<00:02:59.200> with<00:03:00.200> different<00:03:00.710> laws

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
different level with different laws

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.090 
different level with different laws
counties<00:03:02.570> often<00:03:03.170> are<00:03:03.350> more<00:03:03.560> simple

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
counties often are more simple

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.890 
counties often are more simple
straightforward<00:03:04.430> wine<00:03:05.060> since<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.570> pianta

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
straightforward wine since the pianta

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.440 
straightforward wine since the pianta
classical<00:03:06.470> are<00:03:06.800> more<00:03:07.310> complex<00:03:07.820> with<00:03:08.210> more

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
classical are more complex with more

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.210 
classical are more complex with more
debt<00:03:08.720> than<00:03:09.020> and<00:03:09.910> another<00:03:10.910> appealing<00:03:11.830> edge<00:03:12.830> to

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
debt than and another appealing edge to

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.540 
debt than and another appealing edge to
it<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:14.000> I<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.630> don't<00:03:14.720> know<00:03:15.110> if<00:03:15.500> this<00:03:15.770> was<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.130> just

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
it so I I don't know if this was I just

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.000 
it so I I don't know if this was I just
hope<00:03:16.820> that<00:03:17.000> this<00:03:17.120> was<00:03:17.360> clear<00:03:17.660> enough<00:03:18.010> of

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
hope that this was clear enough of

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.370 
hope that this was clear enough of
course<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.640> information<00:03:20.510> about<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:21.020> on<00:03:21.230> the

course is information about that on the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.800 
course is information about that on the
way

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.510
