00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.879

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.060
 one of the trends up to which will be 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.680
 true it will be either both shoulders or 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.149

 made like a fake dress like 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.719
 will reveal some disadvantages of the waist 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.939
 but emphasize beautiful shoulders for example 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.850
 so proceed from the dignity of your 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.110

 black sandals and bracelets

 another option for dress decoration 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.970
 this straight dress is so light and so 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.170
 she is not pure white rather such 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.670
 unbleached wool 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.170
 it is a variety of ruffles and frills and flounces 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.739
 also looks very feminine here 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.079

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.480
 opens shoulders opens beautiful legs 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.879

 according to the model according to the details for some 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.220
 Yes, because it will emphasize the figure that 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:07.489
 you marked yourself 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:10.230
 open shoulders and one shoulder by the way 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.590
 the question is she does not slip there is no such dress 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.790
 do not slip open shoulders drapery 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.250
 the waist is emphasized i'm flowing dress in 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.599

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.410
 be asked no no not necessarily 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:28.230

 fitted dresses open shoulder this 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.370
 maybe by the way 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.130
 and one open shoulder for example too 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.180

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.919
 comment from olga direct with open 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.030
 shoulders that in 50 it is impossible but she to me 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:59.459
 Goes it depends still on finish Olga 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.530
 and from understand, yes, there is an image there 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.780
 made right puppet such if 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.209
 a similar dress will be less fun 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.750
 colors and complemented by elegant 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.760
 accessories shoes handbag then you 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.690
 translate it to another level the same 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.790
 christian dior 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.639

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.359
 just the longest was this new look 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:24.110
 for such therefore as if there still 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.250
 strenuously with color times and accessories up 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.210
 accessories 2 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.190
 yes decoration bag sandals and so 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.730
 further so if you have a figure 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.700
 severe waist 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:41.640
 then I recently with the client 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.800
 chose a dress and she was just about 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.290
 such a 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.920
 fitted christian dior and her very 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.540
 well they just have a mediterranean 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.450
 figures with differences chest and waist and 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.310
