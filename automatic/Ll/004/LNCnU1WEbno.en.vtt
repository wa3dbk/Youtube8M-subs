what I did see gave me an idea I saw

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.860 
what I did see gave me an idea I saw
some<00:00:56.400> much<00:00:56.640> more<00:00:56.850> sturdy<00:00:57.150> blades<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.720> would

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
some much more sturdy blades that would

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.140 
some much more sturdy blades that would

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
for a quick project this probably isn't

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.050 
for a quick project this probably isn't
it<00:01:04.290> unless<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.100> some<00:01:05.430> power<00:01:05.579> tools<00:01:05.850> like

different types of blades if you try it
