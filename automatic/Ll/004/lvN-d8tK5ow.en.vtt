thing heated up it's at 144 right now

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.619 
thing heated up it's at 144 right now
I've<00:00:58.410> had<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:58.800> about<00:00:59.100> five<00:00:59.309> minutes

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
I've had it on for about five minutes

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.560 
I've had it on for about five minutes
going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.750> take<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> 225

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
going to take it up to 225

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.149 
going to take it up to 225
best<00:01:03.570> way<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.809> do<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.379> start<00:01:04.559> off<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.979> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
best way to do that to start off is to

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.820 
best way to do that to start off is to
keep<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.519> little<00:01:05.670> damper<00:01:06.500> almost<00:01:07.500> closed

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
keep your little damper almost closed

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.219 
keep your little damper almost closed
because<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:09.240> want<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.479> keep<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:09.720> much<00:01:09.869> heat<00:01:10.110> in

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
because you want to keep as much heat in

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.859 
because you want to keep as much heat in
there<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.560> right<00:01:10.950> now<00:01:11.510> get<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.630> warmed
