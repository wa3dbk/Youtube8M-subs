00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.020
 here you can see that ventilation of the storage facilities and 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.680
 better when the air intake holes is located 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.839
 in the bottom of the room on the side she adds the building 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.919
 and that the exit holes is time 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.270
 for products that are sensitive to ethylene 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.620
 the ventilation system must ensure a complete renewal and 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.620
 continues the era of storage room 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.150
 the buildings to be used for the storage of horticultural products must 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.060
 be well insulated to be effective 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.050
 a building with deep insulation requires less energy for the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.050
 cooling and maintaining desired temperatures 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.480
 if the installation is cooled by evaporation or by air ventilation 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.600
 night this type of building will stay cold longer 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.710
 if the energy for refrigeration is not available or is too expensive 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.670
 underground cellars can be used for the medium-term storage of 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.680
 tuberous roots these bubbles 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.969
 the cave shown here is a fake about two meters deep 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.420
 surmounted by a piece of four meters by five 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.750
 built in plank and covered with a thick layer of earth 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.550
 note that a square chimney of about 30 centimeters 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.640
 was added on the roof 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.620
 for the medium-term storage of large quantities of products released 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.219
 glue like potato 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.219
 we can build a triangular warehouse 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.670
 involved a fake about 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.509
 three meters fifty deep 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.859
 and fish ventilation pipes placed on the ground 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.829
 the roof of the building may be wooden covered with straw and earth 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.370
 when bulk storage of the potato in the cellars it is necessary 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.750
 ensure a good distribution of the product to allow ventilation 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.490
 adequate 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.670
 uneven distribution decrease air flow 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.670
 and causes significant losses of stored food 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.500
 when transporting in bulk the products should always be carefully 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.770
 charged to reduce the damage 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.890
 vehicles must be reimbursed double shot and a thick layer of 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.190
 Straw 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.760
 you should never put other loads on top of the fresh produce. 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.220
 will 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.460
 it is necessary as much as possible to maintain the temperatures of the products 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.029
 stable during transport 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:15.339
 an air-catching device with ducts can be built with 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:17.119
 wooden crates 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.819
 remove the sides of the crates and winter sets with wire from 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.139
 the way shown here 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.470
 during the transport 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.120
 this allows the air to flow upwards through the load en frac 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:29.859
 thus avoiding 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.919
 product warming 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.230
 this technique is better early in the morning 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.889
 before sunrise 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.829
 the conditions inside a refrigerated vehicle 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.899
 affect the vehicle's ability to maintain desirable temperatures 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:45.739
 during the transport 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.019
 trailers must always be refrigerated before loading 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.540
 carriers must inspect the trailer before the load is 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.819
 verified 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.659
 that the air blast chimneys are fixed and that the joints 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.949
 sealing doors are intact 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:03.829
 that the doors the floor and the walls of the vehicle are clean and are not 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:04.979
 damaged 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.429
 that the floor lands are all brothers 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:10.589
 that the pottery and the interior width is suitable for loading 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.559
 and there are bars for lashing 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:17.890
 when you transport cartons or bags of fresh produce 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.590
 you have to be careful of loading the containers so that the air 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.769
 then drive through the load 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.549
 Keep cargo away from parishes and vehicle floor 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.300
 to reduce the heat transfer between the product and the surfaces more 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.299
 hot and colder the roma 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:37.890
 always leave room 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.939
 between the last product key and the 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.949
 bottom of the transport vehicle 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:46.089
 the load must be wedged with wooden tie-down bars to prevent it 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:48.999
 moving against the back doors 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:50.730
 this lashing technique 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.900
 and fast as the loading of your against the back doors 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.519
 and we block the flow of air 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.709
 it also protects the workers who opens the doors to him 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.519
 some products need to be washed by create betting boots off hiller at 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.659
 level of wholesale or retail 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.600
 the station what it is for handling the products 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.810
 must be organized in such a way as to minimize the necessary actions 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.799
 products such as bananas and avocados 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.799
 are often matured before being offered for sale to consumers 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.949
 ripening like this 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.949
 in general, a temperature of between 15 and 21 degrees centigrade is expected 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.889
 of ethylene about 100 milligrams per liter 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.889
 and add in the room to stimulate ripening 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.080
 oranges and mandarins are often verdicts in rooms 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.370
 which contain 10 milligrams per liter of ethylene 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.960
 crates and pallets must be arranged in such a way as to ensure 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.550
 good ventilation 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.469
 and better air circulation 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:56.699
 the stripping reduces the shelf life of the products of the verdicts 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.090
 therefore, the material handlers need to think well 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.090
 if their market demands this treatment we do not 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.460
 at retailers, displays of products in single-layer 

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:08.170
 double 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.060
 protect them from compression damage and tampering 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.150
 excessive 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.659
 by consumers 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:17.940
 the temperature in the display case or in refrigerated rooms 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.940
 must correspond to the requirements of the product under consideration 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:22.650
 for example 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.960
 although pepper and tomato garth look fresh next to the reading 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.960
 the first two are sensitive to cold contrary to reading 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.120
 spraying relatively cold water on leafy vegetables and 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.080
 on products that can tolerate water on display 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.240
 contribute to the increase in relative humidity 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.400
 and maintaining the freshness of the products 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.820
 a simple spray device 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.480
 may be made from a properly perforated water hose 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:55.099
 at the market level or do the products have to be always keep 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:56.729
 at om 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.419
 there are many post harvest methods and technologies 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.639
 that can be used by smallholders 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:04.590
 farmer 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.040
 conditioners carriers his merchant of fruits and vegetables and of 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.009
 ornamental plants 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.290
 we showed some was written in this presentation 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.800
 the big harvest link program of the university of california between 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.110
 a lot of information about the technology for at least three weeks 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.710
 the use of these simple and inexpensive technologies allows small 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.090
 farmers to maintain quality and reduce post-harvest losses of 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.719
 products out of the shadows in the light 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:35.360
 we will not surrender 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.010
 we can then laurent
