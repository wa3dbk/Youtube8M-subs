 what I bring you now is about grandpa 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.469
 8 that as you can see I'm going to leave you in 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.469
 the job 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.490
 the quality that you have not with the quality 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:26.000
 but 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.000
 the determination 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.870
 let's play a little one in the game 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.199
 we'll see 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.700
 I swear I 'm fine I'm very 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.960
 excited to 45 seconds just iniesta 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.960
 later if all goes well 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.640
 while they are being going out 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.130
 soon this 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.520
 skywork I think that it came out without misunderstandings 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.860
 and it came out and now we 're going to get into 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.990
 a game from babies when 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.030
 we delay that I sincerely believe that 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:23.790
 they do very fast because as the goal of 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.790
 again between the 13th and I'd better be 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.650
 and something 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.860
 we went in we went wrong 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.509
 well like Picasso or my games 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.569
 waka waka of my times this could be 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.500
 see saying let's get to see in 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:09.470
 little things we put on 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:13.280
 this as more or less equipped go there 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.690
 a chest we're going and we follow what 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.690
 we open and then all this 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.320
 almost almost good 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.410
 well let's see if I can kill donda 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.470
 for this I honestly would not like 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.740
 get in there because there are so many 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.740
 good 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.670
 Imagine 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.950
 we go for this one that has stronger 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.310
 but let's kill someone 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.760
 2 the ark is winning all 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.890
 this every neighbor that is going to make a 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.960
 account because he is sincerely had 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:15.610
 but this one someone like that 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:19.060
 a friend of mine who did not put him 700 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.340
 and I sincerely authenticity as 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.480
 something more or less like a rat child or 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.030
 something like that but do not worry about it 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.700
 I will change now we take a death 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.170
 have touched the hearts well let's 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.060
 see if we find another one around here and 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.090
 let's talk nothing else so that we 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.489
 nothing bad happened we walked and saw walking 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.580
 well this is being a mega game 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:46.150

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.120
 suffocated none good from the first 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.680
 dead at the hands of more we follow 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.360
 on our way 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.400
 I think that light 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.870
 five minutes and I think they fill in the 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.950
 chests and seeing well also 80 that I 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.950
 I do not have it 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.500
 and good was good game sincerely 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.090
 I think that very epic let's see if 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.389
 works what is being the sky 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.210
 wars friends we get 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.230
 look at a vegetable guy the 126 I do not know what 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.170
 characters 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.320
 we do not have generating world generally what 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.540
 Overall it generates what it was is that if 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.690
 this next I know that as it is very 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.390
 used for that you can not enter and 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.310
 It is very crowded and you can not enter 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.110
 good friends up here would be what 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.530
 I'm doing 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.750
 so far I will continue doing my tutorial 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.260
 and now does not want to enter any 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.450
 server is that I have bad luck 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.600
 up to here I sincerely believe that it would be 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:02.220
 good to leave my tutorial of waiting for them 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.220
 what about them all 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:09.630
 they all have the same style but they 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.650
 I knew in 12 minutes because I've 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.650
 seen that we three 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:20.840
 I think that if it is arranged in two 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.270
 or three minutes and well up here 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.940

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:30.310
