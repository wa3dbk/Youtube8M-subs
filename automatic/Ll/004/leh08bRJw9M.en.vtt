00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
what's quite interesting about this

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.560 
what's quite interesting about this
device<00:00:45.650> is<00:00:45.800> if<00:00:46.310> you're<00:00:46.460> comparing<00:00:46.880> them<00:00:47.120> to

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
right which turns into a keyboard and a

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.770 
right which turns into a keyboard and a
little<00:01:02.000> stand<00:01:02.360> here

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
