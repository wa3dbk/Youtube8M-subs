if<00:00:22.369> you<00:00:22.550> have<00:00:22.730> these<00:00:23.119> styles<00:00:23.540> of<00:00:23.689> chairs<00:00:23.930> that

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
if you have these styles of chairs that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.440 
if you have these styles of chairs that
have<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:24.580> seat<00:00:25.580> and<00:00:25.610> back<00:00:25.910> separate<00:00:26.300> from

have the seat and back separate from
each<00:00:26.510> other<00:00:26.660> rather<00:00:26.930> than<00:00:27.080> one<00:00:27.830> big<00:00:28.010> piece<00:00:28.160> so

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
each other rather than one big piece so

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.070 
each other rather than one big piece so
this<00:00:29.000> would<00:00:29.120> be<00:00:29.210> my<00:00:29.300> green<00:00:29.510> table<00:00:29.840> because

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
this would be my green table because

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.589 
this would be my green table because
each<00:00:30.260> of<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.530> chairs<00:00:30.800> are<00:00:31.039> green<00:00:31.490> and<00:00:31.760> what<00:00:32.570> I

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
each of the chairs are green and what I

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.000 
each of the chairs are green and what I
did<00:00:32.900> was<00:00:33.140> I<00:00:33.170> simply<00:00:33.620> purchased<00:00:34.309> a<00:00:35.440> of<00:00:36.440> the

fabric<00:00:37.370> book<00:00:37.610> covers<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.270> called<00:00:38.449> a

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
fabric book covers the called a

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.960 
fabric book covers the called a
stretchable<00:00:38.870> book<00:00:39.140> cover<00:00:39.350> in<00:00:39.590> a<00:00:40.489> variety<00:00:40.640> of

color so each of my five tables has a

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.380 
color so each of my five tables has a
different<00:00:43.070> color<00:00:43.430> assigned<00:00:43.850> to<00:00:44.030> it<00:00:44.149> sort<00:00:44.360> of

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
different color assigned to it sort of

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.729 
different color assigned to it sort of
problem<00:00:44.690> is<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:44.899> yellow<00:00:45.020> table<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:45.560> green

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
problem is the yellow table the green

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.460 
problem is the yellow table the green
table<00:00:46.160> etc<00:00:46.340> and<00:00:46.910> I<00:00:47.600> got<00:00:47.720> these<00:00:47.870> at<00:00:47.899> target<00:00:48.380> they

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
table etc and I got these at target they

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.990 
table etc and I got these at target they
were<00:00:48.560> super<00:00:48.890> cheap<00:00:49.100> i<00:00:49.220> want<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.430> say<00:00:49.579> they're

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
were super cheap i want to say they're

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.130 
were super cheap i want to say they're
definitely<00:00:50.180> under<00:00:50.510> a<00:00:50.540> dollar<00:00:50.750> probably

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
definitely under a dollar probably

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.889 
definitely under a dollar probably
closer<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.550> fifty<00:00:52.550> cents<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:53.450> i<00:00:53.480> just<00:00:53.690> bought<00:00:53.870> a

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
closer to fifty cents so i just bought a

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.520 
closer to fifty cents so i just bought a
class<00:00:54.140> that<00:00:54.350> like<00:00:54.530> i<00:00:54.649> said<00:00:54.920> with<00:00:55.220> enough<00:00:56.530> for

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
class that like i said with enough for

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.500 
class that like i said with enough for
each<00:00:57.649> table<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:58.309> i<00:00:58.370> think<00:00:58.460> i<00:00:58.610> did<00:00:58.790> five<00:00:59.030> colors

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
each table so i think i did five colors

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
each table so i think i did five colors
in<00:00:59.719> five<00:00:59.899> of<00:01:00.079> each<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:01.130> i<00:01:01.280> would<00:01:01.460> have

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
in five of each so that i would have

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.109 
in five of each so that i would have
enough<00:01:03.530> for<00:01:03.680> class<00:01:03.860> of<00:01:04.009> 25<00:01:04.339> which<00:01:04.580> is<00:01:04.699> a<00:01:04.879> little

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
enough for class of 25 which is a little

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.280 
enough for class of 25 which is a little
bit<00:01:05.210> more<00:01:05.360> than<00:01:05.479> what<00:01:05.570> I<00:01:05.600> normally<00:01:05.660> have<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:06.259> I

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
bit more than what I normally have and I

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.560 
bit more than what I normally have and I
wanted<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:06.530> have<00:01:06.649> the<00:01:06.740> extras<00:01:07.190> and<00:01:07.390> so<00:01:08.390> what<00:01:08.540> I

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
wanted to have the extras and so what I

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.960 
wanted to have the extras and so what I
did<00:01:08.690> was<00:01:09.320> they<00:01:09.530> just<00:01:09.680> open<00:01:09.979> it<00:01:10.039> up<00:01:10.220> when<00:01:10.880> you

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
did was they just open it up when you

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.109 
did was they just open it up when you
open<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:11.420> you'll<00:01:11.570> see<00:01:11.780> it<00:01:12.020> is<00:01:13.030> designed<00:01:14.030> like

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
open it you'll see it is designed like

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.060 
open it you'll see it is designed like
this<00:01:14.240> that<00:01:14.479> you<00:01:14.539> can<00:01:14.660> slide<00:01:14.869> a<00:01:14.899> book<00:01:15.170> into<00:01:15.950> each

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
this that you can slide a book into each

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.330 
this that you can slide a book into each
side<00:01:16.540> not<00:01:17.540> a<00:01:17.570> book<00:01:17.810> but<00:01:17.840> rather<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.440> ends<00:01:19.250> of

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
side not a book but rather the ends of

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.760 
side not a book but rather the ends of
the<00:01:19.400> book<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:19.790> what<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:20.299> do<00:01:20.450> is<00:01:20.479> you<00:01:20.690> just

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
the book and what you do is you just

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.719 
the book and what you do is you just
slide<00:01:21.770> it<00:01:21.890> right<00:01:21.920> over<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.250> back<00:01:22.490> of<00:01:22.670> the

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
slide it right over the back of the

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.630 
slide it right over the back of the
chair<00:01:24.010> and<00:01:25.010> do<00:01:25.190> this<00:01:25.540> one<00:01:26.540> handed<00:01:26.960> here<00:01:27.580> so<00:01:28.580> I

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
chair and do this one handed here so I

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.800 
chair and do this one handed here so I
put<00:01:28.790> it<00:01:28.850> through<00:01:29.000> that<00:01:29.090> first<00:01:29.270> time<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.720> it

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
put it through that first time and it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.080 
put it through that first time and it
hangs<00:01:29.990> down<00:01:30.260> and<00:01:30.590> then<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:31.280> simply<00:01:31.640> take<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:31.970> and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
hangs down and then I simply take it and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.450 
hangs down and then I simply take it and
loop<00:01:32.299> it<00:01:32.390> around<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:32.930> second<00:01:33.320> time<00:01:33.500> put<00:01:34.369> it

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
loop it around to the second time put it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.030 
loop it around to the second time put it
right<00:01:34.490> over<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.880> again<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.330> then<00:01:36.040> simply

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
right over it again and then simply

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.550 
right over it again and then simply
straighten<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:37.460> up<00:01:38.170> anyway<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:39.229> get<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.439> idea

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
straighten it up anyway you get the idea

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.600 
straighten it up anyway you get the idea
not<00:01:40.430> exactly<00:01:40.640> a<00:01:41.710> one-man<00:01:42.710> show<00:01:43.189> in<00:01:43.340> terms<00:01:43.520> of

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
not exactly a one-man show in terms of

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.460 
not exactly a one-man show in terms of
the<00:01:43.700> video<00:01:43.970> but<00:01:44.240> anyway<00:01:44.689> you<00:01:44.750> get<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:44.930> idea<00:01:45.020> so

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
the video but anyway you get the idea so

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.469 
the video but anyway you get the idea so
it<00:01:45.920> just<00:01:45.979> slides<00:01:46.280> right<00:01:46.430> over<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:46.909> then<00:01:47.180> I

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
it just slides right over and then I

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.560 
it just slides right over and then I
then<00:01:47.840> have<00:01:48.080> a<00:01:48.409> yellow<00:01:48.890> table<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:49.610> easy<00:01:50.210> easy

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
then have a yellow table so easy easy

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.990 
then have a yellow table so easy easy
the<00:01:51.170> other<00:01:51.290> thing<00:01:51.439> I<00:01:51.500> like<00:01:51.650> about<00:01:51.680> this<00:01:51.890> is<00:01:52.250> you

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
the other thing I like about this is you
