and<00:00:50.309> you'll<00:00:51.120> see<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:52.170> did<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.500> sorts<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.829> good

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
and you'll see we did all sorts of good

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.430 
and you'll see we did all sorts of good
wire<00:00:53.250> management<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:55.110> ran<00:00:55.260> all

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
wire management on this and we ran all

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.920 
wire management on this and we ran all
the<00:00:55.620> lines<00:00:56.280> vacuum<00:00:56.760> lines<00:00:57.000> cooling<00:00:57.539> hoses

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
the lines vacuum lines cooling hoses

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.680 
the lines vacuum lines cooling hoses
everything<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.760> looks<00:00:59.969> pretty<00:01:00.059> much<00:01:00.420> like

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
everything so it looks pretty much like

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.750 
everything so it looks pretty much like
factory<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.039> exception<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.730> couple

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
factory with the exception of a couple

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.050 
factory with the exception of a couple
of<00:01:03.149> still<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.989> relays<00:01:04.289> over<00:01:04.589> there<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.579> we<00:01:05.909> did

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
of still in relays over there but we did

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.590 
of still in relays over there but we did
the<00:01:06.179> best<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.420> could<00:01:06.509> and<00:01:07.399> so<00:01:08.399> I'm<00:01:09.389> going<00:01:09.539> to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the best we could and so I'm going to

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.209 
the best we could and so I'm going to
back<00:01:09.719> it<00:01:09.899> out<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.109> garage<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.679> we'll<00:01:10.979> take

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.219 
back it out of the garage and we'll take

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:13.519 
back it out of the garage and we'll take
a<00:01:11.249> look<00:01:11.459> around<00:01:11.549> from<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.999> outside<00:01:12.319> okay<00:01:13.319> well

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:13.529 
a look around from the outside okay well

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:15.889 
a look around from the outside okay well
it<00:01:13.619> turns<00:01:13.829> out<00:01:13.979> today<00:01:14.279> is<00:01:14.429> too<00:01:14.639> bright<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.479> do

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
it turns out today is too bright to do

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.410 
it turns out today is too bright to do
an<00:01:16.020> outside<00:01:16.380> shot<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:17.099> can't<00:01:17.279> get<00:01:17.399> the<00:01:17.490> ISO<00:01:17.880> set

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
an outside shot we can't get the ISO set

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.499 
an outside shot we can't get the ISO set
right<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.219> it's<00:01:20.219> also<00:01:20.340> 110<00:01:20.969> degrees<00:01:21.270> outside

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
right and it's also 110 degrees outside

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.319 
right and it's also 110 degrees outside
so<00:01:21.779> it<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.009> Phoenix<00:01:23.459> in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.700> middle<00:01:23.999> of<00:01:24.090> summer

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
so it is Phoenix in the middle of summer

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.989 
so it is Phoenix in the middle of summer
so<00:01:25.289> this<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.889> front<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.219> vehicle<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:26.999 
so this is the front of the vehicle you

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:28.849 
so this is the front of the vehicle you
can<00:01:27.149> see<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.389> added<00:01:27.630> an<00:01:27.749> ease<00:01:27.929> mode<00:01:28.170> badge<00:01:28.590> on

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
can see we added an ease mode badge on

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.260 
can see we added an ease mode badge on
the<00:01:28.919> front<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.700> really<00:01:29.939> about<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.209> only

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the front it's really about the only

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.029 
the front it's really about the only
modification<00:01:30.749> except<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.529> might<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.859> able<00:01:31.919> to

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
modification except you might be able to

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.099 
modification except you might be able to
see<00:01:32.249> through<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.520> grille<00:01:32.779> there's<00:01:33.779> still<00:01:33.990> an

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
see through the grille there's still an

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:38.120 
see through the grille there's still an
intercooler<00:01:35.359> the<00:01:36.359> heat<00:01:37.229> exchanger<00:01:37.679> for<00:01:37.709> it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
intercooler the heat exchanger for it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.539 
intercooler the heat exchanger for it
so<00:01:39.380> that's<00:01:40.380> behind<00:01:40.709> there<00:01:40.919> and<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.069> actually

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
so that's behind there and it actually

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.760 
so that's behind there and it actually
says<00:01:41.759> Stillen<00:01:42.419> on<00:01:42.569> it<00:01:42.749> other<00:01:43.319> than<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
says Stillen on it other than that the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.129 
says Stillen on it other than that the
whole<00:01:43.799> front<00:01:44.189> end<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.429> completely<00:01:44.789> stock<00:01:45.139> so

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:46.139 
whole front end is completely stock so

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.449 
whole front end is completely stock so
now<00:01:46.289> we'll<00:01:46.439> move<00:01:46.469> over<00:01:46.709> to<00:01:46.859> the<00:01:47.069> driver's<00:01:47.429> side

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
now we'll move over to the driver's side

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.190 
now we'll move over to the driver's side
and<00:01:47.880> take<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> look<00:01:48.359> at<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.569> from<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.959> side

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and take a look at it from that side

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.709 
and take a look at it from that side
okay<00:01:50.039> so<00:01:50.069> here's<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.789> wheels<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.329> added<00:01:51.569> knees

nice<00:02:05.789> paint<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.359> won't<00:02:07.109> say<00:02:07.289> it's<00:02:07.439> super

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
nice paint I won't say it's super

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:11.500 
nice paint I won't say it's super
awesome<00:02:08.329> but<00:02:09.329> it's<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.750> pretty<00:02:10.229> good<00:02:10.500> paint<00:02:10.739> and

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
awesome but it's a pretty good paint and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.950 
awesome but it's a pretty good paint and
my<00:02:12.510> model<00:02:12.870> also<00:02:13.019> came<00:02:13.379> with<00:02:13.409> this

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
my model also came with this

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.020 
my model also came with this
steps<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:15.280> few<00:02:15.490> other<00:02:16.320> accoutrements<00:02:17.320> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
steps and a few other accoutrements and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.430 
steps and a few other accoutrements and
so<00:02:19.030> that's<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.750> from<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.020> side

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
so that's it from the side

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.680 
so that's it from the side
okay<00:02:21.280> here's<00:02:21.550> from<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.880> back<00:02:22.060> nothing<00:02:22.540> much

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
okay here's from the back nothing much

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.300 
okay here's from the back nothing much
to<00:02:22.720> talk<00:02:22.930> about<00:02:22.990> except<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.770> can<00:02:23.920> see<00:02:24.100> we

to talk about except you can see we

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.030 
to talk about except you can see we
added<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:24.760> chrome<00:02:25.030> exhaust<00:02:25.270> tip<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:25.930> we<00:02:26.740> did<00:02:26.920> do

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
added a chrome exhaust tip and we did do

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.670 
added a chrome exhaust tip and we did do
a<00:02:27.070> video<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.460> that<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:28.030> we'll<00:02:28.870> also<00:02:29.020> see<00:02:29.530> if<00:02:29.590> we

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
a video on that and we'll also see if we

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.140 
a video on that and we'll also see if we
get<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.830> shot<00:02:30.100> from<00:02:30.250> underneath<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.940> show<00:02:31.090> you

get a shot from underneath and show you

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.040 
get a shot from underneath and show you
the<00:02:31.680> Doug<00:02:32.680> Thorley<00:02:33.100> catback<00:02:33.490> exhaust<00:02:34.050> so

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
the Doug Thorley catback exhaust so

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.240 
the Doug Thorley catback exhaust so
we'll<00:02:35.140> try<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.320> get<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.560> shot<00:02:35.800> for<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.070> next

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.010 
we'll try to get that shot for you next
okay<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.330> picture<00:02:37.600> of<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.870> Doug

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
okay this is a picture of the Doug

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.860 
okay this is a picture of the Doug
Hurley<00:02:38.260> catback<00:02:38.680> exhaust<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:40.330> wasn't<00:02:40.690> too

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
Hurley catback exhaust it wasn't too

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.450 
Hurley catback exhaust it wasn't too
hard<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.320> an<00:02:41.410> installation<00:02:41.710> and<00:02:42.220> we<00:02:42.310> actually

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
hard of an installation and we actually

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.970 
hard of an installation and we actually
did<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.970> tube<00:02:43.150> video<00:02:43.480> on<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.710> can<00:02:44.770> see

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
did you tube video on it so you can see

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.940 
did you tube video on it so you can see
how<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:45.190> was<00:02:45.460> done<00:02:45.490> came<00:02:46.330> out<00:02:46.450> pretty<00:02:46.600> good

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
how that was done came out pretty good

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.940 
how that was done came out pretty good
and<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:49.150> think<00:02:49.390> we'll<00:02:49.600> try<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.870> get<00:02:50.110> one<00:02:50.680> shot<00:02:50.890> in

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
and I think we'll try to get one shot in

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.440 
and I think we'll try to get one shot in
the<00:02:51.160> engine<00:02:51.430> compartment<00:02:51.460> of<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.060> knees<00:02:52.300> Moe

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
the engine compartment of the knees Moe

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.710 
the engine compartment of the knees Moe
headers<00:02:52.840> see<00:02:53.770> if<00:02:53.830> we<00:02:53.920> can<00:02:54.010> get<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.600> look<00:02:55.600> at

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
headers see if we can get a look at

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.660 
headers see if we can get a look at
those<00:02:55.870> okay<00:02:56.800> we're<00:02:56.980> actually<00:02:57.070> having<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.580> look

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
those okay we're actually having to look

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.300 
those okay we're actually having to look
through<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.060> wheel<00:02:58.210> weld<00:02:58.480> for<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:58.960> to<00:02:59.080> get<00:02:59.200> a

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
through the wheel weld for you to get a

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.190 
through the wheel weld for you to get a
look<00:03:00.310> at<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.610> knees<00:03:00.970> Moe<00:03:01.150> headers<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.660> by<00:03:02.140> the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
look at the knees Moe headers and by the

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.960 
look at the knees Moe headers and by the
way<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.440> do<00:03:02.830> install<00:03:03.220> them<00:03:03.430> through<00:03:03.820> the

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
way you do install them through the

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.580 
way you do install them through the
wheel<00:03:04.120> wells<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.810> we<00:03:04.930> did<00:03:05.080> a<00:03:05.110> video<00:03:05.290> on<00:03:05.560> that

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
wheel wells and we did a video on that

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.750 
wheel wells and we did a video on that
as<00:03:05.830> well<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.160> have<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.370> pull<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:06.610> front

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
as well you have to pull the front

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.880 
as well you have to pull the front
wheels<00:03:07.000> off<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:07.600> install<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.650> headers

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
wheels off and install the headers

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.850 
wheels off and install the headers
through<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.220> side<00:03:09.660> but<00:03:10.680> these<00:03:11.680> are<00:03:11.800> the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
through the side but these are the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.240

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
overhead view of the headers from the

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
overhead view of the headers from the
top<00:03:24.160> of<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.370> engine<00:03:24.640> bay<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:26.760> pretty<00:03:27.760> cool

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970

mode<00:03:31.420> switch<00:03:31.690> out<00:03:31.930> of<00:03:31.960> a<00:03:32.110> Nissan<00:03:32.470> Titan<00:03:32.890> and

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
mode switch out of a Nissan Titan and

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.810 
mode switch out of a Nissan Titan and
that<00:03:33.910> lets<00:03:34.270> me<00:03:34.360> select<00:03:34.630> map<00:03:35.020> a<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.500> map<00:03:35.680> B<00:03:35.920> for

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
that lets me select map a and map B for

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.390 
that lets me select map a and map B for
the<00:03:36.910> still<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:37.210> supercharger<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.160> then<00:03:39.160> we

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
the still and supercharger and then we

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.700 
the still and supercharger and then we
also<00:03:40.500> put<00:03:41.500> in<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.740> water<00:03:42.670> temperature<00:03:42.910> gauge

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
also put in a water temperature gauge

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.770 
also put in a water temperature gauge
right<00:03:44.710> here<00:03:44.980> that<00:03:45.310> gives<00:03:45.760> me<00:03:45.910> my<00:03:46.060> intercooler

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
right here that gives me my intercooler

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.260 
right here that gives me my intercooler
water<00:03:46.990> temperature<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:48.280> we're<00:03:49.060> going<00:03:49.210> to

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
water temperature and we're going to

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.440 
water temperature and we're going to
start<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.600> up<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:49.900> go<00:03:50.680> take<00:03:50.830> it<00:03:50.890> for<00:03:51.160> a<00:03:51.190> drive

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
start it up and go take it for a drive

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.940 
start it up and go take it for a drive
all<00:03:52.450> right<00:03:52.630> someone<00:03:52.990> started<00:03:53.320> up<00:03:53.440> now<00:03:53.620> and

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
we're going to go take it for a test

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:05.770 
we're going to go take it for a test
drive

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.140 

so<00:04:06.380> at<00:04:06.560> first<00:04:06.710> I'm<00:04:07.010> just<00:04:07.040> going<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.490> take<00:04:07.970> it

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
so at first I'm just going to take it

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.180 
so at first I'm just going to take it
very<00:04:08.330> slowly<00:04:09.080> and<00:04:11.740> we'll<00:04:12.740> do<00:04:12.890> that<00:04:13.010> on<00:04:13.070> the

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
very slowly and we'll do that on the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.970 
very slowly and we'll do that on the
first<00:04:13.520> little<00:04:13.790> take<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.590> this<00:04:15.590> is<00:04:15.740> the<00:04:15.860> way<00:04:15.950> I

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
first little take and this is the way I

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.319 
first little take and this is the way I
normally<00:04:16.459> would<00:04:16.640> drive<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.980> I<00:04:18.980> get<00:04:19.220> about<00:04:19.340> 18

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
normally would drive and I get about 18

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.160 
normally would drive and I get about 18
miles<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.810> a<00:04:20.840> gallon<00:04:20.900> in<00:04:21.320> town<00:04:21.580> when<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:22.640> Drive

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
miles to a gallon in town when I Drive

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.820 
miles to a gallon in town when I Drive
pretty<00:04:24.170> slight<00:04:24.830> footed<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:25.460> then<00:04:26.380> 20<00:04:27.380> maybe

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
pretty slight footed and then 20 maybe

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.430 
pretty slight footed and then 20 maybe
21<00:04:28.340> on<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.520> highway<00:04:28.960> before<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:29.990> put<00:04:30.260> on<00:04:30.290> the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
21 on the highway before I put on the

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.560 
21 on the highway before I put on the
supercharger<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.130> was<00:04:31.370> getting<00:04:31.610> about<00:04:31.790> 26<00:04:33.100> so

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
supercharger I was getting about 26 so

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.270 
supercharger I was getting about 26 so
again<00:04:35.570> I'm<00:04:36.140> going<00:04:36.320> to<00:04:36.380> show<00:04:36.560> you<00:04:36.620> as<00:04:36.860> it<00:04:37.010> shifts

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
again I'm going to show you as it shifts

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.640 
again I'm going to show you as it shifts
through<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.700> gears<00:04:38.260> when<00:04:39.260> you<00:04:39.350> drive<00:04:39.620> just

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
through the gears when you drive just

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.210 
through the gears when you drive just
real<00:04:40.540> light-footed<00:04:41.540> like<00:04:41.840> this<00:04:42.140> you<00:04:43.070> can

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
real light-footed like this you can

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.080 
real light-footed like this you can
still<00:04:43.430> maintain<00:04:43.610> decent<00:04:44.300> gas<00:04:44.450> mileage<00:04:46.090> so

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
still maintain decent gas mileage so

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.000 
still maintain decent gas mileage so
we'll<00:04:47.419> cut<00:04:47.600> away<00:04:47.780> here<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.230> then<00:04:48.500> we're<00:04:48.919> going

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
we'll cut away here and then we're going

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.640 
we'll cut away here and then we're going
to<00:04:49.100> get<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:49.370> an<00:04:49.520> area<00:04:49.760> where<00:04:50.060> we<00:04:50.210> can<00:04:50.470> do<00:04:51.470> some

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
to get to an area where we can do some

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.140 
to get to an area where we can do some
hard<00:04:51.860> accelerations<00:04:52.610> and<00:04:52.790> we'll<00:04:52.880> get<00:04:53.060> a

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
hard accelerations and we'll get a

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.540 
hard accelerations and we'll get a
couple<00:04:53.270> of<00:04:53.450> shots<00:04:53.510> of<00:04:53.840> that<00:04:53.990> okay<00:04:54.950> right<00:04:55.340> now<00:04:55.520> I

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
couple of shots of that okay right now I

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.900 
couple of shots of that okay right now I
have<00:04:55.880> it<00:04:56.000> on<00:04:56.060> map<00:04:56.360> a<00:04:56.660> which<00:04:56.990> is<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:57.910> low

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
have it on map a which is the low

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.600 
have it on map a which is the low
performance<00:04:59.510> mode<00:04:59.919> as<00:05:00.919> soon<00:05:01.160> as<00:05:01.250> I<00:05:01.340> can<00:05:01.400> figure

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
performance mode as soon as I can figure

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.120 
performance mode as soon as I can figure
out<00:05:01.730> where<00:05:01.940> this<00:05:02.060> guy<00:05:02.300> is<00:05:02.360> going<00:05:02.720> to<00:05:02.780> be<00:05:03.040> then<00:05:04.040> I

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
out where this guy is going to be then I

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.500 
out where this guy is going to be then I
can<00:05:04.160> go<00:05:04.460> ahead<00:05:04.490> and<00:05:04.850> see<00:05:05.000> how<00:05:05.120> it's<00:05:05.270> going<00:05:05.450> to

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
can go ahead and see how it's going to

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.810 
can go ahead and see how it's going to
do

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.630 

don't<00:05:13.510> want<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.660> get<00:05:13.780> a<00:05:13.810> ticket<00:05:14.050> as<00:05:14.920> you<00:05:15.490> can

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
don't want to get a ticket as you can

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.610 
don't want to get a ticket as you can
see<00:05:15.820> it<00:05:15.940> has<00:05:16.150> pretty<00:05:16.390> darn<00:05:16.840> good<00:05:17.050> performance

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
see it has pretty darn good performance

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.050 
see it has pretty darn good performance
and<00:05:17.770> that's<00:05:17.950> in<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.340> low<00:05:19.240> performance<00:05:19.840> mode

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
and that's in the low performance mode

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.150 
and that's in the low performance mode
so<00:05:22.060> I'm<00:05:22.810> going<00:05:22.990> to<00:05:23.080> turn<00:05:23.320> into<00:05:23.500> a<00:05:23.650> place<00:05:23.950> here<00:05:24.130> I

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
so I'm going to turn into a place here I

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.480 
so I'm going to turn into a place here I
can<00:05:24.340> turn<00:05:24.460> around<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:25.740> we<00:05:26.740> will<00:05:26.980> put<00:05:27.160> it<00:05:27.190> high

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
can turn around and we will put it high

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.730 
can turn around and we will put it high
performance<00:05:28.030> and<00:05:28.180> come<00:05:28.390> back<00:05:28.540> out<00:05:28.780> so<00:05:29.530> that'll

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
performance and come back out so that'll

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.130 
performance and come back out so that'll
be<00:05:29.830> another<00:05:30.070> take<00:05:30.790> here<00:05:31.090> okay<00:05:31.900> I'm<00:05:31.990> going<00:05:32.080> to

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
be another take here okay I'm going to

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.290 
be another take here okay I'm going to
pull<00:05:32.290> up<00:05:32.320> here<00:05:32.710> to<00:05:32.860> a<00:05:32.890> stop<00:05:33.220> sign<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:33.850> I<00:05:34.120> have

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
pull up here to a stop sign and I have

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.170 
pull up here to a stop sign and I have
it<00:05:34.420> in<00:05:34.540> the<00:05:34.630> high<00:05:34.750> performance<00:05:34.810> mode<00:05:35.470> now<00:05:36.180> so

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
it in the high performance mode now so

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.710 
it in the high performance mode now so
if<00:05:37.960> it's<00:05:38.170> clear<00:05:38.440> which<00:05:38.680> it<00:05:39.010> is<00:05:39.360> then<00:05:40.360> here<00:05:40.600> we

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
if it's clear which it is then here we

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:50.820 
if it's clear which it is then here we
go

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.460 

as<00:05:51.010> you<00:05:51.610> can<00:05:51.730> see<00:05:51.970> it's<00:05:52.240> pretty<00:05:52.810> darn<00:05:53.230> quick<00:05:54.150> so

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
as you can see it's pretty darn quick so

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.770 
as you can see it's pretty darn quick so
there's<00:05:56.470> a<00:05:56.560> good<00:05:56.820> example<00:05:57.820> of<00:05:58.060> how<00:05:58.210> fast<00:05:58.480> this

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
there's a good example of how fast this

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.350 
there's a good example of how fast this
machine<00:05:59.440> is<00:05:59.650> now<00:05:59.800> that<00:05:59.980> I've<00:06:00.070> modified<00:06:00.400> it<00:06:00.580> so

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
machine is now that I've modified it so

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.660 
machine is now that I've modified it so
I<00:06:01.420> hope<00:06:01.600> you<00:06:01.720> enjoyed<00:06:01.990> watching<00:06:02.020> my<00:06:02.770> 2011
