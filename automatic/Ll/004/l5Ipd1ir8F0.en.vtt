00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
pictures are good but I don't think they

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.740 
pictures are good but I don't think they
match<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> Samsung<00:01:01.410> Galaxy<00:01:01.590> s6<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.750> when

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
match to the Samsung Galaxy s6 like when

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.090 
match to the Samsung Galaxy s6 like when

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.240 
I was taking pictures with the iPhone 6
plus<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.790> felt<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.990> background<00:01:07.320> was<00:01:07.680> um

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
plus it felt like the background was um

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.219 
plus it felt like the background was um
too<00:01:08.790> much<00:01:09.000> Sun<00:01:09.360> coming<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.900> something<00:01:10.170> like

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
too much Sun coming in something like

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.500 
too much Sun coming in something like
that<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.189> wasn't<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> Sun<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.180> was<00:01:12.330> just

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
that but it wasn't the Sun it was just

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.300 
that but it wasn't the Sun it was just
like<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.990> exposure<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.680> guess<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.100> say<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.620 
like the exposure I guess you can say I
don't<00:01:14.430> know<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.330> something

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
don't know but it was just something

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.149 
don't know but it was just something
about<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.110> iPhone<00:01:16.380> 6<00:01:16.590> plus<00:01:16.710> when<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.009> was
