combining it so you're creating like a

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.540 
combining it so you're creating like a
basket<00:02:07.750> weave<00:02:07.780> which<00:02:08.289> creates<00:02:08.710> movement<00:02:09.039> and

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
basket weave which creates movement and

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.710 
basket weave which creates movement and
texture<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:12.310> see<00:02:12.520> how<00:02:12.640> already<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.330> covered

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
texture you see how already you covered

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.340 
texture you see how already you covered
the<00:02:13.840> line

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
the line

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.530 
the line
that's<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.580> idea

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
that's the idea

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.470 
that's the idea
separating<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.290> front<00:02:17.650> from<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.920> back<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:19.209> so

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
separating the front from the back is so

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.020 
separating the front from the back is so
you<00:02:19.599> can<00:02:19.780> cover<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.200> line<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.829> then<00:02:21.790> when

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
you can cover the line and then when

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.550 
you can cover the line and then when
you're<00:02:22.180> bringing<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.599> back<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:23.049> just<00:02:23.319> pin<00:02:23.530> it

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
you're bringing it back you just pin it

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.319 
you're bringing it back you just pin it
in<00:02:25.950> then<00:02:26.950> you're<00:02:27.129> gonna<00:02:27.220> take<00:02:27.519> some<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:28.150> the

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
in then you're gonna take some of the

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:35.479 
in then you're gonna take some of the
hair<00:02:28.510> that's<00:02:28.689> hanging<00:02:29.140> out<00:02:29.260> already<00:02:33.959> pin<00:02:34.959> it

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
hair that's hanging out already pin it

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:42.809 
hair that's hanging out already pin it
and<00:02:36.489> then<00:02:37.180> bring<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.540> in<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:42.250> next<00:02:42.459> we're<00:02:42.670> going

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
and then bring it in so next we're going

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.759 
and then bring it in so next we're going
to<00:02:42.940> take<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.359> left<00:02:43.540> side<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.049> hair<00:02:44.349> and

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
to take the left side of the hair and

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.210 
to take the left side of the hair and
you're<00:02:45.250> going<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.400> just<00:02:45.700> swoop<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.180> back<00:02:47.220> to

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
you're going to just swoop it back to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.099 
you're going to just swoop it back to
cover<00:02:48.459> that<00:02:48.700> parting<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.540> already<00:02:49.870> did

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
cover that parting that you already did

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.170 
cover that parting that you already did
and<00:02:50.379> then<00:02:51.159> when<00:02:51.280> you're<00:02:51.430> swooping<00:02:51.849> it<00:02:51.970> back

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
and then when you're swooping it back

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.580 
and then when you're swooping it back
you<00:02:52.420> want<00:02:52.599> to<00:02:52.659> make<00:02:52.840> sure<00:02:53.019> that<00:02:53.200> this<00:02:53.379> is

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
you want to make sure that this is

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.059 
you want to make sure that this is
laying<00:02:53.859> nice<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.930> when<00:02:56.470> you're<00:02:56.590> laying<00:02:56.769> it

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
laying nice so when you're laying it

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.300 
laying nice so when you're laying it
back<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.959> can<00:02:59.139> create<00:02:59.409> somewhat<00:03:00.099> of<00:03:00.280> the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
back you can create somewhat of the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.970 
back you can create somewhat of the
style<00:03:01.200> then<00:03:02.200> you're<00:03:02.379> going<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.530> take<00:03:02.769> the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
style then you're going to take the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.580 
style then you're going to take the
right<00:03:03.159> side<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:04.109> you're<00:03:05.109> going<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.290> pull<00:03:05.470> it

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
right side and you're going to pull it

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:14.789 
right side and you're going to pull it
behind<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.720> pin<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.319> up<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:14.440> now<00:03:14.590> it's

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
behind and pin it up so now it's

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.110 
behind and pin it up so now it's
creating<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.489> criss<00:03:15.909> cross<00:03:15.940> X<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.790> then<00:03:18.970> what

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
creating a criss cross X so then what

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.490 
creating a criss cross X so then what
you<00:03:19.239> want<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.510> do<00:03:19.629> is<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:19.840> want<00:03:20.019> to<00:03:20.049> take<00:03:20.260> some

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
you want to do is you want to take some

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.069 
you want to do is you want to take some
existing<00:03:20.829> hair<00:03:21.310> that's<00:03:21.579> already<00:03:21.879> here<00:03:25.079> to

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
existing hair that's already here to

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.349 
existing hair that's already here to
cover<00:03:26.379> that<00:03:26.590> mark<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:29.470> don't<00:03:29.769> see<00:03:30.359> the

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
cover that mark so you don't see the

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.409 
cover that mark so you don't see the
actual<00:03:31.750> criss<00:03:32.109> cross<00:03:32.470> you<00:03:33.280> bring<00:03:33.519> this<00:03:33.669> in<00:03:33.910> you

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:34.419 
actual criss cross you bring this in you

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.199 
actual criss cross you bring this in you
throw<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.810> over<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:36.459> you<00:03:36.519> see<00:03:36.819> that<00:03:36.970> there's

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
throw it over so you see that there's

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.819 
throw it over so you see that there's
something<00:03:37.480> going<00:03:37.810> on<00:03:38.139> but<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:38.560> don't<00:03:38.650> know

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
something going on but you don't know

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.939 
something going on but you don't know
exactly<00:03:39.340> where<00:03:39.609> it's<00:03:39.760> coming<00:03:40.000> from<00:03:40.949> and

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:41.949 
exactly where it's coming from and

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:43.920 
exactly where it's coming from and
that's<00:03:42.190> basically<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:43.030> idea<00:03:43.480> of<00:03:43.599> what<00:03:43.780> you're

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
that's basically the idea of what you're

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.599 
that's basically the idea of what you're
going<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:44.169> be<00:03:44.260> doing<00:03:44.650> throughout<00:03:45.129> the<00:03:45.430> whole

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
going to be doing throughout the whole

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.369 
going to be doing throughout the whole
hair<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.120> just<00:03:46.359> want<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.599> keep<00:03:46.750> on<00:03:46.930> grabbing

hair you just want to keep on grabbing

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.339 
hair you just want to keep on grabbing
random<00:03:47.560> pieces<00:03:48.099> and<00:03:48.629> just<00:03:49.629> stick<00:03:49.870> them<00:03:50.019> up<00:03:50.169> in

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
random pieces and just stick them up in

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:57.990 
random pieces and just stick them up in
your<00:03:50.379> hair<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:56.579> then<00:03:57.579> what<00:03:57.790> you're<00:03:57.940> gonna
