exactly the way LC does what she does is
takes<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.540> bobby<00:04:10.719> pin<00:04:10.840> with<00:04:11.200> this<00:04:11.349> little

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
takes a bobby pin with this little

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.000 
takes a bobby pin with this little
jaggedy<00:04:12.159> part<00:04:12.430> facing<00:04:12.639> down<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:13.650> just<00:04:14.650> sticks

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
jaggedy part facing down and just sticks

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.400 
jaggedy part facing down and just sticks
it<00:04:15.220> in<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.370> hair<00:04:15.750> then<00:04:16.750> she<00:04:16.959> takes<00:04:17.199> another

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
it in the hair then she takes another

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.379 
it in the hair then she takes another
one<00:04:18.220> with<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.519> jaggedy<00:04:18.940> part<00:04:19.209> down<00:04:19.329> and

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
one with the jaggedy part down and

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.100 
one with the jaggedy part down and
sticks<00:04:19.959> it<00:04:20.139> from<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.560> top<00:04:21.360> going<00:04:22.360> down<00:04:22.539> this

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
sticks it from the top going down this

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.230 
sticks it from the top going down this
way<00:04:23.169> so<00:04:23.440> that<00:04:23.800> they<00:04:23.919> interlock<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:24.490> hold<00:04:25.090> it

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
way so that they interlock and hold it

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.890 
way so that they interlock and hold it
together<00:04:25.830> like<00:04:26.830> this<00:04:27.060> so<00:04:28.060> then<00:04:28.270> you<00:04:28.690> can<00:04:28.870> take

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
together like this so then you can take

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.379 
together like this so then you can take
this<00:04:29.289> down<00:04:29.560> brush<00:04:30.460> out<00:04:30.669> any<00:04:30.820> of<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.150> braid

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
this down brush out any of the braid

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.430 
this down brush out any of the braid
that's<00:04:31.599> not<00:04:31.990> in<00:04:32.259> it<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.930> have<00:04:35.139> your

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
that's not in it and you have your

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.260 
that's not in it and you have your
famous<00:04:36.039> LC<00:04:36.940> braid<00:04:37.210> so<00:04:38.169> you<00:04:38.199> can<00:04:38.560> choose<00:04:39.270> maybe

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
if you have shorter hair you only want

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.589 
if you have shorter hair you only want
to<00:04:41.889> take<00:04:42.009> it<00:04:42.160> down<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.310> there<00:04:42.610> maybe<00:04:42.970> you<00:04:43.300> want

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
to take it down to there maybe you want

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
to take it down back around but that is

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.439 
to take it down back around but that is
the<00:04:46.960> first<00:04:47.169> way<00:04:47.500> you<00:04:47.530> can<00:04:47.680> do<00:04:47.949> it<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:49.090> second

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
the first way you can do it the second

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.750 
the first way you can do it the second
way<00:04:49.539> you<00:04:49.599> can<00:04:49.900> do<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.080> is<00:04:50.349> by<00:04:50.949> taking<00:04:51.490> those

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
way you can do it is by taking those

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.670 
way you can do it is by taking those
bobby<00:04:52.120> pins<00:04:52.539> out<00:04:54.900> pretty<00:04:55.900> carefully<00:04:56.440> so<00:04:56.650> that

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
bobby pins out pretty carefully so that

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.490 
bobby pins out pretty carefully so that
you<00:04:56.889> can<00:04:57.039> still<00:04:57.370> hold<00:04:57.580> on<00:04:57.789> to<00:04:58.000> your<00:04:58.090> braid<00:04:59.789> okay

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
hold on to that braid so it doesn't come

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.370 
hold on to that braid so it doesn't come
out<00:05:03.940> and<00:05:04.330> what<00:05:04.570> you're<00:05:04.720> going<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:04.960> want<00:05:05.139> to<00:05:05.199> do

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.779 
out and what you're going to want to do
is<00:05:05.979> take<00:05:06.340> this<00:05:06.639> top<00:05:07.030> section<00:05:07.659> of<00:05:07.780> hair<00:05:08.639> pick<00:05:09.639> it

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
is take this top section of hair pick it

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.540 
is take this top section of hair pick it
up<00:05:09.940> and<00:05:10.090> throw<00:05:10.570> it<00:05:10.599> around<00:05:10.810> back<00:05:11.289> and<00:05:11.849> pin<00:05:12.849> this

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
up and throw it around back and pin this

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.480 
up and throw it around back and pin this
right<00:05:15.570> under<00:05:16.710> where<00:05:17.710> that<00:05:17.949> hair<00:05:18.250> usually

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
right under where that hair usually

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:26.279 
right under where that hair usually
falls<00:05:19.000> down<00:05:19.389> like<00:05:23.460> this<00:05:24.810> then<00:05:25.810> you're<00:05:26.199> going

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
falls down like this then you're going

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.909 
falls down like this then you're going
to<00:05:26.349> take<00:05:26.560> that<00:05:26.800> hair<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:27.370> swing<00:05:27.820> it<00:05:27.970> over

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
to take that hair and swing it over

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.610 
to take that hair and swing it over
position<00:05:29.919> your<00:05:30.099> bobby<00:05:30.340> pins<00:05:31.169> so<00:05:32.169> you<00:05:32.199> can't

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
position your bobby pins so you can't

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.429 
position your bobby pins so you can't
see<00:05:32.979> them<00:05:33.250> and<00:05:34.120> that's<00:05:34.720> another<00:05:35.050> way

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:36.439 
see them and that's another way

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.829 
see them and that's another way
so<00:05:36.949> the<00:05:37.099> braid<00:05:37.309> just<00:05:37.339> kind<00:05:37.849> of<00:05:37.909> cascades<00:05:38.539> back

00:05:38.829 --> 00:05:38.839 
so the braid just kind of cascades back

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.199 
so the braid just kind of cascades back
into<00:05:39.379> your<00:05:39.499> hair<00:05:39.830> and<00:05:40.099> you<00:05:40.550> can't<00:05:40.789> see<00:05:40.969> any

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:41.209 
into your hair and you can't see any

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:42.459 
into your hair and you can't see any
pins<00:05:41.659> at<00:05:41.839> all

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:42.469 
pins at all

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:45.100 
pins at all
the<00:05:43.009> final<00:05:43.489> way<00:05:43.639> which<00:05:43.819> is<00:05:43.969> my<00:05:44.149> favorite<00:05:44.929> way

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
the final way which is my favorite way

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.549 
the final way which is my favorite way
is<00:05:45.409> by<00:05:45.589> taking<00:05:45.830> these<00:05:46.279> pins<00:05:46.669> out<00:05:47.319> once<00:05:48.319> again

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:50.559 
is by taking these pins out once again

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:53.259 
is by taking these pins out once again
holding<00:05:51.559> this<00:05:51.769> up<00:05:52.009> and<00:05:52.159> brushing<00:05:52.669> all<00:05:52.909> of<00:05:53.119> this

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:53.269 
holding this up and brushing all of this

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:57.549 
holding this up and brushing all of this
hair<00:05:53.629> down<00:05:54.819> okay<00:05:55.819> then<00:05:55.999> I<00:05:56.539> take<00:05:56.749> a<00:05:56.779> little<00:05:57.110> clip

00:05:57.549 --> 00:05:57.559 
hair down okay then I take a little clip

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:00.699
