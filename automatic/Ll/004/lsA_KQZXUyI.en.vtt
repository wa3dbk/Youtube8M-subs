00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
and I actually end up losing it right

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.540 
and I actually end up losing it right
here<00:04:25.320> because<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.590> side<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.890> set<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.130> claymore

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550

game<00:05:02.760> you<00:05:03.270> saw<00:05:03.420> the<00:05:03.480> first<00:05:03.780> building<00:05:04.140> i<00:05:04.200> went

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
game you saw the first building i went

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.500 
game you saw the first building i went
into<00:05:04.620> was<00:05:04.980> chopper<00:05:05.550> gunner<00:05:05.790> you<00:05:06.300> saw<00:05:06.450> the

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
into was chopper gunner you saw the

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.180 
into was chopper gunner you saw the
first<00:05:06.750> building<00:05:07.080> i<00:05:07.140> went<00:05:07.350> into<00:05:07.530> was<00:05:07.800> building

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
first building i went into was building

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.030 
first building i went into was building
building<00:05:08.970> b<00:05:09.290> FY<00:05:10.290> i'm<00:05:10.710> not<00:05:10.860> going<00:05:11.010> to

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
building b FY i'm not going to

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.460 
building b FY i'm not going to
fast-forward<00:05:11.370> this<00:05:11.730> because<00:05:12.090> I<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.900> is<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.110> very

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
fast-forward this because I it is a very

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.320 
fast-forward this because I it is a very
very<00:05:13.620> short<00:05:13.770> match<00:05:14.130> anyway<00:05:14.580> and<00:05:14.790> so<00:05:14.880> I<00:05:14.910> kind<00:05:15.270> of

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
very short match anyway and so I kind of

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.640 
very short match anyway and so I kind of
want<00:05:15.480> to<00:05:15.540> take<00:05:15.690> these<00:05:15.870> couple<00:05:16.230> minutes<00:05:16.530> to

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
want to take these couple minutes to

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.840 
want to take these couple minutes to
tell<00:05:16.830> you<00:05:16.920> guys<00:05:17.070> a<00:05:17.130> little<00:05:17.340> bit<00:05:17.460> about<00:05:17.700> my

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
tell you guys a little bit about my

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.850 
tell you guys a little bit about my
strategy<00:05:18.360> so<00:05:18.570> just<00:05:18.840> go<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.170> a<00:05:19.260> new<00:05:19.410> page<00:05:19.620> or

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
strategy so just go to a new page or

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.290 
strategy so just go to a new page or
whatever<00:05:20.100> if<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:20.340> don't<00:05:20.490> like<00:05:20.670> this<00:05:20.850> chopper

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
whatever if you don't like this chopper

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.110 
whatever if you don't like this chopper
gunner<00:05:21.450> gameplay<00:05:21.840> but<00:05:22.800> yeah<00:05:23.370> so<00:05:23.820> first

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
gunner gameplay but yeah so first

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.270 
gunner gameplay but yeah so first
building<00:05:24.420> i<00:05:24.510> went<00:05:24.720> into<00:05:24.870> was<00:05:25.260> a<00:05:25.470> warehouse<00:05:25.860> be

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
building i went into was a warehouse be

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.240 
building i went into was a warehouse be
and<00:05:26.610> so<00:05:27.420> that<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:27.930> probably<00:05:28.740> one<00:05:29.100> of<00:05:29.130> the

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
and so that is probably one of the

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.740 
and so that is probably one of the
quintessential<00:05:29.700> areas<00:05:30.150> you<00:05:30.270> can<00:05:30.390> access

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
quintessential areas you can access

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.960 
quintessential areas you can access
crossroads<00:05:31.410> see<00:05:31.710> from<00:05:32.430> that<00:05:32.580> building<00:05:32.760> you

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
crossroads see from that building you

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.090 
crossroads see from that building you
can<00:05:33.150> also<00:05:33.390> overlooked<00:05:34.080> the<00:05:34.350> entrance<00:05:34.740> into<00:05:34.980> a

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
can also overlooked the entrance into a

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.000 
can also overlooked the entrance into a
and<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.730> main<00:05:35.940> area<00:05:36.330> it<00:05:37.200> also<00:05:37.380> is<00:05:37.590> great<00:05:37.800> for

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
and the main area it also is great for

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.320 
and the main area it also is great for
defending<00:05:38.610> be<00:05:38.760> when<00:05:39.000> you're<00:05:39.120> playing

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
defending be when you're playing

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.710 
defending be when you're playing
domination<00:05:40.260> on<00:05:40.380> this<00:05:40.560> map<00:05:40.740> or<00:05:41.730> sabotage<00:05:42.540> I

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
domination on this map or sabotage I

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.270 
domination on this map or sabotage I
think<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:42.990> bomb<00:05:43.140> is<00:05:43.350> right<00:05:43.500> where<00:05:43.650> flag<00:05:43.890> be<00:05:44.100> is

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
think the bomb is right where flag be is

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.730 
think the bomb is right where flag be is
on<00:05:44.460> sabotage<00:05:44.940> so<00:05:45.270> you<00:05:46.020> know<00:05:46.110> that's<00:05:46.260> a<00:05:46.470> very

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
on sabotage so you know that's a very

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.380 
on sabotage so you know that's a very
the<00:05:46.980> one<00:05:47.130> with<00:05:47.280> the<00:05:47.310> two<00:05:47.550> smoke<00:05:47.820> stacks<00:05:48.150> right

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
the one with the two smoke stacks right

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.520 
the one with the two smoke stacks right
there<00:05:48.570> to<00:05:48.720> left<00:05:48.930> that's<00:05:49.050> a<00:05:49.170> very<00:05:49.350> very

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
there to left that's a very very

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.140 
there to left that's a very very
important<00:05:50.010> building<00:05:50.310> and<00:05:50.460> you<00:05:50.520> almost<00:05:50.760> always

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
important building and you almost always

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.730 
important building and you almost always
want<00:05:51.450> to<00:05:51.480> make<00:05:51.600> sure<00:05:51.660> your<00:05:51.990> team<00:05:52.200> has<00:05:52.380> control

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
want to make sure your team has control

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.740 
want to make sure your team has control
of<00:05:52.770> that<00:05:52.980> the<00:05:53.610> best<00:05:53.820> way<00:05:53.940> to<00:05:54.000> do<00:05:54.180> that<00:05:54.210> is<00:05:54.390> going

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
of that the best way to do that is going

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.270 
of that the best way to do that is going
to<00:05:54.810> be<00:05:54.870> using<00:05:55.050> claymores<00:05:55.560> claymores<00:05:56.070> are

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
to be using claymores claymores are

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.800 
to be using claymores claymores are
probably<00:05:56.610> your<00:05:56.760> best<00:05:56.910> friend<00:05:57.210> a<00:05:57.360> lot<00:05:57.570> of<00:05:57.720> these

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
probably your best friend a lot of these

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.020 
probably your best friend a lot of these
maps<00:05:58.080> and<00:05:58.440> you<00:05:59.340> know<00:05:59.460> you<00:05:59.520> always<00:05:59.730> want<00:05:59.970> to

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
maps and you know you always want to

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.440 
maps and you know you always want to
hold<00:06:00.180> control<00:06:00.600> that<00:06:00.840> and<00:06:01.170> uh<00:06:01.820> we<00:06:02.820> were<00:06:03.000> doing<00:06:03.360> a

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
hold control that and uh we were doing a

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.600 
hold control that and uh we were doing a
pretty<00:06:03.600> good<00:06:03.690> job<00:06:03.810> of<00:06:04.020> holding<00:06:04.380> them<00:06:04.710> against

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
pretty good job of holding them against

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.430 
pretty good job of holding them against
the<00:06:05.760> adult<00:06:06.240> cross<00:06:06.480> line<00:06:06.750> and<00:06:06.990> the<00:06:07.050> importance

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
the adult cross line and the importance

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.080 
the adult cross line and the importance
of<00:06:07.470> the<00:06:07.650> don't<00:06:07.890> cross<00:06:08.130> line<00:06:08.400> I<00:06:08.730> know<00:06:08.790> it<00:06:08.970> sounds

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
of the don't cross line I know it sounds

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.370 
of the don't cross line I know it sounds
really<00:06:09.330> stupid<00:06:09.600> but<00:06:09.810> that's<00:06:10.050> just<00:06:10.170> what<00:06:10.350> i

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
really stupid but that's just what i

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.790 
really stupid but that's just what i
call<00:06:10.620> it<00:06:10.800> the<00:06:10.950> importance<00:06:11.850> of<00:06:11.910> that<00:06:12.090> line<00:06:12.330> is<00:06:12.690> a

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
call it the importance of that line is a

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.590 
call it the importance of that line is a
front<00:06:13.800> switching<00:06:14.190> of<00:06:14.280> spawn<00:06:14.580> so<00:06:14.970> we<00:06:15.240> went<00:06:15.420> a

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
front switching of spawn so we went a

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.330 
front switching of spawn so we went a
little<00:06:15.780> too<00:06:15.870> far<00:06:16.200> into<00:06:16.470> their<00:06:16.650> spawn<00:06:16.920> and<00:06:17.250> it

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
little too far into their spawn and it

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.970 
little too far into their spawn and it
actually<00:06:17.550> end<00:06:17.880> up<00:06:17.970> switching<00:06:18.300> their<00:06:18.630> spawn

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:18.980 
actually end up switching their spawn

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.980 
actually end up switching their spawn
and<00:06:19.980> so<00:06:20.130> we<00:06:20.220> kind<00:06:20.400> of<00:06:20.460> paid<00:06:20.670> for<00:06:20.880> that<00:06:21.030> they

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
and so we kind of paid for that they

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.560 
and so we kind of paid for that they
kind<00:06:22.200> of<00:06:22.290> you<00:06:22.770> know<00:06:22.800> start<00:06:23.160> spawning

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
kind of you know start spawning

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.690 
kind of you know start spawning
sporadically<00:06:24.570> but<00:06:24.870> if<00:06:25.590> we<00:06:25.800> if<00:06:26.100> we<00:06:26.130> hold<00:06:26.490> them

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
sporadically but if we if we hold them

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.010 
sporadically but if we if we hold them
right<00:06:26.940> at<00:06:27.060> that<00:06:27.180> line<00:06:27.420> they<00:06:27.690> will<00:06:27.840> keep

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
right at that line they will keep

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.260 
right at that line they will keep
spawning<00:06:28.350> there<00:06:28.680> even<00:06:29.190> in<00:06:29.310> this<00:06:29.430> game<00:06:29.700> I<00:06:30.030> mean

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
spawning there even in this game I mean

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.730 
spawning there even in this game I mean
it's<00:06:30.480> hard<00:06:30.720> to<00:06:30.840> Swan<00:06:31.020> trap<00:06:31.260> in<00:06:31.380> this<00:06:31.470> game<00:06:31.620> but

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
it's hard to Swan trap in this game but

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.230 
it's hard to Swan trap in this game but
even<00:06:31.980> in<00:06:32.100> this<00:06:32.220> game<00:06:32.430> if<00:06:32.550> you<00:06:32.670> hold<00:06:32.880> that<00:06:32.970> line

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
even in this game if you hold that line

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.900 
even in this game if you hold that line
really<00:06:33.570> well<00:06:33.960> they<00:06:34.860> won't<00:06:34.980> be<00:06:35.190> able<00:06:35.310> to<00:06:35.520> spawn

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
really well they won't be able to spawn

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.030 
really well they won't be able to spawn
anywhere<00:06:36.240> else<00:06:36.390> and<00:06:36.630> so<00:06:37.320> I<00:06:37.350> think<00:06:37.530> it's

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
anywhere else and so I think it's

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.270 
anywhere else and so I think it's
wrapping<00:06:38.400> up<00:06:38.670> um<00:06:38.910> I'm<00:06:39.720> Nick<00:06:39.960> thanks<00:06:40.680> i<00:06:40.890> play
