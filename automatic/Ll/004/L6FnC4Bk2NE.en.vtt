00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
side deck that i am using in my nature

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.220 
side deck that i am using in my nature
is<00:00:10.889> but<00:00:11.639> due<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.480> fact<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.900> i<00:00:13.049> have

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
is but due to the fact that i have

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.550 
is but due to the fact that i have
changed<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.769> build<00:00:14.009> up<00:00:14.280> some<00:00:15.320> i'm<00:00:16.320> going<00:00:16.500> to

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
changed the build up some i'm going to

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.050 
changed the build up some i'm going to
be<00:00:16.619> switching<00:00:16.980> around<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.310> extra<00:00:17.730> or<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
be switching around the extra or the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.540 
be switching around the extra or the
side<00:00:18.300> deck<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> little<00:00:18.779> bit<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.470> i<00:00:19.710> wanted<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.430> go

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
side deck a little bit so i wanted to go

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.160 
side deck a little bit so i wanted to go
over<00:00:20.580> some<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> changes<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> deck

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
over some of the changes in the deck

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.019 
over some of the changes in the deck
with<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.410> guys<00:00:22.619> um<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:25.410> reason<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.039> on

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
with you guys um and the reason is on

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.179 
with you guys um and the reason is on
some<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.570> these<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.050> stick<00:00:28.289> has<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> hard<00:00:29.130> time

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
some of these of a stick has a hard time

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.999 
some of these of a stick has a hard time
getting<00:00:29.939> over<00:00:30.119> six<00:00:30.570> samurais<00:00:30.990> because<00:00:31.830> this

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
getting over six samurais because this

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.819 
getting over six samurais because this
is<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> slower<00:00:32.730> deck<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.360> six<00:00:33.870> samurais<00:00:34.380> can

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
is a slower deck and six samurais can

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.970 
is a slower deck and six samurais can
just<00:00:36.079> there's<00:00:37.079> too<00:00:37.140> many<00:00:37.380> things<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.860> they

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
just there's too many things that they

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.590 
just there's too many things that they
can<00:00:38.010> do<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.460> being<00:00:38.670> able<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.030> special<00:00:39.390> summon

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
can do with being able to special summon

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.869 
can do with being able to special summon
and<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:41.690> since<00:00:42.690> they<00:00:42.899> are<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.559> toughest<00:00:44.040> deck

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and so since they are the toughest deck

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.100 
and so since they are the toughest deck
in<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.480> meadow<00:00:45.750> right<00:00:45.989> now<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.809> think<00:00:48.840> this

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
in the meadow right now and I think this

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.959 
in the meadow right now and I think this
deck<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.590> compete<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.100> any<00:00:50.250> other<00:00:50.430> deck<00:00:50.730> and

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
deck can compete with any other deck and

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.090 
deck can compete with any other deck and
I<00:00:51.090> took<00:00:51.149> six<00:00:51.600> samurais<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.260> other<00:00:52.379> time<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
I took six samurais the other time the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.520 
I took six samurais the other time the
other<00:00:53.190> day<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:54.210> played<00:00:54.480> three<00:00:54.809> matches<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
other day we played three matches and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.770 
other day we played three matches and
each<00:00:55.710> time<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.010> took<00:00:56.160> them<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.520> Game<00:00:56.730> three<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.750> I

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
each time I took them to Game three so I

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.119 
each time I took them to Game three so I
did<00:00:58.170> pretty<00:00:58.379> well<00:00:58.500> um<00:00:59.600> but<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.320> deck<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
did pretty well um but so the deck and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.590 
did pretty well um but so the deck and
the<00:01:02.250> side<00:01:02.489> deck<00:01:02.730> are<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> little

the side deck are going to be a little

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.500 
the side deck are going to be a little
more<00:01:03.719> engineered<00:01:05.000> directly<00:01:06.000> towards<00:01:06.270> taking

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
more engineered directly towards taking

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.330 
more engineered directly towards taking
down<00:01:06.810> six<00:01:07.140> samurais<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:08.270> however<00:01:10.070> this<00:01:11.070> deck

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
down six samurais but however this deck

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.000 
down six samurais but however this deck
will<00:01:11.549> be<00:01:11.700> able<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.939> compete<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:12.560> glad<00:01:13.560> beasts

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
will be able to compete with glad beasts

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.160 
will be able to compete with glad beasts

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
pumpkins now I didn't really like doing

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.749 
pumpkins now I didn't really like doing
it<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.619> i'm<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.100> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.280> test<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
it but it's i'm just going to test and

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.770 
it but it's i'm just going to test and
see<00:01:47.790> what<00:01:47.970> happens<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:49.140> mantis<00:01:49.619> now<00:01:50.780> mantis

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
see what happens one mantis now mantis

see what happens one mantis now mantis
was<00:01:51.990> becoming<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.500> little<00:01:52.619> bit<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.040> problem

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
was becoming a little bit of a problem

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.190 
was becoming a little bit of a problem
because<00:01:53.610> six<00:01:54.000> samurais<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.750> special<00:01:55.170> summon

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
because six samurais can special summon

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.700 
because six samurais can special summon
so<00:01:55.649> much<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.189> he<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.240> gets<00:01:57.420> run<00:01:57.659> over<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:58.439> a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
so much and he just gets run over that a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.130 
so much and he just gets run over that a
normal<00:01:59.280> summon<00:01:59.850> wasn't<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.630> helping<00:02:00.840> that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
normal summon wasn't really helping that

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.600 
normal summon wasn't really helping that
much<00:02:01.350> because<00:02:01.590> they<00:02:01.950> may<00:02:02.100> have<00:02:02.219> already<00:02:02.369> had<00:02:02.579> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
much because they may have already had a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.709 
much because they may have already had a
monster<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.329> field<00:02:03.509> or<00:02:03.689> something

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
monster out on the field or something

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.100 
monster out on the field or something
and<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.649> he<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.130> wasn't<00:02:05.310> coming<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.869> handy<00:02:06.869> as

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
and so he just wasn't coming in handy as

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.529 
and so he just wasn't coming in handy as
much<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.500> he's<00:02:07.590> still<00:02:07.710> worth<00:02:07.920> running<00:02:08.160> one

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
much but he's still worth running one

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.990 
much but he's still worth running one
and<00:02:09.539> now<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.379> change<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.860> I'm<00:02:11.039> maining<00:02:11.640> to

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
and now the change is I'm maining to

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.430 
and now the change is I'm maining to
Thunder<00:02:12.420> kings

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
Thunder kings

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.140 
Thunder kings
I<00:02:13.470> think<00:02:13.710> it's<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.980> really<00:02:14.310> good<00:02:14.430> tech<00:02:14.850> for<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
I think it's a really good tech for the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.570 
I think it's a really good tech for the
deck<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:16.020> really<00:02:16.230> helps<00:02:16.650> stop<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:16.980> special

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
deck it really helps stop the special

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.790 
deck it really helps stop the special
summoning<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.330> searching<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.990> that's

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
summoning and the searching and that's

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.000 
summoning and the searching and that's
for<00:02:20.490> so<00:02:20.640> many<00:02:20.760> decks<00:02:21.060> for<00:02:21.360> X<00:02:21.870> Sabres<00:02:22.290> for<00:02:22.770> all

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
for so many decks for X Sabres for all

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.430 
for so many decks for X Sabres for all
kinds<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.370> things<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:24.110> really<00:02:25.110> like<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
kinds of things so I really like the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.070 
kinds of things so I really like the
tooth<00:02:25.620> under<00:02:25.800> kings<00:02:26.100> in<00:02:26.310> here<00:02:26.550> I've<00:02:26.790> also<00:02:27.540> made
