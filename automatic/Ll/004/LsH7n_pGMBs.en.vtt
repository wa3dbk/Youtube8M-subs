00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 click 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.740
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.719
 okay you want to 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.670
 cook your a bad guy today on 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.410
 will make chopsticks tradition so the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.509
 bread at home so do not panic 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.770
 it's very simple it's going to take us a 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.080
 hour and a half because we will use 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.270
 the technique of self lists autolysis 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.460
 what is the fact of not 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.950
 knead the dough and rely on the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.169
 natural strength of gluten contained in 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.220
 flour as well as yeast that 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.960
 should do his job 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.450
 enough to offer us a 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.640
 baguette of quality tradition at the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.100
 home made by you even I show you 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.630
 that right now it's gone then for 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.470
 to make our homemade chopsticks we go 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.080
 need 375 g flour t45 on 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.420
 will need 12 g of fresh yeast 8 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.970
 grams of salt as well as 300 milliliters 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.070
 of water then hold the first 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.990
 low operation will just consist of 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.990
 mix the salt with the flour 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:13.050
 I m such a measure in a glass I 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:22.490
 take a little warm water and we're going to 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:22.490
 dilute it will add to the flour 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.320
 that we will stir without too much kneading and then 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.040
 we will add the rest of the 300 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.040
 milliliters of water 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.240
 that we are going to get a pawning up and 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.369
 inform him whose paw will be at these 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.149
 flights but no concern is 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.149
 as well as it should be 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.170
 here we mixed the ingredients between 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.170
 them 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.560
 I'm just going to let the dough rest 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.730
 under an age in a corner of the kitchen 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.330
 during 1h30 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.430
 go hop so the dough has doubled that's 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.020
 nickel she went soft but that's 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.790
 normal since we did not work 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.200
 now because we're going to do this 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.090
 we are going to form and we will put it 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.710
 in baguette molds 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.840
 I already heat the oven to 240 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.700
 degrees I put in my full broiler pan 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.590
 of water so to a beautiful production of 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.090
 steam what will allow the pins 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:53.100
 to have a nice golden crust 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:55.110
 and then my faith or valves to cook there you 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.530
 see the ticket network 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.460
 develop so that's really nickel I 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.460
 will he cut in half 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.260
 we will lengthen a little 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:19.330
 as you want a flexible mold to 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.020
 baguette 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.020
 and then strips of paper on its 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.950
 seconds 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.910
 where is the claw is a little for him 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.210
 give the appearance a wand that in 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.210
 general 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.980
 and we are going to leave for all 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.900
 minutes as is 240 degrees with the 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.459
 lick full of water 30 minutes is 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.470
 left half an hour ago 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.269
 later our chopsticks are ready 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:14.040
 so you see they're cooked and 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:15.510
 it sounds hollow it means it's cooked 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.030
 inside I will leave them 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.310
 cool down and then bah we'll listen to him for 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.760
 see a little bit how it's going to 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.320
 interior 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.949
 here I cut a trench the 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:35.840
 cool down that's what it gives ni ken 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:35.840
 hill everything with great we will feast 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.250
 here I have done a little tour 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.660
 a little bit I wanted to actually include in 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.669
 in this little tutorial of the baguette 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.520
 express so this one ben you see I 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.740
 do with seeds we have 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.930
 so a little personal message for nico 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.470
 So here you broken you see in 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.360
 1h30 what you can get it should 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.270
 normally simplify life because 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.910
 it's a bread without kneading here 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.830
 good if not for me it's good there is 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.780
