starting to come on the top

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.820 
starting to come on the top
I<00:04:04.560> got<00:04:05.550> a<00:04:05.580> hide<00:04:05.820> beat<00:04:06.060> that<00:04:06.810> vaporizer<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.740> had

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
I got a hide beat that vaporizer you had

I got a hide beat that vaporizer you had
done<00:04:08.040> from<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.400> high<00:04:08.670> beetle<00:04:09.000> toward<00:04:09.240> the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390

let me put this to the back you get a

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.080 
let me put this to the back you get a
background<00:04:16.550> can<00:04:17.550> you<00:04:17.580> get<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:17.760> background

background can you get a background

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:26.750 
background can you get a background
better<00:04:18.360> that<00:04:18.510> way<00:04:18.660> this<00:04:18.750> way<00:04:24.950> okay<00:04:25.950> once<00:04:26.670> you

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
better that way this way okay once you

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.000 
better that way this way okay once you
start<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.150> see<00:04:27.360> it<00:04:27.450> you're<00:04:28.110> getting<00:04:28.380> good<00:04:28.590> good

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.440 
flow through there but I'll do is unhook
the<00:04:31.620> battery<00:04:31.770> yeah<00:04:32.430> just<00:04:32.640> let<00:04:32.730> it<00:04:32.850> cool<00:04:32.970> off<00:04:33.030> in

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
the battery yeah just let it cool off in

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.680 
the battery yeah just let it cool off in
there<00:04:34.160> it's<00:04:35.160> gonna<00:04:35.310> take<00:04:35.520> another<00:04:35.730> 30<00:04:36.270> seconds

vaporizer make sure you're getting a

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.740 
vaporizer make sure you're getting a
good<00:05:03.990> burn<00:05:04.430> all<00:05:05.430> right<00:05:05.670> see<00:05:05.910> that<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.270> got<00:05:06.480> no

no lock selleck acid left in there I got

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.330 
no lock selleck acid left in there I got
a<00:05:09.570> good<00:05:09.840> burn<00:05:10.140> there<00:05:10.740> should<00:05:10.950> be<00:05:11.040> very<00:05:11.250> little

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
a good burn there should be very little

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.130 
a good burn there should be very little
powder<00:05:11.790> at<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.060> bottom<00:05:12.390> and<00:05:12.600> when<00:05:12.990> you've<00:05:13.110> got

that you've got a good burn let it cool

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.360 
that you've got a good burn let it cool
down<00:05:15.690> completely<00:05:16.140> before<00:05:16.620> you<00:05:16.920> do<00:05:17.070> the<00:05:17.220> next

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
down completely before you do the next

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
versus their smoker the fogger is this

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.500 
versus their smoker the fogger is this
here<00:05:24.780> takes<00:05:25.050> about<00:05:25.260> a<00:05:25.380> minute<00:05:25.650> per<00:05:25.980> hive<00:05:26.610> the

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
here takes about a minute per hive the

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.920 
here takes about a minute per hive the
fogger

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930

as<00:05:28.710> fast<00:05:29.010> you<00:05:29.130> can<00:05:29.400> squirt<00:05:29.640> it<00:05:29.700> in<00:05:29.910> there<00:05:30.060> you

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
as fast you can squirt it in there you

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.940 
as fast you can squirt it in there you
go<00:05:30.270> walk<00:05:30.390> around<00:05:30.690> and<00:05:30.810> do<00:05:30.900> all<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.200> hives<00:05:31.410> it's

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
go walk around and do all the hives it's

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.280 
go walk around and do all the hives it's
a<00:05:32.070> lot<00:05:32.250> faster<00:05:32.520> but<00:05:33.300> this<00:05:33.450> is<00:05:33.600> more<00:05:33.750> effective

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
a lot faster but this is more effective

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.220 
a lot faster but this is more effective
this<00:05:35.040> is<00:05:35.190> my<00:05:35.340> preferred<00:05:35.760> method<00:05:35.790> and<00:05:36.540> I'll

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
this is my preferred method and I'll

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.560 
this is my preferred method and I'll
make<00:05:37.410> a<00:05:37.440> living<00:05:37.800> doing<00:05:37.950> this

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
make a living doing this

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.870 
make a living doing this
