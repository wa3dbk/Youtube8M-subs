here<00:00:34.800> they'll<00:00:35.399> use<00:00:35.579> its<00:00:35.790> mass<00:00:36.030> relay<00:00:36.540> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
here they'll use its mass relay to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.110 
here they'll use its mass relay to
travel<00:00:37.140> throughout<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.649> galaxy<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.790> call<00:00:39.000> it

travel throughout the galaxy we call it

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.110

the alpha relay from here the Reapers

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.470 
the alpha relay from here the Reapers
can<00:00:42.329> invade<00:00:42.719> anywhere<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> galaxy<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.450> you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
can invade anywhere in the galaxy so you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.979 
can invade anywhere in the galaxy so you
decided<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.110> destroy<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.910> exactly<00:00:47.910> doing<00:00:48.809> that

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
decided to destroy it exactly doing that

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.500 
decided to destroy it exactly doing that
would<00:00:49.230> stop<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> Reapers<00:00:50.070> invasion<00:00:50.579> even<00:00:51.420> at

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
would stop the Reapers invasion even at

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.779 
would stop the Reapers invasion even at
FTL<00:00:51.989> speeds<00:00:52.170> it'll<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.829> months<00:00:53.160> or<00:00:53.399> years

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
before they got to the next relay we

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.680 
before they got to the next relay we
came<00:00:56.309> up<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.180> called<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
came up with what we just called the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.560 
came up with what we just called the
project<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.680> plan<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.760> launch<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.239> nearby

project a plan to launch a nearby

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.319 
project a plan to launch a nearby
asteroid<00:01:01.230> into<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.680> relay<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.309> destroy<00:01:03.120> it

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
asteroid into the relay and destroy it

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.270 
asteroid into the relay and destroy it
before<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.140> Reapers<00:01:04.500> could<00:01:04.710> arrive<00:01:04.979> of

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
before the Reapers could arrive of

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.760 
before the Reapers could arrive of
course<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.240> resulting<00:01:06.720> explosion<00:01:07.049> would

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
course the resulting explosion would

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.410 
course the resulting explosion would
probably<00:01:08.340> wipe<00:01:08.610> out<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> system

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.700 

I've<00:01:13.420> always<00:01:13.630> heard<00:01:13.840> that<00:01:13.900> mass<00:01:14.200> relays<00:01:14.439> are

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
I've always heard that mass relays are

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.670 
I've always heard that mass relays are
indestructible<00:01:15.270> I've<00:01:16.270> heard<00:01:16.509> that<00:01:16.720> too<00:01:16.990> but<00:01:17.650> I

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
indestructible I've heard that too but I

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.350 
indestructible I've heard that too but I
think<00:01:17.950> it's<00:01:18.070> more<00:01:18.130> that<00:01:18.310> nobody's<00:01:18.939> willing<00:01:19.150> to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
think it's more that nobody's willing to

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.789 
think it's more that nobody's willing to
find<00:01:19.600> out<00:01:19.750> what<00:01:19.930> happens<00:01:20.320> when<00:01:20.500> one<00:01:20.680> is

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
find out what happens when one is

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.600 
find out what happens when one is
destroyed<00:01:21.220> and<00:01:22.200> well<00:01:23.200> we<00:01:23.860> plan<00:01:24.100> to<00:01:24.159> slam<00:01:24.580> a

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.520 
destroyed and well we plan to slam a
small<00:01:24.970> planet<00:01:25.299> into<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.720> thing<00:01:25.930> at<00:01:26.049> very<00:01:26.380> high

speed<00:01:27.009> by<00:01:27.790> our<00:01:27.940> calculations<00:01:28.090> that's<00:01:28.899> more

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
speed by our calculations that's more

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.310 
speed by our calculations that's more
than<00:01:29.350> enough<00:01:29.470> I<00:01:30.810> still<00:01:31.810> don't<00:01:31.840> see<00:01:32.049> how<00:01:32.259> you
