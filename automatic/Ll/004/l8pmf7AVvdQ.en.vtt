00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.799
 jeep lifts the veil on its declination 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.719
 srt of the great cherokee a car that 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.240
 was already very attractive and very 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.990
 succeeded but there under the hood the horses 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.730
 are dropped 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.589
 everything is done to make this model 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.589
 exclusive and admired by all 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.200
 we are warned about this model at high 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.940
 performance 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.920
 nothing is superfluous it is the 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.120
 jeep engineers who say it's 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.910
 elements are dedicated to performance 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.170
 with the air intakes and bedding and 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.910
 very frankly even from a point of view 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.210
 aesthetic it's really nice to 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.920
 the eye 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.809
 provided, of course, that you like them 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.330
 bodybuilder and silhouettes 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.250
 thematic 1 inches to the front admire 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.350
 the very aggressive shield that contains 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.350
 beautiful effect led lights 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.530
 it's almost paradoxical on board it's the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.030
 discretion that is required before 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.649
 it's kind of fun not to be 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.110
 in a vehicle totally dedicated to 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.450
 sport we still find inserts 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.939
 carbon aluminum is a superb driving 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.219
 to flat in short a cockpit really 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.219
 pretty class well finished and well worked 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.310
 under the hood we find a new 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.320
 block v8 6 2 4 2 4 168 horses for 624 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.420
 newtons-meters of numbers couple 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.410
 gigantic ones guarantee a lot of 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.630
 pleasure in driving 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.700
 only downside but size this engine is 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.860
 coupled to a 5-speed auto box 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.170
 it will be necessary to wait until next year for 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.270
 feel the box hui report and everything 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.010
 is thought for a sporting cause the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.320
 steering and braking are ultra 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.390
 accurate and suspensions are excellent 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.640
 and the great Cherokee swallows the 0 to 100 in 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.870
 almost five seconds with ease 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.690
 baffling 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.690
 this gear is simply 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.690
 exceptional 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.050
 only 30 copies of this great 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.380
 cherokee srt8 were allocated to the 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.420
 la France 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.490
 so it's almost impossible to 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.130
 to be able to afford it 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.980
 pay the sum of 78 1100 euros 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.900
 dear for a jeep probably but near 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.330
 50000 euros less than a porsche 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.950
 cayenne for example what a pity 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.690
 not be able to cross more often 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.690
 our exception on our roads
