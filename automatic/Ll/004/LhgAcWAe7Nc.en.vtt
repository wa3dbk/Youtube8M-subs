plastic jar for twist pop and inside you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.580 
plastic jar for twist pop and inside you
see<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> pomade<00:01:21.570> itself<00:01:21.930> which<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.259> remember

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
see the pomade itself which is remember

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.520 
see the pomade itself which is remember
that<00:01:22.770> clear<00:01:23.070> white<00:01:23.400> off-white<00:01:23.810> color<00:01:24.810> looks

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
that clear white off-white color looks

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.429 
that clear white off-white color looks
really<00:01:25.799> similar<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.159> black<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.580> white<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.439> so

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
really similar to black and white and so

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.450 
really similar to black and white and so
let's<00:01:28.979> go<00:01:29.100> ahead<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:29.400> started<00:01:29.520> now

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.660 

so<00:01:35.460> upon<00:01:36.210> opening<00:01:36.539> a<00:01:36.689> jar<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.490> get<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.640> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
so upon opening a jar you get like a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.080 
so upon opening a jar you get like a
very<00:01:38.969> light<00:01:39.500> lotion<00:01:40.500> eat<00:01:40.890> coconut<00:01:41.670> smell<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
very light lotion eat coconut smell to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.399 
very light lotion eat coconut smell to
the<00:01:42.450> palmate<00:01:42.810> itself<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:45.360> looks<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.929> then<00:01:46.170> it

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
the palmate itself it looks and then it

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.020 
the palmate itself it looks and then it
would<00:01:46.530> definitely<00:01:46.950> feel<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.759> black<00:01:47.969> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
would definitely feel like black and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.649 
would definitely feel like black and
white

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
white

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.859 
white
the<00:01:49.020> Tupac's<00:01:49.469> is<00:01:49.619> actually<00:01:49.860> really<00:01:50.009> similar

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
the Tupac's is actually really similar

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.609 
the Tupac's is actually really similar
but<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.229> would<00:01:52.890> say<00:01:53.810> that<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.929> Taylor<00:01:55.229> hair<00:01:55.380> wax

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
but I would say that the Taylor hair wax

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.499 
but I would say that the Taylor hair wax
is<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> little<00:01:56.219> more<00:01:56.399> refined<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.209> a<00:01:57.299> little

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
is a little more refined it's a little

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.539 
is a little more refined it's a little
cleaner

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
cleaner

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.469 
cleaner
especially<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.850> Sun<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.950> obviously<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.090> would

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
especially the Sun so obviously I would

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.479 
especially the Sun so obviously I would
describe<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.810> as<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.140> light<00:02:04.350> plum<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.739> it

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:05.489 
describe it as like a light plum a it

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:07.039 
describe it as like a light plum a it
comes<00:02:05.729> out<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> jar<00:02:06.239> really<00:02:06.450> easily

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
comes out of the jar really easily

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:15.440 
comes out of the jar really easily
it<00:02:07.649> applies<00:02:08.009> really<00:02:08.340> easily<00:02:08.759> as<00:02:08.940> well

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.510 

so<00:02:16.050> for<00:02:16.319> like<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.590> consistency<00:02:16.950> we're

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
so for like the consistency we're

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.270 
so for like the consistency we're
talking<00:02:18.000> something<00:02:18.569> around<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.280> night

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
talking something around the night

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.990 
talking something around the night
around<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.640> magnitude<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:22.580> royal<00:02:23.580> crown

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
around the magnitude of royal crown

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.900 
around the magnitude of royal crown
black<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.020> white<00:02:25.760> somewhere<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.849> that

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
black and white somewhere in that

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.470 
black and white somewhere in that
ballpark<00:02:28.130> like<00:02:29.130> performance<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.940> completely

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
ballpark like performance is completely

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.510 
ballpark like performance is completely
different<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:31.080> don't<00:02:31.830> get<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.190> confused

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
different like don't get that confused

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.850 
different like don't get that confused
but<00:02:32.880> just<00:02:33.569> talking<00:02:33.750> about<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.110> consistency

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
but just talking about the consistency

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.860 
but just talking about the consistency
in<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.010> application<00:02:35.040> right<00:02:35.700> now<00:02:35.760> it's<00:02:36.569> really

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
in the application right now it's really

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.020 
in the application right now it's really
similar<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.920> other<00:02:38.130> light<00:02:38.459> pomades<00:02:38.910> or

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
similar to like other light pomades or

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.839 
similar to like other light pomades or
hair<00:02:39.209> dressings

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.550

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
still are like moves really easily even

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.940 
still are like moves really easily even
once<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:49.780> pomade<00:02:50.079> has<00:02:50.260> been<00:02:50.439> applied<00:02:55.950> so

so as you guys can see my comb is moving

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.680 
so as you guys can see my comb is moving
through<00:03:44.040> very<00:03:44.250> smoothly<00:03:44.640> it's<00:03:45.180> like<00:03:45.330> really

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
through very smoothly it's like really

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.050 
through very smoothly it's like really
silky<00:03:46.320> smooth<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.830> this<00:03:47.280> way<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.460> expect<00:03:47.910> out

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
everything slicked back we'll go ahead

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:59.420 
everything slicked back we'll go ahead
side<00:03:52.230> forming<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.680> part<00:03:52.920> now<00:03:57.260> as<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.950> side<00:03:59.400> note
