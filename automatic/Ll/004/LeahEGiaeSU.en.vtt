00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.800
 slow 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.710
 only there is one moment when 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.280
 the theme is played the third time she play 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.280

 you are doing a slide with 3 frets 6 countries well 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.000
 Accordingly, with 5 ride on immediately 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.330

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.930
 watt 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.930
 year spirin and 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.879
 but throughout the entire song this 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.879
 is found in 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.370
 and note the opening reef 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.540
 again 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.250
 go further 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.140
 here the same fifths are played 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.140
 as in the beginning 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.260
 have on their duration varies 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.260
 respectively 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.490

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.470

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.950
 our. measure 8 watts at 5 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.950
 you get 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.660
 and also these songs have acoustic 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.660
 moment 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.990
 I like the same here as at the beginning 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:43.830
 but the only thing you do here is more 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:47.640
 bright accents but these notes 2 are not 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.640
 choose them muffled 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.340
 closer to the end there is in the song 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.340
 melodic bra 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.840

 the phrase 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.740
 and then it goes on identical 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:17.290

 authors tena got 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.530
 but 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.949
 further the phrase is repeated 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:19.050
 but now instead of 5 okay 2 string you 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:21.080
 pinch already 12 in the second side you 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.080
 it turns out 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.949
 together they sound like 

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:43.009
 Well, the chain is faster 

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:47.669
 but 

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.509

00:07:55.949 --> 00:08:01.770

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:03.419
