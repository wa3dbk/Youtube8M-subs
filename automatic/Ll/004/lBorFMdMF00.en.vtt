00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.110
 I see what it is with players like songs like this 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.209
 that's what I try 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.779
 because it's split enough, it's welcome right now 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.990
 count a new table on the side of the star 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.460
 but what we wanted you to go back to the road all started 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.800
 that is to say on the side called the left bank at the crossroads ferry and to see it 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.829
 so always it is with the rendezvous for this famous address 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.590
 out of the field of course is not there or so that from time to time a 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.570
 passionate 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.390
 they want around the world but he has always left behind 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.520
 sacred holding 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.470
 grain kientzheim 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.300
 the address is she remained he names in this data is adherent very decor 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.270
 dark with the tubs of the rolls were a little 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.540
 in europe place a little austere 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.920
 but to a man it works well 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.410
 always the same dynamic and the good roll looters and the servers are 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.120
 dressed in black as the rows the machined it is a little tolerance a 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.600
 is a little alcatraz rise as the other would say it's a little village of 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.690
 president encrypt what I mean 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.290
 Clement stop sneering like that just because believe me it 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.130
 brake system in serious this is the series 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.080
 when the players workshop a chance my scallops business with the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.850
 truffle 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.260
 so that's crazy that knows 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.790
 we have the exact answer to what is proposed on the map and even better 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.760
 it is probably not perfection but it is a work of 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.590
 gbagbo like that you do not play beef for 40 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.970
 and to a repurchase France says 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.390
 impeccable finally we can then give them decor and listen to 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.620
 serious of the address at least the company frankly sharp I 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.490
 rarely seen such consistency in quality the survival time is 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.910
 always there and that is what makes this opinion around the world succeed 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.590
 god supporters why because it is to unite the counter twoio there is a 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.460
 kind of 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.150
 biblical simplicity in the plate the products are excellent in fact 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.119
 that's how we make a restaurant without clement all it takes is a little bit of 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.520
 fervor from behind and we feel it in front of us because chefs cook 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.039
 almost in front of his dolphin in slight shift through debts 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.679
 the displays and shelves but we feel that there is a kind 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:15.639
 of fit between them the any application finds that a bit more the 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:19.369
 tension that in addition imitated plate that is almost delivered in its own juice 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:21.709
 dance economic activities 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.950
 everything was good even the desserts and are not too complicated we always 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.179
 a little presentation 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:30.619
 with his arabesques but he also worked class for example are 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:34.269
 real ice cream that is to say that are closed they have fresh my taste 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:39.010
 what to say that to say otherwise he has nothing to say I think it's part of 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:40.409
 very good addresses of paris 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.620
 it's not cheap you have to be careful but if you wish well between 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.870
 different proposals with the plates sincerely we keep a 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.250
 excellent memory
