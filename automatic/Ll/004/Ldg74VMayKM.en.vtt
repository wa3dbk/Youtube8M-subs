00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.370
Hey, Lisa.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.530
It's your big sister.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.220
Olivia and I were just
talking about all the stuff

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.053
your friends are going to say about
your period while we're at camp.

00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:10.840
So we just thought of an awesome new
game to play-- true, false, or dare?

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.870
We'll take turns.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.520
And if I get it wrong, I have
to do whatever she dares me to.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.420
And vice-versa.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.011
Yup.

00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:16.510
OK.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.490
I go first.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.650
True or false, using a tampon
makes you lose your virginity.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.350
I think true.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.850
Nope.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:22.750
False.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.292
Are you sure?

00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:24.499
Because I heard that if you--

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:25.450
I'm totally sure.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.934
A tampon has nothing to do with it.

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:29.350
You have to have actually have
sexual intercourse in order

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.550
to lose your virginity.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.750
So what do I have to do?

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.050
You have to tread water
and do the Macarena.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.150
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.950
OK, my turn.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.750
True of false, using a tampon hurts?

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.350
Easy.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.950
No way.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.600
That's false.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.350
I've been using tampons
for the past year.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.650
And even though it took a little bit
of practice, once I got used to it,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.850
I barely notice.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.150
The only time it felt uncomfortable
was if I didn't insert it all the way.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.250
In that case, I just try
again with a new tampon.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.750
That was a gimme.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.350
No, it wasn't.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.950
No, seriously.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.450
I obviously know it doesn't hurt.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.950
I just thought your
sister would like to know.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.700
I get another one.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.750
OK, fine.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.350
True or false, you have to take out
your tampon to go to the bathroom?

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.450
Well, you don't have to,
but it's easier, right?

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.350
No buts.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.150
I was definitely in
health class that day.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.450
Where you go to the bathroom
and where the tampon is inserted

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.950
are two totally different places.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.450
Well, I guess that's
good to know, right?

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.750
Yeah.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.625
It doesn't matter when
you go, or how you go.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:23.050
It doesn't affect your tampon.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.650
So now you have to do
the breakfast dishes.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.250
Missed a spot.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.950
What'd you eat?

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.750
I'm going to get you back for that.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.350
OK, true or false, a tampon can
get stuck or lost inside of you?

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.850
You mean if the string breaks?

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.450
Wrong already.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.150
The string is next to
impossible to break.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.717
I don't know how to do it, but
the string is super-strong.

00:01:42.717 --> 00:01:45.550
If it's hard to pull out, you just
have to relax because it probably

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.150
hasn't absorbed enough fluid yet.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.650
Right.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.233
That's why you should use the
lowest absorbency for your flow.

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:51.550
Does she know about the sizes?

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.250
Just like Always pads, Tampax tampons
come in different absorbencies

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.458
for your different flow days.

00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:57.550
You can tell by the colors.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.250
Lavender is light, yellow
is regular, green is super,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.750
and orange is super plus.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.750
And ultra is purple.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.250
Right.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.650
But you still got that one wrong, so
you have to do a cannonball back in.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.150
What?

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.400
I just changed out of my suit.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.950
Oh, well.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.283
I guess you have to change back.

00:02:10.283 --> 00:02:12.250
Or, do I?

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.050
[SCREAMING]

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.450
All right, you won that round.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.850
But I bet you can't race me to
the end of the pool and back.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:20.350
OK.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.950
So I have a race to win.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.450
So if you have anymore questions
about what's true or false,

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.450
you could always log

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.650
OK?

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.550
Ready?

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.350
1, 2, 3.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.550
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.850
I won.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.700
Oh, man.
