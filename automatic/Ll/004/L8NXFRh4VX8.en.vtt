in the description which was mainly done
for<00:01:39.090> before<00:01:39.540> Apple<00:01:39.750> offered<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.259> option<00:01:40.710> to

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
phone already which you'll have done and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.069 
phone already which you'll have done and
then<00:01:47.549> basically<00:01:47.909> what<00:01:48.090> you're<00:01:48.240> doing<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
very rudimentary crude copying data over

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.490 
very rudimentary crude copying data over
the<00:01:52.560> memory<00:01:52.740> blocks<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.579> iPhone<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
the memory blocks of the iPhone and

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.840 
the memory blocks of the iPhone and
you're<00:01:55.500> doing<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.890> by<00:01:56.130> including<00:01:56.490> more

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
you're doing that by including more

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.550

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
music and syncing that over and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.230 
music and syncing that over and
basically<00:01:59.490> what<00:01:59.670> you're<00:01:59.759> doing<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240

that<00:02:03.030> covers<00:02:03.329> your<00:02:03.509> whole<00:02:03.689> memory<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.140> do

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
that covers your whole memory you do

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.050 
that covers your whole memory you do
that<00:02:04.380> three<00:02:04.649> times<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.790> then<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.939> can

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
that three times and then you can

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.270 
that three times and then you can
restore<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.479> phone

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280
