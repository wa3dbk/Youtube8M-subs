00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.899 
and it keeps my temperature consistent
at<00:02:24.920> 200<00:02:25.459> degrees<00:02:27.189> so<00:02:28.189> then<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.430> don't<00:02:28.609> have<00:02:28.760> to

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
at 200 degrees so then I don't have to

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.910 
at 200 degrees so then I don't have to
use<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.269> on/off<00:02:29.719> switch<00:02:29.750> is<00:02:30.349> my<00:02:30.469> temperature

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
use the on/off switch is my temperature

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.110 
use the on/off switch is my temperature
control<00:02:31.489> I<00:02:31.519> could<00:02:31.730> have<00:02:31.969> in<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.239> last<00:02:32.389> month

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
control I could have in the last month

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.729 
control I could have in the last month
really<00:02:35.120> simple<00:02:35.659> to<00:02:35.750> hook<00:02:35.900> up<00:02:36.139> you<00:02:36.349> basically

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
really simple to hook up you basically

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.610 
really simple to hook up you basically
just<00:02:37.299> really<00:02:38.299> one<00:02:38.659> of<00:02:38.750> your<00:02:38.870> wires<00:02:39.109> underneath

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
just really one of your wires underneath

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.209 
just really one of your wires underneath
there<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:39.980> controls<00:02:40.579> the<00:02:40.760> power<00:02:42.129> to<00:02:43.129> the

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
there that controls the power to the

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.490 
there that controls the power to the
machine<00:02:43.659> you'll<00:02:44.659> find<00:02:44.930> one<00:02:45.139> of<00:02:45.169> the<00:02:45.290> wires

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
machine you'll find one of the wires

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.020 
machine you'll find one of the wires
under<00:02:45.919> there<00:02:46.129> to<00:02:46.310> relay<00:02:46.700> pretty

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
under there to relay pretty

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.069 
under there to relay pretty
straightforward<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.939> it<00:02:49.939> has<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.180> temperature

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
straightforward and it has a temperature

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.399 
straightforward and it has a temperature
sensor<00:02:51.590> which<00:02:51.769> you<00:02:52.069> would<00:02:52.220> run<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:53.169> the<00:02:54.169> same

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
sensor which you would run to the same

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.229 
sensor which you would run to the same
place<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.889> temperature<00:02:55.370> sensor<00:02:55.790> is<00:02:55.879> and<00:02:56.150> your

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
place the temperature sensor is and your

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.640 
place the temperature sensor is and your
drive<00:02:56.419> out<00:02:56.569> press<00:02:56.810> which<00:02:57.049> is<00:02:57.079> under<00:02:57.500> this

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
drive out press which is under this

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.459 
drive out press which is under this
plate<00:02:58.040> here<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.629> just<00:02:59.629> drilled<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.109> hole<00:03:00.290> and

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:00.469 
plate here I just drilled the hole and

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.530 
plate here I just drilled the hole and
put<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:00.650> little<00:03:00.769> rubber<00:03:01.459> grommet<00:03:02.060> there<00:03:02.239> so<00:03:02.480> it

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
put a little rubber grommet there so it

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.569 
put a little rubber grommet there so it
wouldn't<00:03:02.840> cut<00:03:03.409> the<00:03:03.560> wire<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:05.090> then<00:03:05.659> same<00:03:06.079> with

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
wouldn't cut the wire and then same with

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.099 
wouldn't cut the wire and then same with
this<00:03:07.579> piece<00:03:07.819> here<00:03:08.030> this<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.359> the<00:03:08.510> relay<00:03:08.870> wire

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
this piece here this is the relay wire

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.920 
this piece here this is the relay wire
here<00:03:09.469> this<00:03:09.709> goes<00:03:09.919> in<00:03:10.299> under<00:03:11.299> here<00:03:11.480> relays

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
here this goes in under here relays

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.159 
here this goes in under here relays
between<00:03:12.319> two<00:03:12.620> wires<00:03:13.359> that<00:03:14.359> turns<00:03:14.719> this<00:03:14.930> light

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:15.169 
between two wires that turns this light

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.629 
between two wires that turns this light
on<00:03:15.349> and<00:03:15.530> off<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:16.010> also<00:03:16.370> turns<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:17.419> heater

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
on and off and also turns the heater

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.969 
on and off and also turns the heater
wherever<00:03:19.639> it<00:03:19.819> is<00:03:19.940> on<00:03:20.329> and<00:03:20.629> off<00:03:20.750> which<00:03:21.560> controls

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:21.979 
wherever it is on and off which controls

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:25.539 
wherever it is on and off which controls
the<00:03:22.159> heat<00:03:23.590> so<00:03:24.590> if<00:03:24.769> you<00:03:24.919> want<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:25.129> look<00:03:25.310> at<00:03:25.459> this

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
the heat so if you want to look at this

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.229 
the heat so if you want to look at this
thing<00:03:25.790> it's<00:03:25.940> 94<00:03:26.599> I<00:03:26.870> have<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:27.859> set<00:03:28.099> to<00:03:28.129> come<00:03:29.060> back

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
thing it's 94 I have it set to come back

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.319 
thing it's 94 I have it set to come back
on<00:03:29.479> after<00:03:29.959> about<00:03:30.290> a<00:03:30.590> degree<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:31.400> believe<00:03:32.030> so<00:03:32.299> I

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
on after about a degree I believe so I

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.819 
on after about a degree I believe so I
think<00:03:32.449> it<00:03:32.629> drops<00:03:32.900> down<00:03:32.989> about<00:03:33.349> 3<00:03:33.709> degrees

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
think it drops down about 3 degrees

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.280 
think it drops down about 3 degrees
before<00:03:34.549> it<00:03:34.819> turns<00:03:35.030> back<00:03:35.299> on<00:03:35.510> so<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:35.930> gets<00:03:36.109> down

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
before it turns back on so it gets down

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:44.199 
before it turns back on so it gets down
to<00:03:36.319> about<00:03:38.260> 94<00:03:40.000> that<00:03:41.000> comes<00:03:41.269> back<00:03:41.449> on<00:03:41.720> so<00:03:42.019> I<00:03:43.209> can

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
to about 94 that comes back on so I can

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.770 
to about 94 that comes back on so I can
see<00:03:44.239> it<00:03:44.479> rising<00:03:44.720> back<00:03:45.019> up<00:03:45.079> there<00:03:46.780> works

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
see it rising back up there works

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.949 
see it rising back up there works
