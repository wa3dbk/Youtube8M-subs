my sleep so I ended up not using it all

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.709 
my sleep so I ended up not using it all
that<00:02:02.250> much<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.880> order<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.360> use<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.509> though

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.460 
I'm a huge fan of being able to look
over<00:02:42.640> my<00:02:42.940> wrist<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.390> immediately<00:02:43.900> see<00:02:44.319> my

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
over my wrist and immediately see my

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.690 
over my wrist and immediately see my
step<00:02:44.739> count<00:02:44.980> without<00:02:45.099> having<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.489> push<00:02:45.670> a

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
step count without having to push a

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.670 
step count without having to push a
button<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.180> have<00:02:46.329> something<00:02:46.540> light<00:02:46.840> up<00:02:47.019> I<00:02:47.290> can

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
button and have something light up I can

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.990 
button and have something light up I can
also<00:02:47.799> look<00:02:47.980> at<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.160> time<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.790> distance

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
also look at the time and the distance

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.759 
also look at the time and the distance
I've<00:02:49.269> traveled<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.720> steps<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.379> have<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.590> go<00:02:50.709> to

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
I've traveled the steps I have to go to

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.319 
I've traveled the steps I have to go to
my<00:02:50.920> goal<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.400> everything<00:02:51.579> like<00:02:51.790> that<00:02:51.849> without

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
my goal and everything like that without

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.270 
my goal and everything like that without
having<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.840> hit<00:02:52.900> any<00:02:53.140> buttons<00:02:53.500> unless<00:02:53.890> I<00:02:54.010> want

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
having to hit any buttons unless I want

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.770 
having to hit any buttons unless I want
to<00:02:54.400> go<00:02:54.910> between<00:02:55.090> them<00:02:55.450> of<00:02:55.569> course

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
to go between them of course

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.050 
to go between them of course
unfortunately<00:02:56.049> though<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.400> model<00:02:57.730> doesn't

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
unfortunately though this model doesn't

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.399 
unfortunately though this model doesn't
have<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.180> backlight<00:02:58.629> so<00:02:58.810> if<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.049> want<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.349> be

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
have a backlight so if you want to be

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:00.690 
have a backlight so if you want to be
able<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.650> see<00:02:59.769> your<00:02:59.890> step<00:03:00.159> count<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.609> you're

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
able to see your step count and you're

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.069 
able to see your step count and you're
in<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.849> dark<00:03:01.090> you're<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.540> bit<00:03:01.720> out<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:01.840> luck

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
in the dark you're a bit out of luck

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.569 
in the dark you're a bit out of luck
unless<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.470> got<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.620> flashlight<00:03:02.859> or<00:03:03.159> a<00:03:03.340> phone

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
unless you got a flashlight or a phone

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.610 
unless you got a flashlight or a phone
or<00:03:03.790> something<00:03:03.819> however<00:03:04.629> I'm<00:03:04.840> sure<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.470> not

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
or something however I'm sure that not

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.990 
or something however I'm sure that not
having<00:03:05.829> a<00:03:05.950> backlight<00:03:06.280> helps<00:03:06.609> the<00:03:06.730> battery

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
having a backlight helps the battery

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.789 
having a backlight helps the battery
life<00:03:07.180> out<00:03:07.359> so<00:03:07.720> that's<00:03:07.959> a<00:03:08.079> plus<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.590> like<00:03:08.680> I

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
life out so that's a plus and like I

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.259 
life out so that's a plus and like I
said<00:03:08.859> it's<00:03:09.129> supposed<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.549> be<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.790> year<00:03:09.909> of

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
said it's supposed to be a year of

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.910 
said it's supposed to be a year of
battery<00:03:10.510> life<00:03:10.690> I've<00:03:10.930> had<00:03:11.079> it<00:03:11.200> for<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.530> month<00:03:11.769> and

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
battery life I've had it for a month and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.440 
battery life I've had it for a month and
a<00:03:11.980> half<00:03:12.010> now<00:03:12.159> or<00:03:12.459> so<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:12.819> I<00:03:12.849> don't<00:03:13.060> really<00:03:13.209> know

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
a half now or so so I don't really know

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.180 
a half now or so so I don't really know
what<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.780> long<00:03:13.959> term<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.440> once<00:03:14.769> you<00:03:14.859> hit<00:03:15.010> that

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
what the long term and once you hit that

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.680 
what the long term and once you hit that
time<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.609> take<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.790> few<00:03:16.000> screws<00:03:16.269> off<00:03:16.510> the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
time you take a few screws off the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.449 
time you take a few screws off the
inside<00:03:16.989> of<00:03:17.139> the<00:03:17.200> device<00:03:17.319> and<00:03:17.769> you<00:03:17.980> can<00:03:18.160> replace

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
inside of the device and you can replace

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.580 
inside of the device and you can replace
those<00:03:18.730> with<00:03:18.790> other<00:03:19.180> batteries<00:03:19.750> not<00:03:20.290> really<00:03:20.560> a

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
those with other batteries not really a

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.960 
those with other batteries not really a
big<00:03:20.799> deal<00:03:20.829> from<00:03:21.220> what<00:03:21.340> I've<00:03:21.459> heard<00:03:21.489> and

the ones sort of annoying thing about

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.309 
the ones sort of annoying thing about
the<00:03:33.579> vivofit<00:03:33.940> in<00:03:34.299> my<00:03:34.480> opinion<00:03:34.870> is<00:03:35.019> that<00:03:35.079> it

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
the vivofit in my opinion is that it

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.069 
the vivofit in my opinion is that it
doesn't<00:03:35.560> automatically<00:03:36.370> sync<00:03:36.849> I'm<00:03:37.239> so<00:03:37.780> used

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
doesn't automatically sync I'm so used

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.659 
doesn't automatically sync I'm so used
