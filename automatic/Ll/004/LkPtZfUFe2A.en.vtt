00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
straight to it so your your server

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.460 
straight to it so your your server

full the sea strike and go to maps and

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.970 
full the sea strike and go to maps and
it's<00:05:39.450> going<00:05:39.630> to<00:05:39.690> start<00:05:40.080> out<00:05:40.290> with<00:05:40.320> only<00:05:40.740> as<00:05:40.950> the

maps that gives you in the beginning

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.910 
maps that gives you in the beginning
again<00:05:42.690> when<00:05:43.080> you<00:05:43.170> first<00:05:43.440> install<00:05:43.560> a
