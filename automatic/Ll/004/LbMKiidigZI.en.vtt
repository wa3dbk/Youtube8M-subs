 if you join all the compact 10-inch 12 batches 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.380
 About 13 thousand 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.250
 how do you start to gather this all started to buy disk in three 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.870
 years of age but this is similar to 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.180
 You're only six years old. 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.079

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.520
 the lps kama sutra cheap from brazil 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.750
 and the foreigners they realized that and that they came here 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.690
 Brazil in Maputo 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.990
 he lived they lived with Alex had in hand and she came up similar 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.340
 or foreigner can access the lines of japan and in england of france in this 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.510
 the same year 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.670
 they were things I barely know 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.590
 and I was so think of a time when he was taking everything away 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.780
 There the plug fell - I do not want any more income and ipi 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.260
 my first contact with the selection of Brazilian music 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.189
 from the beginning of history until today to the present day ansa 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.979
 who access the site and buying things that I do not give them new 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.940
 for me the goal 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.080
 op 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.710
 he tells the story 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.960
 by the little he personally by the music understood 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.960
 I'm far behind 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.380
 I love the 10 2 inches with the first few weeks of March a very 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.410
 hard to find 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.690
 bossa nova disc so it is not even said that it has in here but at least 400 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.039
 since bossa nova 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:17.779
 until I can join all of bossa nova are examples pointed out in the zone 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.839
 east site has already raised 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.839
 then this is the patient disdained proposes 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.499
 in a capital letter Brazil had 27 people with the same proposal as me 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:29.379
 also 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.359
 we were going to go wrong 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.349
 the exit of pc brazil 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.849
 and the repeated ones we were going to be exchanging among ourselves 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.079
 I remember I was a shopkeeper. 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.509
 I had the courage to open the first store 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.519
 the two particulars 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.949
 But every time they sell it for years, they say they suffer it. 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.939
 and musically 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:53.219
 by the concept of recovering to this day how you can forget yourself 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:57.060
 with the fans it seems to us slowly a donation from here an exchange of line one 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:00.079
 Little here and there is a puzzle 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.319
 that I see another store for five years says he always have ideas take place 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.309
 their 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.480
 this idea is that it is who owns it 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.370
 I want him 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.319
 Anything that would be in Brazil spoke graphically 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.059
 51 score 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:18.959
 colleague ticket since 2007 we are with the pair if I want to reach up to 40 thousand says 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.729
 cataloged my story is to create a living museum without which people can come 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.689
 here and get the disc in hand 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.149
 type the risk 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:31.139
 son of recordings 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.319
 music nelito 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.100
 data sheet said 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.100
 even with all the information 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.289
 to try to complete five years the patents of these five years will do 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:52.519
 five on the 8th of 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.519
 now you have been discarded you have here 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.489
 he considered one of the most expensive records I have here 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:01.749
 a synthesis disk 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:03.579
 what is it 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.579
 the precursor of brazilian disc aggravate taxes 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.579
 already the index of 10 inches led 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.969
 is a collection with the field command for the ceasas a collection with 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:15.769
 O 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.969
 the use and singers dance artists 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:20.269
 the record company 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.269
 August 30 said the mayor 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:28.279
 In Canada, it's Miguel 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.409
 I have is that the index is also one time 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:40.659
 Super Face is the first 12 inch disc being Brazil celebrating the 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.039
 fifth anniversary of the synthesis 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.039
 so the collection only with songs of carnival 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:51.889
 p delay says that talking is an interesting thing that was Brazil was the 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.309
 first country or country of 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:56.180
 the mercosul factory 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.990
 and the 4th in the world fifteen years 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.879
 and with sugar or wine 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.809
 the whalers 

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:05.809
 not yet 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.330
 3 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.219
 there 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.279
 the two victims 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:15.580
 Sorry 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.979
 instrumental' 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.180
 the ju the names of the artists I do not know I already looked for in the region and 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.689
 please do not find 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.599
 only the first disk 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.740
 I hope they were arrested in Brazil and it was done it was searched 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.839
 to be done these however remains so close to a search 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:36.720
 on 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.470
 of songs and 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.770
 the percussion of the instruments at 0 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.539
 monitoring 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.539
 and he also has the first recording of No Longer 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.310
 this afternoon 58 the first time that happens in Brazil 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.270
 I think they are in dispute 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.150
 rare because it went wrong 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.330
 first time purchase 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.490
 from the globe network 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.779
 the locals 69 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:09.079
 and those 19 brings me many memories of that mining team that did not lose there 

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:12.079
 nine years 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:24.749
 I'm going there 

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:29.549
 a nice thing that I learned after a long time that I'm here to 

00:06:29.549 --> 00:06:32.909
 people had in addition to jane kirby in the limited recordings 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.490
 these are the first discs 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.039
 of a mining company that they are the most beautiful thing in the world 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.830
 here's the tudors 63 4 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.689
 this disk here is a square disk 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:51.999
 of the concrete band a band that d 

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:53.939
 from belo horizonte 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:59.300
 recorded in 1980 I found it very funny because it looks pictures 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.800
 but at the same time they have a sticker on the front 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.240
 and it only plays on one side 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.979
 and here we have 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:09.979
 two tracks on one side of this 

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:13.199
 Maria to Wednesday 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:16.199
 do not know 

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:27.069
 if the fair is also the score if I also nÃ© since it does not come trying 

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:31.059
 have to create the wrong move one arrives at the conclusion that beautiful horizon and 

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:33.509
 I did not have any fair 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:35.619
 in this sector 

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:38.059
 and the game fair to do 

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:41.309
 three years happens every two months 

00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:44.709
 I'm already going to the 18th edition now on November 6th. 

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:49.619
 points and continues to rise
