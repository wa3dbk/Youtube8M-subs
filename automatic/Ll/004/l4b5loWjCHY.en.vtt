00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 do not 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:10.760
 what has been that gp the weather very 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.480
 peculiar do not believe 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.930
 it seems that the charged winds will change 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.660
 well yes but not easy to know what 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.700
 I have to do but if I return I will have 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.039
 to face the past 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.039
 and I've been hearing him for so long 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.909
 why have you done that it does not matter to be 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.479
 in the past 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:39.369
 yes but it still hurts if the past I can see 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:44.289
 but as I see it you can hear and 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:48.819
 learn you see what you're going to do 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.819
 first I will take away your cane 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.880
 come on 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.880
 hears 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.789
 to find it you must look beyond 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.220
 and what the hell means that means 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:11.210
 look beyond what they see 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.880
 of what he hears with his roll 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.290
 existence of guilt 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.290
 beyond what I see 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.350
 beyond what you see 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.150
 beyond what I see 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.280
 when there is someone who concentrates with so much 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.280
 music 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.010
 of what I say 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.890
 listening 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.810
 I'm caught 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.040
 that's why that worm that I came arrived 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.040
 I feel a relationship
