00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
I really really miss already the kind of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.270 
I really really miss already the kind of
whack-whack<00:01:38.780> response<00:01:39.530> that<00:01:39.800> he<00:01:39.890> used<00:01:40.040> to<00:01:40.100> get

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
whack-whack response that he used to get

do a lap but I'm just I'm wanting more
from<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.590> throttle<00:01:54.770> response<00:01:54.979> I<00:01:55.400> really<00:01:55.760> am

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
from the throttle response I really am

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.040 
from the throttle response I really am
having<00:01:56.540> said<00:01:56.900> that<00:01:56.930> it<00:01:57.710> does<00:01:58.010> go<00:01:58.310> like<00:01:59.050> stink

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
having said that it does go like stink

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.630 
having said that it does go like stink
in<00:02:00.410> Australia<00:02:00.860> like<00:02:00.950> when<00:02:01.160> you<00:02:01.220> put<00:02:01.370> your<00:02:01.490> foot

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
in Australia like when you put your foot

in Australia like when you put your foot
down<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:01.970> it<00:02:02.450> has<00:02:02.630> got<00:02:03.400> masses<00:02:04.400> of<00:02:04.640> torque

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
feet more torque than the old v8 m3 but

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.300 
feet more torque than the old v8 m3 but
that<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.150> not<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.570> be<00:02:14.690> sniffed<00:02:14.900> at<00:02:15.140> okay<00:02:16.070> you

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
that is not to be sniffed at okay you

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.530 
that is not to be sniffed at okay you
lose<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.580> throttle<00:02:16.880> response<00:02:16.940> but<00:02:17.390> that's

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
lose the throttle response but that's

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.080 
lose the throttle response but that's
what<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.750> get<00:02:17.870> in<00:02:18.020> return

what's it like compared with the c63

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.510 
what's it like compared with the c63
well<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:24.650> actually<00:02:24.950> feels<00:02:25.130> quite<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.370> bit

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
well it actually feels quite a bit

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.150 
well it actually feels quite a bit
lighter<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:26.120> its<00:02:26.330> feet<00:02:26.690> than<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.140> c63<00:02:27.709> which

towards emissions etc but but not really

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.170 
towards emissions etc but but not really
it's<00:04:30.650> it's<00:04:30.920> an<00:04:31.070> out-of-date<00:04:31.430> engine<00:04:31.940> but<00:04:32.090> it

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
it's it's an out-of-date engine but it

it's it's an out-of-date engine but it
is<00:04:32.300> an<00:04:32.710> absolutely<00:04:33.710> lovely<00:04:34.370> engine<00:04:34.970> in<00:04:35.120> this

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
is an absolutely lovely engine in this

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.780 
is an absolutely lovely engine in this
car<00:04:35.920> and<00:04:36.920> it<00:04:37.700> really<00:04:37.910> does<00:04:38.150> make<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.630> M<00:04:38.720> Falls

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.160 
honest is that being fair well I think
it<00:04:46.580> is<00:04:46.730> because<00:04:47.120> you<00:04:47.270> just<00:04:47.450> just<00:04:47.780> paid<00:04:47.990> for

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.160 
the AMG s the BMW also rides a fair bit
more<00:06:58.370> smoothly<00:06:58.760> on<00:06:59.120> rough<00:06:59.450> roads<00:06:59.480> and

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.170 
more smoothly on rough roads and

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.130 
more smoothly on rough roads and
generates<00:07:00.920> a<00:07:01.070> touch<00:07:01.310> less<00:07:01.550> tire<00:07:01.910> noise<00:07:02.150> but

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:03.140 
generates a touch less tire noise but

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.320 
generates a touch less tire noise but
what<00:07:03.260> it<00:07:03.380> doesn't<00:07:03.650> do<00:07:03.980> is<00:07:04.220> steer<00:07:04.880> as<00:07:05.060> sweetly

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
what it doesn't do is steer as sweetly

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.490 
what it doesn't do is steer as sweetly
as<00:07:05.480> the<00:07:05.660> Mercedes<00:07:06.140> and<00:07:06.530> again<00:07:07.220> it's<00:07:07.580> the<00:07:07.760> AMG's

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
as the Mercedes and again it's the AMG's

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.620 
as the Mercedes and again it's the AMG's
extra<00:07:09.500> bit<00:07:09.650> of<00:07:09.680> touchy-feely<00:07:10.460> appeal<00:07:10.940> that

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
extra bit of touchy-feely appeal that

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.400 
extra bit of touchy-feely appeal that
keeps<00:07:11.870> it<00:07:12.080> just<00:07:12.500> out<00:07:12.740> of<00:07:12.770> reach<00:07:13.130> for<00:07:14.260> it's<00:07:15.260> not

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.410 
keeps it just out of reach for it's not

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.270 
keeps it just out of reach for it's not
as<00:07:15.530> talked<00:07:15.770> is<00:07:15.980> the<00:07:16.130> m4<00:07:16.490> definitely<00:07:17.090> not

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:23.850 
but it is every bit as well as well
