00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:02.400
 Hi everyone 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.800
 this is a very simple one in the art that I wanted to show you the first one 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.000
 caste males are simple hearts on the ring finger 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:15.489
 there are some 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:18.609
 dots that they do 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.489
 an effect 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.859
 map booom 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.859
 however liz macity of itachi 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.630
 all in a hurry 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.850
 inna the number grows even if I in the ghetto kronos is that this 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.660
 and it's a rose 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.650
 with a bit of god he loves 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.060
 these glazes are I must say good in flash that anyway consistency 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.080
 in what sense it has the same only a pass with this brush that is 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.130
 particularly large so 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.130
 it is very easy to pass over the entire nail 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.740
 loco says 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.249
 from the mixture of two other enamels, always those who make it 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.249
 the plan with ferrari la spezia 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.850
 this jump of the line causes the number 296 duck samp 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.770
 which has a bright fuchsia 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.649
 light yagami shell arts 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.800
 and it has also come out 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.800
 brosa baby very star one 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.530
 with whom I did. the little hearts 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.550
 very harley shipment designs used this dr r amp this 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.300
 lets torterra 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.240
 5 so there are 10 tips 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.050
 because I refer back to England I bought on the store day at the very 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.620
 modest sum of 6 hours 50 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.909
 including 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.509
 shipping costs therefore not as much as you see 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.850
 you could do 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.290
 let's say bigger or smaller dowry 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.500
 and it is very useful to everyone to use especially those. finer 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.100
 in short, to use to design what you want for which 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.359
 maybe instead of the toothpick e 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.239
 these fonts 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.419
 two-seater and the incas 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.759
 allinfo box 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.439
 ignored now is let see how 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.199
 some simple sum 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.229
 to do 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:30.979
 it turns out that a nice assumption I have something not particularly long for which 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:32.979
 all Marianaza 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.979
 ok ciauz 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.369
 first of all apply but as usual 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.920
 news 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.409
 let's move 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:47.779
 to the drafting 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:50.969
 and the enamel as you see this tell me 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:55.509
 precisely the very large brush for which 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.909
 remains very simple to 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.529
 to spend 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.689
 indeed 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.759
 just one pass 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:08.499
 ok at this point 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.079
 let's move on to our own design 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.329
 using and pink 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.379
 I'll show you 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.379
 let's do two simple 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.339
 Alini 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:28.339
 this world 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:35.269
 then with the doctor or with a toothpick 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.269
 let's go to his heart's retina 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.939
 as if dragging it maximum 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:48.509
 in this world 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.509
 ok this. let's put some 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.469
 rose 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:56.469
 I'm a paper girl 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.239
 this world 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.949
 let's turn off the land. a little bigger this is 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.939
 Syria. bigger 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.479
 in the middle of the world the enamel and let's go for it 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.129
 2 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.090
 then 3 albinos 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.559
 after that 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:31.149
 we use the smallest tip in the same doc 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
 in my world apply other children 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:42.580
 obviously every pass for every step oman you have to wait for that 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.689
 anyway 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.689
 the enamel dries 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.309
 then take the polish with which you did the job 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:55.559
 the same the application that there are 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:57.930
 on a sheet of paper 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.360
 and using 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.430
 mah. 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.120
 meridol terre 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.279
 sent 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:09.550
 to admit 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.550
 another dot inside 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.400
 of each one of the pink ones 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.400
 in this world 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.169
 do not sleep 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.169
 I do like burzio effect 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.479
 fly as much as you can 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:41.800
 ok 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.509
 I take some pictures because inca colors but they never come out well 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:48.779
 and I greet you
