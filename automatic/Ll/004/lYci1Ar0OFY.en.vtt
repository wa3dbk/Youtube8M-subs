00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.369
 On September 23, 2013 two of my 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.710
 comrades and I left anna ohio 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.740
 rumbas in a funk facilities 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.330
 try is in rochester hills michigan al 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.330
 get to the place we wait for you in the 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.040
 hotel crown plaza we have a place to 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.130
 rest and enjoy a week of 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.200
 many final emotions try ex account 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.559
 with an extensive list of thefts of everything 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.809
 type and for all applications I 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.510
 impressed the new robot that I call 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.929
 spider by its three main axes that 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.030
 look like the legs of a spider this type 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.879
 of robot I saw it for the first time in a 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.469
 movie titled anime tricks but 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.460
 now it is a reality in many 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.460
 industries in the world 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.630
 in this application that you see here 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.510
 the base robot to the pills and then 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.130
 according to the selected color and 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.020
 Determine your position for later 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.869
 accommodate them in their respective 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.030
 containers the pills are left in 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.640
 disorderly shape in the base and the robot 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.550
 use a video system to identify 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.520
 the color and position of the pads 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.659
 to be able to decide which pill to take since 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.659
 the container belongs 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.190
 There are many sizes of robots 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.100
 according to the applications that are 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.170
 assign those from small to very 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.180
 big enough to hold a car in 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.280
 the warner air 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.350
 Bryant and I had a great time 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.350
 programming these incredible machines 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.349
 in this application the robot accommodates the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.869
 batteries from one container to another 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.750
 changing the terminal's address 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.060
 positive battery 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.400
 it's an incredible speed I do not think that 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.230
 there is a human being capable of doing this 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.230
 operation so fast and without errors 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.290
 this is a simulation of a line of 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.019
 bottles where the product of 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.450
 one band to another the idea is to keep the 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.030
 flow and not stop the bands is 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.709
 impressive the accuracy and speed with 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.629
 the one that robots can do those 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.629
 maneuvers in fraction of seconds 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.040
 here it shows how the robot simulates 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.920
 take cookies from a band in 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.980
 move and arrange them in your package 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.050
 without the band stop this is possible 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.390
 with the robot integrated vision system 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.150
 that can see the exact position of each 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.430
 cookie and quickly determine your 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.650
 speed and be able to transfer the of the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.100
 band to its respective place in the 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.100
 package 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.670
 the classes we took were for 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.640
 understand the programming of robots 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.760
 of an intense week of much 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.950
 information but at the same time fun the 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.470
 classes were divided between theory and 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.560
 practice the first day was much more 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.870
 theory and at the end of the week many 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.180
 laboratories with a lot of opportunity to 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.460
 create interesting programs that simulate 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.180
 some applications that we see every day 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.180
 in our work 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.959
 here I am developing a practice in 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.300
 where you ask to make a picture a 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.950
 triangle and a circle and with this 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.620
 apply the basic commands of 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.020
 programming is exciting to play with a 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.419
 toy as big and as expensive as this 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.010
 robot throughout my career I have 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.220
 come to the conclusion that my 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.530
 work is to play with toys and apart 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.060
 they pay me to do it for which I 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.060
 I feel so lucky 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.860
 in some places they say that the 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.170
 difference between the child and the adult is 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.010
 the price of the toy and I'm 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.010
 totally agree 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.710
 ah 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.170
 i 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.450
 finally I can say that I am very 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.180
 happy to be learning and 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.280
 developing the machines of the future and 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.980
 also thank my parents my wife 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.530
 to my brothers and my friends for giving me the 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.690
 support to keep going gives me 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.180
 nostalgia remember that five years ago 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.910
 I was in jacona michoacÃ¡n in mexico without 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.490
 I work without money after I have 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.130
 lost everything but gave me a second 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.290
 opportunity and here I am 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:49.270
 smiling at life because when one 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.270
 want if you can
