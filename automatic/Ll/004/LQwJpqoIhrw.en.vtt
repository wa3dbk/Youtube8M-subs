00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
for Brandon and me I both of us we

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.999 
for Brandon and me I both of us we
didn't<00:01:11.660> have<00:01:11.930> any<00:01:12.080> anticipation<00:01:12.740> of<00:01:12.950> seeing

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
second one the third one was what really

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.179 
second one the third one was what really
killed<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.850> series<00:02:05.210> for<00:02:05.479> me<00:02:05.630> because<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:06.890> was

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
killed the series for me because it was

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.900 
killed the series for me because it was
just<00:02:07.390> blatant<00:02:08.390> dumb<00:02:09.049> I<00:02:09.560> mean<00:02:10.040> it<00:02:10.190> was<00:02:10.280> obvious

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
just blatant dumb I mean it was obvious

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.539 
just blatant dumb I mean it was obvious
that<00:02:10.940> they<00:02:11.329> did<00:02:11.570> just<00:02:11.989> for<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.350> money<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:13.340> it

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
that they did just for the money and it

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.270 
that they did just for the money and it
was<00:02:13.640> so<00:02:13.880> generic<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:15.049> call<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.769> actually

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
was so generic and I call it actually

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.990 
was so generic and I call it actually
the<00:02:16.459> shrek<00:02:17.360> sitcom<00:02:18.230> of<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:19.280> series<00:02:19.640> because

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
the shrek sitcom of the series because

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.970 
the shrek sitcom of the series because
that's<00:02:20.720> what<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:21.019> ended<00:02:21.260> up<00:02:21.350> being<00:02:21.590> there's<00:02:21.920> a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
that's what it ended up being there's a

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.890 
that's what it ended up being there's a
big<00:02:22.190> message<00:02:22.549> at<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.060> end<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.810> was

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.710 
wasn't enthused about seeing shrek ever
again<00:02:30.170> like<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.739> thought<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.579> story<00:02:31.880> was<00:02:32.120> okay

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
again like I thought the story was okay

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.530 
again like I thought the story was okay
it's<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.560> felt<00:02:33.890> like<00:02:34.100> it<00:02:34.400> wasn't<00:02:34.730> necessary

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
it's it felt like it wasn't necessary

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.350 
it's it felt like it wasn't necessary
like<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:35.900> movie<00:02:36.260> was<00:02:36.980> not<00:02:37.340> even<00:02:37.670> necessary

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
like this movie was not even necessary

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.660 
like this movie was not even necessary
actually<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.230> liked<00:02:39.739> it<00:02:39.920> better<00:02:39.950> than<00:02:40.610> the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
actually I liked it better than the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.330 
actually I liked it better than the
third<00:02:40.970> one<00:02:41.209> I<00:02:41.420> really<00:02:41.930> actually<00:02:42.470> enjoyed<00:02:43.130> this

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
third one I really actually enjoyed this

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.370 
third one I really actually enjoyed this
one<00:02:43.549> they<00:02:43.970> could<00:02:44.120> have<00:02:44.209> not<00:02:44.420> made<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:45.110> it

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
one they could have not made it and it

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.740 
one they could have not made it and it
would<00:02:45.530> not<00:02:45.560> made<00:02:45.890> any<00:02:46.100> difference<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.910> can't

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750

the<00:02:49.790> best<00:02:49.940> trick<00:02:50.299> ever<00:02:50.329> no<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.739> wasn't<00:02:51.799> it<00:02:52.340> was

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
the best trick ever no it wasn't it was

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.460 
the best trick ever no it wasn't it was
plain<00:02:52.820> it<00:02:53.720> was<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.680> was<00:02:54.920> but<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.930> story<00:02:57.260> of

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
this one was much better than or

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.590 
this one was much better than or
one<00:02:59.470> story<00:03:00.100> was<00:03:00.490> all<00:03:00.790> right<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.540> thought<00:03:02.110> was
