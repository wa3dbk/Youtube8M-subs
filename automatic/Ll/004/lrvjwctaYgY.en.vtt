00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hi, I wanted to take this little one 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.319
 space to tell you a new project 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.200
 which we are undertaking is not a 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.030
 project any because it 's love and 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.700
 the service what motivates us 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.400
 realize above all 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.340
 second interest I think we 're in a 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.949
 epoch of changes where technology and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.519
 the capacity of man is reaching 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.960
 its limits and I wonder where is the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.369
 evolution of the essence if one observes 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.809
 globally it would seem that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.430
 stagnant but if we start 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.890
 individually to improve and in our 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.340
 process of evolution go helping 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.860
 our neighbor family friend and they 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.280
 so on to others could 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.949
 function 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.100
 I do not know if you think about the meeting 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:57.309
 with the creative father I do and I think 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.989
 the titles that I am going to present and I know 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.780
 that will not be the cartons that are 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.450
 hung in my room or the titles that 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.540
 they are in the bank 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.600
 everyone knows what kind of titles 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.970
 the father rewards for it we have created 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.220
 a foundation to help others 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.360
 people and other foundations that 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.540
 they need that support so much material 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.510
 personal and spiritual I invite you to see 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.500
 these images for next 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.500
 make another invitation 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.780
 to 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.330
 by reviewing the history of mankind 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.729
 you can not be oblivious to the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.390
 events that among men 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.500
 have generated by establishing supremacy 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:56.229
 conquest of water lands empires 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.030
 religious conflicts governability in 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.030
 end the search for power 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.490
 for no one these are unknown 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.250
 circumstances or difficult times 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.830
 we go through but also not unknown 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.250
 that we possess the strength and tenacity 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.920
 to overcome all these barriers and we are 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.450
 aware that values ​​are the 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.690
 forces that drive humans 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.690
 to evolve and be better every day 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.750
 that is why the living water foundation 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.780
 believes that it is possible to recover the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.840
 lost balance and proposes for it 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.900
 work in conjunction with organizations 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.540
 public and private to preserve 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.180
 the natural wealth of the planet and 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.980
 contribute to the welfare of those who 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.980
 they need our support 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.970
 we are a group of conscious people 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.820
 that not everything should be done by those 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.620
 who have power or money or the 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.990
 politicians nor the religious 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.410
 we want to be reborn the values ​​in 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:44.370
 people indistinctly of their creed 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:48.330
 its norms its customs its condition 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.610
 social policy and economic consider 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.910
 that if man rescues the true 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.670
 meaning and meaning of life 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.680
 understands and applies the values 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.680
 we will achieve that humanity will 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.010
 compromise with your dreams and make them 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.010
 reality 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.160
 the work of being well depends 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.890
 only from each one if all 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.980
 we work for our well-being and that of 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.739
 our families understanding 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.740
 family the population or people who 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.190
 they are close to us we will find 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.810

 Angel 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:05:02.119
