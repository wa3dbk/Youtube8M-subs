00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
really boosting up the intensity and

stick in Lightroom and you know do the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.910 
stick in Lightroom and you know do the
basic<00:00:51.840> stuff<00:00:51.989> I'm<00:00:52.110> doing<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.410> really<00:00:52.649> rough

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
basic stuff I'm doing this really rough

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.389 
basic stuff I'm doing this really rough
and<00:00:53.100> ready<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.520> let's<00:00:53.760> say<00:00:53.969> drop<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.899> blacks

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
and ready but let's say drop the blacks

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.420 
and ready but let's say drop the blacks
pop<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.670> lights<00:00:57.590> really<00:00:58.590> boost<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.039> contrast

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
pop the lights really boost the contrast

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.810 
pop the lights really boost the contrast
to<00:01:00.059> he'll<00:01:00.350> maybe<00:01:01.350> drop<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> saturation<00:01:02.309> just

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
to he'll maybe drop the saturation just

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.840 
to he'll maybe drop the saturation just
a<00:01:02.969> little<00:01:03.210> bit<00:01:03.979> already<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.309> see<00:01:05.549> that's

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
a little bit already you can see that's

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.390 
a little bit already you can see that's
doing<00:01:06.360> some<00:01:06.600> nice<00:01:06.780> things<00:01:07.170> let's<00:01:07.979> see<00:01:08.159> where

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
doing some nice things let's see where

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.140 
doing some nice things let's see where
we<00:01:08.520> were<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:10.010> then<00:01:11.010> there<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.610> are<00:01:11.640> after

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
we were and then there we are after

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.539 
we were and then there we are after
doing<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.140> already<00:01:13.590> some<00:01:14.310> fairly

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
doing that so already some fairly

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.620 
doing that so already some fairly
significant

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
significant

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.980 
significant
oomph<00:01:16.619> added<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> shot<00:01:17.700> yet<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.780> there's

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
oomph added to the shot yet but there's

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.410 
oomph added to the shot yet but there's
a<00:01:19.080> really<00:01:19.439> simple<00:01:20.189> process<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:21.150> course

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
a really simple process and of course

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.270 
a really simple process and of course
you<00:01:21.630> need<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.840> tweak<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.500> suit<00:01:22.740> your<00:01:22.890> image

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
there don't just copy the slider numbers

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.140 
there don't just copy the slider numbers
I'm<00:01:25.530> gonna<00:01:25.680> show<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.610> let's<00:01:26.790> right-click

I'm gonna show you but let's right-click
it<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.630> open<00:01:28.020> as<00:01:28.200> smart<00:01:28.619> object<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.310> Photoshop

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it and open as smart object in Photoshop

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.399 
it and open as smart object in Photoshop
it's<00:01:30.000> important<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.540> open<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> smart

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
it's important that you open as a smart

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.039 
it's important that you open as a smart
object<00:01:31.560> not<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> standard<00:01:32.729> document<00:01:33.049> so

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
object not as a standard document so

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.200 
object not as a standard document so
there<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.320> go<00:01:34.350> then<00:01:35.100> right<00:01:35.579> click<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
there we go then right click on the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.740 
there we go then right click on the
layer<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.829> name<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.340> say<00:01:38.909> new<00:01:39.299> smart

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
layer so on the name and say new smart

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.170 
layer so on the name and say new smart
object<00:01:40.229> via<00:01:40.439> copy<00:01:40.799> don't<00:01:41.280> duplicate<00:01:42.000> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
object via copy don't duplicate it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.899 
object via copy don't duplicate it
because<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.990> won't<00:01:43.229> work<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.500> way<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.729> then

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
because it won't work that way so then

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.240 
because it won't work that way so then
you<00:01:45.000> can<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.299> over<00:01:45.329> here<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:46.320> two

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
version on the image and then there we

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.410 
version on the image and then there we
go<00:01:52.890> now<00:01:53.100> what<00:01:53.220> we're<00:01:53.399> gonna<00:01:53.520> do<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:54.000> is

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
really over the top but we're gonna

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.520 
really over the top but we're gonna
blend<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.420> not<00:01:57.600> gonna<00:01:57.750> come<00:01:57.990> out<00:01:58.170> this

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
blend it so it's not gonna come out this

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.810 
blend it so it's not gonna come out this
way<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.399> first<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.880> all<00:02:00.000> push<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.020> clarity

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
way so first of all push the clarity

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.490 
way so first of all push the clarity
pretty<00:02:02.820> much<00:02:03.030> all<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.420> way<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.600> 100<00:02:04.229> now<00:02:04.439> you

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
pretty much all the way to 100 now you

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.039 
pretty much all the way to 100 now you
you're<00:02:05.040> gonna<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.850> vary<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.689> course<00:02:06.840> as

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
you're gonna you vary that of course as

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.979 
you're gonna you vary that of course as
I<00:02:07.170> said<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.740> suit<00:02:08.039> your<00:02:08.220> image<00:02:08.580> then<00:02:09.270> push<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
I said to suit your image then push the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.500 
I said to suit your image then push the
fill<00:02:10.259> light<00:02:10.500> again<00:02:11.280> pretty<00:02:11.819> much<00:02:11.940> all<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> way

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
fill light again pretty much all the way

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.640 
fill light again pretty much all the way
up<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> hundred<00:02:13.260> now<00:02:13.410> you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
up to a hundred now you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.210 
up to a hundred now you
see<00:02:13.739> all<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.280> detail<00:02:14.579> here<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:15.329> before

see all of this detail here that before
you<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.819> wasn't<00:02:18.090> there<00:02:18.450> well<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:19.140> in

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
you just it wasn't there well it's in

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.119 
you just it wasn't there well it's in
the<00:02:19.470> file

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
the file

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.619 
the file
it's<00:02:20.280> still<00:02:20.610> in<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.879> file<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.180> can<00:02:21.239> see<00:02:21.329> this

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
it's still in the file you can see this

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.140 
it's still in the file you can see this
was<00:02:21.810> shot<00:02:22.019> on<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.230> Nikon<00:02:22.680> d300<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.700> not<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:24.030> know

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
was shot on a Nikon d300 so not you know

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.720 
was shot on a Nikon d300 so not you know
the<00:02:25.110> most<00:02:25.349> outstanding<00:02:25.769> camera<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.549> world

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
the most outstanding camera in the world

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.490 
the most outstanding camera in the world
but<00:02:26.939> there's<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.180> huge<00:02:27.629> amount<00:02:27.989> of<00:02:28.140> information

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
but there's a huge amount of information

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.380 
but there's a huge amount of information
that<00:02:28.829> you<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.129> see<00:02:29.370> once<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.790> push<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.180> fill

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
that you can see once you push the fill

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.970 
that you can see once you push the fill
light<00:02:30.569> also<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:31.079> ripple<00:02:31.379> of<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.530> curtain

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
light also the ripple of the curtain

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.309 
light also the ripple of the curtain
behind<00:02:32.159> him<00:02:32.579> then<00:02:33.510> we're<00:02:33.750> gonna<00:02:33.870> use<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
behind him then we're gonna use the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.099 
behind him then we're gonna use the
blacks<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.010> bring<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:36.060> back<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.599> you'll<00:02:36.870> see

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
blacks and bring it back and you'll see

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.319 
blacks and bring it back and you'll see
because<00:02:37.319> of<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.950> adding<00:02:38.579> light<00:02:38.790> then<00:02:39.000> adding

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
because of that adding light then adding

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.199 
because of that adding light then adding
dark<00:02:39.629> it<00:02:39.840> goes<00:02:40.049> super<00:02:40.680> contrast<00:02:41.640> II<00:02:41.849> all<00:02:42.030> the

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
dark it goes super contrast II all the

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.479 
dark it goes super contrast II all the
red<00:02:42.390> blotches<00:02:42.689> and<00:02:43.049> it's<00:02:43.620> all<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:44.010> blotches

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
red blotches and it's all the blotches

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.240 
red blotches and it's all the blotches
on<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.849> skin<00:02:45.180> will<00:02:45.390> appear<00:02:45.859> then<00:02:46.859> we're<00:02:47.099> going

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
on the skin will appear then we're going

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.069 
on the skin will appear then we're going
to<00:02:47.340> drop<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.700> saturation<00:02:47.879> all<00:02:48.659> the<00:02:48.900> way<00:02:49.019> to

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
to drop the saturation all the way to

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.199 
to drop the saturation all the way to
zero<00:02:49.530> then<00:02:49.889> work<00:02:50.099> with<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.519> as<00:02:50.639> a<00:02:50.670> black<00:02:50.970> and

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
zero then work with it as a black and

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.629 
zero then work with it as a black and
white<00:02:51.359> and<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:52.620> actually<00:02:52.859> want<00:02:53.069> it<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.430> be<00:02:53.609> a

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
white and you actually want it to be a

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.240 
white and you actually want it to be a
bit<00:02:53.940> darker<00:02:54.510> than<00:02:54.659> it<00:02:54.780> should<00:02:55.079> be<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:55.590> then

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
bit darker than it should be and then

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.270 
bit darker than it should be and then
let's<00:02:56.549> just<00:02:56.730> hit<00:02:56.849> OK<00:02:57.209> for<00:02:57.269> now<00:02:57.889> okay<00:02:58.889> so<00:02:58.950> that's

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
let's just hit OK for now okay so that's

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.649 
let's just hit OK for now okay so that's
what<00:02:59.430> you're<00:02:59.579> going<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.790> see<00:02:59.970> cuz<00:03:00.209> that<00:03:00.389> layer

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
what you're going to see cuz that layer

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.110 
what you're going to see cuz that layer
is<00:03:00.930> on<00:03:01.139> top<00:03:01.170> what<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:02.189> need<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.519> do<00:03:02.670> then<00:03:02.909> is

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
is on top what we need to do then is

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.509 
is on top what we need to do then is
actually<00:03:03.720> change<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.260> blending<00:03:04.709> mode<00:03:04.769> so<00:03:05.280> up

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
actually change the blending mode so up

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.390 
actually change the blending mode so up
here<00:03:05.870> change<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.019> from<00:03:07.200> normal<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.040> bottom

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
here change it from normal to the bottom

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.129 
here change it from normal to the bottom
one<00:03:08.579> luminosity<00:03:09.389> and<00:03:09.599> just<00:03:09.750> look<00:03:09.959> what

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
one luminosity and just look what

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.740 
one luminosity and just look what
happens<00:03:10.500> when<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.680> do<00:03:10.889> that<00:03:11.099> an<00:03:11.750> insane

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
happens when you do that an insane

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.110 
happens when you do that an insane
amount<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.290> detail<00:03:13.769> pops<00:03:14.189> out<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.970> comes

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
amount of detail pops out and it comes

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.539 
amount of detail pops out and it comes
back<00:03:15.299> to<00:03:15.450> color<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.139> with<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:16.829> not<00:03:17.280> too

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
back to color and with a not too

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.750 
back to color and with a not too
over-the-top<00:03:18.889> rendition<00:03:19.889> of<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.190> colors<00:03:20.579> you

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
over-the-top rendition of the colors you

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.360 
over-the-top rendition of the colors you
can<00:03:21.329> go<00:03:21.569> back<00:03:21.870> in<00:03:22.139> and<00:03:22.379> if<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.620> really<00:03:22.980> want<00:03:23.220> to

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
can go back in and if you really want to

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.849 
can go back in and if you really want to
work<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.269> hell<00:03:24.449> you<00:03:25.079> can<00:03:25.290> go<00:03:25.440> into<00:03:25.650> the

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
work it to hell you can go into the

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.619 
work it to hell you can go into the
bottom<00:03:26.160> layer<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.639> push<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.120> clarity<00:03:27.510> on

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
bottom layer and push the clarity on

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.809 
bottom layer and push the clarity on
that<00:03:27.660> one<00:03:28.079> as<00:03:28.290> well<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.739> if<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.340> saturation

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
that one as well and if the saturation

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.629 
that one as well and if the saturation
still<00:03:30.329> a<00:03:30.359> bit<00:03:30.629> too<00:03:30.659> much<00:03:31.049> on<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.379> final<00:03:32.340> result

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
still a bit too much on the final result

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.460 
still a bit too much on the final result
you<00:03:32.760> can<00:03:32.940> drop<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.329> saturation<00:03:33.629> on<00:03:34.290> this

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
you can drop the saturation on this

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.030 
you can drop the saturation on this
level<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.919> little<00:03:35.040> bit<00:03:35.329> bring<00:03:36.329> it<00:03:36.449> back<00:03:36.659> and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
level a little bit bring it back and

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.199 
level a little bit bring it back and
there<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.129> go<00:03:38.310> it's<00:03:38.489> pulled<00:03:38.760> out<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:38.970> little

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
there you go it's pulled out a little

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.240 
there you go it's pulled out a little

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
it up to a hundred percent just a mental

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.750 
it up to a hundred percent just a mental
amount<00:04:00.269> of<00:04:00.419> detail<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:02.069> course<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.519> can

amount of detail and of course you can

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.059 
amount of detail and of course you can
still<00:04:03.120> work<00:04:03.389> it<00:04:03.629> further<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.199> further<00:04:04.470> to

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
shot when we started yep there it is

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.760 
shot when we started yep there it is
as<00:04:19.669> we<00:04:20.669> started<00:04:21.090> out<00:04:21.299> now<00:04:21.959> looking<00:04:22.289> at<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.560> one

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
as we started out now looking at it one

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.649 
as we started out now looking at it one
two<00:04:23.010> one

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:25.659 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.909 

certainly<00:04:26.659> there's<00:04:26.930> a<00:04:27.050> lot<00:04:27.199> of<00:04:27.469> detail<00:04:27.889> there

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
certainly there's a lot of detail there

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.909 
certainly there's a lot of detail there
and<00:04:28.550> it's<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:29.150> nice<00:04:29.330> crisp<00:04:29.780> portrait<00:04:30.349> as<00:04:30.560> it<00:04:30.740> is

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
and it's a nice crisp portrait as it is

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.339 
and it's a nice crisp portrait as it is
but<00:04:31.580> then<00:04:31.819> swinging<00:04:32.270> back<00:04:32.569> to<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.930> edited

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
but then swinging back to the edited

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.740 
but then swinging back to the edited
version<00:04:33.530> and<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:34.430> can<00:04:34.460> see<00:04:34.819> it's<00:04:35.150> just<00:04:35.539> off

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750

quick<00:04:38.509> edit<00:04:39.229> obviously<00:04:39.830> I<00:04:39.860> just<00:04:40.219> did<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:40.490> in<00:04:40.610> a

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
quick edit obviously I just did it in a

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:42.999 
quick edit obviously I just did it in a
couple<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.120> minutes<00:04:41.449> to<00:04:41.629> show<00:04:41.870> you<00:04:41.930> I<00:04:42.289> would

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
couple of minutes to show you I would

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.459 
couple of minutes to show you I would
you<00:04:43.460> know<00:04:43.580> work<00:04:44.060> with<00:04:44.270> it<00:04:44.419> more<00:04:44.659> before<00:04:44.960> I<00:04:45.199> was

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:45.469 
you know work with it more before I was

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:47.379 
you know work with it more before I was
sending<00:04:45.710> that<00:04:45.949> off<00:04:46.069> to<00:04:46.250> print<00:04:46.550> certainly<00:04:47.180> I

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
sending that off to print certainly I

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.450 
sending that off to print certainly I
would<00:04:47.840> want<00:04:48.020> to<00:04:48.080> have<00:04:48.229> more<00:04:48.530> detail<00:04:48.949> coming<00:04:49.340> in

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
would want to have more detail coming in

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.610 
would want to have more detail coming in
in<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:49.699> blacks<00:04:49.969> there<00:04:50.360> but<00:04:51.050> as<00:04:51.259> a<00:04:51.319> quick

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
in the blacks there but as a quick

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.219 
in the blacks there but as a quick
little<00:04:52.009> thing<00:04:52.039> to<00:04:52.250> show<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.669> amount<00:04:52.879> of

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
little thing to show you the amount of

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.749 
little thing to show you the amount of
contrast<00:04:54.229> and<00:04:54.500> detail<00:04:54.889> you<00:04:55.310> can<00:04:55.460> bring<00:04:55.610> up

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
contrast and detail you can bring up

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.490 
contrast and detail you can bring up
through<00:04:55.969> that<00:04:56.120> process<00:04:56.389> I<00:04:56.840> think<00:04:57.349> that's

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
through that process I think that's

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.420 
through that process I think that's
worthwhile<00:04:58.069> point<00:04:58.849> to<00:04:59.000> note<00:04:59.590> it<00:05:00.590> really<00:05:01.189> makes

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
worthwhile point to note it really makes

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.119 
worthwhile point to note it really makes
a<00:05:01.580> mess<00:05:01.759> of<00:05:01.789> people's<00:05:02.240> skin<00:05:02.629> so<00:05:02.930> be<00:05:03.259> judicious

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:04.129 
a mess of people's skin so be judicious

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:06.129 
a mess of people's skin so be judicious
in<00:05:04.250> using<00:05:04.669> it<00:05:04.759> on<00:05:04.969> women<00:05:05.389> unless<00:05:05.659> you<00:05:05.900> want

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
in using it on women unless you want

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.320 
in using it on women unless you want
that<00:05:06.199> really<00:05:06.529> gritty<00:05:06.949> effect<00:05:07.340> as<00:05:07.520> well<00:05:07.759> even

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
that really gritty effect as well even

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.529 
that really gritty effect as well even
women<00:05:08.930> wearing<00:05:09.379> a<00:05:09.740> strong<00:05:10.340> studio<00:05:11.029> makeup

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
women wearing a strong studio makeup

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.529 
women wearing a strong studio makeup
it'll<00:05:12.139> bring<00:05:12.319> up<00:05:12.500> any<00:05:12.740> flaws<00:05:13.639> in<00:05:13.969> the<00:05:14.060> skin<00:05:14.360> I'm
