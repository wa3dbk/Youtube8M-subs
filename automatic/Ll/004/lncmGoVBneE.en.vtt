you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.729> see<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.090> pretty<00:01:12.900> simple<00:01:13.290> design

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
you can see this is pretty simple design

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.249 
you can see this is pretty simple design
but<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.040> works<00:01:14.189> very<00:01:14.460> very<00:01:14.580> well<00:01:15.080> this<00:01:16.080> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
but it works very very well this is

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.170 
but it works very very well this is
actually<00:01:16.409> best<00:01:16.799> used<00:01:17.189> underneath<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.759> helmet

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
actually best used underneath a helmet

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.140 
actually best used underneath a helmet
or<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:19.229> know<00:01:19.700> over<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:21.830> baseball<00:01:22.830> cap<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.939> is

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
or you know over a a baseball cap it is

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.789 
or you know over a a baseball cap it is
designed<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.659> work<00:01:24.810> with<00:01:25.020> goggles<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.710> it

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
designed to work with goggles so it

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.890 
designed to work with goggles so it
won't<00:01:25.979> conflict<00:01:26.189> too<00:01:26.670> much<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.630> will

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
won't conflict too much but this will

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.289 
won't conflict too much but this will
not<00:01:27.930> work<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.619> full<00:01:28.950> paintball<00:01:29.369> masks<00:01:29.790> well

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
not work for full paintball masks well

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.490 
not work for full paintball masks well
it<00:01:30.479> might<00:01:30.689> depends<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.170> guys<00:01:31.259> are<00:01:31.409> your

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it might depends if you guys are your
