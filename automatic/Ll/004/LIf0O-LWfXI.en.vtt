00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.030
 we'll do something like that in the beginning 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.719
 Can you all join in? 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:19.140
 say wow tell or 20 euros 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:24.750
 actually okay he will not 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:32.250
 but I will disappear then 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:34.230
 actually get white from 20 euros 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.280
 not whether it works out if now 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.770
 five euros 20 cents will be the best 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.809
 greece wrestles him but i show 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.780
 not five euros will be honest 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.989
 brothers in our show and otherwise 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.989
 always 50 euro that was the hammer or 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.680
 no matter how Chinese I can 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.759
 which would have but if I mean 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.110
 Munich Table Legend said afterwards 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.820
 You have to be careful now 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:22.420
 can give people in one hand 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:22.420
 like you put them in a money box 21 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:39.750
 hidden in the hand under the table like that 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.280
 what's the following, yes, a little bit 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:55.109
 maybe back on the table so that 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:58.979
 you can see well ok number 13 me 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:01.909
 can just put me here like this 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.420
 through the desk hours 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:14.310
 disappeared 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:17.879
 Logically under the table makes it so 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.650
 right down there on the left so right 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.049
 with each other exactly you can go there too 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.690
 make and kulis also in high right and 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.160
 left and now he wiggles me 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.579
 little finger wiggling with the little ones 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.959
 fumble 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.400
 because if you did that long enough 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:37.430
 you can thumb up 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.139
 bring forget to explain 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.980
 how do we drive the route ? 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.980
 out to the front here 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.480
 So it's not like what we do 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.989
 is 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.650
 We say stop right there 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.819
 your hands a little higher 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.530
 we should have turned the hand ever 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.930
 it does not have to be held because we just say 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.099
 to touch the hands 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.260
 and if if if we correct now 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.340
 yes, then I turn my hand out 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.220
 which I just shot so fast 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.040
 I have now turned very slowly 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.780
 then we will get it wrong again 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.120
 composing is then very important 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.380
 that wobble with his finger because afterwards 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.760
 Forgets to take what happens before it 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.890
 is not kidding 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.430
 then you can hands up a lot 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.430
 fun while trying
