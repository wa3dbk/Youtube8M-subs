00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.050 
going to start a series for yash called
Moab<00:02:18.440> on<00:02:18.650> every<00:02:18.950> map<00:02:19.130> or<00:02:19.430> something<00:02:19.610> similar

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
Moab on every map or something similar

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.170 
Moab on every map or something similar
to<00:02:20.120> like<00:02:20.390> that<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.560> believe<00:02:21.890> there<00:02:22.100> are<00:02:22.190> 16

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
to like that so I believe there are 16

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.170 
to like that so I believe there are 16
maps<00:02:23.480> right<00:02:23.780> now<00:02:23.960> with<00:02:24.740> every<00:02:25.040> dlc<00:02:25.490> yet<00:02:25.730> maybe

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180

for<00:02:26.570> whatever<00:02:26.960> but<00:02:27.250> I'm<00:02:28.250> thinking<00:02:28.730> I'm

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
for whatever but I'm thinking I'm

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.010 
for whatever but I'm thinking I'm
thinking<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:30.620> if<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:31.460> am<00:02:31.970> able<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.450> do<00:02:32.630> this<00:02:32.780> if

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
thinking that if I am able to do this if

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
that's that's they'll be a year so I

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.460 
that's that's they'll be a year so I
don't<00:02:46.670> know<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:47.000> might<00:02:47.390> not<00:02:47.570> get<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.930> all<00:02:48.080> of<00:02:48.290> the
