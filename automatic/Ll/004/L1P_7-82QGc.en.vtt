00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.090 
retain their value a little bit they
drop<00:03:54.570> quite<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.870> bit<00:03:55.140> but<00:03:55.320> some<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.770> cards

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.550 
retain their value like the supporter in
but<00:03:59.160> then<00:03:59.310> six<00:03:59.790> months<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.390> good<00:04:00.690> year<00:04:01.080> after

but then six months to a good year after

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.740 
but then six months to a good year after
the<00:04:02.520> sets<00:04:02.790> are<00:04:03.000> dropped<00:04:03.240> from<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.480> current

the sets are dropped from the current
rotation<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.890> prices<00:04:05.370> go<00:04:05.580> way<00:04:05.610> down<00:04:06.410> so<00:04:07.410> these

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
rotation the prices go way down so these

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.460

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
the cup next couple of months but I

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.530 
the cup next couple of months but I
would<00:04:13.260> say<00:04:13.500> they<00:04:13.739> won't<00:04:14.190> decrease<00:04:15.060> by<00:04:15.300> more

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
would say they won't decrease by more

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.260 
would say they won't decrease by more

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
value eventually but right now they're

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.930 
value eventually but right now they're
pretty<00:04:31.350> low<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:31.919> see<00:04:32.160> that<00:04:32.310> same<00:04:32.610> path

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
pretty low and I see that same path

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.249 
pretty low and I see that same path
happening<00:04:33.569> for<00:04:34.500> full<00:04:35.280> art<00:04:35.610> Pokemon<00:04:36.360> cards<00:04:36.780> so

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
happening for full art Pokemon cards so

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:38.930 
happening for full art Pokemon cards so
I<00:04:37.289> laid<00:04:37.530> out<00:04:37.680> what<00:04:37.860> their<00:04:38.009> values<00:04:38.430> are<00:04:38.610> right

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
I laid out what their values are right

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.809 
I laid out what their values are right
now<00:04:39.150> I<00:04:39.449> think<00:04:40.229> that<00:04:40.680> those<00:04:40.860> values<00:04:41.340> will<00:04:41.669> say

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819 
now I think that those values will say

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.059 
now I think that those values will say
somewhat<00:04:42.419> steady<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:43.080> supporter<00:04:43.740> end<00:04:43.919> will

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
somewhat steady the supporter end will

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.040 
somewhat steady the supporter end will
probably<00:04:44.370> decrease<00:04:44.759> the<00:04:45.060> most<00:04:45.330> just<00:04:45.960> because

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
probably decrease the most just because

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.430 
probably decrease the most just because
it<00:04:46.349> was<00:04:46.470> valued<00:04:46.860> at<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.039> highest<00:04:47.460> at<00:04:47.639> one<00:04:47.819> time

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
it was valued at the highest at one time

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
it was valued at the highest at one time
in<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:50.580> future<00:04:51.150> I<00:04:51.389> think<00:04:52.319> these<00:04:52.770> cards<00:04:53.220> will

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
in the future I think these cards will

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.400 
in the future I think these cards will
definitely<00:04:53.940> increase<00:04:54.270> but<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:54.930> won't<00:04:55.080> be<00:04:55.199> for

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
definitely increase but it won't be for

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.640 
definitely increase but it won't be for
another<00:04:55.470> couple<00:04:56.009> of<00:04:56.069> years<00:04:56.130> at<00:04:56.729> least<00:04:56.910> and<00:04:57.650> I

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
another couple of years at least and I

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.279 
another couple of years at least and I
could<00:04:58.830> see<00:04:59.009> these<00:04:59.160> cards<00:04:59.520> being<00:05:00.240> valued<00:05:00.630> at<00:05:00.780> 15

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
could see these cards being valued at 15

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.490 
could see these cards being valued at 15
to<00:05:01.470> 20<00:05:01.800> dollars<00:05:01.949> apiece<00:05:02.550> in<00:05:02.990> five<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.259> ten

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
to 20 dollars apiece in five to ten

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.400 
to 20 dollars apiece in five to ten
years<00:05:04.949> but<00:05:05.699> for<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.090> next<00:05:06.570> five<00:05:07.020> years

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
years but for the next five years

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.710 
years but for the next five years
they're<00:05:07.830> probably<00:05:08.009> going<00:05:08.220> to<00:05:08.280> be<00:05:08.570> ten<00:05:09.570> to

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
they're probably going to be ten to

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
they're probably going to be ten to
fifteen<00:05:10.110> dollars<00:05:10.289> at<00:05:10.710> a<00:05:10.740> very<00:05:11.039> maximum<00:05:12.710> so<00:05:13.710> I

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
fifteen dollars at a very maximum so I

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.580 
fifteen dollars at a very maximum so I
would<00:05:14.160> definitely<00:05:14.840> purchase<00:05:15.840> these<00:05:16.050> cards<00:05:16.470> if

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
would definitely purchase these cards if

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.990 
would definitely purchase these cards if
you're<00:05:16.710> looking<00:05:17.039> to<00:05:17.220> collect<00:05:17.550> full<00:05:17.820> hour

you're looking to collect full hour
cards<00:05:18.389> right<00:05:18.630> now<00:05:18.690> just<00:05:19.500> because<00:05:19.830> all<00:05:20.070> of<00:05:20.099> the

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
cards right now just because all of the

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.820

people<00:05:20.729> in<00:05:20.849> the<00:05:20.970> TCG<00:05:21.570> that<00:05:21.840> had<00:05:22.050> these<00:05:22.289> cars<00:05:22.620> in

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
people in the TCG that had these cars in

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.939 
people in the TCG that had these cars in
their<00:05:22.949> decks<00:05:23.220> or<00:05:23.520> in<00:05:23.970> their<00:05:24.090> collections

their decks or in their collections

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.809 
their decks or in their collections
possibly<00:05:25.949> going<00:05:26.130> to<00:05:26.280> use<00:05:26.430> them<00:05:26.610> in<00:05:26.729> their

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:26.819 
possibly going to use them in their

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.570 
possibly going to use them in their
decks<00:05:27.060> they'll<00:05:27.539> probably<00:05:27.750> be<00:05:28.470> looking<00:05:29.039> to<00:05:29.250> get

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
decks they'll probably be looking to get

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.330 
decks they'll probably be looking to get
rid<00:05:29.759> of<00:05:29.789> those<00:05:30.090> cards<00:05:30.599> and<00:05:31.009> make<00:05:32.009> some<00:05:32.220> money

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
rid of those cards and make some money

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.790 
rid of those cards and make some money
on<00:05:32.550> those<00:05:32.699> cards<00:05:33.060> to<00:05:33.750> buy<00:05:33.960> some<00:05:34.229> newer<00:05:34.409> cards

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
on those cards to buy some newer cards

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.800 
on those cards to buy some newer cards
for<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:35.370> TCG<00:05:36.030> so<00:05:36.270> the<00:05:37.610> quantity<00:05:38.610> of<00:05:38.639> the<00:05:39.509> full

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
for the TCG so the quantity of the full

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.279 
for the TCG so the quantity of the full
art<00:05:39.990> cards<00:05:40.380> isn't<00:05:40.530> going<00:05:40.949> to<00:05:41.099> increase

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
art cards isn't going to increase

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.920 
art cards isn't going to increase
significantly<00:05:43.969> it<00:05:44.969> already<00:05:45.270> has<00:05:45.570> and<00:05:45.840> will

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
significantly it already has and will

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:46.820 
significantly it already has and will
increase<00:05:46.289> even<00:05:46.440> more

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
increase even more

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.459 
increase even more
thus<00:05:47.610> it'll<00:05:47.880> drop<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.389> price<00:05:48.630> down<00:05:48.900> even

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469 
thus it'll drop the price down even

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:51.439 
thus it'll drop the price down even
farther<00:05:50.159> and<00:05:50.639> you'll<00:05:50.880> be<00:05:51.000> able<00:05:51.090> to<00:05:51.270> purchase
