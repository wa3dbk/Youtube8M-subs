00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.220
 paying more videos stay at one point of the 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.589
 good team but this time you see a 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.070
 Stand by it the crisis I have 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.200
 very much utility very much that 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.770
 can help but your world over will 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.050
 get give myspace crips import no 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.090
 4th region where the price we think 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.070
 win the case when downloading 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.580
 It rains from here, there are more people today. 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.080
 It's here so I'm going to face this motto. 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.880
 that game is back in the world 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.489
 basically when I do not know you 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.410
 garden of the world that you are and continue 17 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.790
 so then I have a lot of faith that I am 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.770
 high in this way think this will 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.690
 become your yearly affection and you 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.750
 You are here and to ask forward 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.329
 to the ready and see the block me 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.390
 follow me I'm going to fall here fast you 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.950
 have to try to fall for the pac 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.590
 cool, it's ok, but I'm going to fall 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.449
 quickly and this is unnecessary and 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.550
 thing you see here on the side already has 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.559
 more block so they will follow up 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.180
 you fall to the ground in case I fell to the ground 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.680
 I'm going to walk here anyway 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.200
 today is the best I want to fall 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.840
 crap will fall and that he is not 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.990
 used in the most is as if they were your 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.340
 Feet like that, you 're fine. 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.369
 here on top and robert otto who is in 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.750
 Your Lord is going to vote you do not want 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.490
 fall on the ground and only being so 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.189
 basically it is you will take in the middle 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.470
 No, and this shows that you only have this 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.100
 activity even though nothing else connects but 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.600
 It's going to be super cool because it's I do not know. 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.670
 Because I thought it cool because it has color. 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.259
 I do not know, but I think it's super legal. 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.780
 my then went to a roller coaster 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.020
 here to want to make the structure of it already 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.030
 after you put your children so it 's 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.939
 It's basically a has what it is 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.570
 this way of changing the cut here and I already 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.220
 I go the motto we do what we like it 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.470
 is that the channel share its 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.310
 favorites 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.409
 we position ourselves videos and impressions of 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.420
 today where we got 1 60m and so 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.030
 was video type neither because of the channel 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.619
 Children's contest so not so 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.060

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.250

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.660

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.900
 yes, and very big, we support turning 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.330
 2500 subscribers forget that it's the team 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.430
 when you comment and how in everything that 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.960
 is on strike that scratches the sky 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.800
 At first I thought why the team made a 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.680
 big favor 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.210

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.040

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.960
 popular on the channel and amorim than with 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.640

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.400
 Just giggled. 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.390
 the ethical doubts segment on the channel is 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:49.860
 Look how cool, it 's really cool, but it's 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.860
 He said, 'It goes with video and such.
