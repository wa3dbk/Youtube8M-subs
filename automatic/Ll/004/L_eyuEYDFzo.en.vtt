the rear axis and that really comes from

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.370 
the rear axis and that really comes from
the<00:01:23.030> design<00:01:23.420> of<00:01:23.569> the<00:01:23.630> machine<00:01:23.719> with<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:24.170> cab

as we get to the backside we get to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.680 
as we get to the backside we get to
really<00:01:31.220> what<00:01:31.520> is<00:01:31.820> at<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.270> heart<00:01:32.480> of<00:01:32.570> the

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
really what is at the heart of the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.510 
really what is at the heart of the
sprayer<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.320> is<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.860> application<00:01:34.340> of

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
sprayer and that is the application of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.340 
sprayer and that is the application of

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
nozzles we have a PWM solenoid that

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.680 
nozzles we have a PWM solenoid that
allows<00:02:13.520> us<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.880> maintain<00:02:14.030> constant

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
allows us to maintain constant

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.960 
allows us to maintain constant
application<00:02:15.530> rate<00:02:15.740> at<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.190> constant<00:02:16.640> pressure

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
even as the speed of the machine changes

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.210 
even as the speed of the machine changes
so<00:02:19.400> we<00:02:19.520> get<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.820> optimum<00:02:20.330> size<00:02:20.510> droplet

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
so we get the optimum size droplet

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.740 
so we get the optimum size droplet
exactly<00:02:22.220> where<00:02:22.400> we<00:02:22.550> want<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.910> at<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.420> rate<00:02:23.600> we

to turn off sections or the entire boom

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.729 
to turn off sections or the entire boom
