00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
quick disconnect just shove the bottle

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.600 
quick disconnect just shove the bottle
filler<00:01:00.510> into<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> end<00:01:01.609> like<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:04.430> with<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
filler into the end like that with the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.830 
filler into the end like that with the
stopper<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:09.000> reason<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.420> keg<00:01:09.689> is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
stopper on it and the reason this keg is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.200 
stopper on it and the reason this keg is
not<00:01:10.020> my<00:01:10.260> kegerator<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.640> because<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.030> don't

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
not my kegerator it's because I don't

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.539 
not my kegerator it's because I don't
have<00:01:12.360> room<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.869> did<00:01:13.439> chill<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.860> down<00:01:14.040> just

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
have room I did chill it down just

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.580 
have room I did chill it down just
outside<00:01:15.180> because<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:15.840> very<00:01:15.990> cold<00:01:16.380> outside

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
outside because it's very cold outside

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.280 
outside because it's very cold outside
right<00:01:16.830> now<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.729> want<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.810> cold

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
right now so you do want to have cold

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.550 
right now so you do want to have cold
beer<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.860> do<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.840> then<00:01:21.990> I've<00:01:22.140> set<00:01:22.380> my

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
beer to do this and then I've set my

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.289 
beer to do this and then I've set my
regulator<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:24.299> about<00:01:24.570> 3<00:01:25.020> psi<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.299> that's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
regulator to just about 3 psi and that's

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.910 
regulator to just about 3 psi and that's
important<00:01:27.810> because<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.140> don't<00:01:28.500> want<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.740> whole

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
important because you don't want a whole

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.319 
important because you don't want a whole
lot<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.100> pressure<00:01:29.400> behind<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.970> beer<00:01:30.119> while

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
lot of pressure behind the beer while

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.050 
lot of pressure behind the beer while
you're<00:01:30.509> doing<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.490> got<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.579> my<00:01:32.700> bottles

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
you're doing this got all my bottles

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.460 
you're doing this got all my bottles
ready<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.630> now<00:01:34.590> I'll<00:01:34.799> get<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.280> now<00:01:36.470> it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
ready and now I'll get going now it

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.330 
ready and now I'll get going now it
helps<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:38.070> dump<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.119> beer<00:01:39.329> out<00:01:39.360> first<00:01:40.340> through

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
helps to dump the beer out first through

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.420 
helps to dump the beer out first through
the<00:01:41.490> line<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.930> get<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.290> little<00:01:43.590> bit<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the line to get a little bit in and to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.050 
the line to get a little bit in and to
get<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.820> line<00:01:45.030> shield<00:01:45.420> down<00:01:48.229> then<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:50.850> can

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
get the line shield down then you can

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.249 
get the line shield down then you can
start<00:01:51.329> bog<00:01:51.630> or<00:01:52.200> one<00:01:52.470> out<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> stopper

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
start bog or one out of the stopper

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.039 
start bog or one out of the stopper
inside<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.500> bottle<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:57.570> where<00:01:57.780> it's

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
inside the bottle to where it's

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.380 
inside the bottle to where it's
providing<00:01:58.590> back<00:01:58.829> pressure<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.969> isn't

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
providing back pressure but isn't

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.980 
providing back pressure but isn't
totally<00:02:01.020> stopping<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.920> bottle<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.990> don't

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
totally stopping up the bottle I don't

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.600 
totally stopping up the bottle I don't
know<00:02:04.079> how<00:02:04.200> well<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:04.740> see<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.310> camera

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
know how well you can see it on camera

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.809 
know how well you can see it on camera
but<00:02:06.590> feels<00:02:07.590> pretty<00:02:07.860> slowly<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.520> that's<00:02:08.610> what

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
but feels pretty slowly and that's what

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.150 
but feels pretty slowly and that's what
you<00:02:08.910> want

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
you want

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.880 
you want
but<00:02:09.280> there<00:02:09.460> is<00:02:09.730> hardly<00:02:10.150> any<00:02:10.510> foam<00:02:10.960> on<00:02:11.260> top<00:02:11.710> of

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
but there is hardly any foam on top of

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.490 
but there is hardly any foam on top of
the<00:02:11.980> beer<00:02:12.750> usually<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.840> get<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.050> little<00:02:14.350> bit

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
the beer usually you get a little bit

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.360 
the beer usually you get a little bit
more<00:02:14.710> foam<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:16.180> first<00:02:16.480> beer<00:02:17.010> then<00:02:18.010> after

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
more foam on the first beer then after

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.000 
more foam on the first beer then after
that<00:02:18.490> it's<00:02:18.730> smooth<00:02:19.030> sailing<00:02:22.590> right<00:02:23.590> up<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:23.890> the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
that it's smooth sailing right up to the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.240 
that it's smooth sailing right up to the
top<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:25.110> usually<00:02:26.110> find<00:02:26.320> it's<00:02:26.530> okay<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:26.950> let<00:02:27.190> a

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
top I usually find it's okay to let a

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.730 
top I usually find it's okay to let a
little<00:02:27.550> bit<00:02:27.730> leak<00:02:27.940> through<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.750> then<00:02:29.530> just

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
little bit leak through and then just

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.730 
little bit leak through and then just
