00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.460
 or ford festiva named she somehow 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.619
 my engine is more or less clean from 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.880
 he did not get past the owner 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.079
 terrible condition 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.129
 everything was in the oil means replaced the glands 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:43.260
 replaced 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:47.559
 gasket rings then it means I laundered 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:52.350
 a box full of gasoline now 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:56.620
 you see that she is a little shining 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:01.629
 there were two centimeters already dried 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:05.110
 oil at the expense of the shaft we gasoline why are we 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.120
 forgive me now wash because he 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.170
 there was some kind of fatty 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:15.510
 I want to remove it a little bit, and also in 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.110
 hard to reach places too 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:24.700
 let's say there 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.470
 harry ask yinka bought i mean here 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.270
 such engine cleaner 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.070
 Soviet cost 75 rubles seen 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.300
 recent tests 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:41.680
 highgear ovsky means for 300 rubles here 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:46.210
 this lost means of application 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:50.230
 very simple put this liquid in two 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.710
 minutes on a hot engine and then 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.710
 wash off with water 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.880
 warm up to 60 degrees i think no more 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.380
 need to 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.750
 take out the battery completely to 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.170
 there was more space where it was possible 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.009
 splashing means reading a lot of reviews 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:15.150
 about washing this particular machine means 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.060
 buy shoe covers close the unit 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.250
 fuses 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.120
 close the mass flow sensor 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.930
 of air 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.820
 for some reason they say it flies after the match 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:35.970
 automatic close the generator and very 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:38.900
 I advise let's say cut some 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:44.450
 long ones such as strings of rags and 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:47.940
 huddled over there in the candle wells they 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.900
 at an angle of 45 degrees all the water will be 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.709
 there but I didnâ€™t get shoved in there because 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:00.570
 that I will not go there to try to pour a lot 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.239
 water well let's get the engine heated already 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.480
 up to 60 degrees 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.480
 I think that's enough 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.850
 passat 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:00.970
 everything is well sprinkled now means we take 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.970
 water and all this wash off 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.240
 but 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:19.419
 Yes, I understand that the pressure of water useless 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:28.900
 but still he watch water there already flowed 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.900
 black 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.820
 mean after all well washed 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.840
 let dry for at least three hours 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.160
 I want to remind once again about candlesticks 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:16.610
 wells means guys do not be lazy 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:21.100
 something there to shove I'm like 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:25.100
 there cram means strings that 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:29.230
 tying up bushes of tomatoes but not found 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.990
 them here and since evening 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:37.100
 then time to chop out of rags I already have 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:41.360
 there was no water there means dirt gets 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.700
 then this whole thread goes there 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.700
 rust then candles mean not 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.640
 unscrew ok if not unscrew 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.240
 then hell twist in general not 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:56.300
 be lazy 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:06:00.130
 and then you will have to regret it because 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.130
 It's already too late 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:08.320
 I will go to sleep and in the morning we are with you 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:11.020
 try to start and maybe not start 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.960
 this car but it has arrived 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:18.310
 the long-awaited morning now poured 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:29.220

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:37.420
 car 12 years here already and from time bruce 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:45.490
 there is a scuff which is already a sponge or 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:48.270
 erased this one was all oil 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:52.980
 films jumping at fingers touched 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:07:04.480
 the oil remained dry now 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:06.870
 so the box the box is all shiny so 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.870
