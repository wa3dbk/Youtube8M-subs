00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
bit loose so I can use the socket to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.969 
bit loose so I can use the socket to
take<00:01:06.149> them<00:01:06.300> all<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.450> way<00:01:06.630> off<00:01:06.740> then<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:07.830> going

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
take them all the way off then I'm going

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.999 
take them all the way off then I'm going
to<00:01:08.009> set<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.280> handlebar<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.060> towel<00:01:09.360> gently

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
to set the handlebar on the towel gently

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.800 
to set the handlebar on the towel gently
it<00:01:11.009> has<00:01:11.190> some<00:01:11.369> pretty<00:01:11.520> tight<00:01:11.820> wiring<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.570> it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
it has some pretty tight wiring and it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.310 
it has some pretty tight wiring and it
also<00:01:12.990> has<00:01:13.289> a<00:01:13.320> very<00:01:13.560> tight<00:01:14.960> connection<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
also has a very tight connection to the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.770 
also has a very tight connection to the
hydraulic<00:01:16.770> brake<00:01:17.040> which<00:01:18.030> does<00:01:18.299> concern<00:01:18.720> me

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
hydraulic brake which does concern me

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.859 
hydraulic brake which does concern me
these<00:01:19.290> risers<00:01:19.740> may<00:01:20.130> not<00:01:20.310> work<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.939> that

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
these risers may not work for that

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.270 
these risers may not work for that
reason<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.900> let<00:01:24.900> me<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.259> take<00:01:25.470> these<00:01:25.650> off<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
reason so let me just take these off and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
reason so let me just take these off and

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
while I think they put Loctite on it so

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.060 
while I think they put Loctite on it so
I'm<00:02:33.120> gonna<00:02:33.270> take<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:33.600> loose<00:02:33.870> I'm<00:02:34.320> gonna<00:02:34.830> put

the spacer on I'll show you how to do

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.480 
the spacer on I'll show you how to do
that<00:02:36.540> once<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.900> have<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.260> loose<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.830> then

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
that once I have this loose and then

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.730 
that once I have this loose and then
we'll<00:02:38.640> reinstall<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:39.590> okay

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
we'll reinstall it okay

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.340 
we'll reinstall it okay
so<00:02:40.890> our<00:02:41.160> goal<00:02:41.400> now<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.820> take<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.300> old<00:02:42.630> bolt

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
so our goal now is to take this old bolt

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.510 
so our goal now is to take this old bolt
out<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.850> set<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.060> aside

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
out and set it aside

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.229 
out and set it aside
install<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.640> new<00:02:47.760> bolt<00:02:49.280> install<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.550> spacer

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
install the new bolt install the spacer

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.290 
install the new bolt install the spacer
piece<00:02:51.630> which<00:02:51.870> fits<00:02:52.140> right<00:02:52.320> in<00:02:52.500> there<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:53.300> then

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
piece which fits right in there and then

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.770 
piece which fits right in there and then
the<00:02:54.420> washer<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:56.090> then<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.300> piece<00:02:57.510> goes<00:02:57.750> here

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
the washer and then this piece goes here

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.479 
the washer and then this piece goes here
and<00:02:58.350> then<00:02:58.530> these<00:02:58.709> would<00:02:58.860> go<00:02:59.010> on<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.310> bottom

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
and then these would go on the bottom

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.910 
and then these would go on the bottom
and<00:02:59.910> again<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.959> have<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.140> make<00:03:01.290> sure<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.709> keep

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
and again you have to make sure you keep

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:10.610 
and again you have to make sure you keep
this<00:03:03.050> dot<00:03:05.000> going<00:03:06.000> forward<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:09.260> I'm<00:03:10.260> gonna<00:03:10.410> see

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
this dot going forward so I'm gonna see

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.240 
this dot going forward so I'm gonna see
if<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.739> can<00:03:10.830> get<00:03:10.920> all<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.130> this<00:03:11.220> started<00:03:13.250> with

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
if I can get all of this started with

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:25.440 
if I can get all of this started with
one<00:03:14.519> hand<00:03:14.989> it's<00:03:15.989> not<00:03:16.170> easy<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.560> do

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.229 

okay<00:03:26.450> I've<00:03:26.840> gotten<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.500> started<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:28.209> want<00:03:29.209> to

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
okay I've gotten it started I want to

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.729 
okay I've gotten it started I want to
make<00:03:29.360> sure<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.540> orientate<00:03:30.140> it<00:03:30.170> into<00:03:30.650> the

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
make sure I orientate it into the

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.309 
make sure I orientate it into the
correct<00:03:31.010> position<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.819> then<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:33.019> looks<00:03:33.260> like

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
correct position and then it looks like

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.180 
correct position and then it looks like
this<00:03:33.590> is<00:03:33.769> gonna<00:03:33.890> take<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.250> giant<00:03:35.920> allen<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.160> I

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
this is gonna take a giant allen so I

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.350 
this is gonna take a giant allen so I
have<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.400> go<00:03:37.489> find<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.790> Allen<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.180> I'll<00:03:38.239> be

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
have to go find that Allen and I'll be

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.839 
have to go find that Allen and I'll be
right<00:03:38.480> back<00:03:38.739> okay<00:03:39.739> so<00:03:39.800> now<00:03:40.069> I'm<00:03:40.190> gonna<00:03:40.280> tighten

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
right back okay so now I'm gonna tighten

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.620 
right back okay so now I'm gonna tighten
up<00:03:41.349> this<00:03:42.349> using<00:03:42.800> this<00:03:42.920> 8<00:03:43.190> millimeter<00:03:43.640> allen

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
up this using this 8 millimeter allen

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.600 
up this using this 8 millimeter allen
and<00:03:45.340> with<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:47.290> 16<00:03:48.290> millimeter<00:03:48.610> backing

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
and with the 16 millimeter backing

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.750 
and with the 16 millimeter backing
wrench<00:03:50.590> let's<00:03:51.590> see<00:03:51.709> if<00:03:51.769> I<00:03:51.830> can<00:03:51.920> get<00:03:52.010> this<00:03:52.160> up<00:03:52.370> to

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.610 

25<00:03:56.200> Newton<00:03:57.200> meters<00:03:58.269> okay<00:03:59.269> there<00:03:59.510> it<00:03:59.599> is<00:03:59.780> now

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
25 Newton meters okay there it is now

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.089 
25 Newton meters okay there it is now
this<00:04:00.860> is<00:04:01.010> off<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:01.190> little<00:04:01.549> bit<00:04:01.700> but<00:04:02.239> I<00:04:02.269> believe

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
this is off a little bit but I believe

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.259 
this is off a little bit but I believe
that<00:04:04.099> I'll<00:04:04.220> be<00:04:04.340> able<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.549> turn<00:04:04.700> that<00:04:04.970> because

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
that I'll be able to turn that because

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.940 
that I'll be able to turn that because
it's<00:04:05.450> ice<00:04:05.599> elastically<00:04:06.700> mounted<00:04:07.700> on<00:04:07.849> here<00:04:08.950> so

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
it's ice elastically mounted on here so

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.729 
it's ice elastically mounted on here so
yeah<00:04:10.130> I<00:04:10.160> can<00:04:10.489> actually<00:04:11.140> turn<00:04:12.140> that<00:04:12.349> to<00:04:12.530> get<00:04:12.620> it

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
yeah I can actually turn that to get it

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.599 
yeah I can actually turn that to get it
into<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.130> correct<00:04:13.400> rotation<00:04:15.190> it<00:04:16.190> just<00:04:16.400> takes

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
into the correct rotation it just takes

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.210 
into the correct rotation it just takes
a<00:04:16.700> little<00:04:16.790> bit<00:04:16.940> of<00:04:17.000> work<00:04:17.829> okay<00:04:18.829> so<00:04:19.010> I'm<00:04:19.130> gonna

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
a little bit of work okay so I'm gonna

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
do the other side and then I'll come

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.480 
do the other side and then I'll come
back<00:04:20.810> and<00:04:21.019> put<00:04:21.139> the<00:04:21.200> handlebars<00:04:21.560> on<00:04:21.769> okay<00:04:22.460> I

back and put the handlebars on okay I
have<00:04:22.790> the<00:04:22.940> risers<00:04:23.300> in<00:04:23.450> place<00:04:23.810> now<00:04:24.020> torque<00:04:24.440> down

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
have the risers in place now torque down

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.129 
have the risers in place now torque down
to<00:04:24.740> 25<00:04:25.160> Newton<00:04:25.550> meters<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:26.120> have<00:04:26.750> them<00:04:26.870> aligned

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
to 25 Newton meters I have them aligned

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.550 
to 25 Newton meters I have them aligned
I'm<00:04:27.979> ready<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.430> start<00:04:28.639> installing<00:04:29.000> the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
going to do is just put the brackets on

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.550 
going to do is just put the brackets on
and<00:04:35.530> just<00:04:36.530> finger<00:04:36.770> tighten<00:04:37.010> them<00:04:37.220> and<00:04:38.410> so<00:04:39.410> I'll

and just finger tighten them and so I'll

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.890 
and just finger tighten them and so I'll
do<00:04:39.710> that<00:04:39.740> on<00:04:39.860> both<00:04:40.100> brackets<00:04:40.460> and<00:04:41.889> then<00:04:43.900> I'm

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
do that on both brackets and then I'm

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.840 
do that on both brackets and then I'm
going<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:45.410> align<00:04:45.950> them<00:04:46.100> to<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.370> marks<00:04:46.639> I<00:04:46.760> had

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
going to align them to the marks I had

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.840 
going to align them to the marks I had
made<00:04:47.000> earlier<00:04:47.919> so<00:04:48.919> I<00:04:48.950> have<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.250> handlebars<00:04:49.639> in

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
made earlier so I have the handlebars in

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.480 
made earlier so I have the handlebars in
the<00:04:49.940> correct<00:04:50.800> original<00:04:51.800> position<00:04:52.310> so<00:04:54.340> I'll<00:04:55.340> do

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
the correct original position so I'll do

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.940 
the correct original position so I'll do
that<00:04:55.520> and<00:04:55.700> then<00:04:56.030> I'll<00:04:56.120> torque<00:04:56.510> it<00:04:56.660> down<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:57.289> 25

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
that and then I'll torque it down to 25

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.890 
that and then I'll torque it down to 25
Newton<00:04:58.310> meters

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.350 

so<00:05:05.900> I'm<00:05:05.990> trying<00:05:06.259> to<00:05:06.290> get<00:05:06.470> this<00:05:07.360> centered

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
so I'm trying to get this centered

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.460 
so I'm trying to get this centered
properly<00:05:10.780> and<00:05:13.780> they<00:05:14.780> should<00:05:15.020> be<00:05:15.139> about<00:05:15.289> like

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
properly and they should be about like

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.340 
properly and they should be about like
that<00:05:16.570> so<00:05:17.570> what<00:05:17.690> I'm<00:05:17.750> going<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:17.900> do<00:05:18.020> is<00:05:18.199> I'm

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
that so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.439 
that so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:05:18.560> to<00:05:18.800> go<00:05:19.490> ahead<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:19.940> while<00:05:20.090> I'm<00:05:20.180> aligned

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
going to go ahead and while I'm aligned

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:21.909 
going to go ahead and while I'm aligned
in<00:05:20.570> it<00:05:20.690> I'll<00:05:20.810> tighten<00:05:21.050> it<00:05:21.169> down<00:05:21.199> to<00:05:21.289> 25<00:05:21.590> Newton

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
in it I'll tighten it down to 25 Newton

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.980 
in it I'll tighten it down to 25 Newton
meters<00:05:22.280> and<00:05:22.520> then<00:05:23.330> we'll<00:05:23.690> come<00:05:23.840> back<00:05:23.870> and

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
meters and then we'll come back and

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.850 
meters and then we'll come back and
we'll<00:05:24.199> check<00:05:24.259> to<00:05:24.470> make<00:05:24.680> sure<00:05:24.740> everything

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
we'll check to make sure everything

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.920 
we'll check to make sure everything
clears<00:05:25.550> here<00:05:25.880> on<00:05:26.030> all<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.330> electrical<00:05:26.720> wiring

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
clears here on all the electrical wiring

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.529 
clears here on all the electrical wiring
so<00:05:27.320> we<00:05:27.470> will<00:05:27.889> be<00:05:27.979> right<00:05:28.160> back<00:05:28.310> okay<00:05:29.150> so<00:05:29.210> I<00:05:29.330> have

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
so we will be right back okay so I have

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.420 
so we will be right back okay so I have
the<00:05:29.660> riser<00:05:29.870> installed<00:05:30.320> 25<00:05:30.800> Newton<00:05:31.130> meters

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
the riser installed 25 Newton meters

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.510 
the riser installed 25 Newton meters
tighten<00:05:32.419> these<00:05:32.509> up<00:05:32.570> evenly<00:05:33.110> on<00:05:33.229> each<00:05:33.259> side<00:05:33.650> so

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
tighten these up evenly on each side so

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.580 
tighten these up evenly on each side so
this<00:05:34.729> is<00:05:34.910> all<00:05:35.060> good<00:05:35.300> now<00:05:35.479> so<00:05:36.199> what<00:05:36.320> I<00:05:36.380> want<00:05:36.560> to
