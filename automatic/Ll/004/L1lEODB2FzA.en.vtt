groundwater<00:00:50.969> believe<00:00:51.239> your<00:00:51.449> ground<00:00:51.690> water<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.619 
groundwater believe your ground water to
the<00:00:52.289> next<00:00:52.710> generation<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.760> generation

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the next generation so this generation

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.139 
the next generation so this generation
will<00:00:54.860> not<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> groundwork<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:56.820> some

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
will not have a groundwork for some

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.380 
will not have a groundwork for some
reason<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.530> still<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.859> 2<00:00:59.219> 360<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.149> ps3

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
reason so we still have 2 360 and ps3

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.810 
reason so we still have 2 360 and ps3
we'll<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> play<00:01:01.500> without<00:01:01.829> round<00:01:02.370> wall<00:01:02.609> so

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
we'll have to play without round wall so

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.359 
we'll have to play without round wall so
99<00:01:03.300> will<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> game<00:01:04.320> only<00:01:04.500> 66<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
so why did I have to make huge maps for

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.950 
so why did I have to make huge maps for
98<00:01:30.869> 99<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.619> don't<00:01:31.860> understand<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.460> even<00:01:33.180> he

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
98 99 I don't understand and even he

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.649 
98 99 I don't understand and even he
just<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:34.619> confusing<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.250> me<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.579> me<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
just is really confusing to me to me the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.179 
just is really confusing to me to me the
match<00:01:36.930> should<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.290> been<00:01:37.439> much<00:01:37.740> smaller

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
match should have been much smaller

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.100 
match should have been much smaller
that's<00:01:38.850> what<00:01:39.090> everyone<00:01:39.420> likes<00:01:39.630> about<00:01:39.780> cold

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
that's what everyone likes about cold

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179

disposed<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.200> still<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.009> game<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.489> every

there<00:02:13.690> are<00:02:13.870> problems<00:02:14.260> with<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.860> spawns<00:02:15.160> and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
there are problems with the spawns and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.070 
there are problems with the spawns and
even<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:16.209> one<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.480> think<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:16.780> one<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
even in this one I think this one is the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.530 
even in this one I think this one is the
worst<00:02:17.319> worst<00:02:17.739> yet<00:02:18.160> because<00:02:18.910> there's<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.330> many

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
worst worst yet because there's so many

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.600 
worst worst yet because there's so many
he<00:02:19.780> was<00:02:19.930> born<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.319> right<00:02:20.650> behind<00:02:20.890> me<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.340> stuff

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
he was born in right behind me and stuff

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.760 
he was born in right behind me and stuff
like<00:02:22.120> administered<00:02:22.900> when<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.170> first<00:02:23.380> started

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
like administered when I first started

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.990 
like administered when I first started
playing<00:02:23.860> this<00:02:24.040> game<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.400> wasn't<00:02:24.700> used<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.940> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
playing this game I wasn't used to the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.270 
playing this game I wasn't used to the
spawns<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.569> stuff<00:02:25.780> but<00:02:26.590> that'll<00:02:26.920> mean<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.069> have

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
spawns and stuff but that'll mean I have

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.360 
spawns and stuff but that'll mean I have
to<00:02:27.430> get<00:02:27.580> shot<00:02:27.880> in<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.150> back<00:02:28.440> 24-7<00:02:29.440> because<00:02:30.040> so

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
to get shot in the back 24-7 because so

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.580 
to get shot in the back 24-7 because so
many<00:02:30.489> people<00:02:30.790> just<00:02:30.970> when<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.390> spawn<00:02:31.780> on<00:02:31.989> my<00:02:32.260> flag

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
many people just when I spawn on my flag

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.830 
many people just when I spawn on my flag
in<00:02:32.830> domination<00:02:33.280> I've<00:02:33.580> run<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.150> 30<00:02:34.450> meters

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
in domination I've run like 30 meters

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.309 
in domination I've run like 30 meters
and<00:02:35.019> my<00:02:35.680> enemy<00:02:36.190> spawns<00:02:36.640> in<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.450> same<00:02:37.720> exactly

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319

around 20 meters I think it's just shoot
me<00:02:43.269> in<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.360> back<00:02:43.420> now<00:02:44.019> should<00:02:44.200> not<00:02:44.349> happen

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
they just should spawn in the place with

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.660 
they just should spawn in the place with
no<00:02:46.840> one<00:02:46.989> around<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.560> they<00:02:48.310> shouldn't<00:02:48.580> you

I<00:06:06.719> just<00:06:06.960> like<00:06:07.110> about<00:06:07.229> the<00:06:07.409> game<00:06:07.560> is<00:06:07.710> lag<00:06:08.070> yes

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490

life<00:06:08.880> is<00:06:08.909> of<00:06:09.120> course<00:06:09.330> back<00:06:09.719> just<00:06:10.080> like<00:06:10.169> in<00:06:10.289> any

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
life is of course back just like in any

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.189 
life is of course back just like in any
other<00:06:11.070> previous<00:06:11.699> Koji<00:06:12.090> and<00:06:12.270> I<00:06:12.780> think<00:06:12.990> this<00:06:13.080> is

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
other previous Koji and I think this is

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.830 
other previous Koji and I think this is
the<00:06:13.289> worst<00:06:13.500> one<00:06:13.710> yet<00:06:13.740> and<00:06:14.190> of<00:06:14.940> course<00:06:14.969> they<00:06:15.539> say

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
the worst one yet and of course they say

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.629 
the worst one yet and of course they say
you<00:06:15.900> didn't<00:06:16.289> remove<00:06:16.620> theater<00:06:17.099> mode<00:06:17.250> and<00:06:17.610> it

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
you didn't remove theater mode and it

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.270 
you didn't remove theater mode and it
will<00:06:17.789> become<00:06:17.909> become<00:06:18.509> much<00:06:18.719> bear<00:06:18.990> I<00:06:19.440> can't<00:06:20.159> see

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
will become become much bear I can't see

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.339 
will become become much bear I can't see
change<00:06:20.550> and<00:06:20.820> the<00:06:21.570> biggest<00:06:21.870> problem<00:06:21.960> I<00:06:22.320> think

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349 
change and the biggest problem I think

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.040 
change and the biggest problem I think
is<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:22.919> lag<00:06:23.180> compensation<00:06:24.180> if<00:06:24.690> you<00:06:24.870> don't

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
is the lag compensation if you don't

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.390 
is the lag compensation if you don't
know<00:06:25.139> what<00:06:25.289> dies<00:06:25.469> it's<00:06:25.800> pretty<00:06:26.009> much<00:06:26.130> just

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
know what dies it's pretty much just

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.390 
know what dies it's pretty much just
this<00:06:26.969> example<00:06:27.930> imagine<00:06:28.680> if<00:06:29.009> you<00:06:29.099> show<00:06:29.340> you

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
this example imagine if you show you

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.589 
this example imagine if you show you
someone<00:06:29.729> and<00:06:29.940> they're<00:06:30.090> shooting<00:06:30.330> you<00:06:30.389> back

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
someone and they're shooting you back

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.420 
someone and they're shooting you back
and<00:06:30.870> then<00:06:31.349> you<00:06:31.440> decide<00:06:31.800> to<00:06:31.919> run<00:06:32.070> behind<00:06:32.250> a

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
and then you decide to run behind a

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.060 
and then you decide to run behind a
corner<00:06:32.639> and<00:06:32.969> then<00:06:33.630> you<00:06:33.719> die<00:06:33.930> like<00:06:34.169> you

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070

clearly<00:06:35.430> behind<00:06:35.580> the<00:06:35.760> corner<00:06:36.030> behind<00:06:36.150> a<00:06:36.420> wall

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
clearly behind the corner behind a wall

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.150 
clearly behind the corner behind a wall
and<00:06:37.050> then<00:06:37.320> you<00:06:37.410> think<00:06:37.620> what<00:06:37.710> the<00:06:37.830> fuck<00:06:38.040> you

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160

and then you think what the fuck you
know<00:06:38.280> he<00:06:38.400> didn't<00:06:38.880> warble<00:06:39.240> me<00:06:39.450> when<00:06:40.020> you<00:06:40.140> look

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.290

know he didn't warble me when you look
at<00:06:40.380> the<00:06:40.440> killcam<00:06:40.920> you<00:06:41.490> actually<00:06:41.760> can<00:06:41.940> see<00:06:42.180> it

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
at the killcam you actually can see it

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.380 
at the killcam you actually can see it
from<00:06:42.960> his<00:06:43.290> eyes<00:06:43.890> you<00:06:44.610> weren't<00:06:44.820> even<00:06:44.970> behind

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
from his eyes you weren't even behind

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.670 
from his eyes you weren't even behind
the<00:06:45.480> corner<00:06:45.840> you<00:06:45.930> were<00:06:46.020> still<00:06:46.230> in<00:06:46.320> front<00:06:46.590> of

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
the corner you were still in front of

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.890 
the corner you were still in front of
him<00:06:46.800> and<00:06:46.980> he<00:06:47.310> killed<00:06:47.610> you<00:06:47.790> before<00:06:48.330> you<00:06:48.750> ran

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
him and he killed you before you ran

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.440 
him and he killed you before you ran
past<00:06:49.140> the<00:06:49.320> wall<00:06:49.530> when<00:06:50.010> clearly<00:06:50.460> you<00:06:50.610> did<00:06:50.970> so

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
past the wall when clearly you did so

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.540 
past the wall when clearly you did so
that's<00:06:51.630> that's<00:06:51.840> lag<00:06:52.200> compensation<00:06:52.830> and<00:06:53.130> that
