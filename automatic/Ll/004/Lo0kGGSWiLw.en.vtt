00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.220
 in this video I want to think a little bit about 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.740
 what the numbers represent 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:15.240
 let's suppose someone wrote the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:17.670
 number 25 25 what it means 15 is 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.130
 in place of units literally 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.880
 represents five units 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.830
 this two is in the tens place is 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.859
 in the tens place 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.790
 and this is in the house of the units there 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.510
 represents two dozen that I want 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.110
 tell 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.440
 another way is to say that this 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.360
 this 2 represents two feet 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.680
 Let me write is two dozen 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:52.260
 plus five units 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:56.309
 Now what are two dozen? 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.879
 good you can imagine 10 as a block of 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.159
 ten things then you can imagine that 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.280
 here is a 10 left copy and paste this 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:11.310
 copy and paste will be the same thing 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.650
 You have your two dozen 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.049
 then a dozen and two tens 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:25.159
 Those are your two dozen and 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:27.659
 20 is five units but 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.049
 five units 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.189
 good if it is a unit represented by 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:46.549
 a vertical bar five units will 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:49.170
 Opinion 2 3 4 and 5 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:54.720
 these are different ways of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:59.640
 representing the same quantity 25 is 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:05.310
 equal to two dozen and five units 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.439
 the 2 is in the tens house the 5 is 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.780
 in the units house 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.110
 then two dozen plus five units 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.830
 you can see how two groups of 10 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:21.030
 the five units will be the same as 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:27.030
 what two sets of 10 is the same thing 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:29.460
 that 20 and here is equal to 5 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.310
 again are all ways to 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:37.440
 represent 25 you can see how two 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:42.030
 five units or tens # 25 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:47.130
 because these two are two dozen and 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.980
 represents 20 but five units 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.640
 correct until the next video 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.640
 went
