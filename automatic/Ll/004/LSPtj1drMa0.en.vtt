00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:10.280
 ok to see if we're from my routine 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:13.009
 arm and so my week 4 volume is this 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.250
 time is my last week of week 5 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.710
 of increasing more weight to each exercise 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.539
 of the muscle group in this in this 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.990
 occasion on this occasion I am working 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.179
 the biceps that I wanted with him cover 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.679
 the recipe reminds you that there are many 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.410
 mistakes that people know how to commit 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.759
 they move their elbows a lot like they 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.220
 I will show below more 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.460
 forward in the video always remember 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.010
 concentrate and do well in weight and not 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.050
 try to balance t by inertia you go 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.270
 to balance a bit because the base weight 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.570
 front and you look a little but you do not 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.550
 balances too much then we are 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.830
 working after I'm going to put triceps 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.320
 also in my training and good 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.150
 let's go to the second series I do in 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.500
 this heating first at two 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.620
 heating series already after 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.330
 four series of muscular construction 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.089
 that approximately 28 to two 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.399
 repetitions thousands and see how they see well 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.550
 blocks the blocked elbows and rises and 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:13.700
 you go up, you do not have to move 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.530
 in simple movements it works your 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.960
 bikes you should feel that you work a maximum 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.530
 not your shoulders but your biceps then 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.600
 forward you take chest and turn if 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.850
 unlock the elbows as much as I can 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.860
 I know it is difficult and therefore to be 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.500
 less heavy try it block your elbows 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.620
 and go up remembering to find 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.000
 also down a bit this and be also 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.470
 to work some secondary muscles 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.910
 similarly when I do shoulders for 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.860
 example in military interest I like 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.440
 go down to the chest to work 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.260
 also the triceps we're still there for 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.440
 less a little but 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.960
 ready then finished this exercise and 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.730
 I'm going to the second exercise that is one 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.590
 of my favorites that is concentrated on 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.590
 Course centered on more inclined 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.140
 once we have finished this exercise 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.020
 I do four series of 8 to 12 flies the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.780
 boat tilted as you can see here with 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.160
 5 degrees is fine little more less less 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.130
 it does not matter the thing is I wanted to unlock 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.160
 your elbows as you see and slowly the 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.250
 movement we do not hurry we leave 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.620
 there we find biceps and we go down 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.600
 same way breathing is important 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.880
 indispensable do not do so fast look 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.770
 there is something with a weight that is small and 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.590
 however , I find it hard to work because 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.870
 I do concentrate and it really works 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.480
 this exercise is one of the best 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.000
 take out chest the erect back remember 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.000
 as always and without another help 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.220
 always to your elbows they must be attached 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.260
 analyze other people how they do this 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.019
 exercise releases what I talk about many 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.330
 they move their head too much their back 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.370
 their forearms as they were rather 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.930
 working men then you already know to 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.040
 what I mean 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.160
 we finished this exercise of doing 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.019
 repetitions and we go to the preacher one 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.959
 of my favorites in the same way but 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:09.200
 with closed grip we already said of the ass 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.230
 open recipe and now we're going to be 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.120
 closed the same way 2 8 to 12 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.250
 repetitions 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.019
 remember against the wind you say a 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.510
 normal speed going down well and going up 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.060
 well then so I mean do not use a 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.769
 weight too big because 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.200
 if you're not going to swing too much 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.170
 back then what we want most is 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.310
 isolate the biceps work 100% 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.310
 Eyes not another muscle 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.170
 no more and the last one is the one worth the 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.840
 last repetition is the one that is worth 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.300
 then it's something very simple guys now 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.440
 if we finish this arm exercise 3 of 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.450
 Arm exercises we finished 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.410
 and here below we go with press 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.570
 French but inclined forgiveness declined 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.160
 to block the elbows and not sacrifice 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.870
 much elbows then you block your 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.580
 known 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.830
 we block the elbows and only the 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.810
 triceps look there are many people that 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.400
 they totally move their entire arm rather 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.550
 it seems that they are doing pulóver 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.170
 then it is not pulóver is press french 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.000
 ok then we continue and go down to your forehead 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.740
 blocking your elbows and not stretching your 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.020
 arms completely because if not your 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.750
 elbows are going to express a lot and not 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.030
 we want that 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.920
 just as something warming am 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.040
 heating all here right now 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.050
 repetitions warm first and now if 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.810
 I go with the weight that is good 20 kilos 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.510
 per side 40 kilos I'm moving forward I 'm going 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.250
 do 8 to 10 repetitions 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.180
 if I can two more and pulled two more is 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.000
 well the same way blocks the elbows and 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.520
 went down to the forehead remember if you put 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.260
 a lot of weight you have to be very good and that 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.370
 a partner is behind you caretaker 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.680
 because this exercise is a bit 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.920
 dangerous and do not forget to do it in 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.510
 bank declined to protect your elbows 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.580
 okay 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.250
 is the best exercise for the triceps 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.250
 the best that I can guarantee to me 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:18.059
 and a mass that remembers that everything is in 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.099
 the mind connection mind muscle does not 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:22.679
 forget about that connect your mind muscle 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:24.509
 now we go with pulley extensions is 

00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:27.419
 very good remember to put your thumb 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.610
 neutral grip to move the wrists 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.739
 because if you close all your hands with the 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.229
 finger down the finger the thumb of 

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:36.479
 down you will see your dolls then what 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.379
 what I do is the neutral grip for not 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.019
 move your dolls 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:42.569
 if you see how they move only the triceps and 

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:46.559
 the dolls are straight and we hit two 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:48.239
 things the body that excellent now 

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:50.069
 come on with this is my favorite 

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:53.369
 extensions like in horns also like 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:55.289
 kick then look at sticking your code 

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:57.360
 the mind always sticks to the body 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:59.560
 elbow the body only work the triceps 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.560
 and you see 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.940
 nothing moves where I do not swing 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.950
 I'm doing like a lot of back 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.630
 confuse this exercise with the rowing 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.000
 back because they move everything up to their 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.040
 back here only the triceps work 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.530
 remember that it is very indispensable that 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.910
 this exercise is very good for the 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:20.760
 posterior head of the triceps 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.850
 you can support yourself at any bank in 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.620
 a shallow one is in a dumbbell 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.060
 so that you have a semi position 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.210
 erect, look how you are in the same way 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.280
 about the sites they work I'm not 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.020
 balancing the shoulders nothing is very 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.940
 good to develop your vices 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.920
 try it and with little weight I do it 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.400
 because it's hard to do with a technique 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.560
 It costs a slope and without sacrificing we go 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.330
 and that was the last exercise equally 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.880
 I do four to three series of the Yaquis 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.010
 and that was all for today we see ourselves in the 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.490
 my next workout routine 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.490
 volume
