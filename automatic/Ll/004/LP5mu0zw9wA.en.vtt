00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.230 
know there are a couple of us you can
run<00:00:15.599> but<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.260> kind<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.529> going<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.710> be<00:00:16.770> the

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
run but this is kind of going to be the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.050 
run but this is kind of going to be the
best<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.750> guess<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.230> could<00:00:19.380> say<00:00:19.670> well<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.730> prefer

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
best I guess you could say well I prefer

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.900 
best I guess you could say well I prefer
to<00:00:21.090> run<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:22.109> think<00:00:22.710> especially<00:00:23.430> if<00:00:23.820> you're

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
to run and I think especially if you're

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.340 
to run and I think especially if you're
not<00:00:24.000> very<00:00:24.180> good<00:00:24.240> at<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> game<00:00:24.480> or<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.199> don't

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
not very good at the game or you don't

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.900 
not very good at the game or you don't
really<00:00:25.470> understand<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.279> should<00:00:26.490> too<00:00:26.699> I

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
really understand it you should too I

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.839 
really understand it you should too I
definitely<00:00:27.779> run<00:00:27.960> with<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> carbine<00:00:28.849> carbines

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
definitely run with the carbine carbines

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.830 
definitely run with the carbine carbines
great<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.300> all<00:00:30.390> situations<00:00:30.980> now<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.040> shotgun

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
great in all situations now the shotgun

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.299 
great in all situations now the shotgun
shotgun<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.140> very<00:00:34.320> high<00:00:34.469> damage<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.100> it's

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
shotgun is very high damage and it's

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.520 
shotgun is very high damage and it's
extremely<00:00:35.969> good<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.329> close<00:00:36.540> quarters<00:00:36.989> you

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
extremely good in close quarters you

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.410 
extremely good in close quarters you
know<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.670> doesn't<00:00:38.940> really<00:00:39.000> suit<00:00:39.239> my

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
know but that doesn't really suit my

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.080 
know but that doesn't really suit my
playing<00:00:39.690> style<00:00:39.809> well<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.950> that's<00:00:41.489> not<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> gun

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
playing style well so that's not a gun

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.110 
playing style well so that's not a gun
you'll<00:00:42.270> see<00:00:42.450> me<00:00:42.600> using<00:00:43.520> now<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.579> smart<00:00:44.940> pistol

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
you'll see me using now the smart pistol

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.020 
you'll see me using now the smart pistol
is<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.989> pretty<00:00:46.710> interesting<00:00:47.070> gun<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.910> know

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
is a pretty interesting gun you know

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.369 
is a pretty interesting gun you know
considering<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> fact<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.170> lock

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
considering the fact that it can lock

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.130 
considering the fact that it can lock
onto<00:00:49.559> people<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.460> shorter<00:00:50.760> range<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.930> it's

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
onto people in a shorter range but it's

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.529 
onto people in a shorter range but it's
just<00:00:52.289> really<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.590> my<00:00:52.800> style<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.430> find<00:00:54.300> that

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
just really not my style I find that

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.889 
just really not my style I find that
people<00:00:55.640> rely<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.910> too<00:00:57.059> much<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
people rely on it too much for the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.540 
people rely on it too much for the
lock-on<00:00:58.289> mechanism<00:00:58.890> when<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.250> could<00:00:59.399> easily

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
lock-on mechanism when you could easily

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.360 
lock-on mechanism when you could easily
just<00:00:59.850> shoot<00:01:00.059> people<00:01:00.359> with<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.800> especially<00:01:01.800> if

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
just shoot people with it especially if

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.789 
just shoot people with it especially if
you<00:01:02.460> have<00:01:02.489> decent<00:01:02.910> aim<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.470> I<00:01:04.470> find<00:01:04.739> myself

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
you have decent aim and I find myself

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.380 
you have decent aim and I find myself
out<00:01:05.159> out<00:01:05.339> gunning<00:01:05.760> people<00:01:06.030> with<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> very

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
out out gunning people with it very

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.070 
out out gunning people with it very
easily<00:01:06.770> it's<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> bad

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
easily it's really just it's not a bad

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.469 
easily it's really just it's not a bad
gun<00:01:10.350> by<00:01:10.530> any<00:01:10.680> means<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.159> not<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:12.240> best

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
gun by any means but it's not the best

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.289 
gun by any means but it's not the best
to<00:01:13.080> use<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.770> definitely<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.310> have<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
to use you definitely have to have a

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.060 
to use you definitely have to have a
certain<00:01:15.479> playing<00:01:15.900> style<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> use<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.799> i<00:01:16.830> guess

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
certain playing style to use it i guess

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.770 
certain playing style to use it i guess
you<00:01:17.220> could<00:01:17.340> say<00:01:20.360> now<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.500> SMG<00:01:22.500> uh<00:01:23.210> I<00:01:24.210> don't

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
you could say now the SMG uh I don't

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.740 
you could say now the SMG uh I don't
really<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.380> SMG<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.549> high<00:01:26.820> fiery<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.600> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
really like the SMG is a high fiery in a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.109 
really like the SMG is a high fiery in a
40<00:01:28.080> round<00:01:28.290> mag<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.400> not<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.850> great<00:01:30.060> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119

damaged and again it's kind of one of

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.999 
damaged and again it's kind of one of
those<00:01:32.909> guns<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.570> doesn't<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:34.650> suit<00:01:34.860> my

sniping<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.160> way<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> go<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.729> titanfall

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
sniping is the way to go and titanfall

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.140 
sniping is the way to go and titanfall
I'm<00:02:09.599> sure<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.470> know<00:02:10.700> people<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.819> are<00:02:11.940> very

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
I'm sure you know people that are very

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.280 
I'm sure you know people that are very
good<00:02:12.300> snipers

good snipers
a<00:02:13.319> pretty<00:02:13.650> decent<00:02:14.069> sniper<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.519> know<00:02:14.640> like<00:02:14.790> I

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:14.969 
a pretty decent sniper you know like I

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.569 
a pretty decent sniper you know like I
got<00:02:15.150> kills<00:02:15.450> with<00:02:15.629> it<00:02:15.750> but<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.049> not<00:02:16.579> really

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
got kills with it but just not really

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.240 
got kills with it but just not really
what<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:17.849> want<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.209> use<00:02:18.799> so<00:02:19.799> with<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.010> anti

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
what I want to use so with the anti

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.009 
what I want to use so with the anti
tight<00:02:20.519> and<00:02:20.670> weapon<00:02:20.939> definitely<00:02:21.540> go<00:02:21.659> with<00:02:21.689> the

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
tight and weapon definitely go with the

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.209 
tight and weapon definitely go with the
Sidewinder<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:22.680> kind<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.099> no-brainer

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
Sidewinder it's kind of a no-brainer

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.890 
Sidewinder it's kind of a no-brainer
over<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.819> heavy<00:02:23.969> rocket<00:02:24.209> because<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.719> heavy

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
over the heavy rocket because the heavy

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.940 
over the heavy rocket because the heavy
rocket<00:02:25.200> locks<00:02:25.829> on<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:28.349> locking<00:02:28.799> on

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
rocket locks on and the locking on

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.089 
rocket locks on and the locking on
pretty<00:02:29.819> much<00:02:30.000> alerts<00:02:30.390> tighten<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:31.530> shows<00:02:31.920> you

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
pretty much alerts tighten it shows you

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.559 
pretty much alerts tighten it shows you
exactly<00:02:32.220> where<00:02:32.819> you're<00:02:32.939> getting<00:02:33.090> locked<00:02:33.390> on

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
exactly where you're getting locked on

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.050 
exactly where you're getting locked on
from<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.829> they<00:02:34.920> can<00:02:35.069> easily<00:02:35.340> turn<00:02:35.489> on<00:02:35.640> just<00:02:35.909> get

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
from so they can easily turn on just get

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.780 
from so they can easily turn on just get
you<00:02:36.150> with<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.019> sidewinder<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.680> obviously<00:02:38.040> it

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
you with a sidewinder it obviously it

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.640 
you with a sidewinder it obviously it
creates<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.329> bit<00:02:39.480> more<00:02:39.629> mystery<00:02:40.079> I<00:02:40.260> guess<00:02:40.530> you

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
creates a bit more mystery I guess you

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.589 
creates a bit more mystery I guess you
could<00:02:40.769> say<00:02:40.980> they<00:02:41.370> kind<00:02:41.579> of<00:02:41.609> have<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.760> turn

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
could say they kind of have to turn

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.649 
could say they kind of have to turn
around<00:02:42.719> and<00:02:42.989> look<00:02:43.109> for<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:44.819> I<00:02:45.420> just

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
around and look for you and I just

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.599 
around and look for you and I just
prefer<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.989> because<00:02:46.159> you<00:02:47.159> can<00:02:47.280> kind<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.459> more

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
prefer it because you can kind of more

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.440 
prefer it because you can kind of more
sneak<00:02:47.939> up<00:02:48.120> on<00:02:48.299> them<00:02:48.450> yeah<00:02:48.900> on<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.709> Titan<00:02:50.069> and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
sneak up on them yeah on the Titan and

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.210 
sneak up on them yeah on the Titan and
if<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.599> hit<00:02:51.810> all<00:02:51.989> your<00:02:52.109> Sidewinder<00:02:52.530> shots<00:02:52.919> it

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
if you hit all your Sidewinder shots it

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.610 
if you hit all your Sidewinder shots it
really<00:02:53.579> is<00:02:53.819> gonna<00:02:54.000> damage<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.720> Titan<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.139> lot<00:02:55.379> you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
really is gonna damage a Titan a lot you

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.569 
really is gonna damage a Titan a lot you
can<00:02:55.829> destroy<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> Titan<00:02:57.090> with<00:02:57.209> two<00:02:57.659> or<00:02:57.810> three

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
can destroy a Titan with two or three

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.300 
can destroy a Titan with two or three
mags<00:02:59.579> of<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.209> sidewinder<00:03:00.799> it's<00:03:01.799> really<00:03:01.919> good<00:03:02.189> if

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
mags of a sidewinder it's really good if

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.250 
mags of a sidewinder it's really good if
Titans<00:03:02.939> in<00:03:03.090> another<00:03:03.329> Titan<00:03:03.689> battle<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.139> can

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
Titans in another Titan battle you can

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.679 
Titans in another Titan battle you can
kind<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.500> just<00:03:04.560> catch<00:03:05.340> them<00:03:05.430> by<00:03:05.579> surprise<00:03:05.689> and

use<00:05:55.730> the<00:05:55.880> minion<00:05:56.120> detector<00:05:56.540> because<00:05:56.720> you<00:05:56.840> can

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
use the minion detector because you can

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.990 
use the minion detector because you can
kind<00:05:57.110> of<00:05:57.140> figure<00:05:57.290> out<00:05:57.500> who<00:05:57.740> in<00:05:57.980> that<00:05:58.700> group

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
kind of figure out who in that group

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.460 
kind of figure out who in that group
isn't<00:05:59.240> a<00:05:59.600> minion<00:05:59.900> and<00:06:01.690> it's<00:06:02.690> just<00:06:03.200> a<00:06:03.290> lot

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
isn't a minion and it's just a lot

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.090 
isn't a minion and it's just a lot
easier<00:06:03.740> and<00:06:04.690> yeah<00:06:05.690> and<00:06:05.840> when<00:06:06.050> the<00:06:06.200> spawns<00:06:06.650> flip

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
easier and yeah and when the spawns flip

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.460 
easier and yeah and when the spawns flip
you'll<00:06:08.000> see<00:06:08.300> new<00:06:08.690> minions<00:06:09.020> spawning<00:06:09.350> a

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
you'll see new minions spawning a

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.690 
you'll see new minions spawning a
different<00:06:09.800> area<00:06:10.040> and<00:06:10.190> that's<00:06:10.310> how<00:06:10.430> you<00:06:10.490> know

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
different area and that's how you know

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.210 
different area and that's how you know
that<00:06:10.990> there's<00:06:11.990> a<00:06:12.080> good<00:06:12.230> chance<00:06:12.470> the<00:06:12.860> pilots

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
that there's a good chance the pilots

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.680 
that there's a good chance the pilots
are<00:06:13.310> also<00:06:13.430> spawning<00:06:13.850> in<00:06:14.060> a<00:06:14.120> different<00:06:14.420> area<00:06:14.570> as

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
are also spawning in a different area as

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.200 
are also spawning in a different area as
well<00:06:14.840> probably<00:06:15.380> with<00:06:15.500> those<00:06:15.680> minions<00:06:16.000> so<00:06:17.000> it

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
well probably with those minions so it

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.590 
well probably with those minions so it
keeps<00:06:17.630> you<00:06:17.930> from<00:06:18.230> dying<00:06:19.010> in<00:06:19.430> that<00:06:20.330> kind<00:06:20.570> of

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
keeps you from dying in that kind of

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.980 
keeps you from dying in that kind of
situation<00:06:21.550> which<00:06:22.550> honestly<00:06:22.880> can<00:06:23.450> be<00:06:23.600> quite

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
situation which honestly can be quite

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.330 
situation which honestly can be quite
key<00:06:24.290> if<00:06:24.440> you're<00:06:24.620> trying<00:06:24.770> to<00:06:24.860> be<00:06:24.980> going<00:06:25.190> on<00:06:25.250> the

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
key if you're trying to be going on the

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.870 
key if you're trying to be going on the
killstreak<00:06:26.320> now<00:06:27.320> I<00:06:27.380> also<00:06:27.800> like<00:06:28.220> warp<00:06:28.670> fall

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
killstreak now I also like warp fall

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.000 
killstreak now I also like warp fall
transmitter<00:06:29.390> and<00:06:30.230> what<00:06:30.380> this<00:06:30.530> does<00:06:30.590> is<00:06:30.980> this

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
transmitter and what this does is this

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.330 
transmitter and what this does is this
makes<00:06:31.490> your<00:06:32.120> titanfall<00:06:32.600> a<00:06:33.140> lot<00:06:33.710> quicker

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
makes your titanfall a lot quicker

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.270 
makes your titanfall a lot quicker
and<00:06:35.720> why<00:06:36.720> this<00:06:36.780> is<00:06:37.080> important<00:06:37.560> is<00:06:37.620> because<00:06:37.680> if

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
and why this is important is because if

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.310 
and why this is important is because if
you<00:06:38.550> can<00:06:38.699> be<00:06:38.820> the<00:06:38.940> first<00:06:38.970> person<00:06:39.360> to<00:06:39.690> get<00:06:40.020> your

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
you can be the first person to get your

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.260 
you can be the first person to get your
Titan<00:06:41.210> that's<00:06:42.210> really<00:06:42.630> going<00:06:42.750> to<00:06:42.810> do<00:06:43.110> a<00:06:43.320> lot

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
Titan that's really going to do a lot

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:50.030 
Titan that's really going to do a lot
for<00:06:45.270> um<00:06:45.710> for<00:06:46.710> your<00:06:47.280> game<00:06:48.050> when<00:06:49.050> you<00:06:49.350> get<00:06:50.010> your

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
for um for your game when you get your

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.640 
for um for your game when you get your
Titan<00:06:50.400> first<00:06:50.639> you're<00:06:51.120> going<00:06:51.300> to<00:06:51.389> be

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
Titan first you're going to be

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.840 
Titan first you're going to be
immediately<00:06:52.650> running<00:06:53.010> towards<00:06:53.400> their<00:06:53.550> spawn

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850 
immediately running towards their spawn

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.580 
immediately running towards their spawn
you<00:06:54.330> know<00:06:54.449> you're<00:06:54.660> going<00:06:54.750> to<00:06:54.810> be<00:06:54.870> lightened

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
you know you're going to be lightened

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.920 
you know you're going to be lightened
people<00:06:56.070> up<00:06:56.300> it's<00:06:57.300> going<00:06:57.510> to<00:06:57.540> be<00:06:57.690> absolutely

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
people up it's going to be absolutely

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.070 
people up it's going to be absolutely
nuts<00:06:58.830> and<00:06:59.240> when<00:07:00.240> that<00:07:00.419> happens<00:07:00.449> your

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
nuts and when that happens your

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.450 
nuts and when that happens your
teammates<00:07:01.530> are<00:07:01.710> also<00:07:01.889> going<00:07:02.220> to<00:07:02.280> be<00:07:02.370> doing

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
teammates are also going to be doing

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.250 
teammates are also going to be doing
better<00:07:02.760> when<00:07:03.540> your<00:07:03.660> teammates<00:07:03.990> are<00:07:04.080> doing

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.260 
better when your teammates are doing

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.420 
better when your teammates are doing
better<00:07:04.380> they're<00:07:04.680> going<00:07:04.830> to<00:07:04.889> be<00:07:04.979> getting<00:07:05.130> their

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430 
better they're going to be getting their

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.000 
better they're going to be getting their
Titans<00:07:05.820> quicker<00:07:06.229> so<00:07:07.229> they<00:07:07.500> could<00:07:07.710> get<00:07:07.860> their

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.010 
Titans quicker so they could get their

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.250 
Titans quicker so they could get their
Titans<00:07:08.370> with<00:07:08.669> you<00:07:08.940> and<00:07:09.750> you<00:07:09.840> could<00:07:09.990> end<00:07:10.139> up

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260 
Titans with you and you could end up

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.219 
Titans with you and you could end up
with<00:07:10.320> pretty<00:07:10.710> much<00:07:10.830> a<00:07:10.979> team<00:07:11.220> of<00:07:11.460> titans<00:07:12.229> before

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:13.229 
with pretty much a team of titans before

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:16.810 
with pretty much a team of titans before
their<00:07:13.620> guys<00:07:13.830> can<00:07:14.130> start<00:07:14.340> getting<00:07:14.430> Titans<00:07:14.970> and

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:16.820 
their guys can start getting Titans and

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.490 
their guys can start getting Titans and
what<00:07:17.820> you<00:07:17.910> could<00:07:18.030> also<00:07:18.210> get<00:07:18.660> is<00:07:18.900> you<00:07:19.200> can<00:07:19.380> get

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 
what you could also get is you can get

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.230 
what you could also get is you can get
your<00:07:19.650> damage<00:07:20.040> cor<00:07:20.340> before<00:07:20.790> they<00:07:20.910> get<00:07:21.060> their

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 
your damage cor before they get their

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.629 
your damage cor before they get their
Titan<00:07:21.600> now<00:07:22.290> that<00:07:22.440> would<00:07:22.530> be<00:07:22.620> that<00:07:23.370> would<00:07:23.430> be

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 
Titan now that would be that would be

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:24.740 
Titan now that would be that would be
pretty<00:07:23.790> sweet<00:07:24.090> if<00:07:24.240> you<00:07:24.450> could<00:07:24.600> do<00:07:24.720> that

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.750 
pretty sweet if you could do that

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.620 
pretty sweet if you could do that
because<00:07:25.639> obviously<00:07:26.639> your<00:07:27.150> Titan<00:07:27.389> is<00:07:27.450> going<00:07:27.570> to

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
because obviously your Titan is going to

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.029 
because obviously your Titan is going to
be<00:07:27.720> a<00:07:27.750> little<00:07:27.990> hurt<00:07:28.139> so<00:07:28.680> you're<00:07:28.800> gonna<00:07:28.889> be<00:07:28.979> a

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 
be a little hurt so you're gonna be a

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:31.070 
be a little hurt so you're gonna be a
disadvantage<00:07:29.340> and<00:07:29.880> a<00:07:29.940> straight-up<00:07:30.630> titan<00:07:30.990> on

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 
disadvantage and a straight-up titan on

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.540 
disadvantage and a straight-up titan on
one<00:07:31.200> on<00:07:31.320> one<00:07:31.350> but<00:07:31.860> when<00:07:31.979> you<00:07:32.100> have<00:07:32.130> damaged

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:32.550 
one on one but when you have damaged

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.460 
one on one but when you have damaged
core<00:07:32.820> you<00:07:33.479> were<00:07:33.600> going<00:07:33.780> to<00:07:33.810> destroy<00:07:34.440> that

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.470 
core you were going to destroy that

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.830 
core you were going to destroy that
Titan<00:07:35.039> that<00:07:35.729> tightens<00:07:36.150> not<00:07:36.389> going<00:07:36.570> to<00:07:36.660> stay<00:07:36.810> a

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 
Titan that tightens not going to stay a

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.719 
Titan that tightens not going to stay a
chance<00:07:37.169> damage<00:07:37.560> cor<00:07:37.770> by<00:07:37.889> the<00:07:37.949> way<00:07:38.160> is<00:07:38.430> just

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:38.729 
chance damage cor by the way is just

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:40.790 
chance damage cor by the way is just
increase<00:07:39.210> damage<00:07:39.479> with<00:07:39.900> your<00:07:40.080> Titan<00:07:40.440> you<00:07:40.590> get

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 
increase damage with your Titan you get

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.529 
increase damage with your Titan you get
it<00:07:40.950> when<00:07:41.520> you're<00:07:41.639> going<00:07:41.850> on<00:07:41.970> like<00:07:42.120> a<00:07:42.150> Titan

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 
it when you're going on like a Titan

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:43.820 
it when you're going on like a Titan
kill<00:07:42.720> streak<00:07:43.050> and<00:07:43.289> you're<00:07:43.380> doing<00:07:43.590> a<00:07:43.620> lot<00:07:43.770> of

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:43.830 
kill streak and you're doing a lot of
