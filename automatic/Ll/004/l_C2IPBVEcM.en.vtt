00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
trash can with bleach or a sanitizer if

trash can with bleach or a sanitizer if
you<00:00:59.910> use<00:01:00.030> bleach<00:01:00.270> you're<00:01:00.449> going<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> get

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you use bleach you're going to get

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.450 
you use bleach you're going to get
bleach<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.320> your<00:01:01.379> clothes<00:01:01.680> remember<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
bleach on your clothes remember that and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.660 
bleach on your clothes remember that and
then<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.149> use<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.629> rack<00:01:04.290> thing<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.339> holds

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
then we use this rack thing that holds

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.510 
then we use this rack thing that holds
the<00:01:05.939> bottles<00:01:06.299> ten<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.049> an<00:01:07.140> extravagance<00:01:07.860> but

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the bottles ten of an extravagance but

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.920 
the bottles ten of an extravagance but
it<00:01:08.640> makes<00:01:08.850> moving<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.210> bottles<00:01:09.540> around<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> lot

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it makes moving the bottles around a lot

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.359 
it makes moving the bottles around a lot
easier<00:01:10.290> because<00:01:10.380> your<00:01:10.650> all<00:01:10.740> your<00:01:10.950> bottles<00:01:11.100> are

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
easier because your all your bottles are

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.820 
easier because your all your bottles are
drying<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.970> they're<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:13.260> thing<00:01:13.470> how

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
drying and they're on this thing how

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.310 
drying and they're on this thing how
much<00:01:13.979> they<00:01:14.130> weigh<00:01:14.460> not<00:01:15.150> much<00:01:15.330> less<00:01:15.930> than<00:01:16.080> 20

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
much they weigh not much less than 20

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.770 
much they weigh not much less than 20
pounds<00:01:16.610> but<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.880> makes<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.330> easy<00:01:18.450> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
pounds but it makes it really easy to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.140 
pounds but it makes it really easy to
dry<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> bottles<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.189> bottle<00:01:20.909> your

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
also has a fairly low alcohol content so

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.660 
also has a fairly low alcohol content so
you<00:01:58.590> could<00:01:58.710> drink<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.979> whole<00:01:59.130> one<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.369> these<00:01:59.490> and
