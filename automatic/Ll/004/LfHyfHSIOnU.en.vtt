00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:53.479 
falling to bits now gradually but surely

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.640

and<00:00:54.760> in<00:00:55.760> this<00:00:55.970> position<00:00:56.420> can't<00:00:57.140> often<00:00:57.440> heard

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
and in this position can't often heard

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.430 
and in this position can't often heard
enough<00:00:57.920> after<00:00:58.159> Bishop<00:00:58.460> g7<00:00:58.869> so<00:00:59.869> he<00:01:00.080> puts<00:01:00.320> that

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
enough after Bishop g7 so he puts that

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.149 
enough after Bishop g7 so he puts that
down<00:01:00.860> to<00:01:01.720> two<00:01:02.720> what<00:01:02.900> a<00:01:03.049> laugh<00:01:03.260> of<00:01:03.440> extent<00:01:03.890> my

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
down to two what a laugh of extent my

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.800 
down to two what a laugh of extent my
thinking<00:01:04.549> is<00:01:04.670> based<00:01:04.850> on<00:01:05.030> general<00:01:05.390> principles

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
thinking is based on general principles

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.560 
thinking is based on general principles
and<00:01:05.990> plans<00:01:06.229> okay<00:01:07.100> he<00:01:07.369> overestimated<00:01:08.210> a

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
and plans okay he overestimated a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.600 
and plans okay he overestimated a
position<00:01:09.229> which<00:01:09.380> looked<00:01:09.680> as<00:01:09.890> though<00:01:09.920> black

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
position which looked as though black

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.460 
position which looked as though black
wasn't<00:01:11.060> doing<00:01:11.300> much<00:01:11.450> blacks<00:01:11.810> position<00:01:11.900> seems

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
wasn't doing much blacks position seems

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.380 
wasn't doing much blacks position seems
to<00:01:12.560> be<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:13.100> know<00:01:13.220> most<00:01:13.400> of<00:01:13.580> his<00:01:13.700> pieces<00:01:13.910> at<00:01:14.210> one

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
to be you know most of his pieces at one

point<00:01:14.600> in<00:01:14.750> this<00:01:14.840> game<00:01:15.010> we're<00:01:16.010> all<00:01:16.160> on<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.400> back

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
row and in general in theory you play

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.510 
row and in general in theory you play
the<00:01:20.780> fianchetto<00:01:21.050> variation<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:22.340> don't

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
the fianchetto variation and you don't

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.090 
the fianchetto variation and you don't
expect<00:01:22.760> to<00:01:23.000> be<00:01:23.120> hacked<00:01:23.360> on<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.660> King<00:01:23.870> side<00:01:24.170> but

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
expect to be hacked on the King side but

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.070 
expect to be hacked on the King side but
you<00:01:25.220> know<00:01:25.340> when<00:01:25.490> black<00:01:25.760> gets<00:01:26.180> in<00:01:26.390> fi<00:01:26.780> van<00:01:26.960> def

you know when black gets in fi van def
for<00:01:27.320> you<00:01:27.470> know<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.680> alarm<00:01:27.920> bells<00:01:28.160> should

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
for you know the alarm bells should

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.430 
for you know the alarm bells should
start<00:01:28.730> ringing<00:01:29.150> that<00:01:29.570> this<00:01:29.750> kind<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.110> position

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
start ringing that this kind of position

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.350 
start ringing that this kind of position
is<00:01:30.530> dangerous<00:01:31.040> especially<00:01:31.430> blacks<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.330> know

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
is dangerous especially blacks you know

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.870 
is dangerous especially blacks you know
still<00:01:32.660> got<00:01:32.870> that<00:01:33.020> Queens<00:01:33.350> Bishop<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.790> know

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
still got that Queens Bishop so you know

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.730 
still got that Queens Bishop so you know
black<00:01:35.180> was<00:01:35.300> already<00:01:35.630> doing<00:01:35.840> really<00:01:36.440> quite

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
black was already doing really quite

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.910 
black was already doing really quite
well<00:01:37.010> here<00:01:39.400> so<00:01:40.400> I'm<00:01:40.640> not<00:01:40.850> really<00:01:41.150> convinced<00:01:41.920> by

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
well here so I'm not really convinced by

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.610 
well here so I'm not really convinced by
this<00:01:42.980> example<00:01:43.550> but<00:01:44.300> this<00:01:44.450> is<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.780> prelude<00:01:45.320> to

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
this example but this is the prelude to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.780 
this example but this is the prelude to
cut<00:01:46.580> off<00:01:46.790> training<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:47.960> what<00:01:48.230> he<00:01:48.440> did<00:01:48.740> as<00:01:49.040> a

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
cut off training so what he did as a

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.230 
cut off training so what he did as a
result<00:01:50.150> of<00:01:50.270> this<00:01:50.330> and<00:01:50.810> other<00:01:51.200> losses<00:01:52.120> and<00:01:53.120> he

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
result of this and other losses and he

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.390 
result of this and other losses and he
also<00:01:53.390> consider<00:01:53.930> all<00:01:54.050> the<00:01:54.140> time<00:01:54.409> trouble<00:01:55.220> he

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
also consider all the time trouble he

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.910 
also consider all the time trouble he
was<00:01:55.460> getting<00:01:55.760> into<00:01:55.940> into<00:01:56.600> what<00:01:57.440> he<00:01:57.530> did<00:01:57.560> was

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
was getting into into what he did was

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.850 
was getting into into what he did was
getting<00:01:58.550> a<00:01:58.840> selection<00:01:59.840> of<00:02:00.140> all<00:02:00.350> these<00:02:00.470> really

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
getting a selection of all these really

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.160 
getting a selection of all these really
complicated<00:02:01.400> positions<00:02:02.000> of<00:02:02.150> annotated<00:02:02.870> games

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
complicated positions of annotated games

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.130 
complicated positions of annotated games
and<00:02:03.700> looking<00:02:04.700> at<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.880> annotators<00:02:05.570> analysis

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
and looking at the annotators analysis

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.139 
and looking at the annotators analysis
and<00:02:06.409> then<00:02:06.860> doing<00:02:07.010> his<00:02:07.190> own<00:02:07.280> analysis<00:02:07.909> and

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.690 
seeing how they were different and
apparently<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.480> know<00:02:12.080> this<00:02:12.709> training<00:02:13.310> method

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
apparently you know this training method

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.559 
apparently you know this training method
of<00:02:13.909> comparing<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.890> know<00:02:16.060> his<00:02:17.060> moves<00:02:17.240> to<00:02:17.480> the

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
of comparing you know his moves to the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.860 
of comparing you know his moves to the
annotators

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
annotators

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.259 
annotators
you<00:02:19.290> know<00:02:19.409> he<00:02:19.950> gradually<00:02:20.489> got<00:02:20.760> more<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.150> more

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
you know he gradually got more and more

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.860 
you know he gradually got more and more
you<00:02:22.260> know<00:02:22.409> better<00:02:22.620> at<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.069> matching<00:02:23.879> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
you know better at that matching the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.059 
you know better at that matching the
person<00:02:25.260> who<00:02:25.530> had<00:02:25.620> annotated<00:02:26.159> the<00:02:26.250> game<00:02:28.069> and

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
person who had annotated the game and

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.610 
person who had annotated the game and
let's<00:02:29.879> let's<00:02:30.209> see<00:02:30.450> that's<00:02:30.659> this<00:02:30.959> quote<00:02:31.290> here

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
let's let's see that's this quote here

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.009 
let's let's see that's this quote here
so<00:02:32.099> he<00:02:32.730> would<00:02:32.849> sometimes<00:02:33.060> spend<00:02:33.510> half<00:02:33.750> an<00:02:33.900> hour

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
so he would sometimes spend half an hour

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.199 
so he would sometimes spend half an hour
on<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.319> task<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:35.310> know<00:02:35.430> very<00:02:35.579> complicated

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
on this task you know very complicated

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.119 
on this task you know very complicated
positions<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.019> at<00:02:37.379> first<00:02:37.560> there<00:02:37.769> was<00:02:37.829> a<00:02:37.920> big

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
positions and at first there was a big

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.819 
positions and at first there was a big
discrepancy<00:02:38.819> in<00:02:39.030> favor<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.230> annotators

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
discrepancy in favor of the annotators

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.880 
discrepancy in favor of the annotators
and<00:02:41.390> then<00:02:42.390> he<00:02:42.599> learned<00:02:42.900> apparently<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.500> widen

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
and then he learned apparently to widen

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.619 
and then he learned apparently to widen
the<00:02:43.980> scope<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.370> delineate<00:02:44.970> each<00:02:45.209> variation

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
the scope and delineate each variation

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.530 
the scope and delineate each variation
with<00:02:46.079> considerable<00:02:46.620> exactitude<00:02:47.269> so<00:02:48.269> caught

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
with considerable exactitude so caught

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.530 
with considerable exactitude so caught
up<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.840> quite<00:02:49.049> boastful<00:02:49.530> here<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.540> actually

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
up is quite boastful here and actually

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.300 
up is quite boastful here and actually
he<00:02:51.900> analyzed<00:02:52.379> without<00:02:52.650> moving<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.040> pieces

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
he analyzed without moving the pieces

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.059 
he analyzed without moving the pieces
just<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.849> make<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.269> tournament<00:02:54.780> game

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
just to make it like a tournament game

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.880 
just to make it like a tournament game
so<00:02:56.069> in<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:56.370> way<00:02:56.430> cut<00:02:56.970> off<00:02:57.209> exam<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:58.019> lots<00:02:58.709> of

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
so in this way cut off exam is lots of

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.479 
so in this way cut off exam is lots of
tricky<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.549> complicated<00:02:59.760> positions<00:03:04.489> okay

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
tricky and complicated positions okay

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.229 
tricky and complicated positions okay
and<00:03:05.730> we<00:03:05.970> we<00:03:06.209> have<00:03:06.480> now<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:07.019> this<00:03:07.500> third<00:03:07.769> example

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
and we we have now in this third example

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.619 
and we we have now in this third example
which<00:03:09.239> what<00:03:09.750> I'll<00:03:09.930> leave<00:03:11.120> for<00:03:12.120> another<00:03:12.180> series

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
which what I'll leave for another series

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.539 
which what I'll leave for another series
if<00:03:12.750> you're<00:03:12.900> interested<00:03:13.409> but<00:03:13.859> basically<00:03:14.340> he

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
if you're interested but basically he

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.940 
if you're interested but basically he
takes<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:15.060> very<00:03:15.239> well<00:03:15.540> annotated<00:03:15.930> position<00:03:16.680> and

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
takes a very well annotated position and

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.550 
takes a very well annotated position and
you<00:03:17.940> know<00:03:18.030> he<00:03:18.180> finds<00:03:18.540> an<00:03:18.599> initial<00:03:19.170> brilliant

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
you know he finds an initial brilliant

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.339 
you know he finds an initial brilliant
move<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.829> really<00:03:20.069> subtle<00:03:20.280> move<00:03:20.840> but<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.049> reason

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
move a really subtle move but the reason

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.280 
move a really subtle move but the reason
I'm<00:03:22.440> not<00:03:22.470> convinced<00:03:22.829> by<00:03:23.250> any<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.549> this<00:03:24.290> or

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
I'm not convinced by any of this or

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.620 
I'm not convinced by any of this or
rather<00:03:25.980> I'm<00:03:26.280> only<00:03:26.459> convinced<00:03:27.150> as<00:03:27.359> the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
rather I'm only convinced as the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.330 
rather I'm only convinced as the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
candidate move system as a training

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.080 
candidate move system as a training
system<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.060> comparing<00:03:30.900> two<00:03:31.019> annotators

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
system of comparing two annotators

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.190 
system of comparing two annotators
that's<00:03:33.090> what<00:03:33.299> I'm<00:03:33.389> convinced<00:03:33.870> about<00:03:33.930> at<00:03:34.139> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
that's what I'm convinced about at the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.250 
that's what I'm convinced about at the
moment<00:03:34.349> I'm<00:03:34.739> not<00:03:35.340> convinced<00:03:35.609> about<00:03:36.260> his

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
moment I'm not convinced about his

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.680 
moment I'm not convinced about his
system<00:03:37.650> during<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.190> real-time<00:03:39.000> game<00:03:39.389> to<00:03:39.599> be

system during a real-time game to be

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.180 
system during a real-time game to be

able to create this labyrinth for

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.559 
able to create this labyrinth for
variations<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.849> just<00:03:42.060> don't<00:03:42.269> think<00:03:42.480> that's

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
variations I just don't think that's

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.960 
variations I just don't think that's
possible<00:03:42.840> only<00:03:43.440> in<00:03:43.709> very<00:03:43.859> forcing<00:03:44.459> positions

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
possible only in very forcing positions

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.599 
possible only in very forcing positions
do<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.599> get<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:46.019> like<00:03:46.260> if<00:03:46.530> then<00:03:46.829> if<00:03:47.099> then<00:03:47.129> if

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
do you get this like if then if then if

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.789 
do you get this like if then if then if
then<00:03:47.639> because<00:03:48.329> only<00:03:48.569> then<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.870> can<00:03:49.019> guarantee

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
then because only then you can guarantee

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.979 
then because only then you can guarantee
that<00:03:50.370> you're<00:03:50.519> going<00:03:50.609> to<00:03:50.669> end<00:03:50.879> up<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.359> in<00:03:51.629> this

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
that you're going to end up this in this

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.289 
that you're going to end up this in this
position<00:03:52.349> five<00:03:52.590> moves<00:03:52.859> deep<00:03:53.099> or<00:03:53.609> ten<00:03:54.120> moves

position five moves deep or ten moves

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.789 
position five moves deep or ten moves
deep<00:03:54.480> because<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.780> most<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:55.079> it<00:03:55.169> was<00:03:55.260> forcing

deep because it most of it was forcing

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.379 
deep because it most of it was forcing
of<00:03:55.919> course<00:03:56.129> then<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.459> can<00:03:56.609> guarantee<00:03:56.819> that

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
of course then you can guarantee that

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.300 
of course then you can guarantee that
you're<00:03:57.840> less<00:03:58.230> likely<00:03:58.349> to<00:03:58.829> be<00:03:59.040> relevant

it's always much easier to annotate your
own<00:05:08.750> games<00:05:09.020> because<00:05:09.200> you<00:05:09.350> are<00:05:09.410> aware<00:05:09.680> of<00:05:09.740> the

are aware of the variations and that's
what<00:05:20.630> I<00:05:20.660> find<00:05:20.990> interesting<00:05:21.229> now<00:05:21.950> of<00:05:22.310> what<00:05:22.820> cut

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
what I find interesting now of what cut

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.180 
what I find interesting now of what cut
off<00:05:23.240> right<00:05:23.510> because<00:05:24.080> by<00:05:24.289> saying<00:05:24.680> that<00:05:24.979> he's

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
off right because by saying that he's

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.460 
off right because by saying that he's
looking<00:05:25.639> at<00:05:25.760> all<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.150> world<00:05:26.389> annotated<00:05:27.200> games

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
he's basically trying to test his

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.860 
he's basically trying to test his

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
intimate to that game and that is very

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.129 
intimate to that game and that is very
clever<00:05:35.780> that<00:05:36.530> kind<00:05:36.889> of<00:05:37.330> you<00:05:38.330> know<00:05:38.360> test<00:05:38.780> he<00:05:39.020> was

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
clever that kind of you know test he was

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.409 
clever that kind of you know test he was
putting<00:05:39.380> himself<00:05:39.590> under<00:05:40.430> and<00:05:40.639> if<00:05:41.060> he<00:05:41.210> was

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
getting more accurate at doing that

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.909 
getting more accurate at doing that
that's<00:05:44.270> good<00:05:44.600> it<00:05:44.870> was<00:05:45.139> training<00:05:45.710> his

that's good it was training his
