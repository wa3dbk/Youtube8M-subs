00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and let's talk about this team this team

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.180 
and let's talk about this team this team
is<00:00:34.770> nasty<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.450> one<00:00:37.170> hundred<00:00:37.260> percent<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
is nasty it is one hundred percent to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.250 
is nasty it is one hundred percent to
the<00:00:38.309> bone<00:00:38.520> raw<00:00:39.090> beatdown<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.870> that's<00:00:40.079> why<00:00:40.230> I

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the bone raw beatdown and that's why I

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.810 
the bone raw beatdown and that's why I
like<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.590> much<00:00:40.770> there<00:00:41.340> are<00:00:41.460> two<00:00:41.610> ways<00:00:41.760> that

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
like it so much there are two ways that

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.360 
like it so much there are two ways that
you<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.480> play<00:00:42.690> no<00:00:43.170> recovery<00:00:43.530> gomen<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.190> can

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
you can play no recovery gomen you can

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.540 
you can play no recovery gomen you can
either<00:00:44.520> run<00:00:44.760> Satan<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.570> negative<00:00:46.550> 9999

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
either run Satan for the negative 9999

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.940 
either run Satan for the negative 9999
recovery<00:00:47.940> or<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.480> can<00:00:48.600> run<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.260> read<00:00:49.739> John

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
recovery or you can run to read John

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.220 
recovery or you can run to read John

their own individual strengths but for

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.889 
their own individual strengths but for
the<00:00:55.140> most<00:00:55.260> part<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.829> prefer<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:57.090> double<00:00:57.750> red

gomin and he got to red John gigas then

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.910 
gomin and he got to red John gigas then
you<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.370> hair<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.149> then<00:01:03.629> King<00:01:04.019> bubbly<00:01:04.379> there

are<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> few<00:01:05.460> prerequisites<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.080> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
are a few prerequisites that you have to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.130 
are a few prerequisites that you have to
meet<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.710> make<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:08.040> teamwork<00:01:08.900> number<00:01:09.900> one

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
meet to make this teamwork number one

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.280 
meet to make this teamwork number one
the<00:01:10.650> Red<00:01:10.830> John<00:01:11.040> guesses<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.150> be<00:01:12.330> at<00:01:12.689> max

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the Red John guesses have to be at max

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.070 
the Red John guesses have to be at max
level<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.790> they<00:01:15.030> get<00:01:15.180> stronger<00:01:15.479> their

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
level because as they get stronger their

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.350 
level because as they get stronger their
recovery<00:01:16.590> weakens<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.670> dips<00:01:18.000> into<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
recovery weakens and it dips into the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.450 
recovery weakens and it dips into the
negatives<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.350> max<00:01:19.590> level<00:01:19.860> they<00:01:20.100> end<00:01:20.280> up

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
negatives and a max level they end up

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.940 
negatives and a max level they end up
getting<00:01:20.790> negative<00:01:21.450> 500<00:01:22.110> recovery<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.830> you're

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
getting negative 500 recovery so you're

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.620 
getting negative 500 recovery so you're
on<00:01:23.070> two<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.340> them<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:23.700> negative<00:01:24.030> 1,000

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
on two of them for negative 1,000

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.660 
on two of them for negative 1,000
recovery<00:01:25.020> which<00:01:25.560> will<00:01:25.770> effectively<00:01:26.159> cancel

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
recovery which will effectively cancel

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.520 
recovery which will effectively cancel
out<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.090> recovery<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.960> rest<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> team

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
out the recovery of the rest of the team

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.740 
out the recovery of the rest of the team
another<00:01:29.400> thing<00:01:29.640> about<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.970> team<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.450> that

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
another thing about the team is that

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.679 
another thing about the team is that
both<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.070> Goins<00:01:32.520> pretty<00:01:32.909> much<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.390> be

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
both of the Goins pretty much have to be

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.069 
both of the Goins pretty much have to be
at<00:01:33.960> max<00:01:34.290> skill<00:01:34.590> because<00:01:35.119> there's<00:01:36.119> no<00:01:36.329> way<00:01:36.600> with

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
at max skill because there's no way with

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.420 
at max skill because there's no way with
no<00:01:37.290> recovery<00:01:37.710> you're<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.220> able<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
no recovery you're going to be able to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.429 
no recovery you're going to be able to
stall<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:38.700> 30<00:01:39.150> turns<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.720> order<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.140> get<00:01:40.290> those

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
stall for 30 turns in order to get those

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.020 
stall for 30 turns in order to get those
ninja<00:01:40.770> fireworks<00:01:41.220> charged<00:01:41.579> up<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
ninja fireworks charged up for the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.630 
ninja fireworks charged up for the
bosses<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.110> having<00:01:43.470> skilled<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:43.979> Komen's<00:01:44.399> is

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
bosses so having skilled up Komen's is

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.149

where your health is different
percentages<00:02:12.360> will<00:02:12.599> show<00:02:12.810> different<00:02:13.170> colors

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
percentages will show different colors

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.490

and<00:02:14.060> they<00:02:15.060> made<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.630> where<00:02:15.870> your<00:02:16.290> health

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
and they made it so where your health

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.600 
bar turns red when you're under twenty
percent<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:19.800> perfect<00:02:20.130> with<00:02:20.250> gomen

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
percent so it's perfect with gomen

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.520 
percent so it's perfect with gomen
because<00:02:20.910> his<00:02:21.150> skill<00:02:21.420> triggers<00:02:22.050> when<00:02:22.320> you're

under<00:02:22.740> twenty<00:02:22.950> percent<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.550> in<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.450> past<00:02:24.690> you

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
under twenty percent and in the past you

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.110 
under twenty percent and in the past you
didn't<00:02:25.110> have<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.290> color<00:02:25.650> system<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.340> for<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
didn't have that color system so for the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.210 
didn't have that color system so for the
most<00:02:27.270> part<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.780> could<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.080> ball<00:02:28.350> like<00:02:28.950> where

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
most part you could I ball like where

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.740 
most part you could I ball like where
your<00:02:29.370> health<00:02:29.520> was<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.120> there<00:02:30.480> were<00:02:30.570> some

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
your health was but there were some

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.330 
your health was but there were some
times<00:02:31.020> where<00:02:31.320> you<00:02:31.350> would<00:02:31.560> just<00:02:31.740> get<00:02:31.860> hit<00:02:32.100> and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
times where you would just get hit and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.370 
times where you would just get hit and
you<00:02:33.150> couldn't<00:02:33.330> really<00:02:33.540> tell<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.140> you'd<00:02:34.260> have

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
you couldn't really tell so you'd have

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.990 
you couldn't really tell so you'd have
to<00:02:34.500> bust<00:02:34.680> out<00:02:34.890> your<00:02:34.920> calculator<00:02:35.550> app<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.910> have

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
to bust out your calculator app you have

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.120 
to bust out your calculator app you have
to<00:02:36.060> type<00:02:36.240> in<00:02:36.480> your<00:02:36.660> max<00:02:37.230> hip<00:02:37.470> points<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.070> you

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110
