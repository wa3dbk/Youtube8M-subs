00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.770
 hi to all the teeth spaces I am 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.809
 Dr. White we are here today with one 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.840
 new review of a footballer on 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.250
 alive 15 last teams we saw that 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.220
 last week there was a team of 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.289
 fantastic wick with ronaldo ibra instead 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.599
 a month these weeks a team of the 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.880
 week with players maybe not so strong 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.210
 but still interesting I decided to 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.710
 starting from rising midfielder online 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.560
 central of Rome probably the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.540
 surprise of the rome midfield 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.920
 because however many did not expect 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.140
 a performance so high and in my opinion a 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.760
 January there is a strong risk of upgrading 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.570
 for this player because 79 second 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.420
 me a little bit 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.129
 the statistics are not bad is a 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.780
 player that I really like since 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.480
 its basic version let's see if it's worth it 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.460
 worth investing and buying this 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.219
 hip version that costs about 30,000 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.170
 therefore you believe about 28 thousand more credits 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.359
 of the basic version 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.969
 statistics as we always start 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:04.239
 from speed talking about speed a lot 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.950
 good is a great player for i 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.619
 central midfielders is not fast 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.110
 as vidal however in each case to 84 of 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.270
 acceleration in 79 shutter speed that 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.710
 for a central midfielder is more than that 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.049
 enough in any case you are seeing 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.320
 the physical statistics are really 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:23.229
 really good it has a good strength 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.520
 physical like 73 above all to 86 of 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.799
 aggressiveness that allows him to 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.930
 recover many balls to fight 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.490
 always in any case therefore it would also be 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.619
 stay there goes away he will try to stick 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.270
 on the jersey rather it throws it down though 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.820
 does not make a good player go away 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.970
 as regards the physical sector 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.100
 as for the shooting shot I have to 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.290
 to say that it amazed me especially for 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.240
 the finalization indicated only 66 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.619
 on paper despite having a very good one 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.969
 power and holds a great shot from the 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.990
 distance to be a midfielder 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.460
 with 80 evaluation and I noticed that 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.560
 however ning holland able to score 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.119
 and I put some goals that I did with 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.280
 he who counting however that is a 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.670
 central midfielder so it is not the 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.979
 therefore the pin of the maneuver is not 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.500
 tevez language in which I used it 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.420
 he is not called firsthand a 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.760
 finalize the action but a few go 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.959
 he made it so also 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.940
 under this point of view 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.190
 not bad sin only for the three 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.599
 weak foot stars that go 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.970
 however penalize because you can 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.890
 pull at this point only you destiny 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.690
 I would say to forget it 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.150
 in any case, don't think he has the 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.220
 maybe a hernanes shot here is the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.660
 passage very good second pass 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.280
 me at 79 is great for a midfielder 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.459
 he is not able to make very long throws 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.260
 however, there is no plans to do so 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.430
 they ask the filterers to manage to put them 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.220
 therefore also from this point of view 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.799
 promoted dribbling this good too is 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.170
 one meter high and 76 so it has a very good 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.640
 agility to good ball control that 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.069
 it is not shown on the card but it has me 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.569
 his control amazed enough 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.660
 general promoted dribbling ball 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.940
 the only flaw is the three-star ski 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.470
 so you can't think of doing skill 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.450
 with this player 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.560
 we close the body of the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.200
 movie that we have already said that a good one 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.420
 physical strength in general is difficult to 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.850
 move and with regard to defense 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.940
 he is an excellent midfielder because he has 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.109
 good tackle values always in the 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.690
 right position at the right time 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.160
 despite having high high of workers 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.290
 therefore also from this point of view 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.840
 he is promoted in the throat and not a little mini vidal 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.109
 in any case, recommended chemistry style 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.750
 the first is a sniper increases the shot 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.790
 and dribbling this if you want to think 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.400
 to a language run more offensive 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.720
 that defensive or maybe gladiators 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.420
 in this case it should increase the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.780
 shooting and defense then two aspects 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.859
 several one for those who think more like 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.359
 midfielder who goes selis in attack 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.650
 one more like midfielder maybe a 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.540
 median mantra of faith in any case 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.810
 we see the teams that I recommend 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.579
 first among the classic 4 3 2 1 series a 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.230
 I remind you that in England it belongs to Belgium 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.780
 therefore quite easy to hybridize 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.090
 Aalto high wordpress is a bit like you 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.310
 in fact it is saying is a mini vidal 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.959
 the problem is that it costs more than vidal 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.209
 so this penalizes him a little bit 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.010
 however it is a player who on the ground of 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.260
 game behaves more or less like him 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.080
 look for January for a big upgrade 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.300
 especially in shooting in the pass 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.980
 probably could have too 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.290
 I say all the statistics always on the 80th 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.239
 however, he risks getting close to each 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.850
 In the event this is the very offensive 4 3 2 1 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.890
 with gervinho and cuadrado to the support of 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.110
 tevez tevez that pivots a bit in 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.000
 forward receives and can serve the outsiders 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.250
 or guarini Lingle also van and dis 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.020
 with de rossi to protect the defense 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.270
 together in two full- back full-backs 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.400
 not particularly offensive 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.170
 or the second choice in this case 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.140
 and give me along the year and a choice that 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.390
 I think we can stand mertens 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.010
 giovinco e callejon in 4 2 3 1 a 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.690
 support of the only tip higuain e 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.580
 we de red regulate to protect 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.440
 the defense has excellent defensive values 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.570
 have a good lightning physique to give 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.140
 support for the maneuver can anyway 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.340
 cover when no evra or maicon goes up 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.080
 for cabin in goal they noticed that 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.990
 many on the attack front 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.330
 in conclusion lingle en I liked it 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.070
 why have you seen the statistics are 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.320
 excellent and good more or less do all one 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.120
 good speed for the position at a 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.880
 fair power shot from distance 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.310
 to a great dribble for myself, not me 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.720
 I expected it with dates 82 is a valerio 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.640
 same value as they have callejon and 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.830
 even more than hua hin to make you 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.780
 an example has excellent defensive values 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.640
 so he is a great midfielder for 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.160
 break the opposing action 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.900
 the problem what is the problem is va 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.700
 33 skills well and 3 if weaker 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.860
 that goes well you can also forget 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.350
 the problem that is not so different from the 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.919
 basic version and that vidal costs less 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.720
 so my choice is vidal in this 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.850
 moment even if in the golan and vidal in 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.290
 midfield together I'm not from 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.350
 kind of contact and vidal a 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.640
 Higher statistics is really expensive 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.330
 less then one must also consider 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.590
 maybe this is a little less fast though it is 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.390
 a shot is even more complete 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.610
 much better and bigger 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.690
 above all of physical then with years 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.010
 we have accomplished serve liked 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.330
 leave a like home comment subscribers 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.080
 we will see each other soon 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.080
 Hi everyone
