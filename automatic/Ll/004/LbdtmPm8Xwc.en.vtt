so<00:00:05.020> I<00:00:05.080> started<00:00:05.350> the<00:00:05.440> guitar<00:00:05.740> by<00:00:05.920> throwing<00:00:06.250> two

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:06.700 
so I started the guitar by throwing two

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.699 
so I started the guitar by throwing two
balls<00:00:07.000> one<00:00:07.510> big<00:00:07.810> one<00:00:07.960> one<00:00:08.350> small<00:00:08.500> one<00:00:08.860> I<00:00:10.379> cut<00:00:11.379> a

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:11.709 
balls one big one one small one I cut a

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.580 
balls one big one one small one I cut a
quarter<00:00:12.490> of<00:00:12.789> the<00:00:12.940> big<00:00:13.090> one<00:00:13.240> off<00:00:13.420> I<00:00:13.690> cut<00:00:13.959> to

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
quarter of the big one off I cut to

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.800 
quarter of the big one off I cut to
about<00:00:14.980> a<00:00:15.100> third<00:00:15.549> of<00:00:15.820> the<00:00:15.969> small<00:00:16.209> one<00:00:16.360> off<00:00:16.480> and<00:00:16.720> I

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
about a third of the small one off and I

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.410 
about a third of the small one off and I
stuck<00:00:17.140> them<00:00:17.289> together<00:00:17.880> then<00:00:18.880> I<00:00:18.910> rolled<00:00:19.240> out<00:00:19.359> a

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
stuck them together then I rolled out a

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.290 
stuck them together then I rolled out a
slab<00:00:19.720> and<00:00:19.930> the<00:00:20.020> slab<00:00:20.050> roller<00:00:20.440> I<00:00:21.090> flipped<00:00:22.090> the

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
slab and the slab roller I flipped the

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.170 
slab and the slab roller I flipped the
entire<00:00:22.690> thing<00:00:23.080> over<00:00:23.260> onto<00:00:23.860> that<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.910> then

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
entire thing over onto that and then

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.940 
entire thing over onto that and then
made<00:00:25.750> sure<00:00:25.780> that<00:00:26.200> was<00:00:26.350> completely<00:00:26.800> put

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
made sure that was completely put

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.760 
made sure that was completely put
together<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:28.660> is<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:28.930> electric<00:00:29.500> guitar<00:00:29.560> I

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
together this is the electric guitar I

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.479 
together this is the electric guitar I
started<00:00:30.520> working<00:00:31.480> with<00:00:31.780> I<00:00:32.079> cut<00:00:33.010> the<00:00:33.129> sides<00:00:33.340> off

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
started working with I cut the sides off

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.340 
started working with I cut the sides off
of<00:00:33.699> it<00:00:33.820> I<00:00:33.910> cut<00:00:34.090> the<00:00:34.120> bottom<00:00:34.300> off<00:00:34.600> of<00:00:34.780> it<00:00:34.960> I<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
of it I cut the bottom off of it I and

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.520 
of it I cut the bottom off of it I and
then<00:00:38.710> I<00:00:38.739> began<00:00:39.400> to<00:00:39.850> start<00:00:40.450> to<00:00:40.660> shape<00:00:41.110> it<00:00:41.290> and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
then I began to start to shape it and

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.950 
then I began to start to shape it and
sand<00:00:41.890> it<00:00:42.070> just<00:00:42.550> when<00:00:42.880> I<00:00:42.910> started<00:00:43.600> putting<00:00:43.750> out

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
sand it just when I started putting out

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.130 
sand it just when I started putting out
all<00:00:44.020> this<00:00:44.170> gear<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:46.360> I<00:00:46.420> started<00:00:46.690> to<00:00:46.840> taper<00:00:47.020> the

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
all this gear so I started to taper the

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.590 
all this gear so I started to taper the
edges<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.930> whole<00:00:50.110> concept<00:00:50.649> behind<00:00:51.600> this

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
edges the whole concept behind this

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.930 
edges the whole concept behind this
design<00:00:53.020> was<00:00:53.410> to<00:00:53.530> keep<00:00:53.770> all<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.250> tension<00:00:54.430> from

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
design was to keep all the tension from

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.590 
design was to keep all the tension from
the<00:00:55.210> strings<00:00:55.570> on<00:00:56.020> the<00:00:56.680> wood<00:00:56.860> section<00:00:57.520> so<00:00:58.210> if

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
the strings on the wood section so if

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.080 
the strings on the wood section so if
there<00:00:58.840> was<00:00:59.380> going<00:00:59.770> to<00:00:59.860> be<00:00:59.920> any<00:01:00.820> kind<00:01:00.910> of

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
there was going to be any kind of

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.330 
there was going to be any kind of
breaking<00:01:01.690> it<00:01:01.960> would<00:01:02.079> happen<00:01:02.379> in<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:03.190> wood

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
breaking it would happen in the wood

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.369 
breaking it would happen in the wood
instead<00:01:03.730> of<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:03.940> ceramic<00:01:04.390> so<00:01:04.509> there<00:01:04.719> is<00:01:04.989> the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
instead of the ceramic so there is the

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.669 
instead of the ceramic so there is the
drying<00:01:05.829> ceramic<00:01:06.659> that's<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.899> guitar<00:01:08.049> flipped

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:08.679 
drying ceramic that's the guitar flipped

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:10.789 
drying ceramic that's the guitar flipped
over<00:01:08.859> from<00:01:09.280> how<00:01:09.459> you'd<00:01:09.609> seen<00:01:09.759> it<00:01:09.789> before

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
over from how you'd seen it before

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.410 
over from how you'd seen it before
then<00:01:11.799> cut<00:01:12.009> a<00:01:12.039> knife<00:01:12.219> hole<00:01:12.369> on<00:01:12.459> the<00:01:12.549> top<00:01:12.700> so<00:01:13.389> I

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
then cut a knife hole on the top so I

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.719 
then cut a knife hole on the top so I
cut<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.929> bottom<00:01:14.079> out<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.799> you<00:01:15.369> can<00:01:15.490> see<00:01:15.639> this

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
cut the bottom out and you can see this

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.160 
cut the bottom out and you can see this
is<00:01:15.880> turning<00:01:16.179> really<00:01:16.450> into<00:01:16.659> like<00:01:16.810> just<00:01:16.959> a

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
is turning really into like just a

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.840 
is turning really into like just a
skeletal<00:01:17.619> structure<00:01:17.889> to<00:01:18.069> hold<00:01:18.189> the<00:01:18.340> bridge<00:01:18.549> on

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
skeletal structure to hold the bridge on

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.389 
skeletal structure to hold the bridge on
I<00:01:19.469> wanted<00:01:20.469> the<00:01:20.560> bridge<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:20.950> be<00:01:21.069> attached<00:01:21.310> to

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
I wanted the bridge to be attached to

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.699 
I wanted the bridge to be attached to
the<00:01:21.549> wood<00:01:21.700> again<00:01:22.659> so<00:01:22.929> the<00:01:23.020> tension<00:01:23.380> would<00:01:23.469> stay

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:23.709 
the wood again so the tension would stay

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:27.269 
the wood again so the tension would stay
on<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.979> wood<00:01:25.469> because<00:01:26.469> I<00:01:26.590> had<00:01:26.679> actually<00:01:27.069> read

00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:27.279 
on the wood because I had actually read

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:29.010 
on the wood because I had actually read
a<00:01:27.310> story<00:01:27.999> on<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.209> internet<00:01:28.479> about<00:01:28.569> a<00:01:28.719> guy<00:01:28.959> who

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
a story on the internet about a guy who

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.160 
a story on the internet about a guy who
started<00:01:29.740> tuning<00:01:30.189> up<00:01:30.279> his<00:01:30.429> ceramic<00:01:31.209> guitar<00:01:31.509> so

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
started tuning up his ceramic guitar so

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.980 
started tuning up his ceramic guitar so
that<00:01:32.200> he<00:01:32.499> was<00:01:32.950> very<00:01:33.369> excited<00:01:33.819> about<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.299> it

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
that he was very excited about and it

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.269 
that he was very excited about and it
exploded<00:01:36.539> from<00:01:37.539> the<00:01:37.719> tension<00:01:38.079> so<00:01:38.950> this<00:01:39.099> is<00:01:39.189> the

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:39.279 
exploded from the tension so this is the

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:43.260 
exploded from the tension so this is the
headstock<00:01:39.759> I<00:01:39.999> carved<00:01:40.329> it<00:01:40.420> myself<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:42.579> with<00:01:43.240> a

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
headstock I carved it myself it with a

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.499 
headstock I carved it myself it with a
dremel<00:01:43.569> tool<00:01:43.779> tapered<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:45.179> put<00:01:46.179> into<00:01:46.359> the

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
dremel tool tapered it put into the

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.279 
dremel tool tapered it put into the
shape<00:01:46.719> that<00:01:46.749> I<00:01:47.039> that<00:01:48.039> I<00:01:48.130> thought<00:01:48.310> was<00:01:48.490> pleasing

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
shape that I that I thought was pleasing

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:55.169 
shape that I that I thought was pleasing
there<00:01:50.289> is<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:51.189> bisque<00:01:51.549> fired<00:01:53.189> piece<00:01:54.189> so

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
there is the bisque fired piece so

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.269 
there is the bisque fired piece so
that's<00:01:55.299> ready<00:01:55.539> to<00:01:55.659> be<00:01:55.810> glazed<00:01:57.329> meanwhile<00:01:58.329> I

00:01:59.269 --> 00:01:59.279 
that's ready to be glazed meanwhile I

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:05.370 
that's ready to be glazed meanwhile I
was<00:02:01.349> staining<00:02:02.349> wood<00:02:02.799> conditioning<00:02:04.169> the<00:02:05.169> wood

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
was staining wood conditioning the wood

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.289 
was staining wood conditioning the wood
basically<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.009> finished<00:02:06.279> sanding<00:02:06.459> it<00:02:06.789> I<00:02:06.999> put

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
basically I finished sanding it I put

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.109 
basically I finished sanding it I put
all<00:02:07.419> the<00:02:07.659> masking<00:02:08.229> tape<00:02:08.410> on<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.789> cover<00:02:09.970> up

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
all the masking tape on to cover up

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.100 
all the masking tape on to cover up
anywhere<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.569> I<00:02:10.630> didn't<00:02:10.840> want<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:10.989> get

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
anywhere that I didn't want to get

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.230 
anywhere that I didn't want to get
stained<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.740> then<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.040> started<00:02:12.670> staining<00:02:13.090> its

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
stained and then I started staining its

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.680 
stained and then I started staining its
