this<00:00:42.300> plant<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.720> curious<00:00:43.170> not<00:00:43.410> only<00:00:43.650> because

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
this plant is curious not only because

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.970 
this plant is curious not only because
it<00:00:44.309> has<00:00:44.670> edible<00:00:45.269> qualities<00:00:45.720> but<00:00:46.260> also<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.890> its

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
it has edible qualities but also for its

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.770 
it has edible qualities but also for its
medicinal<00:00:47.370> aspects<00:00:48.150> as<00:00:48.360> well

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
medicinal aspects as well

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.680 
medicinal aspects as well
the<00:00:49.410> touch-me-not<00:00:49.650> is<00:00:50.190> an<00:00:50.339> annual<00:00:50.730> herb<00:00:51.030> that

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the touch-me-not is an annual herb that

produces unique orange or yellow flowers
and<00:00:54.390> pods<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:55.290> edible<00:00:55.680> seeds<00:00:55.980> throughout

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
and pods with edible seeds throughout

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.329 
and pods with edible seeds throughout
the<00:00:56.610> summer<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.150> early<00:00:57.299> fall

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
the summer and early fall

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.950 
the summer and early fall
so<00:00:59.339> the<00:00:59.489> second<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.970> try<00:01:00.119> to<00:01:00.210> harvest<00:01:00.510> these

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
so the second you try to harvest these

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.280 
so the second you try to harvest these
seeds<00:01:01.650> that<00:01:01.890> are<00:01:02.100> hanging<00:01:02.309> here<00:01:03.290> you'll

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
seeds that are hanging here you'll

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.080 
seeds that are hanging here you'll
notice<00:01:04.530> right<00:01:04.710> away<00:01:05.189> why<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.549> call<00:01:05.729> them

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
notice right away why they call them

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.240 
notice right away why they call them
touch<00:01:06.360> me<00:01:06.540> nuts<00:01:07.100> generally<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
touch me nuts generally with the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.649 
touch me nuts generally with the
slightest<00:01:08.760> pressure<00:01:08.970> they're<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
slightest pressure they're going to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.649 
slightest pressure they're going to
explode<00:01:10.170> which<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.340> send<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> seeds

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
explode which is going to send the seeds

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.050 
explode which is going to send the seeds
kind<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.020> flying<00:01:13.260> off<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.710> all<00:01:13.799> directions<00:01:14.060> so

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
kind of flying off in all directions so

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.990 
kind of flying off in all directions so
it's<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.900> great<00:01:16.110> propagation<00:01:16.880> adaptation<00:01:17.880> I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
it's a great propagation adaptation I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.550 
it's a great propagation adaptation I
guess<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.299> would<00:01:18.390> say<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.229> makes<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
guess you would say but it makes it a

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.490 
guess you would say but it makes it a
little<00:01:19.680> bit<00:01:19.830> harder<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:21.780> gather<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.259> seeds

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
little bit harder to to gather the seeds

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.039 
little bit harder to to gather the seeds
so<00:01:23.130> when<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.610> go<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> grab<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.240> seed<00:01:24.570> pod<00:01:24.810> here

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
so when you go to grab a seed pod here

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.740 
so when you go to grab a seed pod here
you<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.619> very<00:01:25.830> quickly<00:01:26.600> hold<00:01:27.600> it

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
you have to do it very quickly hold it

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.270 
you have to do it very quickly hold it
in<00:01:27.840> your<00:01:27.990> hand<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> lot<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.590> pressure<00:01:28.859> and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
in your hand with a lot of pressure and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.789 
in your hand with a lot of pressure and
let<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:29.999> explode<00:01:30.149> in<00:01:30.659> your<00:01:30.689> hand<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.409> then

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
let it explode in your hand and then

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.789 
let it explode in your hand and then
harvest<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.399> seeds<00:01:32.640> from<00:01:32.850> there<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:34.619> here<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
harvest the seeds from there so here a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.349 
harvest the seeds from there so here a
couple<00:01:35.009> nice<00:01:35.249> seed<00:01:35.490> pods<00:01:35.789> I'm<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.149> to<00:01:36.210> try

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
couple nice seed pods I'm going to try

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.149 
couple nice seed pods I'm going to try
to<00:01:36.420> pick<00:01:37.140> them<00:01:37.289> off<00:01:37.469> there<00:01:37.740> without<00:01:37.859> them

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
to pick them off there without them

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.739 
to pick them off there without them
exploding<00:01:38.670> all<00:01:38.820> over<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.329> give<00:01:40.259> them<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> taste

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
exploding all over and give them a taste

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.090 
exploding all over and give them a taste
okay<00:01:42.749> so<00:01:42.810> as<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.259> here<00:01:43.679> there<00:01:43.950> are<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
okay so as you can see here there are a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.090 
okay so as you can see here there are a
couple<00:01:44.249> of<00:01:44.490> seeds<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.119> also<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:48.090> tendrils

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
couple of seeds and also the tendrils

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.190 
couple of seeds and also the tendrils
you<00:01:50.100> may<00:01:50.249> find<00:01:50.460> anywhere<00:01:50.909> from<00:01:51.119> 1<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.600> 6<00:01:51.899> seeds

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
you may find anywhere from 1 to 6 seeds

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.649 
you may find anywhere from 1 to 6 seeds
per<00:01:52.530> pod<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.729> color<00:01:53.969> will<00:01:54.179> vary<00:01:54.450> from

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
per pod and the color will vary from

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.840 
per pod and the color will vary from
green<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.229> brown<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.889> even<00:01:56.159> black<00:01:56.429> when<00:01:56.729> they

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
green to brown and even black when they

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.880 
green to brown and even black when they
are<00:01:56.909> more<00:01:57.090> mature<00:01:58.850> gonna<00:01:59.850> give<00:01:59.969> these<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> try

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.030 

they<00:02:03.890> have<00:02:03.980> a<00:02:04.360> taste<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:05.570> is<00:02:06.020> very<00:02:06.770> similar

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
they have a taste that is very similar

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.390 
they have a taste that is very similar
to<00:02:07.370> raw<00:02:08.150> sunflower<00:02:08.690> seeds<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:10.070> the

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
to raw sunflower seeds and the the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.040 
to raw sunflower seeds and the the
nuttiness<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.480> think<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.780> flavor

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
nuttiness and I think the flavor

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.470 
nuttiness and I think the flavor
intensifies<00:02:12.800> when<00:02:13.400> they<00:02:13.520> turn<00:02:13.730> brown<00:02:14.000> or<00:02:14.330> they

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
intensifies when they turn brown or they

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.090 
intensifies when they turn brown or they
turn<00:02:14.540> black<00:02:14.960> which<00:02:15.290> means<00:02:15.800> they're<00:02:15.920> going<00:02:16.010> to

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
turn black which means they're going to

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.670 
turn black which means they're going to
be<00:02:16.190> just<00:02:16.370> slightly<00:02:16.520> older<00:02:17.440> still<00:02:18.440> taste

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
be just slightly older still taste

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.260 
be just slightly older still taste
really<00:02:18.860> good<00:02:19.100> though<00:02:19.310> now<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.000> additional

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
really good though now the additional
