it<00:02:11.170> up<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.410> down<00:02:11.500> like<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:13.110> say<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:15.310> can

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
it up and down like that say you can

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.000 
it up and down like that say you can
zoom<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:15.790> really<00:02:15.970> far

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
zoom in really far

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.930 
zoom in really far
and<00:02:18.010> move<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.400> around<00:02:18.459> like<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:21.730> can

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
and move it around like that you can

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.000 
and move it around like that you can
zoom<00:02:22.120> in<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.989> little<00:02:23.769> far<00:02:24.190> like<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:25.500> just<00:02:26.500> you

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
zoom in a little far like that just you

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.430 
zoom in a little far like that just you
could<00:02:27.129> do<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.370> everyone<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.970> if<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:29.170> just

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
could do it everyone and if you just

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.050 
could do it everyone and if you just
fool<00:02:29.890> around<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.400> check<00:02:30.640> stuff<00:02:30.819> out<00:02:31.000> like

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
fool around and check stuff out like

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.509 
fool around and check stuff out like
this<00:02:31.510> like<00:02:32.319> if<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:32.500> want<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:32.830> zoom<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.250> right

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
this like if you want to zoom in right

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.820 
this like if you want to zoom in right
here<00:02:33.879> on<00:02:34.060> your<00:02:34.209> dock<00:02:34.480> hold<00:02:35.200> down<00:02:35.290> shift<00:02:35.650> and

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
here on your dock hold down shift and

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.900 
here on your dock hold down shift and
control<00:02:36.310> just<00:02:37.120> run<00:02:37.299> it<00:02:37.450> over<00:02:37.599> if<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:38.470> wanna

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
control just run it over if you wanna

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.280 
control just run it over if you wanna
like<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:39.940> lot<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.180> people<00:02:40.269> post<00:02:40.810> this<00:02:40.959> if<00:02:41.170> you

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
like a lot of people post this if you

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.199 
like a lot of people post this if you
want<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.560> like<00:02:41.709> slow<00:02:42.430> down<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.790> minimizing

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
want to like slow down the minimizing

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.220 
want to like slow down the minimizing
process<00:02:43.900> hold<00:02:44.230> down<00:02:44.349> shift<00:02:44.799> hit<00:02:45.599> hit<00:02:46.599> then<00:02:47.049> hit

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
process hold down shift hit hit then hit

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.870 
process hold down shift hit hit then hit
minimize<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.860> will<00:02:47.950> go<00:02:48.069> down<00:02:48.250> like<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.459> and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
minimize and will go down like that and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.970 
minimize and will go down like that and
you<00:02:49.599> can<00:02:49.720> actually<00:02:49.840> watch<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.349> thing<00:02:50.530> fill<00:02:50.799> up

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
you can actually watch the thing fill up

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.120 
you can actually watch the thing fill up
like<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.120> same<00:02:52.840> as<00:02:53.019> you<00:02:53.140> maximize<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.950> hold

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
like and same as you maximize it hold

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.740 
like and same as you maximize it hold
down<00:02:54.250> shift<00:02:54.549> can<00:02:55.390> watch<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.720> right<00:02:55.750> here<00:02:57.750> it's

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
down shift can watch it right here it's

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.350 
down shift can watch it right here it's
just<00:02:58.989> different<00:02:59.349> things<00:02:59.680> that<00:02:59.860> you<00:02:59.920> can<00:03:00.010> do

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
just different things that you can do

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.329 
just different things that you can do
and<00:03:01.769> it's<00:03:02.769> pretty<00:03:03.010> much<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.370> thanks<00:03:04.150> guys
