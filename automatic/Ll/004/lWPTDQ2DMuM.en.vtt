00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
but less than I was in a tank was

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.230 
but less than I was in a tank was
against<00:01:19.350> other<00:01:19.530> tanks<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.130> didn't<00:01:20.909> last<00:01:21.090> very

driving to the beach with a tank and
obeying<00:03:00.599> traffic<00:03:00.900> rules<00:03:01.379> sounded<00:03:01.829> boring<00:03:02.040> as

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
obeying traffic rules sounded boring as

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.509 
obeying traffic rules sounded boring as
hell<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.450> bought<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.139> car<00:03:04.409> go<00:03:04.590> Bob<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:05.280> now<00:03:05.459> we
