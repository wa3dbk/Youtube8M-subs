most<00:05:26.650> of<00:05:26.980> your<00:05:27.160> units<00:05:27.550> will<00:05:27.760> move<00:05:27.970> in

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
most of your units will move in

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.320 
most of your units will move in
formations<00:05:28.840> they<00:05:29.590> form<00:05:29.980> a<00:05:30.220> square<00:05:30.670> like<00:05:30.970> shape

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
formations they form a square like shape

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.240 
formations they form a square like shape
that<00:05:31.570> helps<00:05:31.840> them<00:05:31.990> fight<00:05:32.230> together<00:05:32.470> and<00:05:32.890> makes

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
that helps them fight together and makes

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.770 
that helps them fight together and makes
it<00:05:33.400> harder<00:05:33.700> for<00:05:33.730> the<00:05:33.940> enemy<00:05:34.210> to<00:05:34.330> harm<00:05:34.540> them

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
it harder for the enemy to harm them

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.980 
it harder for the enemy to harm them
however<00:05:35.500> moving<00:05:36.250> in<00:05:36.610> formation<00:05:37.300> takes<00:05:37.600> extra

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
however moving in formation takes extra

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.410 
however moving in formation takes extra
time<00:05:38.020> in<00:05:38.650> an<00:05:38.950> addition<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.730> units<00:05:40.060> then<00:05:40.240> move

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
time in an addition the units then move

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.480 
time in an addition the units then move
in<00:05:40.600> formation<00:05:40.900> are<00:05:41.380> more<00:05:41.590> vulnerable<00:05:41.920> from

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
in formation are more vulnerable from

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.270 
in formation are more vulnerable from
the<00:05:42.640> back<00:05:42.790> so<00:05:43.570> it's<00:05:43.840> very<00:05:44.230> important<00:05:44.920> that<00:05:45.010> you
