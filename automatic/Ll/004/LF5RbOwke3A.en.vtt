00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:09.300
 Hi guys how are you? 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.160
 A video that is speaking is thiago do 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.009
 channel free games promptly site 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.070
 free games offers dot com here with 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.390
 Wonderful city buildings like 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.090
 You can see I have one more 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.640
 construction and even a cart in 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.470
 low as you can see and the idea of ​​a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.599
 I can not move or anything else. 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.759
 creativity of those who had the idea is this 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.309
 that it is a simple house. 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.079
 her drawing is strange to the modern house 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.750
 more spending nights staying fine 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.090
 so when you come up here in this case 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:54.750
 is still very dark I do not think the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:57.079
 problem is not the day is the time is 10 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.309
 millions 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.500
 So you see there's a lot not 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.450
 have real estate still in the house and the lighting 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.270
 It is bad inside the house a little 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.680
 dark but it will look really cool but 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.720
 thing that I wanted to show you 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.720
 that many people ask me in my 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.600
 videos is first to find these 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.960
 houses on the internet unfortunately 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.670
 creativity to create nothing yet 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.299
 very active always the idea of 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.680
 someone I've seen I'm using what 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.960
 It has nothing to do with it. 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.909
 but the question that received most as it is 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.640
 what to do to clean these large areas 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.310
 in a short time and that this area that I 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.909
 Clean it up fast to build it. 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.619
 seeing 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.829
 so I'll show you guys have a 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.320
 The tool that was called the area is a 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.399
 plugin if you add minecraft and it 's okay 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.909
 simple 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.590
 basically you just need to install 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.600
 after you install it you can 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.000
 select areas like I'll show 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.020
 here o 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.930
 areas and erase everything you have 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.030
 in this area do not select too large 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.049
 not a relatively large show to go by 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.400
 on here 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.620
 Let me see at what level I'm here. 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:21.900
 6074 is much lower 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:23.790
 34 68 66 because the problem is where it is 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.430
 there someone 64 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.329
 So let's get it here and I'll 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.370
 composition b understand I'll get up if you see 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.590
 which has a whole red area that the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.860
 The area that I selected is seeing the whole 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.780
 this area and it will erase but will pay 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.450
 just because a line because it is 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.829
 only selected first and also 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.420
 not only that I can give the command 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:50.519
 eckstein joins him will select all 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.280
 Let's see if it's going to take everything. 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.160
 some rows here are some more 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.859
 five maybe then I think now it's gone 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.530
 also everything is not selected 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:05.340
 complete area I can use the command 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:10.140
 certain and one is what happens 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:13.640
 all that area that had been deleted 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:18.060
 So that's the way I use it. 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.099
 to be able to clean huge areas understood 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.959
 It's an easier way I do not think 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.859
 There's nothing wrong with this, some people. 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.980
 say you need to use way 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.750
 original is breaking things but 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.870
 Geez, look at the size of the area I 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.239
 I cleaned it in 20 seconds and 30 seconds. 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.519
 so I think it's ok for you to do this 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.810
 to advance your game 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.780
 especially as I want to do 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.549
 huge buildings here like these 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.650
 modern houses and so on I'll create 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.510
 other things more 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.739
 in the past video showed that the village 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.410
 changed places 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.109
 If it's straight that gets there then I'll 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.730
 these walls here because they do not 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.500
 accurate is basically not going to have a 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.260
 beggar here will not have anyone going 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.019
 To want to break into, but to be nice 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.940
 someone from one of a few tips from a 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.549
 of a guy who calls jazz goals 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.079
 the jazz goals something like that maybe me 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.639
 can get in touch with him have a 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.579
 very large channel half a million 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:17.220
 subscribed my time of 30 thousand then type 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.840
 so it's much more really advancing I 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.849
 I do not know if I can get more 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.260
 channel the less chances you have of 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.520
 being able to talk to people 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.590
 because they do not want to but because they 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.930
 are very busy involved with many 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.490
 more things 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.949
 I'll see how he can exchange ideas. 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.930
 maybe record a video you never know but 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.240
 The people I will leave there as I said I will 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.830
 to be working on a server 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.889
 some people gave you some tips 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.509
 some people also want to participate 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.340
 and then I'm doing unfortunately not 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.300
 has long wanted to have enough 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.949
 only time to play games and videos and 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.630
 spending time but unfortunately has 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.330
 secular work and has to do other 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.949
 things too but this one I hope you 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.949
 Have you enjoyed it and until the next
