00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.859
 hello i'm regina funny and me 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.289
 tinker today with you a chain this 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.539
 chain is out of no juice pack 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.490
 Made the most tetra pak 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.980
 Fruit juice is packed inside 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.689
 give them such a silvery surface and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.609
 That's why this chain looks very nice 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.360
 silvery and the light also reflects 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.010
 very easy for this chain needs the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.780
 pure clean juice pack good 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.870
 washed out and dry well 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.540
 two small key rings very thin 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.480
 chain a tape one 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.969
 hangover a scissors and very important one 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.610
 cut underlay and a ruler on 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.449
 best would be to take metal ruler first 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.129
 we the tetra pak and in katar with the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.140
 cutter I already have one 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.000
 Adult help on the edge of the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.670
 then cut away the ground with scissors 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.979
 at the part where the tetra pak 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.220
 glued together is on the edge 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:14.520
 leave and then because where the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.600
 The opening on it is over here 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.240
 cutting away whole length now 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.740
 the ruler and the cat first 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.920
 cut like here on one 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.250
 along a straight line and then 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.939
 on the second and the narrow side 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.939
 also a straight line 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.939
 now we have on the long sides and 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.110
 another one narrow side one straight 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:46.979
 knew the narrow knew it about 18 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.880
 19 cm long and now you are cutting approx 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:56.549
 7 mm wide strips and you need 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.950
 about 20 pieces if all 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.909
 then strips are needed 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.479
 we take the tape and take the first one 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.739
 stripes and spaces in the spiral shape 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.929
 with the metallic side outwards 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.969
 together 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:18.129
 then tear off a piece of adhesive tape 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:22.420
 reopen the snail bit 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.739
 then live together so this should be 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.019
 look like shapes 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.739
 exactly the same thing I do with the 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:33.329
 next again snail-shaped 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.400
 curl up and now the end is due 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:39.159
 in the first stretch in and in 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.079
 two loops i choose them in two 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.349
 One of the loops is a compact one 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.840
 falls more beautiful then I break in again 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.250
 piece of tape and sticks too 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.220
 this part together 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.159
 I do the third strip exactly like that 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.250
 like the second last strip number 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.879
 20 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.819
 also roll up in the snail 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.049
 stick in it 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.489
 Now the chain is almost done now 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.269
 all we need is the shutter 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.549
 do it on it 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.819
 I'll take one of these 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:16.060
 key rings and hang on one 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.560
 end of chain on key rings 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.229
 you get in the ironmonger's shop 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.859
 or in the store and also one 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:26.620
 small mini carabiner the second 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.579
 Keyring actually on the other 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:34.810
 end and at the same time due 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:37.720
 the mini carabiner on and already is 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.909
 our chain finished and you have now 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.090
 either a present for your best 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.590

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.329
