what makes leap angkot pattern unique is

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.410 
what makes leap angkot pattern unique is
it<00:00:34.860> was<00:00:35.010> specifically<00:00:35.520> designed<00:00:35.790> from<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
it was specifically designed from the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.170 
it was specifically designed from the
beginning<00:00:36.620> to<00:00:37.620> work<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:38.070> much<00:00:38.219> closer<00:00:38.550> ranges

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
beginning to work at much closer ranges

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.760 
beginning to work at much closer ranges
than<00:00:39.360> any<00:00:39.570> other<00:00:39.809> traditional<00:00:39.989> camouflage

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
than any other traditional camouflage

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.220 
than any other traditional camouflage
pattern<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:42.239> was<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.750> was<00:00:42.809> something<00:00:43.050> we

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
pattern this was a this was something we

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.840 
pattern this was a this was something we
particularly<00:00:43.559> noticed<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> requirement

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
particularly noticed as a requirement

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.660 
particularly noticed as a requirement
due<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> kind<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.379> operational<00:00:47.070> necessity

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
due to the kind of operational necessity

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.619 
due to the kind of operational necessity
of<00:00:48.050> law<00:00:49.050> enforcement<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.860> military<00:00:50.129> up

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
of law enforcement and military up

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.369 
of law enforcement and military up
personnel<00:00:51.629> today<00:00:52.160> we<00:00:53.160> also<00:00:53.340> noted<00:00:54.000> that

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
personnel today we also noted that

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.689 
personnel today we also noted that
traditional<00:00:55.379> camouflage<00:00:55.829> patterns<00:00:56.309> didn't

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
traditional camouflage patterns didn't

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.750 
traditional camouflage patterns didn't
work<00:00:56.910> well<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.629> non-traditional<00:00:58.670> woodland<00:00:59.670> or

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
work well in non-traditional woodland or

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.400 
work well in non-traditional woodland or
non<00:00:59.910> traditional<00:01:00.120> desert<00:01:00.719> type<00:01:01.260> of

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
non traditional desert type of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.500 
non traditional desert type of
environments<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.100> that's<00:01:02.250> why<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:03.090> created

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
environments so that's why we we created

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690 
environments so that's why we we created
the<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.140> badlands<00:01:04.769> transitional<00:01:05.369> pattern

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the the badlands transitional pattern

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.990 
the the badlands transitional pattern
what<00:01:06.630> also<00:01:06.780> makes<00:01:07.170> Penn<00:01:07.470> cot<00:01:07.710> unique<00:01:08.100> apart

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
what also makes Penn cot unique apart

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.810 
what also makes Penn cot unique apart
from<00:01:09.119> its<00:01:09.299> name<00:01:09.510> which<00:01:09.720> by<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.930> way<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
from its name which by the way is a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.219 
from its name which by the way is a
combination<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.210> surnames<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.110> two

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
combination of the surnames of two

British camouflage pioneers from World
War<00:01:14.970> two<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.540> what<00:01:16.259> makes<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.619> unique<00:01:16.740> amongst

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
War two but what makes it unique amongst

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.880 
War two but what makes it unique amongst
pattern<00:01:17.670> designs<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.450> what<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.409> call<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
pattern designs is what we call it a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.670 
pattern designs is what we call it a
three<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.549> pattern<00:01:20.939> geometry<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.560> has

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
three in one pattern geometry so it has

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.580 
three in one pattern geometry so it has
a<00:01:22.710> micro<00:01:23.280> pattern<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:24.090> very<00:01:24.360> fine<00:01:24.780> detail<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
a micro pattern for very fine detail a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.980 
a micro pattern for very fine detail a
MIDI<00:01:26.310> pattern<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.270> sort<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.780> mid-range

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
MIDI pattern for sort of mid-range

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.530 
MIDI pattern for sort of mid-range
detail<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.009> then<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.250> macro<00:01:29.970> pattern<00:01:30.360> which<00:01:30.509> is

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
detail and then a macro pattern which is

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.600 
detail and then a macro pattern which is
the<00:01:30.780> larger<00:01:31.140> elements<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:32.130> longer<00:01:32.460> range

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the larger elements for longer range

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.240 
the larger elements for longer range
disruption<00:01:33.360> why<00:01:34.350> that's<00:01:34.619> unique<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.220> that

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
disruption why that's unique is that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.060 
disruption why that's unique is that
most<00:01:35.640> patterns<00:01:36.090> are<00:01:36.299> either<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.229> macro

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
most patterns are either just a macro

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.910 
most patterns are either just a macro
pattern<00:01:38.549> or<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.360> micro<00:01:39.810> pattern<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.530> ours<00:01:40.710> is

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
pattern or a micro pattern but ours is

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.620 
pattern or a micro pattern but ours is
unique<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.610> has<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.909> third<00:01:42.240> element

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
unique in that it has that third element

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.090 
unique in that it has that third element
the<00:01:42.750> MIDI<00:01:42.960> pattern<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.619> get<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the MIDI pattern so you get the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.039 
the MIDI pattern so you get the
close-range<00:01:44.610> concealment<00:01:45.570> mid<00:01:45.810> range

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
close-range concealment mid range

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.780 
close-range concealment mid range
concealment<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.340> long<00:01:47.549> range

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
concealment and the long range

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.679 
concealment and the long range
concealment<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.509> disruption<00:01:50.240> so<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.450> said

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
concealment and disruption so as I said

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.780 
concealment and disruption so as I said
we<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.710> family<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.159> patterns<00:01:53.610> we

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
we have it's a family of patterns we

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.219 
we have it's a family of patterns we
have<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.090> transitional<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.110> the

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
as I say it's it's very unique in in

as I say it's it's very unique in in

terms of patterns that are currently
available<00:02:06.909> we<00:02:07.909> think<00:02:08.179> in<00:02:08.690> fact<00:02:08.720> we've<00:02:09.050> got<00:02:09.080> the

the analysis results that show that its
