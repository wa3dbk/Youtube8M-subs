00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
I usually play it so each person usually

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.240 
I usually play it so each person usually
starts<00:00:36.120> off<00:00:36.500> with<00:00:37.500> about<00:00:38.899> 7<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:41.030> 5<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.270> 7<00:00:42.600> cards

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
starts off with about 7 and 5 to 7 cards

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.790 
starts off with about 7 and 5 to 7 cards
so<00:00:44.250> we'll<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:47.629> um<00:00:48.800> just

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
so we'll just do that and then um just

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.920 
so we'll just do that and then um just
two<00:00:49.920> cards<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> middle<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.140> yeah<00:00:52.289> um<00:00:53.930> they

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
two cards the middle so yeah um they

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.560 
two cards the middle so yeah um they
just<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> game<00:00:55.850> run<00:00:56.850> out<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.030> cards<00:00:57.329> as

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
just to the game run out of cards as

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.979 
just to the game run out of cards as
quick<00:00:57.809> run<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.949> cards<00:00:59.460> in<00:01:00.030> your<00:01:00.480> hand

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
quick run out of cards in your hand

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.920 
quick run out of cards in your hand
before<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.530> other<00:01:01.680> guy<00:01:01.890> does<00:01:04.250> yeah<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
before the other guy does yeah so you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.030 
before the other guy does yeah so you
know<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.979> has<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.430> match<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:11.030> suit<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:13.040> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
know and it has to match the suit or the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.270 
know and it has to match the suit or the
number<00:01:14.610> or<00:01:14.729> whatnot<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.920> would<00:01:17.130> work

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
number or whatnot so this would work

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.350 
number or whatnot so this would work
because<00:01:19.009> if<00:01:20.009> these<00:01:20.729> two<00:01:22.009> match<00:01:23.360> obviously

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
because if these two match obviously

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.560 
because if these two match obviously
this<00:01:24.869> suit<00:01:25.049> doesn't<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:26.150> that's<00:01:27.150> not<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
this suit doesn't but that's not the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.630 
this suit doesn't but that's not the
point<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:29.810> this<00:01:30.810> would<00:01:31.020> work<00:01:31.640> because

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
point and then this would work because

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.910 
point and then this would work because
of<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.060> same<00:01:33.299> suit<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:34.380> would<00:01:34.560> work<00:01:34.710> because

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
of the same suit this would work because

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.700 
of the same suit this would work because
the<00:01:35.340> same<00:01:35.579> suit<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:37.350> over<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
the same suit and it's one over the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.840 
the same suit and it's one over the
other<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.869> this<00:01:39.869> one<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:41.280> next<00:01:41.430> guy<00:01:41.700> would

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
other so this one the next guy would

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.700 
other so this one the next guy would
have<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.000> match<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.570> sevens<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.530> this

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
have to match the sevens and so this

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.980 
have to match the sevens and so this
would<00:01:43.829> work<00:01:45.380> yeah<00:01:46.640> so<00:01:47.640> what<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:48.180> here<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
would work yeah so what I have here is a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.590 
would work yeah so what I have here is a
bunch<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> cards<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.430> special<00:01:50.700> actions<00:01:51.299> in

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
bunch of cards to do special actions in

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.340 
bunch of cards to do special actions in
this<00:01:51.810> game<00:01:52.430> we'll<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.640> start<00:01:53.820> off<00:01:53.939> with<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
this game we'll just start off with the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.249 
this game we'll just start off with the
jacket<00:01:55.700> each<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.030> jacks<00:01:57.329> allow<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.899> to

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
jacket each of the jacks allow you to

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.219 
jacket each of the jacks allow you to
jump<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.799> person's<00:01:59.340> turn<00:01:59.719> if<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.930> are<00:02:01.020> just

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
jump a person's turn if you are just

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.539 
jump a person's turn if you are just
playing<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.530> two-player<00:02:01.950> game<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:02.399> that

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
playing a two-player game then that

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.420 
playing a two-player game then that
means<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.000> goes<00:02:03.149> automatically<00:02:03.780> back<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.170> you

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
means it goes automatically back to you

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.109 
means it goes automatically back to you
so<00:02:05.430> let's<00:02:05.700> say<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.719> player<00:02:07.079> 1<00:02:07.849> puts<00:02:08.849> down<00:02:09.090> a

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
so let's say that player 1 puts down a

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.290 
so let's say that player 1 puts down a
jack

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
jack

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.980 
jack
it<00:02:10.960> go<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.290> player<00:02:11.680> three<00:02:12.040> automatically<00:02:12.990> kind

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
it go to player three automatically kind

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.970 
it go to player three automatically kind
of<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.730> jerky<00:02:15.730> booth<00:02:15.970> but<00:02:16.300> it's<00:02:17.200> how<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.500> works

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
of a jerky booth but it's how it works

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.150 
of a jerky booth but it's how it works
oh<00:02:19.740> yeah<00:02:20.790> then<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.910> have<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.180> Kings<00:02:23.160> these

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
oh yeah then you have the Kings these

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.220 
oh yeah then you have the Kings these
really<00:02:24.610> only<00:02:24.760> ill<00:02:24.970> effect<00:02:25.300> if<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.600> have<00:02:25.870> three

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
really only ill effect if you have three

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.440 
really only ill effect if you have three
or<00:02:26.260> more<00:02:26.410> players<00:02:26.710> in<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.130> game<00:02:27.280> but<00:02:28.120> what<00:02:28.330> it

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
or more players in the game but what it

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.330 
or more players in the game but what it
will<00:02:28.510> do<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:28.960> reverse<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.380> order<00:02:29.740> so<00:02:30.130> let's

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
will do is reverse the order so let's

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.300 
will do is reverse the order so let's
say<00:02:30.550> it's<00:02:30.900> players<00:02:31.900> one<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:32.560> then<00:02:32.680> 200<00:02:33.130> three

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
say it's players one and then 200 three

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.430 
say it's players one and then 200 three
and<00:02:33.430> then<00:02:33.520> four<00:02:33.760> they'll<00:02:34.720> switch<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.290> order

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
and then four they'll switch the order

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.000 
and then four they'll switch the order
so<00:02:35.710> be<00:02:35.860> player<00:02:36.040> four<00:02:36.430> three<00:02:36.700> two<00:02:36.880> one<00:02:37.830> if<00:02:38.830> you

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
so be player four three two one if you

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.560 
so be player four three two one if you
ever<00:02:39.040> played<00:02:39.460> uno<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:39.970> kind<00:02:40.210> of<00:02:40.240> like<00:02:40.390> that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
ever played uno is kind of like that

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.290 
ever played uno is kind of like that
switch<00:02:40.900> card<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:42.460> twos<00:02:44.520> they<00:02:45.520> just<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:46.090> draw

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
switch card the twos they just you draw

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.690 
switch card the twos they just you draw
two<00:02:46.510> cards<00:02:46.540> if<00:02:46.990> you<00:02:47.080> place<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.440> down<00:02:47.620> so<00:02:48.430> let's

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
two cards if you place it down so let's

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.870 
two cards if you place it down so let's
just<00:02:48.850> say<00:02:49.170> somebody<00:02:50.170> puts<00:02:50.440> down<00:02:50.620> to

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
just say somebody puts down to

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.430 
just say somebody puts down to
two-player<00:02:51.880> to<00:02:52.120> what<00:02:52.330> has<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.480> draw<00:02:52.810> two<00:02:52.990> cards

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
two-player to what has to draw two cards

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.690 
two-player to what has to draw two cards
but<00:02:53.770> if<00:02:54.580> player<00:02:55.150> two<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.870> another<00:02:56.830> two<00:02:57.070> then

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
but if player two and another two then

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.310 
but if player two and another two then
that<00:02:57.910> means<00:02:58.090> player<00:02:58.330> three<00:02:58.870> would<00:02:59.050> have<00:02:59.080> to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
that means player three would have to

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.130 
that means player three would have to
draw<00:02:59.530> four<00:02:59.980> cards<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:01.300> side<00:03:01.510> continues

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
draw four cards and the side continues

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.940 
draw four cards and the side continues
player<00:03:02.560> four<00:03:03.370> draws<00:03:04.030> six<00:03:04.750> cards<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.590> then

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
player four draws six cards and then

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.100 
player four draws six cards and then
another<00:03:06.670> one<00:03:06.910> there<00:03:07.090> player<00:03:07.450> one<00:03:07.720> rejoin

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
another one there player one rejoin

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.820 
another one there player one rejoin
which<00:03:08.530> would<00:03:08.680> be<00:03:08.800> really<00:03:08.950> Zen<00:03:10.590> yeah

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
which would be really Zen yeah

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.030 
which would be really Zen yeah
then<00:03:12.700> these<00:03:12.910> guys<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:14.260> eights<00:03:14.470> are<00:03:14.680> just<00:03:14.860> one

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
then these guys the eights are just one

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.190 
then these guys the eights are just one
of<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.220> cards<00:03:15.520> so<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.060> can<00:03:16.270> just<00:03:16.450> say<00:03:16.630> put<00:03:17.110> an

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
least that's how we play it so let's

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.080 
least that's how we play it so let's
just<00:03:56.110> say<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:57.070> can<00:03:57.220> place<00:03:57.430> down<00:03:57.670> this<00:03:57.880> nine

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
another player says you didn't say last

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.460 
another player says you didn't say last
then<00:04:03.520> you<00:04:03.640> have<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.910> draw<00:04:04.120> another<00:04:04.330> card<00:04:04.480> so

then you have to draw another card so

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.470 
then you have to draw another card so
just<00:04:05.830> be<00:04:05.950> careful<00:04:06.100> about<00:04:06.370> that<00:04:09.269> yeah<00:04:10.269> that's

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480
