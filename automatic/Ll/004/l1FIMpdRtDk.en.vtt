 Leadership and also in the pretty Wednesday not reached around I wanted 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.630
 today like to have an elegant send with you 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:10.230
 speak 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.269
 Blue coat 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.029
 he thinks that is a fact that terrorists are after zig for me 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.400
 has come up with 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.960
 and it goes with it and those who have tried the left is many 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.050
 love gone 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.019
 a little Heinze 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.219
 When I heard about it, I was already an old flame because there is 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.300
 some things that I've tried by that with it at all 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.180
 liked 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.560
 well that's what I think is a pretty normal thing to do when you start 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.510
 make-up and Dedicated Skokan is trying to make a song tonight 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.230
 or 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.160
 to try out what maybe one on to another person totally super great 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.030
 says out 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.880
 then you might look a bit strange yourself 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.400
 but I think it will be tips 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.180
 try different things 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.200
 and therefore 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.280
 around 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.510
 he did not seem to me that she herself could not tell about it 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.350
 or not right away 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.810
 huge stage Johanna increased from 2 0 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.950
 So what motorsport has its first one and now makes it with the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.940
 eyebrows 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.930
 Purpose is 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.930
 the thing is, I had Damian hair 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.659
 cooled and then they were here 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.890
 really round 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.580
 and percent 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.650
 well I 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.650
 No to tell her to let me adjust 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.540
 and they are a bit 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.340
 Schrodt 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.980
 and is a lot much worse than should be 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.100
 around 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.980
 I think I'll take a picture here 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.359
 to escape 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.840
 I mean how seriously can that be that 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.360
 Eyebrows are the ones 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.920
 to fit my face 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.360
 I also do not know what rode me there 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.280
 percent 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.930
 No idea then for a while was of the opinion that me Kaplan lower 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.080
 Eyelash line judgment well stands for example Aldi are Legion 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.529
 and Percent is also a stylus every decision so I do not know anything 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:13.049
 that's simply not through my eyes project with my halfway 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.949
 Percent mediocre bags 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:20.739
 It does not look good that the ITG just does not look good and what I get 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.040
 thought but no longer busy thinking about this video 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:28.799
 and Saturday were trying black 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.580
 ours looks just as bad, but in real life it still sees a lot 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:33.759
 worse from their 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:37.549
 in the video, I also have so many times on the lips who this is currently rank 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.119
 in the video, I also limp on the etna for his business of 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.969
 Mac 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.889
 and that's a mistake 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.679
 chi-x is children's kid 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:48.409
 Forecast 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.599
 and it's one of those really beautiful colors but with my skin 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.559
 she has been doing quite well and has spent all day out of money and money 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:59.849
 in combination with the moment 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.949
 that means like 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.850
 And then there were the eyebrows 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.440
 So I think that's pretty much the picture I care for the most 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.730
 and 2 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.229
 could be advised 2 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:14.430
 by one degree 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.809
 I mean hello 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:18.589
 Spammers Ouest 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.589
 There is absolutely nothing at all 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.249
 Tarvajärvi Richard Stallman 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:26.139
 but calm 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.029
 I still have it with her friend and Dr 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.349
 he is very good at standing 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.679
 and percent 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:36.349
 that was tactically fueled almost the end of cold prose the lipsticks 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.149
 about me 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:40.379
 I still have the one point to get again victories from the university 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.019
 Taze will also show how awesome she looks in her 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.120
 I do not even know if he does not buy it on hand 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.590
 since part of super and I took then because even in 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.489
 many weapons for the county league on YouTube 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.489
 to chat 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:58.699
 Arrived home 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.699
 I even wear it a few times and summer 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:05.309
 but also rather zuzuspitzen look in the mirror 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.639
 I have come - just imagine that is incredible 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.639
 Vogue and and drove their survey fact 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:15.939
 What then criticism yes Red 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:16.780
 more 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.629
 no matter how much you wear 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:23.940
 RG took care of us Ah yes, lately I had that black dress 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:28.479
 I think it was even talk he did not give Brown worn outside 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.439
 and Dominik 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.479
 in Piesport so many races again 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.159
 and finally the game came that could look good in things 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:37.960
 also attend lessons 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.960
 and been in Freest 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.900
 Not 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.900
 Goa 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:51.819
 So they let the things that come to mind spontaneously 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.099
 Percent certainly there is more about what I shake my head 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.059
 could 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:59.879
 become 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:01.479
 I think 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.880
 something else than what I do now 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.800
 So things are a danger but not necessarily so great 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.980
 Play back I think it's a pretty long way to go 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.030
 So find out 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.009
 a thing for me has never been a particularly good one 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.539
 and right have a particularly good standing 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.849
 But I personally think that you are not stuck on it 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.110
 for example »says for example 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.639
 when a 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.639
 Lau and not so super mega good knees 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:32.710
 percent 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.099
 was great 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.089
 at the court 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:38.559
 Percent Brown Björn Brown Purple Blue and Brown Burned 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:42.270
 alban-plant is not very good in women as well as the Kiel 

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:45.269
 For me it does not look like you should do without Blur 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.310
 I'm much too 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.789
 percent 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:54.300
 Dr ORTEC 40 percent that's what I was looking for 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.139
 because 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.610
 I'm someone who likes to try new things and 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.969
 Let's see, it comes with Tusk 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:04.080
 embarrassing banks 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.169
 I'll never let that go, at least that and this one 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.669
 Schwarzenau's tour of those thick eyebrows, by the way, percent the photon 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.479
 before asking here, I had my camera and I would never have Bordeaux 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.479
 The camera app could only use the colors 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.580
 because of my hair not good the lot 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.490
 Since I have now only the rain if the party had to leave and 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.189
 individual users facilitate this kind I think that here Wiesent 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:41.029
 OTB and TV for the rest I do not know how many of you have that 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:44.900
 Cube that he actually knows that's such a block I had a propos after 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.210
 Armenia 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.469
 and percent since I have already tasted for example in the team back Cranberry 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.809
 I am threatened with this beautiful euro I have from NEC 

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:57.339
 and around 

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:58.380
 yes, what do you mean 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.580
 the more optimistic after the cup-ko balance and I have there now too 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.849
 Put online in the NPP to the cave Oscar for the private label of Tobias 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:07.419
 so 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:11.349
 Euro and my whole is completely change what can be on the program 

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:15.810
 that Tillich also regularly suffer from what my thoughts are 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.529
 and so 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:19.029
 So if the beets borrowed 

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:21.439
 I know as it usually does with me 

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:24.889
 before anything in the video with it first in the village at the time 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:26.610
 Game works fast and so on 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.780
 for him how long is Friedrichsdorf pine nuts say like me 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.389
 I'm critical of my God, I have time to pay attention to two 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.180
 b 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.180
 otherwise there are also regular ones 

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:44.749
 Look over it seemed first what I have threatened so high so far 

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:48.789
 and in the info box, however, most of the right nail ablate and where you already first 

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:49.749
 and so 

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:54.070
 but not because I do not like to answer questions in those comments or something 

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.560
 I really like that 

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.830
 Aabar's parents do not have to constantly answer the same question with themselves 

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.729
 I wonder if the answers and also comments and 

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.580
 disputed are expression 

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.500
