00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.080
 Hello dear colleagues in touch 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.889
 Yevgeny Mitskevich 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.009
 in this video i will tell you what's new in 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.789
 version 2 3 of the program kiwi books 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.650
 the calculator has changed first 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.010
 port area entry procedure 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.590
 if earlier we asked a multiplier 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.260
 one and a half or more or less now 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.189
 at the request of users 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.719
 i changed the input order and now we 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.780
 will be sports area right away 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.500
 and the multiplier is calculated based on 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.230
 Iâ€™ll change my entered numbers for example 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.570
 a value of 277 to a large one 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.510
 let's say 400 as you see the multiplier 3 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.750
 The following innovation was considered 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.350
 Added ability to export format 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.500
 dxf 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.469
 what dxf format gives us 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.079
 that you can our three-dimensional 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.019
 image further viewed in 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.820
 any package that works with 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.680
 three-dimensional graphics such as all such 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.180
 from google sketchup and some others 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.729
 we are most interested in google 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.369
 sketchup this program has a good 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.259
 visualization of three-dimensional objects if 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.350
 someone works in 3d max 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.310
 dxf files can be imported and 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.350
 in that program 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.720
 what program to choose for visualization 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.450
 this is for the case of personal choice 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.020
 here we look at the interaction with 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.630
 google sky chat as most 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.340
 mass used well means for 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.549
 order to perform 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.060
 export to dxf format we need to choose 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.970
 command project export to dxf but now 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.899
 this command is not available yet because 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.210
 as you can see we have no data here 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.049
 for exporting then there is no panel 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.040
 calculated click the button to calculate 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.630
 now we can perform 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.130
 use the export dxf command 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.469
 choose the units in which we will 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.760
 export drawing millimeters meters 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.490
 Where 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.580
 we feet the main thing so that later 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.010
 units you chose in the program where 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.490
 will import this three-dimensional 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.710
 an object 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.660
 well now we choose millimeters system 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.230
 invites us to choose the file type 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.350
 dxf he is not here one another and offers 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.530
 for the saved file the name of the current 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:39.680
 project this case of war to 250 is 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.160
 name i I'll leave even my save our 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.440
 project 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.090
 exported now we can 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.150
 import it 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.600
 google sketchup go to this 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.600
 the program 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:03.030
 and import it here because 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.790
 the object will be placed at the beginning 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.680
 coordinates and here this guy 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.880
 we would like to move a little 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.700
 otherwise the box hurts him in the legs 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.880
 let's move it somewhere for 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:25.160
 the limits here are a little further on here 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:29.720
 ok and select the import file command 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.650
 Here we select the type of dvd and dxf files and 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.340
 find our file which we 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.360
 imported here from war to 250 before 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.490
 than click open 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.060
 let's go here a button 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.310
 captions select the units they are 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.060
 must be the same as when exporting 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.850
 us random meter push y kelly and 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.900
 open here appear service 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.810
 message how many objects 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.180
 imported so on click class 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.370
 We look at our box to give my 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.390
 let's reduce it a little bit 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.840
 we turn 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.209
 to make it easier to work with him 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.500
 Now our task as you can see here 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:12.209
 hole non-through drawers holes when 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.940
 export is calculated automatically 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.370
 so that for example here in the design 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.190
 mattress but accounted for just his 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.490
 place or if it's some other 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.400
 hole location design 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.900
 it is selected exactly in the middle of the front 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.000
 the panels do not well penetrate here 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.680
 just a circle because well it 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.110
 due to features 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.210
 conversion formats xxiv means us 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.510
 need to get through holes for 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.870
 we need to break it first 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:50.540
 this solid object on the details like this 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.370
 execute select the select tool 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.690
 we click on the object because it is entirely 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.680
 flashed now choose team sees 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.050
 component and 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.710
 explode i.e. break split to 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.550
 parts click somewhere aside 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.480
 just now every component 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.680
 presents 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.160
 each part represents 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.750
 separate component the following is what we 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:18.800
 do we allocate neatly 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:22.410
 the contour of our circle is pushing along the contour 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.350
 click on the contour of our circle to those 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.420
 until it is highlighted in blue 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.270
 the color of the first attempt may not 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.830
 we can even slightly increase 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.830
 to make it easier to get on it 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:42.090
 shared well now choose teams 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:47.220
 to edit intersect intersect look here 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:52.080
 so good now take the tool 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:55.830
 push-pull extrusion and press our 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.810
 circle inside the box got through 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.560
 hole everything now from now on we 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:05.520
 we can work with our box like us 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:09.270
 wish for example you can affix 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:13.340
 dimensions let's do this let's do 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.340
 let's do this a little bit turn around 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:23.889
 after some manipulations we get 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:27.699
 something like this picture that we 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:34.629
 now we can if you wish in more detail 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:39.960
 consider a print word 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:39.960
 work with her as we will need 

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:49.029
 unfortunately such import dxf format 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.779
 impossible in the eighth version of google 

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:55.749
 download 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:58.120
 more precisely in the free version so if 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:07:01.439
 you want to work with the format of the indexes 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.439
 you two ways either 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:07.629
 get version 7 of google sketchup 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:10.779
 if you do not have it, write to me in PM 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:11.229
 I will help you either install yourself version 

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:14.169
 about 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:16.270
 paid version google sketchup which one 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:19.240
 of these options, choose everyone decides for 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.110
 yourself yourself one more small 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.819
 comment 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:27.909
 as you can see in this picture are missing 

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:31.259
 kerchiefs ie there is no clearance 

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:31.259
 cornering these elements 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.639
 I don't see it big yet 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.949
 need well if it will be very 

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:41.400
 necessary in principle, this is not 

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:44.220
 difficult and so in this short video we 

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.470
 looked what gives new opportunities 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.710
 you version 23 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:52.039
 like a calculator box for updates 

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:56.910
 please contact me in PM 

00:07:52.039 --> 00:08:01.070
 I will answer all the questions will solve thanks for 

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:01.070
 attention with you was Yevgeny Mitskevich
