00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
a whole great big range and we didn't

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.400

want to kind of one-off guitar either so
we<00:01:10.940> decided<00:01:11.940> that<00:01:12.149> we<00:01:12.300> kind<00:01:12.660> of<00:01:12.750> commemorate

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
we decided that we kind of commemorate

we decided that we kind of commemorate
the<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.399> Titanic<00:01:15.090> theme<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.410> places

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the the Titanic theme with the places

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
the the Titanic theme with the places
that<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.430> Titanic<00:01:18.180> was<00:01:18.810> associated<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.830> so

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
that the Titanic was associated with so

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.490 
that the Titanic was associated with so

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
hence we've got the Southampton parlor

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.050 
hence we've got the Southampton parlor
because<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.740> Titanic<00:01:26.310> was<00:01:26.460> sailing<00:01:26.700> from

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
because the Titanic was sailing from

Southampton<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.990> New<00:01:28.020> York<00:01:28.500> hence<00:01:28.860> we've<00:01:29.100> got

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
Southampton to New York hence we've got
