the<00:02:27.140> whole<00:02:27.170> storyline<00:02:27.740> is<00:02:28.070> very<00:02:28.430> complicated

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
the whole storyline is very complicated

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.520 
the whole storyline is very complicated
it's<00:02:29.300> something<00:02:29.660> that<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.900> designers<00:02:30.410> are

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
it's something that the designers are

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.940 
it's something that the designers are
literally<00:02:30.800> made<00:02:31.010> up<00:02:31.190> oh<00:02:33.340> yeah<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:35.440> know<00:02:36.440> maybe<00:02:36.830> I

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
literally made up oh yeah I know maybe I

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.500 
literally made up oh yeah I know maybe I
shouldn't<00:02:37.190> have<00:02:37.310> gone<00:02:37.490> for<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:38.060> don't

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
shouldn't have gone for that I don't

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.990 
shouldn't have gone for that I don't
know<00:02:38.600> if<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.440> QED<00:02:39.860> comes<00:02:40.100> up<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.460> may<00:02:40.610> pick<00:02:40.850> that

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
know if the QED comes up I may pick that

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.670 
know if the QED comes up I may pick that
up<00:02:41.060> in<00:02:41.240> a<00:02:41.300> step<00:02:41.480> but<00:02:41.570> this<00:02:41.660> is<00:02:41.840> more<00:02:42.050> more

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
up in a step but this is more more

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.140 
up in a step but this is more more
useful<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.130> be<00:02:43.190> honest<00:02:43.720> yes<00:02:44.720> picked<00:02:44.990> up<00:02:46.150> this

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
useful to be honest yes picked up this

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.730 
useful to be honest yes picked up this
is<00:02:47.270> a<00:02:47.330> one-hit<00:02:47.660> ko<00:02:47.840> when<00:02:48.110> it's<00:02:48.230> pack-a-punch<00:02:48.500> I

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
is a one-hit ko when it's pack-a-punch I

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.760 
is a one-hit ko when it's pack-a-punch I
think<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.220> think<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.790> think<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:50.120> starts<00:02:50.420> being<00:02:50.540> a

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
think I think I think it starts being a

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.050 
think I think I think it starts being a
jumper<00:02:51.770> man<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.160> think<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.580> stops<00:02:52.820> being<00:02:53.000> a

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
jumper man I think it stops being a

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.610 
jumper man I think it stops being a
one-hit<00:02:53.330> ko<00:02:53.540> like<00:02:53.870> after<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> certain

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
one-hit ko like after a certain

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.400 
one-hit ko like after a certain
background<00:02:54.770> but<00:02:55.370> oh<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:57.110> thought<00:02:57.260> it's<00:02:57.380> very

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
background but oh I thought it's very

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.000 
background but oh I thought it's very
gun<00:02:57.710> for<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:57.950> second<00:02:58.160> I<00:02:58.220> was<00:02:58.280> like<00:02:58.340> ray<00:02:58.580> gun<00:02:58.850> ray

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
gun for a second I was like ray gun ray

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.830 
gun for a second I was like ray gun ray
gun<00:03:01.010> ah<00:03:03.970> I'm<00:03:04.970> gonna<00:03:05.120> do<00:03:05.270> that<00:03:05.420> thing<00:03:05.630> where<00:03:05.810> I

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
gun ah I'm gonna do that thing where I

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.200 
gun ah I'm gonna do that thing where I
pack<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.050> punch<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.670> sorry<00:03:07.670> get<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:07.940> hacking

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
pack a punch the sorry get the hacking

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.920 
pack a punch the sorry get the hacking
device<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.660> take<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:08.900> into<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.140> room<00:03:09.320> I<00:03:10.930> think

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
device and take it into the room I think

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.180 
device and take it into the room I think
it<00:03:12.050> takes<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.290> while<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.500> pack<00:03:12.800> a<00:03:12.830> punch

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
it takes a while to pack a punch

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.610 
it takes a while to pack a punch
earth<00:03:13.460> such<00:03:14.360> in<00:03:14.450> lieu<00:03:14.600> of<00:03:14.630> words<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.200> think<00:03:15.470> it

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
earth such in lieu of words I think it

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.960 
earth such in lieu of words I think it
takes<00:03:15.770> a<00:03:15.890> while<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.460> actually<00:03:18.130> hack<00:03:19.130> it<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:19.400> it

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
takes a while to actually hack it so it

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.100 
takes a while to actually hack it so it
may<00:03:20.240> not<00:03:20.270> be<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.540> best<00:03:20.660> idea

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
may not be the best idea

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.949 
may not be the best idea

bullet but touched him gave him the

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.150 
bullet but touched him gave him the
point<00:03:55.190> bit<00:03:55.370> really<00:03:55.670> isn't<00:03:55.790> I<00:03:56.770> do<00:03:57.770> like<00:03:58.040> the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
point bit really isn't I do like the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160 
point bit really isn't I do like the
commando<00:03:58.640> you<00:03:59.330> think<00:03:59.480> we<00:03:59.540> should<00:03:59.660> upgrade<00:03:59.810> it

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170
