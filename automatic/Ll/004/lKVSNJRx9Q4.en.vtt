one<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> characteristics<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.710> make

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
one of the characteristics that make

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.920 
one of the characteristics that make
them<00:00:35.160> very<00:00:35.190> unique<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.059> fact<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.420> they

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
them very unique is the fact that they

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.080 
them very unique is the fact that they
have<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> pretty<00:00:37.380> plain<00:00:37.770> solid<00:00:38.160> coat<00:00:38.610> there<00:00:39.030> are

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
have a pretty plain solid coat there are

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.790 
have a pretty plain solid coat there are
only<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.270> few<00:00:39.510> other<00:00:39.690> cats<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.590> that

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
only a few other cats that have that

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.799 
only a few other cats that have that
sort<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.160> coat<00:00:41.370> without<00:00:41.579> markings<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.480> that

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
sort of coat without markings and that

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.380 
sort of coat without markings and that
would<00:00:42.930> be<00:00:43.050> Cougars<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.620> lions<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.390> strangely

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
would be Cougars and lions and strangely

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.940 
would be Cougars and lions and strangely
enough<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:45.840> are<00:00:45.870> about<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> same<00:00:46.469> color<00:00:46.710> as

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
enough they are about the same color as

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.130 
enough they are about the same color as
the<00:00:46.980> caracals<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:48.360> caracals<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.840> jet-black

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the caracals the caracals have jet-black

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.660 
the caracals the caracals have jet-black
years<00:00:51.289> the<00:00:52.289> back<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.620> their<00:00:52.710> ears<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:53.280> black

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
years the back of their ears are black

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.760 
years the back of their ears are black
and<00:00:53.940> they<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.360> long<00:00:54.629> tufts<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
and they have long tufts just like the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.010 
and they have long tufts just like the
Lynx<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.160> that's<00:00:56.309> probably<00:00:56.520> why<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.690> lot<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
Lynx so that's probably why a lot of

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.389 
Lynx so that's probably why a lot of
people<00:00:58.079> associated<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:58.890> them<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
people associated with them with the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.630 
people associated with them with the
Lynx<00:00:59.670> or<00:00:59.760> thought<00:00:59.940> they<00:01:00.090> were<00:01:00.149> related<00:01:00.690> so

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
Lynx or thought they were related so

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.039 
Lynx or thought they were related so
caracoles<00:01:02.640> are<00:01:02.760> found<00:01:03.000> throughout<00:01:03.420> Africa

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
caracoles are found throughout Africa

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.240 
caracoles are found throughout Africa
and<00:01:04.260> they're<00:01:04.379> actually<00:01:04.530> found<00:01:04.979> through<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
strangely enough geographically caracals

strangely enough geographically caracals
are<00:01:09.000> found<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> same<00:01:09.600> areas<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.290> you

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
are found in the same areas that you

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.429 
are found in the same areas that you
find<00:01:10.680> cheetahs<00:01:11.659> and<00:01:12.659> cheetahs<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.080> caracals

find cheetahs and cheetahs and caracals

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.200 
find cheetahs and cheetahs and caracals
were<00:01:13.560> found<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.159> actually<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> same

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
were found in actually the same

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.090 
were found in actually the same
locations<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.009> the

locations and one of the one of the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.800 
locations and one of the one of the
things<00:01:17.310> about<00:01:17.700> these<00:01:17.939> two<00:01:18.150> species<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.689> they

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
things about these two species is they

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.020 
things about these two species is they
were<00:01:18.869> both<00:01:19.170> trained<00:01:19.530> by<00:01:19.680> humans<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.369> hunt

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
were both trained by humans to hunt

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.480 
were both trained by humans to hunt
animals<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.750> behalf<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> humans<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
animals on behalf of the humans so the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.679 
animals on behalf of the humans so the
caracals<00:01:23.850> were<00:01:23.939> trained<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> hunt<00:01:24.390> birds

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
caracals were trained to hunt birds

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.840 
caracals were trained to hunt birds
rabbits<00:01:25.320> small<00:01:25.619> gazelles<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.549> course<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
rabbits small gazelles and of course the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.840 
rabbits small gazelles and of course the
cheetah<00:01:27.060> were<00:01:27.210> trained<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> hunt<00:01:27.630> bigger<00:01:28.020> prey

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
cheetah were trained to hunt bigger prey

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.920 
cheetah were trained to hunt bigger prey
very<00:01:29.850> fascinating<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.509> both<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.689> these

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
very fascinating that both of these

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.830 
very fascinating that both of these
animals<00:01:31.380> were<00:01:31.729> not<00:01:32.729> tamed<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.360> conditioned

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
animals were not tamed but conditioned

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.230 
animals were not tamed but conditioned
by<00:01:33.990> humans<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> hunt<00:01:35.100> animals<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.820> there<00:01:36.119> was

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
by humans to hunt animals and there was

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.270 
by humans to hunt animals and there was
actually<00:01:36.360> contests<00:01:37.170> at<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:37.470> time<00:01:37.710> between

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
actually contests at one time between

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.920 
actually contests at one time between
the<00:01:38.579> caracals<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.119> see<00:01:39.270> which<00:01:39.390> one<00:01:39.570> could<00:01:39.720> kill

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the caracals to see which one could kill

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.230 
the caracals to see which one could kill
the<00:01:40.079> most<00:01:40.259> birds<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.799> most<00:01:40.979> pigeons<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:42.150> a

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
flock and the cheetahs which one could

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.289 
flock and the cheetahs which one could
go<00:01:44.040> fastest<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.670> bring<00:01:44.790> down<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> biggest

go fastest and bring down the biggest

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.039 
go fastest and bring down the biggest
