00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.640
 we start with it the screws of the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.730
 left gargle to release right and left 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:14.960
 with a 5 mm in the bus the screws 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.960
 we take out completely 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.340
 now the other one 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.920
 this screw also completely out 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.900
 Now we're going to die with that 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:45.220
 Keys from the hotels are stored 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.220
 small screw out 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.030
 Normally here is still in 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.489
 fuse clip burner is with me 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.489
 no longer in it, we also completely out of it 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.030
 if we do not clean the crank 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.590
 we can calmly with the 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.920
 screwdriver so intervene 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.729
 push that apart a bit and 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.310
 then we just pull the link ball 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.320
 Now lay down from the salmon 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.930
 we'll lump it in front of you 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.409
 rubber mallet three times fixed indio 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:23.380
 salmon and then slips the complete 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.380
 set to the right side out 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.020
 our months key to the bike 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.380
 hangs in the chains 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.790
 that means we solve both camps 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.790
 in the direction of travel 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.110
 here on the cant page also 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.110
 in the direction of travel 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.740
 I use the now roman frame times 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.440
 really nice to clean again 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.240
 that he will shine again 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:04.600
 frame is clean is here 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.970
 super 11 26 bearings we make on the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.770
 thread that alina list a bit 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:15.430
 assembly drives or normal fed 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.800
 put an aluminum space on it and 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.100
 screw the bearing shells in 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.239
 Clockwise in the frame the same 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.130
 we'll do it on the other side 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.739
 also falls on the thread and here 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.870
 stop backwards counterclockwise 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.870
 Screw on the chain space in the gate at 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.739
 that there are 26 bottom brackets but both the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.510
 bearing cups we have with the whole 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.250
 normal variety key for cartridges 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.250
 camp attracted 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.100
 the two bearing shells really nice 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.860
 Tighten quiet when I have the feeling 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.020
 use a torque wrench 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.630
 good and happy 40 newton meters can here 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.930
 also be given always pay attention 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.110
 right side are two spacer left 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.270
 side is a spacer at 68 millimeters 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.270
 bottom bracket bottom bracket width 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.599
 Now we're doing pretty well in the fat too 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.319
 bearing shells on both sides 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:50.160
 right and left lay our stock purely 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.840
 which are chronic are only inserted 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.620
 take the first tight slice comes up 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:01.080
 the crank side brass side direction 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.080
 Warehouses push our crank 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.250
 here again the sealing ring with the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.250
 measurement side to the camp 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.350
 put our left crank again 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.350
 it 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.500
 next to the small end screw 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.030
 I've got it here, too 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.210
 an aluminum bought also red 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.210
 anodized 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.879
 this will take about three to six 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.410
 Newton meter put on as they leave 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.759
 aluminum is and not plastic 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.759
 like the original ones 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.220
 Quietly check that while donning 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.250
 I keep the camp loose and light 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.110
 turns because the stock as I said loose 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:13.710
 drinsitzen funny that rose up then 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.710
 but it must not be hard 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.930
 who the backup clips available 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.270
 has put it back in and then 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.020
 screw the two in the bus with the 5 Series 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.020
 Insert key 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.560
 only the back side 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:44.890
 and then the front hood both with the 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.630
 prescribed torque from to 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.630
 a maximum of twelve newton meters 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:58.409
 after both screws are tightened 

00:05:56.399 --> 00:06:00.149
 also pay a little attention to that one 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.669
 gradually the two still screw 

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:03.910
 change times that is through 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:10.000
 put on that 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:12.340
 the crank arm sets the one 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.590
 screw can loosen up again and 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.240
 that 's it 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.870
 in this sense, until our next 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.870
