00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 you 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.200
 m 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.590
 it 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.430
 in bochum 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.430
 his hands 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.960
 all the friends it's drowning and 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.800
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.439
 new video 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.860
 so today is Christmas and I received 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.790
 by my parents the ipad r so that's it 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:32.540
 so curly so the box is very very 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.860
 I find attractive is that clean 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.160
 like the pack is a girl the 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.160
 apple packaging that is always very 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.300
 net is very sober 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.280
 I show you the sides a little 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:49.159
 so I call the front we see the ipad 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.309
 a little side of the bridge how to say little 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.600
 in profile I do not know what's good then 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.629
 today so we will go to 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:07.750
 unpacking allen boxing 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:07.750
 so try the box 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:35.480
 so it's cardboard and talent here 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.070
 so this is the ipad so for the 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.030
 shoot to remove it we have a small 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.410
 tongue here we will put it a little 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.020
 little on the side we will look at what 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.850
 is inside 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.570
 so in this box we do not have 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:54.380
 so much so we have here already and small 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.940
 notice of use it can serve 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.430
 for some who do not know 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.670
 too much what I call here that's it 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.290
 like that and inside we all 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.620
 cards in all languages 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.390
 different from the ipad 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.610
 we also have as usual small 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.280
 jumps as little stickers from the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.860
 apple brand is always to that in 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:21.980
 to have it is this one dead here 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.460
 so here we read lightning cable so 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.850
 it is the cable that is used to feed 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.400
 the iphone 5 the ipod touch 5 and even the 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.310
 so now the ipad r so he is 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.100
 much smaller than the old cable 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.010
 and I find it better 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:44.090
 so that's the lightning cable broke 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.680
 it is used to recharge the ipad so here is 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.300
 we have the power finally the charger 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.640
 so that is 12 watts which is twice 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.890
 more powerful than the old and therefore to 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.420
 see he did not give us in 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.280
 boxes of cottages charge it does not 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.989
 did not give in boxes and there so 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.360
 they give it so it's nice enough 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.130
 so in addition as it is 12 watts this 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.800
 will be faster to recharge the ipad 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:11.270
 so here and also he is very very 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:15.470
 class so that's so then we go 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:20.290
 to the stupid so the ipad so we go 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.290
 remove that so that's how it works 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.590
 so that's so I do not want to light it 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.209
 because it's useless I'll do a 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.340
 special video so the back is aluminum 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.739
 so that's very cool it's good 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.830
 satin it's a not too hot hand because 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.739
 that ipad r does not heat up here so we 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.739
 has a camera without megapixels so he 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.769
 made us and beautiful pictures on the 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:01.370
 sides we have the silent mode so there 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.500
 silent and normal here we have them 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.489
 volume buttons 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:11.739
 here more here - so there apple apple 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.840
 here important before on ipad and on 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.760
 ipod and all that we had only one 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.760
 micro now we have two so what 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.500
 which will serve to reduce the sounds of 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.650
 background and so we will have a better 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.190
 sound quality here we have the button 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:34.180
 startup is here 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:40.220
 we have the dock for the headphones 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:42.200
 here so we have the light world 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.760
 so it serves to put the little port to 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.780
 lightning in for their loads and 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.690
 then with the charger and there are two 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.620
 stereo speaker 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:57.980
 so we'll have a better sound and so 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:03.080
 that's all so I took the ipad 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.820
 in 32 blond gigas so at 65 79 euros 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.570
 which I also forgot to tell you 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:12.080
 here we have a 1.2 megapixel camera so 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.520
 for facetime know it's not bad as 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.740
 there we are on an ipad we have a big 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.490
 screen so that's fine so these are the 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.130
 douala marks are pretty visible 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.160
 but hey that's normal 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:27.080
 so apple said that has and the 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.570
 new ipad were less we took 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.260
 least the scratches apparently they have 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:37.610
 they reinforced it a bit on that side 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:40.760
 so also we can see on the edges a 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.410
 small how to say a little reflection when 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:49.040
 that I do not know how to explain but 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:50.840
 it's very well done forehead here it is 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.330
 that's all for this boxing hate of 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.340
 ipad r so I hope you like 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.350
 this little video we find ourselves for 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.590
 new videos so with city and 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.600
 spiro and dr is and maybe with dj 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.970

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.570
