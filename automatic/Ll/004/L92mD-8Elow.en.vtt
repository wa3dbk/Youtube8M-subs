 hello friends in this video from I come to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.220
 recommend a game and I'm going to show you 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.019
 how to install it in worship games 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.990
 5 as you can see it is full and in Spanish 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.460
 and good they are going to download us from the 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.680
 link that I'm going to leave information of 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.380
 video we will have the information of the 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.539
 download let's do the requirements 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.550
 minimum although I have a little less than 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.980
 machine that already asks for a week 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.329
 pretty well the game is going to have the 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.980
 installation instructions and 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.009
 finally we will have the links of 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.009
 discharge 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.620
 are by means to download fast and 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.290
 can download several parts at the same 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.880
 time once I finish 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.250
 download I recommend you use 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.620
 that is giving to download the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.840
 program of my previous video since it 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.130
 will allow to make good use of the fact 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.980
 that they are by mediafax 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.350
 Once downloaded, you will see these 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.820
 files that they can extract although they are 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.090
 used the programs as I told them 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.390
 extra storil is that the file did that 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.790
 file weighs 4.19 gigabyte and can 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.250
 burn in a divide or can mount it 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.330
 as I did with montull and 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.240
 directly execute it 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.880
 We said the language we give to accept you 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.690
 we give next we accept the agreement 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.980
 following 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.120
 we choose from installation path 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:26.630
 next next and we can create a 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.000
 desktop icon we have next and 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.159
 we give to install we will have a bar 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.100
 of state 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.610
 what will extract the files was 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.040
 a lot of time is pretty fast 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.260
 as you can see but there's going to be a 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.230
 second status bar 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.010
 what is this that is if it takes enough 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.950
 time it ends up loading like this 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.640
 that I'm going to have to force the video and 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.640
 Resume once you have finished 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.410
 good as you can see it's already finished 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.200
 we click on finish to finish 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.270
 with the installation and he did some 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.520
 tests to try to run the game 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.210
 while degrees but the truth is not me 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.300
 allows since I have the taste of 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.080
 minimum requirements but I play them and 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.470
 I assure you that it works very well 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.570
 I hope you enjoy the game and they 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.570
 serve a big greeting chau
