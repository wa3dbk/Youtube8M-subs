00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.120
 hello good to all welcome again 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.160
 to this channel and thanks for watching the 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.619
 first video I think I actually do 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.050
 today I wanted to recommend an application 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.279
 especially this application oriented 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.800
 all those who are a little 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.950
 maniac with the theme of loading the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.470
 device and we do not like to have it 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.470
 plugged in all the time 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.240
 actually 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.870
 it's a very simple application it's about 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.200
 of battery full notification which 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.500
 we can find in google play of 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.840
 totally totally free 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.000
 it will serve us as its name 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.220
 it indicates it for 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.990
 the mobile phone notifies us when the battery has 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.080
 come one hundred percent I read by 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.080
 there 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.940
 many users are not clear with this 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.950
 because once although once the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.350
 mobile has reached one hundred percent of 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.770
 charging does not mean that the battery is 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.900
 fully loaded as this application 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.220
 what is in charge is that when 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.220
 reach one hundred percent 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.510
 the mobile will notify us the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.540
 application is very simple 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.300
 is updated to the design lines 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.430
 of material design but neither is it 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:37.430
 application that I admired you cause a pleasant 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.370
 printing for its design because I already know 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.320
 I say is very basic 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.750
 One thing to note is that it is in 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.390
 English but in it is very intuitive 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.700
 it's easy it 's easy to understand for 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.550
 activate the service we only have 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.980
 that having activated this box is worth 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.900
 here in the second option of 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.060
 notification where toast says 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.260
 we can all understand what it is so that 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.180
 Notify us also with a message 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.780
 although this I do not see it really useful 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.880
 when we plug the phone into the charger 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.229
 we are not pending there for us 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.030
 they will see the message that it has 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.690
 loaded everything that interests us in 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.920
 reality is this this aspect here the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:23.800
 bad sun here we can choose the ringtone 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:27.500
 what better than what we like and 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.660
 we can also select the the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.310
 volume the volume of this corner 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.980
 I have it here for if I'm far away 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.040
 of the mobile whatever it is so to find out 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.620
 It also has a section 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.220
 interesting in the silent aim 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.080
 that as you can see to program or 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.140
 determine a time series in which 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.110
 we do not want the mobile phone to 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.860
 notify here another part that I like 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.659
 much is the option to repeat the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.599
 notification me in my case I have it 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.000
 marked in 15 minutes so that if by 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.270
 some reason I got confused 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.890
 and the phone reaches one hundred percent in the 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.810
 application notifies me but not what 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.210
 I hear or I can not come at that moment 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.000
 then I forgot about fifteen 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.660
 minutes again notify and then 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 I come and unplug the mobile here 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.709
 section also in the past 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.850
 apart these two are interesting 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:30.390
 repeat count and notify with full search 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.910
 because the first if by any 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.450
 reason we want you to notify us 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.489
 Once we delete the zero and put a 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.240
 if we want to be notified three times 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.480
 so that he is notifying all the time 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.980
 at the third time it stops notifying in 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.740
 my case also those marked so that 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.870
 be infinite times see if I assure myself 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:55.610
 that does not come, I will not forget 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:59.260
 it and here if we uncheck notify or full 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.520
 search we can select the percent 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.660
 the percent of battery 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.240
 to which we want you do not know this and what 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.830
 I say it's very interesting because the 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.960
 to guarantee the correct 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.870
 operation and lengthen the lifespan of 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.530
 Batteries are always recommended not 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.109
 charge them up to 100% or even a 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.870
 fixed percentage 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.850
 ideally it would be more or less up to 80% 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.940
 with this option we can define it 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.190
 but good that there will be few users 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.729
 that they do this because I mainly 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.800
 I always charge it to butt 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:43.740
 another thing that should be highlighted 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.740
 just resource - consuming application 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:51.780
 economic in this sense when I 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.780
 it has only been activated 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.980
 in ram consumption is when 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.370
 I put it load 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.710
 the application goes unnoticed is like 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.710
 if we did not have it 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.860
 I already told you it's a very 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.980
 very simple but that fulfills its function 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.630
 one hundred percent as very little as very 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.060
 few you have seen 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.160
 and at least in the time I've been 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.230
 using what is already going to be more than a year 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.660
 never failed again so I'll give you the 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:31.170
 I highly recommend I'll leave you 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.960
 the link anyway to google play 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:37.260
 in the description of the video nothing from 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.610
 I already encourage you to try it though 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.520
 It is also true that many manufacturers 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:45.280
 they already include you inside their inside their 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:48.160
 show but at least I've had 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.400
 several mobiles had not seen one so 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.310
 complete as this one, nothing more than 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.440
 dismissal if you liked the video not 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.740
 forget to subscribe to the channel and give 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.330
 like that always always helps and 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.630
 motivates us to move forward thanks 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.630
 see you soon
