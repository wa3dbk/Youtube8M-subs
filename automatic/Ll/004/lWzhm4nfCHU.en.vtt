00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
cacti were not the most efficient in the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
cacti were not the most efficient in the
killing<00:02:24.720> which<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.860> true<00:02:26.250> i<00:02:26.580> have<00:02:27.060> found

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350

problem<00:02:39.000> doesn't<00:02:39.360> happen<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:39.690> often<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.350> have

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
problem doesn't happen that often I have

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.270 
problem doesn't happen that often I have
cacti<00:02:41.880> here<00:02:42.440> there's<00:02:43.440> obviously<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.980> block

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
cacti here there's obviously a block

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.190 
cacti here there's obviously a block
missing<00:02:44.730> behind<00:02:45.120> them<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:45.390> they<00:02:45.720> can<00:02:45.750> be<00:02:46.019> there

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
missing behind them so they can be there

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.229 
missing behind them so they can be there
you<00:02:46.650> can<00:02:46.830> see<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.040> when<00:02:47.340> they<00:02:47.489> grow<00:02:47.850> they

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
you can see that when they grow they

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.670 
you can see that when they grow they
generate<00:02:48.840> more<00:02:49.380> cacti<00:02:50.010> which<00:02:50.280> then<00:02:51.680> falls

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
generate more cacti which then falls

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.860 
generate more cacti which then falls
into<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.310> water<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.880> it's<00:02:54.060> deposited<00:02:54.360> so

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
into the water and it's deposited so

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.900 
into the water and it's deposited so
this<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.170> not<00:02:55.350> just<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.709> my<00:02:55.980> baton<00:02:56.340> item

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
this is not just the my baton item

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.170 
this is not just the my baton item
factory<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.870> also<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.940> cacti<00:02:59.940> farm<00:03:00.709> I

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
factory it is also the cacti farm I

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:12.289 
factory it is also the cacti farm I
think<00:03:03.180> during<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:09.709> during<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:11.130> following<00:03:11.820> I

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
think during the during the following I

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.030 
think during the during the following I
guess<00:03:12.959> time<00:03:13.489> I'm<00:03:14.489> going<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:14.970> attempt<00:03:15.329> to

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
guess time I'm going to attempt to

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.360 
guess time I'm going to attempt to
expand<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:17.280> further<00:03:17.790> back<00:03:18.239> as<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:19.860> make<00:03:20.070> sure

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
expand this further back as to make sure

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.620 
expand this further back as to make sure
that<00:03:21.680> more<00:03:22.680> mobs<00:03:23.130> are<00:03:23.549> spawning<00:03:24.030> because<00:03:24.420> the

that more mobs are spawning because the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.110 
that more mobs are spawning because the

this direction on this hill of which I

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.110 
this direction on this hill of which I
could<00:03:47.489> utilize<00:03:48.230> for<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.440> building<00:03:50.120> I'd

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
could utilize for the building I'd

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.900 
could utilize for the building I'd
probably<00:03:51.660> like<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.350> expand<00:03:52.829> it<00:03:53.010> all<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.760> way

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
probably like to expand it all the way

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.690 
probably like to expand it all the way
to<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:55.079> end<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.590> bill<00:03:55.799> are<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.400> end<00:03:56.549> of

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
to the end of the bill are the end of

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.020 
to the end of the bill are the end of
the<00:03:57.590> this<00:04:00.620> because<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:02.160> would<00:04:02.280> result<00:04:02.579> in<00:04:02.910> a

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
the this because that would result in a

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.199 
the this because that would result in a
lot<00:04:03.209> more<00:04:03.570> mobs<00:04:04.350> being<00:04:04.680> spawned<00:04:06.200> I'm<00:04:07.200> also

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
lot more mobs being spawned I'm also

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.619 
lot more mobs being spawned I'm also
thinking<00:04:09.209> of<00:04:09.599> attempting<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.530> add<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:11.129> floor<00:04:11.640> to

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
thinking of attempting to add a floor to

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:13.760 
thinking of attempting to add a floor to
spawn<00:04:13.050> not

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.560 
spawn not
aggressive<00:04:14.220> mobs<00:04:14.750> which<00:04:16.940> would<00:04:17.940> then<00:04:18.120> fall

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
aggressive mobs which would then fall

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.520 
aggressive mobs which would then fall
down<00:04:19.550> I<00:04:20.550> don't<00:04:21.480> know<00:04:21.600> how<00:04:21.780> I<00:04:21.810> necessarily

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
down I don't know how I necessarily

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.530 
down I don't know how I necessarily
would<00:04:23.010> do<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.550> have<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.030> make<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.210> floor<00:04:24.510> that

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
would do it I have to make a floor that

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.070 
would do it I have to make a floor that
would<00:04:24.870> be<00:04:24.990> dirt<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.620> then<00:04:26.160> have<00:04:26.370> it<00:04:26.400> lit<00:04:27.080> well

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
would be dirt and then have it lit well

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.900 
would be dirt and then have it lit well
and<00:04:28.410> then<00:04:28.680> have<00:04:28.890> it<00:04:28.920> somehow<00:04:29.810> set<00:04:30.810> up<00:04:31.050> that

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
and then have it somehow set up that

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.130 
and then have it somehow set up that
they<00:04:32.910> would<00:04:33.150> end<00:04:33.330> up<00:04:35.570> integrating<00:04:36.570> into<00:04:36.810> the

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
they would end up integrating into the

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.440 
they would end up integrating into the
rest<00:04:37.380> of<00:04:37.530> this<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:38.010> get<00:04:38.340> pulled<00:04:38.700> down<00:04:38.820> here

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
rest of this and get pulled down here

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.300 
rest of this and get pulled down here
and<00:04:39.600> killed<00:04:39.870> as<00:04:40.050> well<00:04:40.080> because<00:04:41.010> then<00:04:41.190> this

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
and killed as well because then this

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.160 
and killed as well because then this
item<00:04:41.670> factory<00:04:42.060> could<00:04:42.300> be<00:04:42.420> generating<00:04:43.020> all

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
item factory could be generating all

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.520 
item factory could be generating all
types<00:04:43.650> of<00:04:43.890> items<00:04:44.130> which<00:04:44.640> would<00:04:44.820> be<00:04:44.910> great

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
types of items which would be great

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.990 
types of items which would be great
which<00:04:46.530> is<00:04:46.680> something<00:04:46.920> that<00:04:47.070> I<00:04:47.220> would<00:04:47.460> like<00:04:47.700> I

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
which is something that I would like I

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.570 
which is something that I would like I
would<00:04:48.270> think<00:04:48.570> that<00:04:48.660> that's<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:49.110> very<00:04:49.710> good<00:04:49.800> that

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
would think that that's a very good that

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.000 
would think that that's a very good that
would<00:04:50.700> be<00:04:50.790> a<00:04:50.820> great<00:04:51.260> direction<00:04:52.260> for<00:04:52.890> it<00:04:52.950> to

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
would be a great direction for it to

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.180 
would be a great direction for it to
take<00:04:53.220> however<00:04:54.380> I'm<00:04:55.380> not<00:04:55.560> one<00:04:55.890> hundred<00:04:56.010> percent

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
take however I'm not one hundred percent

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.000 
take however I'm not one hundred percent
sure<00:04:56.550> as<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.060> how<00:04:58.040> I<00:04:59.040> would<00:04:59.790> have<00:05:00.360> that<00:05:01.010> work

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
sure as to how I would have that work

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.110 
sure as to how I would have that work
along<00:05:02.520> with<00:05:03.170> the<00:05:04.170> rest<00:05:04.350> of<00:05:04.710> how<00:05:04.980> the<00:05:05.400> monotron

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
item factory works which is total
