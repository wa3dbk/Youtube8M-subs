00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.710
 I'm going cool, I'm a commentator 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:26.590
 lvbp I am 20 years old and I know bilbao 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.660
 I always liked castellar 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.119
 what I had planned to enter here 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.820
 anywhere else but when I saw the 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.489
 ad I told him to try to walk for 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.080
 enter then good because I do not say the 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.180
 very bad situation because they will laugh a little 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.290
 and that's it and they forget about us and if 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.290
 they do not choose them for perfect 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.800
 give him the beauty for a long time and of 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.340
 fact competed in the call of duty in the 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.739
 lolo did not compete but in the cloud and if 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.340
 I saw your streamings bone so much of 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.960
 he as good code and the other code 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.510
 principles or else in the end caps what I believe 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.670
 and then I started well pain for by sean and 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.530
 especially that at the beginning was the 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.300
 only the guest arrives 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.369
 also from his house I remember that it is 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.030
 in the street to the is that there are many times and 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.440
 I saw it and I had a lot of fun besides I do not know 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.330
 it was said is indirect own project in 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.100
 youtube is tested on youtube when 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.110
 I went up eyes and I saw him at dawn 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.360
 weekend before I go to bed 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.890
 I saw it was not great, I leave them 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.460
 I think it's like this prayer payment 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.960
 credible and I had a great time 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.460
 I saw you want a very serious company that 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.380
 say things well and have the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.380
 very good commentators then 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.390
 I was very happy because mostly I was 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.040
 it made the subject of having contact so weird 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.720
 direct with barbies and ulises that over 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.820
 everything is because we knew each other 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.930
 you are really behind the cameras and 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.570
 we had not liked work but with 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.860
 very rare space not the subject of how 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.260
 our work that varied yulis is 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.410
 then for one was up to the 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.410
 professional 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.030
 by contact this year in January 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.849
 I think it was 18 started on 18 19 of 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.560
 January around about and good 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.989
 it was incredible that it was one more step 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.030
 still and also the premiere of the 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.090
 web was amazing to see webs had 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.800
 very many and nothing as always very 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.600
 Excited I liked it a lot 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.190
 and good with enough nerves for that reason 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.440
 they are running out of a lost past 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.400
 well you have to spend more time 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.560
 of which appears 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.440
 because it's not sitting down and commenting because 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.960
 the good many times 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.030
 you have to be a little prepared for 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.560
 what are you going to do it because make a 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.660
 match without any preparation 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.220
 behind is complicated and whenever you go to 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.530
 do something you have to look at yourself 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.810
 templates the streak that carry what 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.970
 they can get to play what they bite at and 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.650
 especially good the days of lcs are 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.870
 enough hours because even if you do not spend 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.550
 of the direct the entire program and about 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.650
 everything to punish at home is complicated 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.970
 because parents have to understand the 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.740
 work that you do is not the subject of 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.140
 time is not the meat can anyone enter 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.730
 you are punishing one can not pass the 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.140
 vacuum cleaner or get with the dishes or what 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.050
 that is can not enter then it is 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.610
 really complicated that in six seven 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.980
 can not enter your room 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.750
 or can not tell you anything then good 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.520
 I think it's mostly being in 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.660
 house is much more complicated and 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.520
 sacrifice for good 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.850
 much dedication and many hours the 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.850
 true 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.090
 depends depends on the critical the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.840
 criticisms that are not constructive the 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.120
 really quite bad 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.400
 I do not know in what sense the truth is wrong but 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.200
 do not really feel good to me and the 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.580
 constructive to help a lot I've 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.950
 said my form of 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.200
 punish and how do I do things due 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.629
 to the people who have helped you that make you 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.790
 a constructive criticism so it depends 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.829
 of the criticism better or worse 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.810
 You know a lot of people to be 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.670
 known, I have known you all 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.230
 those who are out to many people that my 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.299
 video I would have known if there had not been 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.280
 enter here and especially because doing what 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.689
 what do you like, or are you really 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.549
 comfortable and you're comfortable because you 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.349
 passionate to comment on a match and on 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.090
 all the good reviews of the people that 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.099
 what really makes you keep going 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.930
 to the critics then in bad or me 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.609
 would stay with your friendship but what 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.359
 I'm sorry I could not do it if 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.359
 it really would not make sense 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.570
 the special moment was of gamers and 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.650
 especially because the event I think 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.710
 I can personally do it a lot 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.800
 better but it was my first event then 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.290
 you always have that has been the first 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.880
 time I went to one of these sites and it was 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.190
 very nice not the subject of meeting a lot 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.430
 people and such but as for castles 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:45.080
 in the jump-off of james against me 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.080
 michaels and three in jungle 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.360
 you have a statue and there is no this 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.000
 they leave here they just survive the same 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.920
 it may be the end of the game 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.050
 wow what the team just did 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.050
 she in the initiation that was perfect 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.060
 nobody can stop it from talking 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.400
 from this place that they continue talking that 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.920
 this ends here georg any 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.650
 food came out I knew that this never 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.240
 risky but I'm excited to do it 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.130
 because I think it was time 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.370
 adequate not especially if you see it in 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.870
 direct so people felt more 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.520
 identified because then there are people who 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.169
 what four days later and I understand 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.640
 that is a little strange everything that is 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.020
 a Friday morning a Sunday the 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.570
 tomorrow you say what this man does 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.860
 that is going crazy 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.860
 the team 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.970
 final 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.779
 as punishment 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:10.610
 I transform myself much more I live with 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:12.049
 a lot of passion and I get really alone 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.659
 healthy 

00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:17.779
 has never practiced this I mean I 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:20.269
 it comes out I just get and I get excited and what 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:22.299
 I do so I do not know I can not tell you much 

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:22.299
 plus 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.449
 see you later, friends
