 on television more also more than 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.080
 never clear yes and martita because 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.490
 good you have to take into account that already 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.590
 about the date when the kings 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.780
 wizards are going to come to our homes and go 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.610
 to leave the gifts for the children and 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.590
 good many stores selling 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.840
 animals advise children that 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.390
 put in your little letter hear that they give you 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.570
 a pet a puppy a kitten or a 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.150
 tortuguita mice a canary not know 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.550
 but this may not sound good 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.140
 idea and to clarify because it is with 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.090
 us the freeman family villalobos 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.120
 what exactly are they going to tell us 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.710
 how is sergio welcome and why not 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.590
 it's a good idea to ask the kings 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.510
 Magicians an animal pet 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.879
 Well, we have to remind ourselves that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.120
 puppies require a lot of care and if you 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.460
 We give all the full responsibility to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.469
 the children good they will not be able to 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.600
 this responsibility is going to have to 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.520
 end up being one's responsibility 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.100
 because they will laburar in a short time 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.980
 if they want a good toy in the in 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.930
 Any company that sells toys 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.829
 dolls where the pile is removed and 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.479
 the toy is over 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.909
 if pets do not have batteries like 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.729
 well you say it and eight out of ten 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.070
 pets according to the prophecy are over 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.649
 losing they end up leaving the house 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.259
 or they end up leaving abandoned very 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:26.070
 sad and for the simplest reasons 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.619
 I can not stand it long ago from the bathroom 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.630
 I cross it all then you have to have 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.759
 Care is a responsibility that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.049
 it requires some expense because 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.750
 we need to take it to the doctor 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.799
 veterinary to food care 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.990
 bathrooms and all this then is a stage 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.459
 we have to go to many are many 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.319
 many years today sergio this too 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.060
 applies to small pets like 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.429
 I mentioned a while ago that if they ask for a 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.799
 bunny and if they have a turtle or such 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.689
 once a canary a clear budgie because 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.539
 the cares have to be special to 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.640
 each of the species the animals 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.709
 small especially if we give it to 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.810
 Very young children can reach 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:06.179
 hurt him not do not control his 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.269
 force can hurt many 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.130
 Sometimes they are in the house they walk or 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.040
 they want 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.710
 and good is the puppy the kitten the 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.600
 chick the and frank and being hurt and 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.730
 you have to do the doctor's expense 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.980
 veterinarian because they already fracture a 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.870
 patita anything for this 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.570
 do not happen today jimÃ©nez your 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.930
 beautiful girls are going to show us how 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.390
 this port we can start to train 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.910
 save the first steps to train 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.980
 a puppy please see 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.990
 in this case and how it was also that is 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.460
 this beautiful dog is about 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.280
 that they have to war the family with these 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.830
 trainings we do it in positive 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.990
 is based on awards then every 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:55.220
 she performs the activity that we are 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:56.810
 asking what they are giving they are given what 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.240
 you are but not the ones that they 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.160
 normally consume reward bits of 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.870
 sausage but it's nothing more like a 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.030
 prize can not be food in 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.980
 general sausage bits that 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.990
 would be those who sell prizes 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.410
 those who sell in box any 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.660
 Chain of stores 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.510
 to her what they are teaching her is that 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.040
 answer your name to the call not to a 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.040
 sign no applause 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:30.880
 Marisela not not call for its 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.320
 name would be called applause and all 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.480
 then we regret that she understands 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.850
 which is called sharapova sharapova and has 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.850
 that respond to your name 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.950
 to the subject of children when they ask 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.780
 they want to ask the king is this a 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.910
 little animal what advice could we give to 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.160
 the dads to replace that great 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.230
 children's desire for an animal and 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.640
 to change it for something else that 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.440
 it could be a toy or some other 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.590
 much that they put many hostels where 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.320
 they accept volunteers either for walks 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.210
 ajÃ¡ volunteers for days of care 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.360
 to sponsor a book note one day 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.160
 So if you have the desire to have a 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.110
 pet but we do not have the space or the 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.420
 enough time we can go to 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.250
 some of the shelters and support it in 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.600
 support them in these situations up 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.640
 father it occurs to me that right now in these 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.380
 days before the day of kings and missing 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.850
 little they have suddenly the children are 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.130
 shelters and charged with the dogs to 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.750
 see if it really is your real taste but 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.200
 it is not a novelty or the dazzle of 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.210
 neighbour 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.220
 the little fellow at school is like that and 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.610
 apart you can find an ideal dog 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.040
 where there is some connection and they can 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.860
 interact is the puppy that they 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.840
 they want and a little gift even though they talked about 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.190
 he takes out bags and I figure that 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.290
 better with the passage of time maybe not 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.500
 in the day of kings later they can 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.670
 adopt that same animal clear connection 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.670
 with him and all good 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:10.900
 down below eating eating very well 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.270
 late but when they are slow to learn more 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.770
 or less this trick 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.110
 more or less good what is the 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.120
 Basic obedience takes one month a month 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.860
 more or less and even how many tricks 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.490
 we could teach a puppy from home 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.180
 regular depending on the race and everything 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:30.380
 they learn a certain amount but very much 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.030
 smarter you learn to do 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.030
 border collie I think it's the most 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.520
 father and especially above all an example 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.920
 like the family 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.180
 freeman that is this that in family are 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.070
 living with the dog, not the dog 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.200
 they leave him after he makes the children and 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.240
 dad never takes over or makes him 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.740
 case or nothing then those are a great 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.180
 true example and we are very pleased 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.240
