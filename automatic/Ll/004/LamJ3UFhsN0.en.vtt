00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.570
 the moment expected by many practical tips for today 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.769
 has been submitted by e nt 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.769
 6 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.409
 hello as well as some suitcases and practical advice 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.140
 the molar a super interesting topic and that I think it deserves a therefore 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.410
 tension that is like choosing a racket 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.710
 to choose once you already have to consider some concepts a few 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.610
 criteria 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.750
 for example the level of game players 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.850
 the physical if 16 guys will follow that strong 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.180
 if I'm not so strong 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.050
 and also the frequency once a week to play tennis 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.059
 because all of this 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.160
 because we usually have to buy 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.420
 the racket they use the best 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.510
 those recipes 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.290
 p 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.350
 clinton 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.930
 different weight 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.550
 what an amateur player should use 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.410
 for example the swim racket placidly weighs 130 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.560
 grams but he adds 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.950
 adds to the added lead larrea weights 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.700
 and where they also become 360 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.400
 and in general happens professionals go between 750 of 180 euros 400 grams of 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.200
 weight 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.610
 use a model of that abode that you bring to Paraguay by amateur 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.320
 it's almost impossible 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.409
 or if he does 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.750
 it tends to generate injuries 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.230
 Well, you have to take into account 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.800
 the racket of the professionals not exactly shadow that is in favor in 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.870
 The matter 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.230
 I am an amateur player 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.350
 I play every day that I have a relatively good physical condition 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.660
 to study inym press training 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.979
 good are a racket of a professional without alleging weights 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.420
 to take into account again in the market for example is the lx 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.740
 the model that this 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.900
 in a tense I go to 2 199 grams 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.150
 among the 185 290 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.940
 three hundred 300 milligrams 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.910
 they are recipes that are adaptable to players of amateur level but 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.690
 older players and dented fully developed physique 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.409
 It also happens that many times the Chinese children to the racket 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:16.170
 professionals 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.480
 even if they have the technique that they have the level 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.239
 good simply for lack of strength 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.700
 ll for these children depending on age 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.560
 let's put some basic parameters a child who is going out to 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.120
 the lid 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.290
 child 1- eight or nine years mode ten years of very good technique 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.139
 that already begins to play in whole court 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.890
 I should use a yunior racket 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.650
 but the rain the greatest of all that is 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.230
 a model that already has practically the same measurement and not only by the 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.160
 difference 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.370
 with the normal racket 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.039
 but it has an approximate weight between 775 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.800
 85 grams thanks to a network of trafficking of two children 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.840
 has all the material all the technology of the racket or professional 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.469
 but a lot did not think 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.469
 suddenly we talk about 10 grams 5 we pray 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.450
 it makes no difference apparently 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.669
 but at the time of delivery 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.220
 so many balls followed by training every day 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.050
 that small difference assured a very large weight and that what has adhesion 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.299
 to many of those 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.909
 when we passed percent of the top of 10 children the infant stage 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.119
 let's say when they are in the age of 12 to 13 years 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:22.780
 you should start using 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.119
 normal snowshoe rackets so long attack 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:30.989
 i with a weight of plus or minus 190 300 grams at the most 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.990
 from now on and give it a little 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.880
 from the physical the boy of the game style also 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.999
 terrible because it is see if you do not see them so much 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.999
 but usually they bring to rackets the entretrés sit 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.919
 3 110 615 grams 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.919
 madness keep them going to hit and let's it has some level 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.240
 very social should not use such heavy rackets 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.580
 and above all things you have to understand ad hoc technology 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:59.129
 it's for the players 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.059
 social 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.949
 not being stick by professionals as regional 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.629
 It is generally very accurate 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.579
 and then in addition to a law for being so precise they hit him 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.250
 most of the time in the light zone in the center zone 11 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.360
 that the forest area of ​​the area better 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.970
 the racquet reacts to the impact is and what I have more control and more 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.079
 power the racket 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.860
 professionals has a zone looks pretty small that is called mano de 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.529
 size 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.270
 the appointment will be in the area use because they are very accurate 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.930
 now or for social damage where it has varied impacts 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.590
 by different parts of the remembered Cordoba 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.580
 we need a broader base 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.250
 and generally that rackets I'm not an animal or professionals if they have the 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.599
 technology but they have for example the largest hoop 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.919
 the frames are a little wider 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.919
 because this does not allow a significant margin of error 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.849
 let's take into account all this the gulf of tennis stores 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.330
 the top ten and for example considered it to be 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.350
 the dust and the best sports store where bonus considers that these 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.940
 He has specialized people who can not because he can recommend that he have rackets 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.949
 purchase 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:06.760
 so 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.960
 we do not find and buy mom because the same television or because we are 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.390
 we wanted to go buy what we are going what will be done with another 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.650
 I play needs 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.780
 something very important the size the handle already called purchase marraqueta 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.939
 how I love well 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:23.649
 I like the color I do not like sousa nadal so I see the racket 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:27.909
 you have to keep in mind the following is not a little obsession 

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:33.849
 the right measure for the size of unfair the fist the just is that my finger 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.110
 index 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.589
 exactly in this space many times they will see that the 12 gathering 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:44.069
 yes and this is enough to play 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.269
 the mayor will take continues this position has incorporated as a parana 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.260
 and the other is with very large support 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.749
 of what they announce for today they would be scoring 2 of 2 

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:55.680
 in me in my saving hand 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.939
 as usual 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:00.340
 this causes injuries to the elbow and wrist 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.999
 for example that we vote some good way 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:06.270
 the big and important hilt hands and do some work 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.250
 very small 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.529
 so keep this detail in mind 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:11.599
 important heists what agreed 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:13.529
 and who is chosen in strings 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:17.909
 they are noble in very hard colombo then the thing not professionals are very 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:20.460
 hard because the agreed non-professionals 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.629
 Northwest area have weathered quite 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:25.360
 yes then they do it pretty hard to make it mature 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.600
 they throw a stronger relationship 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.029
 at the moment of impact and that can generate 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:31.490
 this pain in the elbow 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.560
 everything from wrist to shoulder pain when the impact did not regret 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.809
 stay because only the tennis players lasted 

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:40.499
 I had social amatán should I already said 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:41.889
 good these three things 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:43.740
 the racket 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.160
 the size of the ring the string type 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.710
 they are an element to keep in mind when choosing a racket also remember the other 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.050
 level of game 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.319
 physical 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:54.419
 and frequency 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.710
 of times per week complained to tennis 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.180
 I hope you keep in mind that for the next election 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.330
 and grown up thank you very much
