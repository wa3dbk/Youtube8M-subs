00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
specified interval of seconds so it's

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.340 
specified interval of seconds so it's
pretty<00:00:17.490> cool<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.789> automated<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.080> just

just<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.400> pretty<00:01:32.640> cool<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.180> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
just like that it's pretty cool and you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.230 
just like that it's pretty cool and you
know<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.110> don't<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.770> super<00:01:35.520> need

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
know I don't really have a super need

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.660 
know I don't really have a super need
for<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.659> right<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.530> could<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:38.040> where

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
for it right now but I could see where

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.969 
for it right now but I could see where
it<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.570> functional<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.619> where<00:01:40.890> it

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
it can and be functional and where it

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.649 
it can and be functional and where it
can<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.159> totally<00:01:41.610> logical<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.630> your

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
can be totally logical to have on your

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.389 
can be totally logical to have on your
device<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.590> pretty<00:01:43.710> cool<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.130> does<00:01:44.280> it

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
device so it's pretty cool it does it

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.830 
device so it's pretty cool it does it
seamlessly<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.000> background<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.570> doesn't

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
seamlessly in the background it doesn't

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.770 
seamlessly in the background it doesn't
