as the Tina makes expansion team because

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.730 
as the Tina makes expansion team because
they<00:00:21.150> have<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.270> space<00:00:21.570> or<00:00:21.779> low<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.289> pretty

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
they have the space or low so pretty

expansion<00:00:24.300> team<00:00:24.510> they<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:24.900> 89<00:00:25.320> offense<00:00:25.740> 87

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
expansion team they have 89 offense 87

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.950 
expansion team they have 89 offense 87
defense<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.670> 87<00:00:27.090> goaltending<00:00:27.510> that's<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.750> team

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
defense in 87 goaltending that's a team

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.019 
defense in 87 goaltending that's a team
of<00:00:28.050> entirely<00:00:28.619> free<00:00:29.160> agents<00:00:29.519> obviously<00:00:29.910> when

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
of entirely free agents obviously when

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.849 
of entirely free agents obviously when
an<00:00:30.090> expansion<00:00:30.449> team<00:00:30.539> joins<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> NHL<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.529> think

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
an expansion team joins the NHL I think

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.380 
an expansion team joins the NHL I think
they<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.040> up<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.399> two<00:00:32.910> players<00:00:33.239> from

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
they get up to like two players from

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.639 
they get up to like two players from
every<00:00:33.570> team<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.809> they<00:00:34.020> could<00:00:34.140> possibly<00:00:34.290> add

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
every team that they could possibly add

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.990 
every team that they could possibly add
to<00:00:34.680> their<00:00:34.890> team<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.550> basically<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:35.969> like

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
to their team so basically it's like

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.580 
to their team so basically it's like
every<00:00:36.270> team's<00:00:36.480> tubers<00:00:36.809> players<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
every team's tubers players the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.170 
every team's tubers players the
expansion<00:00:37.980> team<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.520> choose<00:00:38.760> from<00:00:38.940> but

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
expansion team you can choose from but

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.150 
expansion team you can choose from but
for<00:00:39.600> example<00:00:40.050> decided<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:40.649> all<00:00:40.829> free

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
for example decided to just do all free

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.530 
for example decided to just do all free
agents<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.030> see<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.239> teams<00:00:42.450> are

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
agents and as you can see the teams are

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.060 
agents and as you can see the teams are
actually<00:00:42.809> pretty<00:00:42.960> good<00:00:43.200> compared<00:00:43.920> them<00:00:44.040> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
actually pretty good compared them to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.110 
actually pretty good compared them to
the<00:00:44.160> worst<00:00:44.370> team<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> league<00:00:44.789> last<00:00:44.969> year

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
Buffalo Sabres they have for higher

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.380 
Buffalo Sabres they have for higher
offense<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.190> same<00:00:47.460> defense<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.270> higher

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
offense the same defense and for higher

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.970 
offense the same defense and for higher
goaltending<00:00:48.960> then<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.440> want<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> compare<00:00:49.829> them

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
goaltending then we want to compare them

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.229 
goaltending then we want to compare them
to<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.100> stanley<00:00:50.370> cup<00:00:50.399> champion<00:00:50.910> chicago

carrying<00:02:36.240> pretty<00:02:36.450> slippery<00:02:36.720> solid<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.110> think

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
carrying pretty slippery solid I think

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.930 
carrying pretty slippery solid I think
for<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.530> number<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.920> pairing<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.730> third

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
for a number to pairing and the third

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.970 
for a number to pairing and the third
pairing<00:02:39.180> there<00:02:39.330> we<00:02:39.450> have<00:02:39.630> Lumira<00:02:40.470> schnoz<00:02:40.739> key

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.470 
pairing there we have Lumira schnoz key
as<00:02:41.070> well<00:02:41.100> as<00:02:41.310> miracles<00:02:41.489> Italy<00:02:41.880> key<00:02:42.030> again<00:02:42.360> to

as well as miracles Italy key again to

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.760 
as well as miracles Italy key again to
offensive<00:02:42.930> defenseman<00:02:43.260> probably<00:02:43.620> as<00:02:43.680> an

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
offensive defenseman probably as an

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.229 
offensive defenseman probably as an
ideal<00:02:44.489> as<00:02:44.610> well<00:02:44.760> they're<00:02:44.850> both<00:02:44.940> pretty<00:02:45.120> old

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
ideal as well they're both pretty old

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.180

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
you know a Vegas expansion teams they

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.220 
you know a Vegas expansion teams they
joined<00:04:54.150> right<00:04:54.389> now<00:04:54.419> for<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:54.870> next<00:04:55.080> month

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
joined right now for the next month

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.720 
joined right now for the next month
could<00:04:55.590> they<00:04:55.680> be<00:04:55.770> competitive<00:04:56.220> in<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.370> NHL

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
could they be competitive in the NHL

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.220 
could they be competitive in the NHL
honestly<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:57.450> don't<00:04:57.540> think<00:04:57.660> they<00:04:57.810> get<00:04:57.960> last

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
honestly I don't think they get last

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.540 
honestly I don't think they get last
they<00:04:58.560> wouldn't<00:04:58.710> make<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:58.950> plows<00:04:59.130> but<00:04:59.340> I<00:04:59.370> think

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
they wouldn't make the plows but I think

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.280 
they wouldn't make the plows but I think
they'd<00:04:59.669> actually<00:04:59.820> be<00:05:00.030> not<00:05:00.240> too<00:05:00.419> bad<00:05:00.570> so<00:05:00.840> hope

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
they'd actually be not too bad so hope

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.210 
they'd actually be not too bad so hope
