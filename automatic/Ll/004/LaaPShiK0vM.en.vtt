00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.660
 This video camera 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.200
 It's attached to the remote control 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.780
 So it sounds like you can press the record button 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.290
 But you can also zoom 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.580
 It doesn't make much sense on Agassi day, but there will be no chance to use it too much 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:22.810
 It's very useful to be able to zoom, too . 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.930
 If you look at the net today, there is an interesting article 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.539
 Please tell us about the climate of the world is not convincing 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.670
 Well I was there is this kind of questionnaire cat Do not answer Gane 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.010
 That's it 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.690
 I think it's something I think I'm going to introduce a bit It really is unreasonable to say that in the world 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.710
 There are many things 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:45.180
 Get introduced from 3rd place 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.010
 I think this is really common, but I think it's a bit disappointing if it's b type 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.199
 Path I 2 weeks 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:57.059
 will have people listen None was'm really unfortunate in Japan word I type b 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:02.210
 After hanging Tsu Li Kazure keep hearing'd resolution ye try what is happening Oh t gutter it looks like 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:07.850
 It looks eh? I'm not or I was Tsuyya Bobby will make you feel things like that 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:12.650
 The students who bother to clean the classroom usually a little unreasonable but Do not think you'll ne second school 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.170
 Sometimes when students are cleaning usually one to be praised and cleaning properly can skip occasionally 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.909
 It is quite problematic 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.250
 28.4% This is I think you may be this but this is a student 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:27.960
 There is a change this in the matter of course anyone is 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.920
 But I think that's the same kind of feeling if we there like a longer Well this maybe the same example 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.810
 People who are cleaning usually become commonplace to clean 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:41.790
 Is questioned more than it Dechotto to Ena and skip because 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.180
 There is no way has become the standard for in do not do those who do not do usually it means failure to reverse 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.540
 Is it 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.170
 So I do not do it 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.650
 And for that 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.690
 I man is and begin to do the opposite I'm itself'm do not think anything 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.960
 Great 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:02:00.510
 That's why you did not do until now this is doing all cleaning it is not good Well 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:04.950
 Softening of Tteyuu began to do against this not done is 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:10.500
 It seems to be configured, it is taken to such a feeling and related 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.400
 It'd become # 1 is more of the person who first much more consistently configured from the bad than serious people 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:18.150
 It is praise 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.500
 37.6% Po is Harada obvious but talk is what to do not mass production 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.480
 I'm always living seriously 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:29.730
 I want to work seriously seriously in the later years and want to pay taxes seriously I want to notice such seriousness tax 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:35.549
 Of course such people should be admired 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:38.730
 Is usually a chat What do Michihazushi as a climate of I just world people 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.420
 I want to configure and do something now 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.690
 Such people are higher 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:50.050
 Anything is true, but so is TV 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:51.450
 There is a tendency that something is taken up, but I thought about it because it was annoyingly annoying 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.959
 As 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:02.730
 Although such should normally normally better of the people who went to live seriously up to what serve now be praised 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.030
 This trend is strange, but there is a stupid trend in this kind of sound world 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.900
 but 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.590
 Well personally the first place is a bit disappointing with this b type 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.890
 This is really Japan, it's Japan 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.160
 Leader 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.580
 I because you say many people also I type b Well I think you received discrimination 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.870
 In general, it would be a problem if it was judged only by the blood type 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:27.300
 Oh and Well have taken just for this I now feel cut out like a live broadcast 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.260
 By the way, I'm doing live broadcasting already every Wednesday night from 9:00, so if you can see that as well 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.880
 I think 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.540
 Today I will leave it here 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.540
 Thank you very much
