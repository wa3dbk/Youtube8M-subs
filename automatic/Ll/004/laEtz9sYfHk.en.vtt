00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
hello everyone this is Jason Nelson and

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.280 
hello everyone this is Jason Nelson and
I'm<00:00:11.790> going<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.090> show<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.300> my<00:00:12.750> Kinect

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
I'm going to show you my Kinect

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.330 
I'm going to show you my Kinect
controlled<00:00:13.880> spotlight<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:16.740> way<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.070> works

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
controlled spotlight and way this works

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.150 
controlled spotlight and way this works
I'm<00:00:18.270> an<00:00:18.420> xbox<00:00:18.840> controller<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.710> front<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.039> me

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
I'm an xbox controller in front of me

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.120 
I'm an xbox controller in front of me
and<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.760> could<00:00:20.910> use<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.410> to<00:00:22.410> control

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
and I could use this to control

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.420 
and I could use this to control
different<00:00:23.609> aspects<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> spotlight<00:00:25.430> but

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
different aspects of the spotlight but

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.509 
different aspects of the spotlight but
on<00:00:26.550> what<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.390> generally<00:00:28.140> do<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.859> I'm<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.400> to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
on what I generally do is I'm going to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.600 
on what I generally do is I'm going to
go<00:00:29.730> through<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.300> I'm<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.630> set

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
go through and I'm going to set

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.250 
go through and I'm going to set
calibration<00:00:32.610> points<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.600> different

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
calibration points at different

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.049 
calibration points at different
locations<00:00:34.829> across<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.370> room<00:00:36.350> and<00:00:37.850> once<00:00:38.850> this

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
locations across the room and once this

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.770 
locations across the room and once this
is<00:00:39.120> complete<00:00:41.030> then<00:00:42.030> I've<00:00:42.210> got<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
is complete then I've got the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.720 
is complete then I've got the
calibration<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> various<00:00:44.160> corners<00:00:44.430> of

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
calibration in the various corners of

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.010 
calibration in the various corners of
the<00:00:44.820> room<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:48.410> get<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> right<00:00:49.680> trigger<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:51.020> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the room I get the right trigger and the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.090 
the room I get the right trigger and the
connect<00:00:52.469> spot<00:00:53.160> lights<00:00:54.170> should<00:00:55.170> find<00:00:55.829> me<00:00:56.010> in

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
connect spot lights should find me in

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.680 
connect spot lights should find me in
the<00:00:56.190> room<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.890> here<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.430> has<00:00:59.609> found<00:00:59.940> me<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the room and here is it has found me and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.280 
the room and here is it has found me and
now<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.440> tracking<00:01:01.920> me<00:01:02.070> throughout<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> room

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
now it's tracking me throughout the room

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.690 
now it's tracking me throughout the room
so<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.830> want<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.729> piece<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.150> my<00:01:06.270> left<00:01:07.700> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
so if I want a piece to my left the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.060 
so if I want a piece to my left the
spotlight<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.570> still<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.380> me<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.950> little

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
spotlight is still on me it's a little

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.420 
spotlight is still on me it's a little
bit<00:01:11.189> rough<00:01:11.460> currently<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.869> walk<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.290> way

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.740 

spotlight<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.670> still<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.840> me<00:01:20.150> not<00:01:21.150> exactly<00:01:21.570> on

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
spotlight is still on me not exactly on

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.210 
spotlight is still on me not exactly on
my<00:01:21.780> head<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:24.049> you<00:01:25.049> know<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.979> first

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
my head but you know it's the first

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.800 
my head but you know it's the first
draft<00:01:26.549> all<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.060> continue<00:01:27.390> i'm

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
draft all I'm going to continue i'm

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.670 
draft all I'm going to continue i'm
going<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.140> continue<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.890> improve<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:30.680> but

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
going to continue to improve this but

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.090 
going to continue to improve this but
you<00:01:32.189> know<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> engine<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:32.970> there<00:01:33.860> then<00:01:34.860> tweak

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
you know the engine is there then tweak

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.789 
you know the engine is there then tweak
the<00:01:35.250> math<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.640> little<00:01:35.759> bit<00:01:36.439> this<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.590> all

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the math a little bit this is all

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.960 
the math a little bit this is all
written<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.250> delphi<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:43.009> i'm<00:01:44.009> having<00:01:44.220> having

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
written in delphi and i'm having having

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.550 
written in delphi and i'm having having
a<00:01:45.090> lot<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.270> prominent

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.670 

and<00:01:51.150> we'll<00:01:52.150> see<00:01:52.300> how<00:01:52.450> practical<00:01:52.960> I<00:01:53.350> can

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
and we'll see how practical I can

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.380 
and we'll see how practical I can
actually<00:01:54.070> make<00:01:55.030> this<00:01:55.350> anyway<00:01:56.350> thank<00:01:56.620> you<00:01:56.680> for

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
actually make this anyway thank you for

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.190 
actually make this anyway thank you for
watching<00:01:58.950> take<00:01:59.950> care
