get into the mid game where your longest
grind<00:01:23.380> will<00:01:23.680> be<00:01:23.830> between<00:01:24.070> those<00:01:24.370> couple

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
grind will be between those couple

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.640 
grind will be between those couple
hundred<00:01:25.270> levels<00:01:25.630> where<00:01:25.870> you<00:01:25.900> insta<00:01:26.440> kill
