00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:04.450
 I would like to take advantage of the program, ask for a license already 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.530
 that the chest 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.040
 be awarded 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.079
 I would like to enjoy the moment so important to see 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.659
 in an article that assumed importance for the whole class 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.759
 by the artists' union 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.060
 and that came out posted yesterday I wrote this article yesterday 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.320
 in space the brazilian newspaper I'll tell you with all respect strengthen active 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.410
 that it should be disclosed 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.689
 try to win all the changes 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.689
 I think maybe it's the article is the most important thing 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.560
 the company own fan since then 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.589
 the article now called 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:37.500
 but be serious 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.600
 in 1947 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.390
 the big hollywood producers gathered at the waldorf-astoria hotel in 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.530
 New York 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.830
 decided that artists with political tendencies at odds with their ideals 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.710
 they would not work more infilm says 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.880
 the blacklist 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.380
 and the consequent witch hunt 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.560
 in a short time not only radicals or liberals were persecuted 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.210
 any artist who displeased their studio bosses was listed and not 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.020
 I could get more work 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.250
 with an impeccable sense of opportunity 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.370
 tv globe chose exactly the moment of the constituent in brazil 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.760
 to open your blacklist 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.090
 who left the station without being sent away 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.400
 run the risk of not being able to work on commercials 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 about threat that these will not be side and paste 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.150
 a network holds almost the market monopoly 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.890
 advertisers do not even think of artists who might displease 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.150
 at this point 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.490
 can someone think I'm talking about personal interest 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.890
 I guarantee not 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.080
 I'm not saying that my ads can not be shown 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.650
 nor by the more recent fact of the calls parcak of my new spectacle in the scale 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.149
 2 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.100
 the goal of alvirrubro have been banned 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.300
 I am a very well paid artist, and even the shows have no other means of 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.390
 disclosure 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.230
 Thank God my monza shows crowded the theaters before I went to 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.200
 globe 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.569
 that the fat calls live would not pass on the broadcaster 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.709
 I already knew since October 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.219
 by the blog itself 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.169
 who told me the room when I went to say goodbye 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:17.889
 that way all your air commercials 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.259
 calls of the new show on scale two also if ps 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:24.929
 I see you being banned from using the word people 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.369
 the latter threat has been somewhat difficult to meet. 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.369
 megalomania is not yet law off the globe 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.759
 so it is not therefore to be expected for the first time on this subject 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:40.579
 leaves the globe where he concentrates great friends with the greatest smoothness 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.749
 I never took advantage of this space. 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.849
 godinho a space in own cause 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.489
 I write this yes 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.469
 because actors working on the program 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.359
 as eliezer motta 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.599
 a duck girl 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.679
 were chartered in commercials 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.319
 the agencies were informed unofficially of course 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.329
 as it happens in all the blacklists 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.209
 that the participations would not be accepted 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.339
 it's sad 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:10.659
 at this moment 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.769
 what is written every day democracy in the congress 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.659
 a company that has the status grant 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.890
 imposing cerci 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.889
 the work of the Brazilian artist 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.999
 in general already so bad 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:29.519
 really I would like to say that if the Saints was tremendously unfair 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.559
 when he called the boni in a luxury office boy interview 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:36.719
 in a ball and can cut 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.090
 both the rapporteur 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.349
 in the heart 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:40.009
 there
