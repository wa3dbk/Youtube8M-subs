00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.319 
to start 3 and mostly you'll see with
the<00:00:31.160> interface<00:00:31.640> that's<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:31.970> biggest<00:00:32.180> thing

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329

the interface that's the biggest thing
that<00:00:32.449> the<00:00:32.719> end<00:00:32.899> user<00:00:33.109> will<00:00:33.440> see<00:00:33.469> and<00:00:33.859> that<00:00:34.219> is

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
that the end user will see and that is

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.279 
that the end user will see and that is
that<00:00:34.670> there<00:00:34.940> is<00:00:35.030> now<00:00:35.179> a<00:00:35.210> small<00:00:35.539> medium<00:00:36.140> and

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
that there is now a small medium and

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:38.110 
that there is now a small medium and
double<00:00:36.890> wide<00:00:37.100> tiles<00:00:37.519> is<00:00:37.760> what<00:00:37.969> they're

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
double wide tiles is what they're

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.239 
double wide tiles is what they're
calling<00:00:38.359> it<00:00:38.600> so<00:00:39.019> the<00:00:39.140> small<00:00:39.379> tile<00:00:39.649> is<00:00:39.890> now<00:00:40.190> the

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:40.249 
calling it so the small tile is now the

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:43.239 
calling it so the small tile is now the
quarter<00:00:41.120> of<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.719> square<00:00:42.139> tile<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:42.710> of<00:00:43.039> course

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:43.249 
quarter of the square tile and of course

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:45.759 
quarter of the square tile and of course
a<00:00:43.370> square<00:00:43.729> tower<00:00:43.969> is<00:00:44.239> still<00:00:44.569> half<00:00:45.109> the<00:00:45.350> size<00:00:45.530> of

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
a square tower is still half the size of

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.469 
a square tower is still half the size of
the<00:00:45.979> double-wide<00:00:46.550> kyle<00:00:47.059> that<00:00:47.329> they're

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:47.479

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.899 
the double-wide kyle that they're
calling<00:00:47.809> it<00:00:47.929> so<00:00:48.409> that's<00:00:48.889> really<00:00:49.309> nice<00:00:49.460> also

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
they're adding more color support so you

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.200 
they're adding more color support so you
don't<00:00:52.010> have<00:00:52.069> to<00:00:52.219> be<00:00:52.309> stuck<00:00:52.519> with<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.789> red<00:00:52.940> blue

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
if they want to use a double wide tiles

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.810 
if they want to use a double wide tiles
before<00:01:12.500> myself<00:01:12.860> locked<00:01:13.100> it<00:01:13.250> in<00:01:13.340> just<00:01:13.670> for

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
before myself locked it in just for

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.240 
before myself locked it in just for
itself<00:01:14.180> just<00:01:14.690> for<00:01:14.870> its<00:01:14.990> partners<00:01:15.350> but<00:01:15.590> now<00:01:15.770> it

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
itself just for its partners but now it

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.010 
itself just for its partners but now it
could<00:01:16.640> developers<00:01:17.240> could<00:01:17.420> even<00:01:17.570> make<00:01:17.810> use<00:01:17.990> of

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
could developers could even make use of

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.680 
could developers could even make use of
that<00:01:18.230> double-wide<00:01:18.710> tile<00:01:19.370> if<00:01:19.670> they<00:01:19.910> if<00:01:20.450> they

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
that double-wide tile if they if they

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.530 
that double-wide tile if they if they
want<00:01:21.290> to<00:01:21.380> next<00:01:22.340> up<00:01:22.460> let's<00:01:22.610> move<00:01:22.790> on<00:01:22.970> to<00:01:23.240> some

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
want to next up let's move on to some

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.940 
want to next up let's move on to some
hardware<00:01:23.900> features<00:01:24.050> so<00:01:24.410> Microsoft<00:01:24.860> did

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
hardware features so Microsoft did

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.410 
hardware features so Microsoft did
announce<00:01:25.250> that<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.640> windows<00:01:25.910> phone<00:01:26.090> 8<00:01:26.240> will

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
announce that the windows phone 8 will

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.660 
announce that the windows phone 8 will
now<00:01:26.600> support<00:01:27.080> dual-core<00:01:27.500> processors<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.280> it

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
now support dual-core processors and it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.020 
now support dual-core processors and it
goes<00:01:28.850> actually<00:01:29.570> up<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:30.020> 64<00:01:30.770> core<00:01:31.370> processors

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
goes actually up to 64 core processors

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.540 
goes actually up to 64 core processors
so<00:01:32.240> just<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:33.170> case<00:01:33.290> it<00:01:33.500> ever<00:01:33.530> happens<00:01:34.100> which<00:01:34.310> I

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
so just in case it ever happens which I

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.030 
so just in case it ever happens which I
guarantee<00:01:34.910> you<00:01:35.180> won't<00:01:35.510> happen<00:01:35.750> no<00:01:36.560> you<00:01:36.890> will

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
guarantee you won't happen no you will

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.410 
guarantee you won't happen no you will
never<00:01:37.190> see<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:37.520> 64<00:01:38.150> a<00:01:38.540> core<00:01:39.230> processor<00:01:39.890> phone
