00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.900
 winter dictates its rules not only to 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.730
 Selection of clothing seasons 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.950
 but also preparing the car for the cold 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.080
 what season does it take for your 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.470
 the car skated in the winter without problems in this 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.420
 help to understand our auto tips on 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.910
 a lot of car preparation for 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.520
 winter comes down to pereobuvki and when pouring 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.770
 automotive fluids and cleaning 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.809
 motor systems and even if the machine 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.820
 ran through everything without any problems 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.250
 summer and at first glance technically 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.670
 fully intact cold weather she 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:47.159
 unexpectedly can bluff the typical 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.870
 blue picture in the evening the car worked 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.909
 regularly and in the morning to turn the key 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.890
 ignition engine does not respond 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.870
 the most common reason is 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.479
 launch failure failure 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.989
 battery case the fact is that 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.769
 myself 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.089
 battery 34 years if 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.820
 in summer , the battery load was 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.700
 small in the winter so we include 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.740
 bake a couple of everything else we have 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.930
 battery discharges much faster 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.149
 than in the summer the car will not start because 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.119
 the oil thickens in the cold and 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.030
 the starter cannot crank the engine 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.689
 thick oil so either we put the car 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.039
 in a warm garage or pour oil 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.140
 calculated for such a temperature on 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.659
 minus and if a to b is 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.130
 served it makes sense to call in 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.079
 car service and check the density 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.539
 electrolyte but if the battery 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.210
 almost new, it is desirable to remove all 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.159
 terminals clean and lubricate because the dirt 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.409
 leads to electrochemical corrosion 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.929
 anti-corrosion treatment specialists 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.070
 It is recommended to carry out also 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.200
 one of 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.430
 a minimum of parts preparing the car for 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.210
 winter season is the treatment of the bottom 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.210
 anti-corrosion coatings 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.700
 this is due to someone today 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.729
 day all roads are treated with reagents 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.260
 leading to transient corrosion 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.780
 car body 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.150
 and also visited motorists advise not 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.310
 start a warm up car they say that 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.260
 this is the prejudice left over from the times 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.540
 when everyone went to the carburetor 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.360
 cars on new cars this 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.830
 do not need to master 1 kilometer 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.959
 low speed 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.520
 and there the engine is already warming up and 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.350
 can be added year 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.840
 mandatory procedure for each 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.820
 car owner changing summer tires per day and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.380
 and the fact is that at air temperature 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.660
 not higher than 10 degrees 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.000
 summer tire tread rubber starts 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.950
 lose their elasticity with this than 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.519
 the lower the temperature the stronger fool 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.590
 tires contrast summer tires from winter 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.080
 is the first part 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.769
 summer composition mode contains less 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.380
 amount of possible additives and mixture 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.660
 gum while winter just 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.739
 a much larger amount is used 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:05.280
 with the possible types of rubber in connection with this 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.769
 of course its cost increases 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.510
 in relation to the summer equivalent of winter 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.640
 rubber has unlike summer 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.060
 analogue more lamellas 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.280
 that interact with the cold 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.299
 asphalt and snow that gives principle 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.579
 hold and and on the road 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.760
 summer tires in contrast to winter more 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.650
 it is necessary to be tough the first thing to pay attention 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.790
 when choosing winter tires 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.610
 it is the softness of the side cord that is 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.340
 is of great importance also has 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.370
 the value of softness is exactly the tread then 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.140
 have all the composition should be soft 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.060
 most effective and often winter 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.180
 asymmetrical tires 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.910
 the outer part of the tire is responsible for 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.620
 asphalt road 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.540
 inner snow should only 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.810
 to install such tires correctly 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.030
 according to markings on them 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.400
 the difference is summer from winter in dimension 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.340
 Ie example offers summer 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.470
 185 tires at 65 will be offered in 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.870
 the fourteenth degree then winter 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.329
 it is recommended to put a narrower and 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:17.639
 high that is 75 by 65 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:20.190
 why in the summer we are interested in clutch with 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.440
 expensive winter grip 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.580
 gives pressure to the ground accordingly 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.520
 with a greater height of rubber and more 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.870
 narrower profile turns out more 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.130
 ground pressure due to this 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:38.160
 improved properties such as braking 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:41.340
 acceleration and side skids of winter tires 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.220
 has two kinds as non-studded 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.190
 common people called velcro and 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.730
 studded version 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.480
 difference ordinary winter tires is good on 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.280
 dry asphalt and snow 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.500
 studded tires have a negative 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.630
 position when braking and accelerating 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.490
 dry asphalt, that is, you need to be more 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.650
 neat and use less 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.910
 speed at operation studded 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.200
 rubber but much better and properties on 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.080
 ice cover 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.310
 water in the expansion tank 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.080
 wiper cold weather 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.990
 you need to merge in the first place 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.270
 easy to find on nezamerzayku or composition and 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.310
 freezes at minus temperatures and 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.650
 general car with a mini weather 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.570
 conditions need to be prepared in advance and 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.910
 especially careful to be 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.630
 if the machine is not new and has already run 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.630
 domestic roads 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.220
 and 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.630
 taking into account the weather changes automatically 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.710
 there is a question about the unspoken rules of their ride 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.780
 in winter conditions 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.669
 and this information is relevant as for 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.460
 newbies motorists so for 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:04.520
 drivers with experience sentence in winter 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:08.930
 time of year must be respected 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.780
 the three basic rules the first is small 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.450
 movement speed 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.130
 the second distance must be greater than 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.720
 usually 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.100
 secret to stay 2 times 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:25.220
 slower than up 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:27.560
 informal years be attentive on 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.750
 on the roads and remember that fast driving is better 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.750
 put off until spring good luck on the streets
