wish to and it gives me the amount of
hours<00:01:20.630> minutes<00:01:21.049> before<00:01:21.439> it<00:01:21.469> will<00:01:21.829> ring<00:01:22.009> which

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
hours minutes before it will ring which

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.899 
hours minutes before it will ring which
is<00:01:22.460> nice<00:01:23.170> time<00:01:24.219> it's<00:01:25.219> nice<00:01:25.429> that<00:01:25.460> is<00:01:25.729> not

repeated<00:01:26.329> automatically<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.829> ringtone<00:01:28.249> blob

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
repeated automatically the ringtone blob

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.160 
repeated automatically the ringtone blob
of<00:01:28.549> life<00:01:28.880> it<00:01:29.149> ripe<00:01:29.329> rates<00:01:29.569> and<00:01:29.780> if<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:29.960> has<00:01:30.139> a

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
of life it ripe rates and if it has a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.370 
of life it ripe rates and if it has a
label<00:01:31.389> so<00:01:32.389> there's<00:01:32.630> nothing<00:01:32.719> really<00:01:33.020> here

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
label so there's nothing really here

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.080 
label so there's nothing really here
that's<00:01:33.799> difficult<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.749> alarm<00:01:35.749> seems<00:01:37.090> natural

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
that's difficult and alarm seems natural

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.940 
that's difficult and alarm seems natural
to<00:01:38.119> have<00:01:38.450> somewhere<00:01:39.259> around<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:39.770> clock

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
to have somewhere around the clock

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.209 
to have somewhere around the clock
application<00:01:41.530> but<00:01:42.530> then<00:01:42.709> there's<00:01:42.859> something

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
application but then there's something

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.069 
application but then there's something
else<00:01:43.369> that<00:01:43.490> I<00:01:43.639> don't<00:01:43.880> understand<00:01:44.389> straight

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
else that I don't understand straight

away<00:01:46.179> down<00:01:47.179> here<00:01:47.209> I<00:01:47.450> have<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.659> home<00:01:47.990> button

away down here I have the home button
I'm<00:01:50.509> not<00:01:50.719> sure<00:01:50.779> why<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.079> need<00:01:51.319> it<00:01:51.469> because<00:01:51.619> I

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
I'm not sure why I need it because I

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:53.559 
I'm not sure why I need it because I
have<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.549> back<00:01:52.700> button<00:01:52.939> over<00:01:53.149> here<00:01:53.179> as<00:01:53.389> well

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569

which would take me back to the home
screen<00:01:55.279> at<00:01:55.939> least<00:01:56.389> the<00:01:56.569> menu<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.679> it<00:01:57.829> seems<00:01:58.009> as

with the clock so it all seems very

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.360 
with the clock so it all seems very
strange<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:12.870> until<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.470> press<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.100> button

strange that is until I press the button
down<00:03:14.520> here<00:03:15.860> that<00:03:16.860> normally<00:03:17.190> has<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> more

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
down here that normally has a more

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.720 
down here that normally has a more
functionality<00:03:18.330> of<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.510> kind<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:19.250> this<00:03:20.250> tells

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
functionality of a kind and this tells

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.000 
functionality of a kind and this tells
me<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:21.300> well<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.540> can<00:03:21.750> go<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:21.930> alarms<00:03:22.320> again<00:03:22.440> so

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
me that well I can go to alarms again so

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.550 
me that well I can go to alarms again so
that's<00:03:23.160> kind<00:03:23.520> of<00:03:23.780> duplicate<00:03:24.780> off<00:03:24.960> the<00:03:25.260> icon

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
that's kind of duplicate off the icon

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.850 
that's kind of duplicate off the icon
just<00:03:25.740> below<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.340> can<00:03:27.300> add<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.450> lamb<00:03:27.780> fan<00:03:28.710> of

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
just below it I can add a lamb fan of

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.230 
just below it I can add a lamb fan of
and<00:03:29.570> then<00:03:30.570> there's<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.840> dark<00:03:31.110> sittings<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:33.150> we

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
and then there's a dark sittings so we

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.300 
and then there's a dark sittings so we
ever<00:03:33.330> going<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.570> dark<00:03:33.840> settings<00:03:34.170> here<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:34.530> can

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
ever going to dark settings here I can

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.370 
ever going to dark settings here I can
see<00:03:35.520> that<00:03:35.790> this<00:03:36.270> has<00:03:36.450> something<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.780> do<00:03:37.080> with

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
see that this has something to do with

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.860 
see that this has something to do with
if<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.740> put<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.160> phone<00:03:38.340> down<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:39.270> some<00:03:39.600> kind<00:03:39.810> of

moves<00:04:19.049> something<00:04:19.680> changes<00:04:20.270> when<00:04:21.270> you<00:04:21.299> have

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
moves something changes when you have

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.060 
moves something changes when you have
your<00:04:21.690> phone<00:04:21.959> let's<00:04:22.290> say<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:22.770> are<00:04:22.860> at<00:04:22.890> your

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
your phone let's say it you are at your

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.909 
your phone let's say it you are at your
office<00:04:23.490> desks<00:04:24.080> so<00:04:25.080> it's<00:04:25.229> all<00:04:25.320> very<00:04:25.500> easy<00:04:25.740> to

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
office desks so it's all very easy to

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.640 
office desks so it's all very easy to
understand<00:04:26.400> this<00:04:27.360> if<00:04:27.750> you<00:04:28.020> understand<00:04:28.530> that

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
understand this if you understand that

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.150 
understand this if you understand that
it<00:04:28.860> is<00:04:28.890> a<00:04:29.190> cradle<00:04:29.820> or<00:04:29.970> abduct<00:04:30.570> function

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
it is a cradle or abduct function

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.850 
it is a cradle or abduct function
so<00:04:32.160> why<00:04:32.940> is<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.599> must<00:04:33.960> go<00:04:34.229> under<00:04:34.530> clock

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
so why is it that I must go under clock

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.820 
so why is it that I must go under clock
to<00:04:35.370> find<00:04:35.550> this<00:04:35.840> and<00:04:36.840> I'm<00:04:36.990> very<00:04:37.110> surprised<00:04:37.560> by

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
to find this and I'm very surprised by

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.619 
to find this and I'm very surprised by
the<00:04:37.889> fact<00:04:38.129> that<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:38.340> cannot<00:04:38.669> change<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.449> time

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:39.629 
the fact that I cannot change the time

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.180 
the fact that I cannot change the time
of<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.870> date<00:04:40.020> in<00:04:40.169> here<00:04:40.379> I'm<00:04:40.680> very<00:04:40.889> surprised

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
of the date in here I'm very surprised

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.399 
of the date in here I'm very surprised
by<00:04:41.370> all<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.490> stuff<00:04:41.759> down<00:04:41.909> here<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.449> that's

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
by all the stuff down here and that's

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.279 
by all the stuff down here and that's
simply<00:04:43.710> because<00:04:43.909> the<00:04:44.909> information<00:04:45.180> is<00:04:45.720> put

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
simply because the information is put

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.469 
simply because the information is put
into<00:04:46.500> this<00:04:46.889> application<00:04:47.729> in<00:04:47.879> a<00:04:47.970> manner<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.270> I

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.510 
into this application in a manner that I
don't<00:04:48.690> understand<00:04:49.199> when<00:04:50.039> you<00:04:50.099> want<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.340> put

have<00:05:25.800> easy<00:05:26.130> access<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:26.580> a<00:05:27.240> number<00:05:27.569> of<00:05:27.900> large

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
have easy access to a number of large

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.930 
have easy access to a number of large
field<00:05:28.650> so<00:05:28.889> you<00:05:28.979> can<00:05:29.129> easily<00:05:29.250> hit<00:05:29.520> them<00:05:29.729> when

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
field so you can easily hit them when

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.180 
field so you can easily hit them when
you<00:05:30.030> are<00:05:30.120> driving<00:05:30.590> only<00:05:31.590> I<00:05:31.860> would<00:05:32.069> never

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
you are driving only I would never

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.580 
you are driving only I would never
expect<00:05:32.639> to<00:05:32.789> see<00:05:32.940> this<00:05:33.090> functionality<00:05:33.509> so<00:05:34.349> this

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
expect to see this functionality so this

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.370 
expect to see this functionality so this
I<00:05:34.770> can<00:05:35.039> should<00:05:35.430> be<00:05:35.550> changed<00:05:35.880> and<00:05:36.270> this<00:05:36.990> label

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
I can should be changed and this label

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.200 
I can should be changed and this label
should<00:05:37.590> be<00:05:37.740> renamed<00:05:37.949> something<00:05:38.639> similar<00:05:39.030> as

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
should be renamed something similar as

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.719 
should be renamed something similar as
yeah<00:05:40.199> it<00:05:40.349> could<00:05:40.530> be<00:05:40.560> duck<00:05:40.889> it<00:05:41.069> could<00:05:41.219> be<00:05:41.340> cradle

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
yeah it could be duck it could be cradle

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.089 
yeah it could be duck it could be cradle
it<00:05:41.819> could<00:05:41.969> be<00:05:42.090> a<00:05:42.120> lot<00:05:42.419> of<00:05:42.479> other<00:05:42.659> stuff<00:05:43.099> it

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
it could be a lot of other stuff it

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:45.740 
it could be a lot of other stuff it
shouldn't<00:05:44.460> be<00:05:44.520> clock<00:05:44.789> because<00:05:45.419> there's<00:05:45.630> no

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
shouldn't be clock because there's no

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.800 
shouldn't be clock because there's no
link<00:05:46.319> between<00:05:47.159> what<00:05:47.849> you<00:05:47.880> get<00:05:48.180> in<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.479> clock

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
link between what you get in the clock

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.080 
link between what you get in the clock
application<00:05:49.050> and<00:05:49.740> what<00:05:50.279> you<00:05:50.400> would<00:05:50.550> expect<00:05:50.849> to

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
application and what you would expect to

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.209 
application and what you would expect to
get<00:05:51.240> in<00:05:51.419> the<00:05:51.509> clock<00:05:51.690> application<00:05:52.039> so<00:05:53.039> it's

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:53.219 
get in the clock application so it's

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.610 
get in the clock application so it's
nice<00:05:53.370> application<00:05:53.940> but<00:05:54.569> if<00:05:55.080> you<00:05:55.259> think<00:05:55.289> this

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
nice application but if you think this

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.920 
nice application but if you think this
is<00:05:55.650> a<00:05:55.800> clock<00:05:56.099> you<00:05:56.759> will<00:05:56.940> see<00:05:57.210> this<00:05:57.360> application

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
is a clock you will see this application

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.140 
is a clock you will see this application
as<00:05:58.080> some<00:05:58.259> kind<00:05:58.440> of<00:05:58.620> trash<00:05:59.039> can<00:05:59.340> for<00:05:59.729> a<00:05:59.789> lot<00:06:00.060> of

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
as some kind of trash can for a lot of

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.790 
as some kind of trash can for a lot of
functionality<00:06:00.449> that<00:06:00.930> Samsung<00:06:01.469> didn't<00:06:01.740> know

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
functionality that Samsung didn't know

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.529 
functionality that Samsung didn't know
where<00:06:01.979> it's<00:06:02.099> a<00:06:02.159> put<00:06:02.190> if<00:06:02.580> you<00:06:03.029> know<00:06:03.150> that<00:06:03.330> it<00:06:03.449> has

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
where it's a put if you know that it has

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:04.870 
where it's a put if you know that it has
something<00:06:03.840> to<00:06:03.930> do<00:06:04.020> with<00:06:04.229> a<00:06:04.259> docking<00:06:04.740> station

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
something to do with a docking station

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.339 
something to do with a docking station
it'll<00:06:05.880> all<00:06:05.940> make<00:06:05.969> sense<00:06:06.180> and<00:06:06.569> be<00:06:06.779> a<00:06:06.810> very<00:06:07.080> fine

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
it'll all make sense and be a very fine

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:09.889 
it'll all make sense and be a very fine
application
