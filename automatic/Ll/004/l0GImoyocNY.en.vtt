00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 in this video I will tell you how to make 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.220
 the simplest low-speed generator for 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.090
 small -scale stirling engine 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.480
 temperature drop the whole trick is that 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.790
 any 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.250
 the generator is extremely sensitive to 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.609
 rate of change of magnetic flux 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.880
 through its windings the higher it is the better 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.880
 and this speed depends on 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.160
 of the engine speed but 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.460
 with a small temperature difference we do not 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.640
 We achieve high speed so you need 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.649
 maximize the diameter of the generator 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.210
 By taking the coils and magnets as possible 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.960
 further from the axis of rotation 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.640
 it will increase the angular velocity that i and 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.149
 made a generator consists of two parts 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.760
 rotor with coins and stator with coils 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.160
 the rotor rotates and at the same time is 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.469
 flywheel engine 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.840
 the rest is set coaxially to the rotor 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.260
 with a minimum gap between the magnets and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.799
 coils the easiest way to do single phase 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.830
 generator 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.880
 whose number of coils is equal to 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.979
 permanent magnets but this number 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.060
 must be even for example 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.060
 I have 16 lures him 16 coils lures and I 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.490
 stuck on double sided tape 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.030
 necessarily alternating their polarity 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:30.030
 so you need the parity of the coil too 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.340
 we mornings not as horrible but strictly alternating 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.930
 clockwise direction 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.840
 against clockwise vs. magnets 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.990
 neodymium diameter of 10 millimeters and 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.220
 5 coils thick wound with copper 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.060
 wire 015 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.530
 100 turns each thickness is not 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.649
 exceeds 1 millimeter 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.310
 because it is precisely within such limits that force 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.070
 Neodymium magnetic field to the maximum 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.189
 Further if cores are not used. 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.240
 it drops sharply in my hearts 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.790
 so that there is no sticking 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.030
 internal diameter of coils is equal to 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.170
 the diameter of the magnets used and 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.030
 transformation they must 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.980
 coaxially match all coils are connected 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:23.480
 consistently each other therefore on 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.680
 the output of the stator we have two wires well 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.440
 that's all 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.610
 I will add only one this generator 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.430
 alternating current 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.459
 so when you connect to it 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.010
 DC consumers will need 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.130
 use straighten or at least 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.760
 primitive but for LEDs and 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.440
 light bulbs 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.989
 this is not necessary in the next video I 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.870
 I will tell about the device of the new 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.900
 three phase permanent generator 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.900
 magnets
