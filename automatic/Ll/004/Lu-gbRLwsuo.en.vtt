to me can't tell if this is making a
difference<00:05:36.290> but<00:05:36.740> certainly<00:05:37.550> get<00:05:37.730> a<00:05:37.760> weird

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060

hairless<00:05:38.300> down<00:05:38.630> there<00:05:38.930> I<00:05:39.610> was<00:05:40.610> a<00:05:40.640> bit<00:05:40.790> worried

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
hairless down there I was a bit worried

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.130 
hairless down there I was a bit worried
there<00:05:41.210> wouldn't<00:05:41.390> be<00:05:41.480> enough<00:05:41.720> but<00:05:41.930> there's

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
there wouldn't be enough but there's

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.040 
there wouldn't be enough but there's
loads<00:05:42.410> of<00:05:42.530> it<00:05:42.680> left<00:05:43.210> ok<00:05:44.210> so<00:05:44.570> i<00:05:44.600> think<00:05:44.750> that's

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
loads of it left ok so i think that's

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.790 
loads of it left ok so i think that's
about<00:05:45.230> right<00:05:46.040> that's<00:05:46.340> enough<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:47.680> sunset<00:05:48.680> is

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800
