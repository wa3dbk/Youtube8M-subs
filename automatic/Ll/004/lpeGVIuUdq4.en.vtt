00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.340
 so you get to play ironman 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.370
 Do you have the impression that he is lonely? 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.049
 plus a classic celtic zelda clone 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.720
 8- bit and you have to walk by 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.340
 enter caves and look for a princess 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.289
 only that it actually delivers more than 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.529
 that this is not just a game of 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.640
 and is not just a simpleton of the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.289
 general right 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.689
 he manages to bring an ambience 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.399
 extremely engaging he can 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.170
 do something that I value a lot in 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.610
 some independent games here like 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.870
 several others that I have already presented 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.190
 channel as dinho 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.530
 are games that value audio and enem 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.719
 he manages to create this ambiance everything 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.820
 based audio as the game without track 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.770
 in which the audio can speak 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.030
 thing can deliver you when you 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.129
 is going a long way when 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.079
 I have a monster nearby and he who has 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.969
 elements that I like very much and did 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.219
 even references to the middle with the games of 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.230
 horror as when he puts a 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.680
 enemy you can not cope with 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.750
 is this cindy feeling of powerlessness 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.729
 character before an enemy that he or she 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.430
 can not face enough 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.650
 fear is mainly due to the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.570
 factor is that it has no pressure 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.240
 in the area it only has the ambient sound it 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.159
 in a totally pixelated game is something to 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.659
 being valued is something I 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.520
 tastes great in independent games 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.979
 poached they can make great 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.900
 things with fewer resources than many 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.600
 Sometimes it's not like that, it's not achieved. 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.280
 to be made even big blockbusters and there 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.320
 the game has several endings and has at least 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.549
 less 15 different endings is well 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.439
 interesting to sit on and not to 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.220
 It's a free game and it runs direct 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.710
 in the browser 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.600
 it is done by tiu photo 57 fines and 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.520
 cuts in some games more or less in the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.229
 same footprint they are very interesting 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.270
 mainly by improving it 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.329
 approach is really to make a sock with 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.649
 a re-read adoption tests 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.840
 I think it sure is a company 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.670
 What are you worth knowing at least? 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.950
 a little April to give you a 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.329
 The iran is the type of game 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.310
 I do not like the show here 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.960
 that that a short experience 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.060
 experience fast you will play 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.619
 Jim and I think maybe they're full of 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.850
 one of the sources of inspiration more 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.290
 interesting and creative 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.850
 independent developers 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.850
 you have to play where he man
