00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
talked about glue tails we talked about

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.470 
talked about glue tails we talked about
piriformis<00:00:28.869> very<00:00:29.500> important<00:00:30.160> to<00:00:30.430> be<00:00:31.090> able<00:00:31.360> to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
piriformis very important to be able to

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.350 
piriformis very important to be able to
release<00:00:32.110> your<00:00:32.619> back<00:00:32.829> so<00:00:33.160> we<00:00:33.340> talked<00:00:33.760> about<00:00:33.880> qlz

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
release your back so we talked about qlz

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.530 
release your back so we talked about qlz
big<00:00:34.720> deep<00:00:35.410> muscles<00:00:35.920> in<00:00:36.310> here<00:00:36.940> and<00:00:37.300> basically

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
big deep muscles in here and basically

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.930 
big deep muscles in here and basically
if<00:00:37.750> they<00:00:37.870> get<00:00:38.110> tight<00:00:38.410> what<00:00:38.739> can<00:00:38.890> happen<00:00:39.070> as<00:00:39.880> a

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
if they get tight what can happen as a

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.550 
if they get tight what can happen as a
runner<00:00:40.390> is<00:00:40.630> number<00:00:40.900> one<00:00:40.989> you<00:00:41.020> get<00:00:41.200> tension

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
runner is number one you get tension

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.840 
runner is number one you get tension
through<00:00:41.950> there<00:00:42.100> which<00:00:42.250> can<00:00:42.430> really<00:00:42.640> kind<00:00:42.820> of

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
through there which can really kind of

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.569 
through there which can really kind of
lock<00:00:43.060> you<00:00:43.239> up<00:00:43.270> but<00:00:43.899> but<00:00:44.170> also<00:00:44.410> it's<00:00:45.250> part<00:00:45.550> of

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
lock you up but but also it's part of

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.300 
lock you up but but also it's part of
that<00:00:45.730> kinetic<00:00:46.270> chain<00:00:46.300> so<00:00:46.930> so<00:00:47.350> if<00:00:47.860> you<00:00:48.100> think

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
that kinetic chain so so if you think

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.400 
that kinetic chain so so if you think
about<00:00:48.460> it<00:00:48.730> you<00:00:49.150> stuck<00:00:49.600> through<00:00:49.870> there<00:00:50.110> so<00:00:50.320> if

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
about it you stuck through there so if

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.470 
about it you stuck through there so if
you<00:00:50.530> almost<00:00:50.830> go<00:00:51.100> into<00:00:51.340> that<00:00:51.430> interrupt<00:00:52.360> type

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
you almost go into that interrupt type

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.260 
you almost go into that interrupt type
of<00:00:52.630> position<00:00:53.080> can<00:00:54.040> you<00:00:54.100> feel<00:00:54.250> that<00:00:54.280> tension<00:00:54.580> so

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
of position can you feel that tension so

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.780 
of position can you feel that tension so
really<00:00:55.630> if<00:00:55.840> they<00:00:56.200> lock<00:00:56.530> you<00:00:56.710> up<00:00:56.740> so<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:57.700> if

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
really if they lock you up so so if

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.130 
really if they lock you up so so if
you're<00:00:57.940> thinking<00:00:58.330> oh<00:00:58.450> I've<00:00:58.570> got<00:00:58.750> twice<00:00:58.930> it

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
you're thinking oh I've got twice it

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.960 
you're thinking oh I've got twice it
flexes<00:00:59.560> you<00:00:59.980> don't<00:01:00.520> want<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:00.730> just<00:01:00.850> think

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
flexes you don't want to just think

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.250 
flexes you don't want to just think
about<00:01:01.090> tight<00:01:01.390> here<00:01:01.570> but<00:01:01.720> you<00:01:01.900> want<00:01:02.050> to<00:01:02.110> think

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
about tight here but you want to think

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.009 
about tight here but you want to think
about<00:01:02.350> likewise<00:01:02.980> hip<00:01:03.610> flexors<00:01:04.059> gluteals<00:01:04.900> and

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
about likewise hip flexors gluteals and

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.929 
about likewise hip flexors gluteals and
particularly<00:01:05.619> QL<00:01:06.250> so<00:01:06.430> I<00:01:06.460> want<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:06.700> show<00:01:06.880> you

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
particularly QL so I want to show you

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.940 
particularly QL so I want to show you
guys<00:01:07.090> how<00:01:07.509> to<00:01:07.540> do<00:01:08.229> that<00:01:08.439> so<00:01:08.619> we're<00:01:08.770> going<00:01:08.860> to

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
guys how to do that so we're going to

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.499 
guys how to do that so we're going to
test<00:01:09.250> and<00:01:10.380> yeah<00:01:11.380> hip<00:01:11.560> flexor<00:01:11.829> range<00:01:12.009> first

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
test and yeah hip flexor range first

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.539 
test and yeah hip flexor range first
most<00:01:13.509> we're<00:01:13.659> going<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.840> get<00:01:13.930> engine<00:01:14.799> to<00:01:14.979> thomas

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
most we're going to get engine to thomas

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.700 
most we're going to get engine to thomas
test<00:01:15.729> positions<00:01:16.210> they're<00:01:16.360> comfy<00:01:16.750> rock<00:01:19.710> am/pm

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
test positions they're comfy rock am/pm

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.810 
test positions they're comfy rock am/pm
yeah<00:01:21.550> so<00:01:21.820> basically<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.590> it<00:01:23.710> could<00:01:23.920> pretty

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
yeah so basically but it could pretty

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.970 
yeah so basically but it could pretty
good<00:01:25.000> range<00:01:25.180> and<00:01:25.930> is<00:01:26.050> pretty<00:01:26.260> good<00:01:26.409> the<00:01:26.740> young

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
good range and is pretty good the young

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.860 
good range and is pretty good the young
so<00:01:27.310> shows<00:01:27.610> you<00:01:27.730> probably<00:01:27.940> about<00:01:28.090> 15<00:01:28.720> degrees

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
so shows you probably about 15 degrees

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.920 
so shows you probably about 15 degrees
below<00:01:29.430> 90<00:01:30.430> which<00:01:30.610> is<00:01:30.640> which<00:01:30.940> is<00:01:30.970> not<00:01:31.240> bad<00:01:31.450> we're

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
below 90 which is which is not bad we're

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.149 
below 90 which is which is not bad we're
going<00:01:32.050> to<00:01:32.140> actually<00:01:32.290> release<00:01:32.710> that<00:01:32.890> up<00:01:33.010> and

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
going to actually release that up and

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.620 
going to actually release that up and
see<00:01:33.310> if<00:01:33.370> we<00:01:33.400> can<00:01:33.550> increase<00:01:33.820> that<00:01:33.850> so<00:01:34.360> we'll

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
see if we can increase that so we'll

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.260 
see if we can increase that so we'll
just<00:01:34.720> come<00:01:34.870> over<00:01:34.990> here<00:01:35.110> guys<00:01:35.940> we'll<00:01:36.940> use<00:01:37.090> our

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
just come over here guys we'll use our

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.070 
just come over here guys we'll use our
wall<00:01:37.600> here

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
wall here

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.740 
wall here
I'll<00:01:38.320> watch<00:01:39.190> your<00:01:39.340> e-wallet<00:01:39.520> girl<00:01:41.700> sign

you're<00:01:43.750> gonna<00:01:43.840> stay<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.650> M<00:01:44.860> so<00:01:45.670> let's<00:01:46.570> tighten

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
you're gonna stay the M so let's tighten

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
you're gonna stay the M so let's tighten
it<00:01:46.960> so<00:01:47.700> I'll<00:01:48.700> just<00:01:49.000> tuck<00:01:49.750> this<00:01:49.930> one<00:01:49.990> up<00:01:50.409> and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
it so I'll just tuck this one up and

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.580 
it so I'll just tuck this one up and
basically<00:01:51.540> deep<00:01:52.540> through<00:01:52.750> here<00:01:52.900> so<00:01:53.080> we<00:01:53.260> always

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
basically deep through here so we always

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.860 
basically deep through here so we always
very<00:01:54.010> much<00:01:54.100> aware<00:01:54.549> of<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:55.030> way<00:01:55.240> out<00:01:55.360> our<00:01:55.600> trigger

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
very much aware of a way out our trigger

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.020 
very much aware of a way out our trigger
point<00:01:56.080> map<00:01:56.260> it's<00:01:57.130> very<00:01:57.430> clean<00:01:57.700> because<00:01:57.850> we

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
point map it's very clean because we

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.210 
point map it's very clean because we
just<00:01:58.240> use<00:01:58.479> it<00:01:58.600> all<00:01:58.810> day<00:01:58.840> every<00:01:59.409> day<00:01:59.440> you<00:02:00.070> guys

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.630 
have to be an expert on one trigger
point<00:02:02.049> map<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.320> it's<00:02:02.860> your<00:02:03.070> so<00:02:03.369> you<00:02:03.460> don't

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
point map and it's your so you don't

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.390 
point map and it's your so you don't
have<00:02:03.760> to<00:02:03.880> get<00:02:04.000> in<00:02:04.119> as<00:02:04.270> much<00:02:04.540> detail<00:02:04.780> but

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
have to get in as much detail but

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.350 
have to get in as much detail but
basically<00:02:06.400> you've<00:02:06.580> got<00:02:06.700> your<00:02:06.850> floating<00:02:07.119> rib

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
basically you've got your floating rib

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.089 
basically you've got your floating rib
through<00:02:07.690> here<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:08.080> these<00:02:08.349> big<00:02:08.619> thick<00:02:08.860> back

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
through here and these big thick back

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.830 
through here and these big thick back
straps<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:09.519> you<00:02:09.610> see<00:02:09.759> those<00:02:09.939> on<00:02:10.090> surfaces

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
straps so you see those on surfaces

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.780 
straps so you see those on surfaces
those<00:02:10.959> big<00:02:11.200> big<00:02:11.560> back<00:02:11.799> strips<00:02:12.069> if<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.340> get

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
those big big back strips if you get

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.820 
those big big back strips if you get
onto<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.239> edge<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.569> that<00:02:13.659> back<00:02:13.870> strap<00:02:14.170> and

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
onto the edge of that back strap and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.369 
onto the edge of that back strap and
sink<00:02:15.189> any<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.640> just<00:02:15.879> there<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.510> one<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.170> then

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
sink any is just there so one and then

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.500 
sink any is just there so one and then
at<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.860> lower<00:02:18.010> one<00:02:18.250> two<00:02:18.790> in<00:02:19.060> there<00:02:19.330> there's

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
at the lower one two in there there's

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.149 
at the lower one two in there there's
actually<00:02:19.750> deeper<00:02:20.170> ones<00:02:20.319> as<00:02:20.530> well<00:02:20.680> but<00:02:20.890> but

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
actually deeper ones as well but but

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.589 
actually deeper ones as well but but
we'll<00:02:21.310> just<00:02:21.340> do<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.700> superficial<00:02:22.240> ones<00:02:22.360> today

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
we'll just do the superficial ones today

bullies on that outer edge born to walk

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.710 
bullies on that outer edge born to walk
45-degree<00:02:36.290> angle<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.890> wall<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:38.330> and

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
45-degree angle to the wall and and and

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.570 
45-degree angle to the wall and and and
see<00:02:39.080> Kobe<00:02:39.290> back<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:39.710> concave<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.130> back<00:02:40.280> so

so see that Angela's got her knee bent

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.600 
so see that Angela's got her knee bent
again<00:02:45.410> because<00:02:45.680> that's<00:02:45.770> her<00:02:46.010> lever<00:02:46.220> so<00:02:46.460> her

wall<00:02:48.710> that<00:02:49.130> bent<00:02:49.430> knee<00:02:49.610> if<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:49.850> have<00:02:50.090> a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
wall that bent knee if you have a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.540 
wall that bent knee if you have a
straight<00:02:50.450> straight<00:02:50.900> knee<00:02:51.110> see<00:02:51.710> she<00:02:51.920> can't<00:02:52.220> she

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
straight straight knee see she can't she

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.250 
straight straight knee see she can't she
can't<00:02:52.730> get<00:02:53.180> pressure<00:02:53.570> onto<00:02:53.810> that

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
can't get pressure onto that

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.230 
can't get pressure onto that
okay<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.040> got<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.220> release<00:02:55.460> that<00:02:55.670> there<00:02:56.000> so

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
okay so you got to release that there so

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.700 
okay so you got to release that there so
that's<00:02:56.450> actually<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.780> higher<00:02:57.050> one<00:02:57.410> she's

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
that's actually the higher one she's

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.130 
that's actually the higher one she's
doing<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.160> there<00:02:58.370> at<00:02:58.610> superior<00:02:59.330> one<00:02:59.510> and<00:03:00.020> if

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
doing it there at superior one and if

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.520 
doing it there at superior one and if
she<00:03:00.260> moves<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.710> down<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.840> same<00:03:02.840> thing<00:03:03.140> it's

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
too far fallen to warm you got him so

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.070 
too far fallen to warm you got him so
sometimes<00:03:11.030> takes<00:03:11.270> a<00:03:11.420> little<00:03:11.660> bit<00:03:12.020> of

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
sometimes takes a little bit of

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.270 
sometimes takes a little bit of
maneuvering<00:03:12.410> when<00:03:12.770> you're<00:03:12.860> first<00:03:13.010> getting

great little Thomas disposition and and
again<00:03:52.640> so<00:03:53.420> we've<00:03:53.540> increased<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.960> range<00:03:54.290> so

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
again so we've increased that range so

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.920 
again so we've increased that range so
easily<00:03:55.310> got<00:03:55.459> another<00:03:55.610> 10<00:03:55.910> degrees<00:03:56.060> so<00:03:56.540> really

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
easily got another 10 degrees so really

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.800 
easily got another 10 degrees so really
simple<00:03:57.500> little<00:03:57.620> thing<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.330> that's<00:03:59.600> how

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
simple little thing and and that's how

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.920 
simple little thing and and that's how
it<00:04:00.020> puts<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.410> stretch<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.400> test<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:01.970> but<00:04:02.720> what

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
it puts a stretch and test and but what

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.540 
it puts a stretch and test and but what
we've<00:04:03.080> done<00:04:03.110> there<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:03.680> we've<00:04:03.709> we've<00:04:04.220> released

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
we've done there is we've we've released

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.060 
we've done there is we've we've released
those<00:04:04.940> cue<00:04:05.300> Elle's<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.959> which<00:04:06.500> has<00:04:06.650> given<00:04:06.950> us

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
those cue Elle's and which has given us

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.880 
those cue Elle's and which has given us
range<00:04:07.370> through<00:04:07.790> through<00:04:08.500> lower<00:04:09.500> in<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.709> body

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
range through through lower in the body

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.980 
range through through lower in the body
so<00:04:10.370> again<00:04:10.940> starts<00:04:11.300> to<00:04:11.390> think<00:04:11.570> of<00:04:11.630> yourself<00:04:11.900> as

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
so again starts to think of yourself as

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.380 
so again starts to think of yourself as

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
adjust and leave that then you get what

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.910
