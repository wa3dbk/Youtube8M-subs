 Finally, a mortal heart, 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:23.080
 He saved the two worlds from collapse and destroyed the Prime Evil forever. 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.180
 A new day is born for angels and people. 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.240
 Nephalem, the supreme champion of humanity 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:13.090
 he did what we could and he came face to face with the darkness. 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.040
 Brothers, I'm going back to you ... 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.240
 but this time, as a mortal. 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.200
 Today justice is in place, 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.110
 that's why we've done everything to save us. 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.160
 I continue as wisdom. 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:19.240
 In the light of this new dawn, the angels and the people will be together forever.
