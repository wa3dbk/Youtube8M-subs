00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 and we are with a boyfriend of jeta 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.580
 5 and in this case we are playing a 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.490
 new career as I'm seeing with 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.320
 subscribers care care and joseph efe 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.139
 baldini damn madness attention attention 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.870
 that send me to the other side is worth it 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.359
 well we have today a 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.789
 wal root incredible guys I've been 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.080
 watching the thumbnail and said this race 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.539
 I have to put it for you to see 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.150
 because it is damn very very epic is 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.760
 same drive let's see around here for the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.289
 right perfect let's go right now 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.059
 third let's see if we can do it 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.280
 quickly the walt challenge that the truth 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.090
 that I would be happy, even though it looks like 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.620
 complicated I hope it does not go well 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.050
 I would really fly if we did not pass it 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.460
 all say that it is so expensive to anyone 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.610
 that everything was spent there pim pam 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.320
 quickie that would be very good but 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.180
 well surely we stay 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.780
 trapped or someone gets stuck 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.100
 because the world races can be very very 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.199
 curious 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.710
 ok let's take a little bit the slipstream 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.989
 of this curve has been can not be no 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.909
 can be ally has sent you good me 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.890
 it has been bundled but well nothing happens 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.840
 we go back here put on quickly 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.030
 let's take here another little dot that we have and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.570
 we have another one that follows us very close 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:20.789
 in fact, my mother, my mother, we do not lose 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.340
 control of the car but we recovered it 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.560
 quickly it's worth to her from a tree two 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.850
 the world has to be here 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.229
 rights and in fact is already here is already 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.590
 here we go let's go see the first 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.470
 I try how we do very well first 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.330
 perfect attempt and let's go for the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.179
 next let's hope they are now 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.920
 reaching everyone for that they are crashing 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.679
 I do not know if someone has passed it on but 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.110
 It looks like one is half 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.390
 happening but I think I do not think that at 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.890
 final is not worth come come come back 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.890
 we will go back for a new attempt 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.540
 and eye is that it is not I do not want to give it very 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.650
 fast I think now they have caught 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.840
 the point I'm not very sure but I think 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.780
 that someone I know he has caught 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.100
 I want to turn a lot here why 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.540
 then the car goes away and that's why 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.850
 I'm bouncing all the time my mother 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.130
 my mother and so bad luck that we are 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.320
 having 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.950
 eye to see if it is that I have the bed to 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.650
 fly 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.920
 to see if now now it is worth first 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.890
 good try after so many shits 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.080
 so now yes now now yes now 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.830
 yes, that's how it's worth, it's worth it, 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.830
 shitting too much 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.260
 they have spent two perfect 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.690
 It's worth two seconds have passed 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.330
 it's pretty good we've bundled it 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.740
 very much my mother we have marked there 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.140
 more than ever and nothing happens does not happen 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.210
 nothing because the good thing is that they were 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.340
 being left because he did not take well what 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.290
 then it would be the ramp but then we have 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.850
 come first try good and we have it 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.770
 done so it has come out quite 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.750
 well the values I want that is happening 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.180
 on the ramp eta the next thing that I 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.100
 I tried to catch it well what happens that 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.810
 I did not want to give much to Haiti because 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.870
 with nothing that you owe you already moves a lot 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.489
 there is not a very little studying very 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.930
 very short touches then if there were 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.340
 given a little more what would have 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.930
 past is that we would have grown up manuel 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.850
 gual and so I wanted to catch the ones from 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.650
 first if we have to throw a lot 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.300
 but I was not calculating well 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.360
 nothing happens let's see if we get 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.090
 now road or even though they take me out 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.260
 quite I think that if they arrive and 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.000
 any of you two 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.650
 he does it the first time I even think that 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.390
 can have two opportunities each 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.830
 of them and they will have two opportunities 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.860
 because until I get where they are 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.360
 they are pretty good but the 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.010
 case is that nothing happens I'm happy 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.680
 actually because we have bundled it but 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.140
 then we have done the first and as soon as 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.120
 we could have the opportunity like this 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.680
 it was not there we are not here to see 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.870
 yes now that there is nobody that can 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.680
 done karin arnold to someone a lot for 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.380
 these curves and we do it well there 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.180
 we have it we are already almost arriving 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.730
 now let's start going in here 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.440
 already here is had the guard-rail we're going to 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.910
 see if it makes no first hope 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.550
 I 'm lucky and I got at least one 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.080
 opportunity to do it and be able to 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.910
 win the race that would be very very 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.620
 ok but I think it's going to be very 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.670
 complicated because I do not say is that 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.650
 they have had at least two 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.229
 sure tries 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.350
 it is worth the advance the second this test 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.669
 and not stops and asia now yes perfect 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.690
 up I do not want to look at the position 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.570
 I want to look if someone has arrived 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.990
 because if I'm not going to get nervous I'm going 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.370
 First, it's worth, it's worth, it's worth, 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.220
 ok we had the race if I do not win 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.350
 It is because he has messed up but I have 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.050
 I had eternity and it's gone a 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.690
 little the car a little bit and that's 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.610
 what happens is that it bounces I think that 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.680
 someone close to or has exploited not 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.169
 you are going to suicide 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.770
 I love it come no no no they have already 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.009
 past assured 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.220
 sure and yes yes 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.760
 like the boys 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.720
 I will see if I can pass it to me now 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.190
 it's second 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.040
 so the first one to say that we have 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.660
 ahead if there is not going to pass anything 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.740
 because it is not put to people so 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.580
 nobody is going to be able to exploit me either 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.580
 I will be able to do nothing because 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.490
 let's hope a tree a corner 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.930
 a lamp post but the guys do not seconds 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.639
 they are not nothing else is not bad 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.280
 We hope it arrives and now I tell you if 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.169
 It is good because we have also reached 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.129
 the seconds at the end is not bad at all 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.110
 I'm really happy 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:30.659
 because I have bundled it a lot there is 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.099
 saying it has arrived but the case is 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:33.810
 which then came out quite 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.939
 pretty good we could have stayed 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.099
 first and stay with that little thing 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:39.479
 final because as you have seen we have 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.280
 tried to do which reid the first 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.569
 once the first attempt has been good but 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.740
 it has come out more than anything because 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.289
 they were very nervous they wanted to look at the 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.300
 position did not look at her and she was pending 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.469
 to all but to which I return at the end 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.729
 so the boys I hope that I have 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:52.440
 liked it would be very much appreciated 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.759
 next brush you subscribed before to 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.330
 operated none and we do not see the next 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.330
 goodbye
