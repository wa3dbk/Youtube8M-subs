be using two different colors on my

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.530 
be using two different colors on my
nails<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.250> seem<00:01:05.610> long<00:01:05.850> wearing<00:01:06.240> nail

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
nails and we seem long wearing nail

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.740 
nails and we seem long wearing nail
enamel<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.100> an<00:01:08.280> orange<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.570> I

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
enamel and this is in an orange and I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.600 
enamel and this is in an orange and I
can't<00:01:09.990> tell<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.439> even<00:01:10.619> if<00:01:10.860> they<00:01:11.070> still<00:01:11.549> make

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
can't tell you even if they still make

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.700 
can't tell you even if they still make
this<00:01:12.000> because<00:01:13.100> it's<00:01:14.100> pretty<00:01:14.189> old<00:01:14.580> admittedly

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
this because it's pretty old admittedly

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.410 
this because it's pretty old admittedly
um<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.520> I've<00:01:17.610> had<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.210> at<00:01:18.299> least

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
um I think I've had it for at least

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.399 
um I think I've had it for at least
three<00:01:18.780> years

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
three years

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.620 
three years
I<00:01:19.439> don't<00:01:19.740> wear<00:01:20.100> orange<00:01:20.580> nail<00:01:20.820> polish<00:01:21.240> which<00:01:21.450> is

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
why I still have it but I thought today

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.240 
why I still have it but I thought today

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.679 
don't love it but I find it chips a
little<00:01:48.060> bit<00:01:48.210> too<00:01:48.720> soon<00:01:49.220> but<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.490> pretty<00:01:50.939> it's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
little bit too soon but it's pretty it's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.649 
little bit too soon but it's pretty it's
okay<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.140> wouldn't<00:01:52.710> buy<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:52.920> again<00:01:53.159> though<00:01:55.490> so

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
okay I wouldn't buy it again though so

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.569 
okay I wouldn't buy it again though so
basically<00:01:57.659> I'm<00:01:58.079> gonna<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.409> painting<00:01:58.680> every

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
basically I'm gonna be painting every

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.499 
basically I'm gonna be painting every
other<00:01:59.790> nail<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.420> these<00:02:01.939> because<00:02:02.939> apparently

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
other nail with these because apparently

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.990 
other nail with these because apparently
I'm<00:02:03.899> 12<00:02:04.799> years<00:02:04.920> old

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.670 

so<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.240> next<00:02:12.420> step<00:02:12.660> it's<00:02:12.870> probably<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.500> most

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
so the next step it's probably the most

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.490 
so the next step it's probably the most

and<00:02:20.570> it's<00:02:21.570> kind<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.840> interesting<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:23.970> take

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
and it's kind of interesting so you take

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.130 
and it's kind of interesting so you take
a<00:02:24.270> pencil<00:02:24.620> with<00:02:25.620> an<00:02:25.740> eraser<00:02:25.800> on<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.310> top<00:02:27.140> then

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
a pencil with an eraser on the top then

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.180 
a pencil with an eraser on the top then
you<00:02:28.170> take<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.500> pin<00:02:29.480> pin<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.690> has<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> flat<00:02:31.410> head

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:42.370 

then<00:02:36.080> we<00:02:37.080> stick<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.590> pin<00:02:38.630> in<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:40.560> eraser<00:02:41.340> head

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
then we stick the pin in the eraser head

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.410 
then we stick the pin in the eraser head
and<00:02:43.380> you've<00:02:43.530> got<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.800> get<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.070> in<00:02:44.420> relatively

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
and you've got to get it in relatively

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.199 
and you've got to get it in relatively
deep<00:02:46.100> now<00:02:47.100> I'm<00:02:47.250> going<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.490> take<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.910> colors

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
deep now I'm going to take the colors

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.830 
deep now I'm going to take the colors
that<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.450> wanted<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.840> polka<00:02:49.110> dots<00:02:49.350> with<00:02:50.840> take

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
that I wanted you polka dots with take

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.110 
that I wanted you polka dots with take
some<00:02:52.080> purple

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.360 

and<00:02:57.599> end<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.959> piece<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.290> plastic<00:02:58.769> I<00:02:59.040> just

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
and end on a piece of plastic I just

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.160 
and end on a piece of plastic I just
used<00:02:59.580> an<00:02:59.700> old<00:02:59.819> margarine<00:03:00.300> tub<00:03:02.810> but<00:03:03.810> some<00:03:04.050> of

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
used an old margarine tub but some of

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.400 
used an old margarine tub but some of
the<00:03:04.260> color<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.780> basically<00:03:07.260> want<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:09.410> dip

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
the color and you basically want to dip

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:19.949 
the color and you basically want to dip
the<00:03:11.250> tip<00:03:11.480> in<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.540> polish

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.559 

and<00:03:20.590> then<00:03:21.060> create<00:03:22.060> some<00:03:22.359> polka<00:03:22.540> dots<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:25.420> the

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
and then create some polka dots and the

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.449 
and then create some polka dots and the
reason<00:03:25.959> I<00:03:26.049> like<00:03:26.260> pinheads<00:03:26.829> for<00:03:27.069> this<00:03:27.189> is

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
reason I like pinheads for this is

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.869 
reason I like pinheads for this is
because<00:03:28.109> you<00:03:29.109> get<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.500> most<00:03:29.680> tiny<00:03:30.219> detailed

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
because you get the most tiny detailed

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.459 
because you get the most tiny detailed
dots<00:03:32.909> more<00:03:33.909> than<00:03:34.090> if<00:03:34.450> he<00:03:34.659> is<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.840> toothpick<00:03:35.200> for

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:35.469 
dots more than if he is a toothpick for

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:46.300 
dots more than if he is a toothpick for
example

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:59.470 

you<00:03:46.849> have<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.090> kind<00:03:47.330> of<00:03:47.390> read<00:03:47.599> it<00:03:47.780> back<00:03:48.140> in

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.470 

and<00:04:00.020> there's<00:04:00.230> our<00:04:00.410> finished<00:04:00.590> nail<00:04:01.480> looks

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
colors to do this then I would pick holy

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.130

face<00:05:42.870> with<00:05:43.530> them<00:05:43.740> a<00:05:43.980> dark<00:05:44.340> polka<00:05:44.640> dot<00:05:44.820> I<00:05:45.150> mean

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
face with them a dark polka dot I mean

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.360 
face with them a dark polka dot I mean
you<00:05:46.380> could<00:05:46.560> do<00:05:46.680> it<00:05:46.770> with<00:05:46.890> a<00:05:46.920> lighter<00:05:47.190> one

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
you could do it with a lighter one

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.600 
you could do it with a lighter one
obviously<00:05:47.820> as<00:05:48.030> I'm<00:05:48.180> doing<00:05:48.450> here<00:05:48.630> but<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:50.310> just

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
obviously as I'm doing here but it just

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.520 
obviously as I'm doing here but it just
looks<00:05:50.850> better<00:05:51.150> with<00:05:51.450> their<00:05:51.690> ones<00:05:52.080> I<00:05:52.260> think

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530

looks better with their ones I think
just<00:05:53.100> don't<00:05:53.250> worry<00:05:53.400> this<00:05:53.670> is<00:05:53.790> gonna<00:05:53.970> suck<00:05:55.070> this

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
just don't worry this is gonna suck this
