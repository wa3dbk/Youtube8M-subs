the studio tyranids now these have gone
through<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.319> couple<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:05.150> incarnations<00:00:06.150> the

through a couple of incarnations the
first<00:00:07.020> one<00:00:07.230> was<00:00:07.379> oceanic<00:00:08.220> tyranids<00:00:08.910> but<00:00:09.420> the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
first one was oceanic tyranids but the

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.209 
first one was oceanic tyranids but the
teal<00:00:09.750> obviously<00:00:10.380> was<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.559> miserable<00:00:10.800> failure

tyranids<00:00:42.690> called<00:00:42.899> hive<00:00:43.170> guard<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.860> we're

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
tyranids called hive guard and we're

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.490 
tyranids called hive guard and we're
getting<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.820> lot<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.120> orders<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:45.750> these<00:00:46.140> and

getting a lot of orders for these and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.840 
getting a lot of orders for these and
they<00:00:46.710> are<00:00:47.149> great<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.750> game<00:00:48.930> they<00:00:49.230> are

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
they are great in the game they are

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.740 
they are great in the game they are
toughness<00:00:50.850> six<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:52.430> i<00:00:53.430> believe<00:00:54.210> armor<00:00:54.570> say

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
toughness six and i believe armor say

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.439 
toughness six and i believe armor say
for<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.620> toughness<00:00:56.610> six<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.030> important

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
for up and toughness six is important

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.150 
for up and toughness six is important
because<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.840> means<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.230> can't<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.620> insta

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
because that means it can't be insta

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.500 
because that means it can't be insta
killed<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:02.010> hive<00:01:02.399> guard<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.239> rare

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
killed and so hive guard have that rare

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
killed and so hive guard have that rare
quality<00:01:04.080> where<00:01:04.229> they<00:01:04.379> do<00:01:04.439> something<00:01:04.920> good<00:01:05.280> but

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
quality where they do something good but

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.359

toughness to them oh and they have

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.149 
toughness to them oh and they have
ballistics<00:01:10.350> kill<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.860> it's<00:01:13.860> it's

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
ballistics kill for so it's it's it's

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.380 
ballistics kill for so it's it's it's
pretty<00:01:14.430> awesome<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> model<00:01:15.360> looks

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
pretty awesome and the model looks

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.280 
pretty awesome and the model looks
really<00:01:15.990> cool<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.430> our<00:01:18.119> answer<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
really cool this is our answer to the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.149 
really cool this is our answer to the
harpy<00:01:19.820> now<00:01:20.820> I've<00:01:21.659> changed<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.320> body<00:01:22.530> pose<00:01:22.890> you

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
harpy now I've changed the body pose you

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.260 
harpy now I've changed the body pose you
can't<00:01:23.340> really<00:01:23.520> tell<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.150> I've<00:01:24.240> changed

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
can't really tell here but I've changed

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.990 
can't really tell here but I've changed
the<00:01:24.720> body<00:01:24.900> posts<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> tail<00:01:25.770> isn't<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.700> close

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the body posts the tail isn't so close

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.910 
the body posts the tail isn't so close
to<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> ground<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.720> looks<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.320> flying

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
to the ground it looks like it's flying

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.649 
to the ground it looks like it's flying
along<00:01:29.579> at<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> more<00:01:30.090> clipper<00:01:30.420> pace<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.970> think

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
along at a more clipper pace so I think

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.359 
along at a more clipper pace so I think
I've<00:01:33.900> already<00:01:34.049> talked<00:01:34.380> about<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.770> conversion

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
I've already talked about the conversion

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.850 
I've already talked about the conversion
work<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.540> got<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> custom<00:01:37.619> tail

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
work on this it's got a custom tail

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.200 
work on this it's got a custom tail
these<00:01:38.430> are<00:01:38.610> Balrog<00:01:39.119> wings<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:41.210> front

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
these are Balrog wings that the front

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.420 
these are Balrog wings that the front
talons<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:43.110> been<00:01:43.259> changed<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.100> they

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
talons have been changed so that they

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.160 
talons have been changed so that they
are<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.149> line<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.659> tyranid<00:01:48.170> structure

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
are in line with that tyranid structure

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.929 
are in line with that tyranid structure
and<00:01:49.759> underneath<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:51.149> you've<00:01:51.420> got<00:01:52.700> we<00:01:53.700> used

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
and underneath here you've got we used

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.370 
and underneath here you've got we used
one<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.880> carnifex<00:01:56.880> plates<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.079> don't<00:01:58.320> know

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
one of the carnifex plates I don't know

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.319 
one of the carnifex plates I don't know
if<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:58.950> where<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.149> has

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
if you can see it there where it has

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.929 
if you can see it there where it has
like<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.719> spore<00:02:01.020> launcher<00:02:01.590> holes<00:02:01.979> there<00:02:02.549> so

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
like the spore launcher holes there so

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.469 
like the spore launcher holes there so
for<00:02:03.719> all<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.899> its<00:02:04.259> equipment<00:02:05.040> all<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.909> weapons

that it has it has the appropriate thing
modeled<00:02:10.110> actually<00:02:10.770> on<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.039> figure<00:02:11.220> hey<00:02:11.879> now

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
modeled actually on the figure hey now

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.080 
modeled actually on the figure hey now
let's<00:02:12.270> talk<00:02:12.510> about<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.959> colors

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
let's talk about the colors

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.450 
let's talk about the colors
the<00:02:15.200> now<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> little<00:02:16.950> different<00:02:17.340> than

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
the now this is a little different than

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.070 
the now this is a little different than
what<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.610> normally<00:02:17.700> do<00:02:18.240> because<00:02:18.390> usually<00:02:18.780> I'm<00:02:19.050> a

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
what I normally do because usually I'm a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.400 
what I normally do because usually I'm a
huge<00:02:19.440> fan<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.800> pale<00:02:20.370> skin<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:22.080> dark

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
huge fan of pale skin and a dark

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.950 
huge fan of pale skin and a dark
carapace<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.000> case<00:02:24.210> I<00:02:24.390> really<00:02:24.660> ended

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
carapace and in this case I really ended

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.090 
carapace and in this case I really ended
up<00:02:25.080> with<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:26.480> dark<00:02:27.480> almost<00:02:28.350> brick<00:02:28.800> red

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
up with a dark almost brick red

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.910 
up with a dark almost brick red
especially<00:02:29.880> on<00:02:29.970> these<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.750> brick<00:02:31.320> red<00:02:32.390> skin<00:02:33.390> and

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
especially on these a brick red skin and

especially on these a brick red skin and
the<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.250> colors<00:02:35.580> for<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.850> skin<00:02:36.180> our<00:02:37.340> whole

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
the the colors for the skin our whole

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.560 
the the colors for the skin our whole
read<00:02:38.700> by<00:02:38.970> Vallejo<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.310> khaki<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.460> it's<00:02:42.450> a

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
read by Vallejo and khaki and it's a

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.100 
read by Vallejo and khaki and it's a
privateer<00:02:43.110> press<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.800> brown<00:02:44.310> ink<00:02:44.820> wash<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
privateer press a brown ink wash and the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.630 
privateer press a brown ink wash and the
thing<00:02:46.260> about<00:02:46.290> private<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.890> your<00:02:47.010> press<00:02:47.250> Brown

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
thing about private to your press Brown

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.380 
thing about private to your press Brown
is<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.570> it's<00:02:48.720> actually<00:02:48.960> kind<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.920> purple

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
is that it's actually kind of a purple

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.710 
is that it's actually kind of a purple
color<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:52.080> now<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.520> trigon<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.540> actually

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
color so now on the trigon I actually

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.560 
color so now on the trigon I actually
made<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.590> bottom<00:02:56.310> portion<00:02:56.850> of<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.270> skin<00:02:57.540> very

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
made the bottom portion of the skin very

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.400 
made the bottom portion of the skin very
light<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.290> made<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.130> almost<00:02:59.310> purpley<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.410> I

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
light and made it almost purpley and I

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.580 
light and made it almost purpley and I
made<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> custom<00:03:02.280> glaze<00:03:02.880> out<00:03:03.240> of<00:03:03.390> Vallejo<00:03:03.900> gore

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
made a custom glaze out of Vallejo gore

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.750 
made a custom glaze out of Vallejo gore
red<00:03:05.900> what<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:06.990> it<00:03:07.110> dark<00:03:07.350> Prussian<00:03:07.830> blue<00:03:07.860> so<00:03:08.460> red

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
red what is it dark Prussian blue so red

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.030 
red what is it dark Prussian blue so red
and<00:03:08.910> blue<00:03:09.270> make<00:03:09.720> purple<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.440> that's<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.830> hard

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
and blue make purple and that's a hard

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.850 
and blue make purple and that's a hard
thing<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.430> pull<00:03:11.580> off<00:03:11.810> but<00:03:12.810> on<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.410> back<00:03:13.590> side

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
thing to pull off but on the back side

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.000 
thing to pull off but on the back side
again<00:03:14.280> you'll<00:03:14.460> see<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.910> brick<00:03:15.540> red<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.170> the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
again you'll see the brick red and the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.610 
again you'll see the brick red and the
khaki<00:03:17.490> and<00:03:17.610> it's<00:03:18.120> straight<00:03:18.510> khaki<00:03:19.080> on<00:03:19.260> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
khaki and it's straight khaki on the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.190 
khaki and it's straight khaki on the
ends<00:03:20.580> of<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.760> talents<00:03:21.240> so<00:03:21.540> that's<00:03:22.020> the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
ends of the talents so that's the

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.680 
ends of the talents so that's the
narrative<00:03:22.590> there<00:03:22.740> anything<00:03:23.040> super<00:03:23.730> hard<00:03:24.180> is

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
narrative there anything super hard is

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.740 
narrative there anything super hard is
that<00:03:25.440> khaki<00:03:25.890> color<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:28.280> what<00:03:29.280> else<00:03:29.460> the<00:03:29.760> the

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
that khaki color and what else the the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.160 
that khaki color and what else the the
carapace<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.760> foul<00:03:32.760> green<00:03:33.330> which<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.930> actually

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
carapace is foul green which is actually

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.930 
carapace is foul green which is actually
a<00:03:34.410> very<00:03:34.790> light<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.060> airy<00:03:37.070> green<00:03:38.070> I've<00:03:38.340> heard

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
a very light and airy green I've heard

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.330 
a very light and airy green I've heard
it<00:03:39.060> called<00:03:39.270> park<00:03:39.600> green<00:03:40.110> before<00:03:40.590> in<00:03:41.040> other

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
it called park green before in other

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.790 
it called park green before in other
ranges<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.150> I'm<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.750> huge<00:03:43.020> fan<00:03:43.050> of<00:03:43.320> that<00:03:43.560> and

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
ranges and I'm a huge fan of that and

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.130 
ranges and I'm a huge fan of that and
actually<00:03:44.490> after<00:03:45.030> painting<00:03:45.270> these<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.540> realized

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
actually after painting these I realized

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.820 
actually after painting these I realized
that<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.440> had<00:03:46.680> gone<00:03:46.890> back<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.730> an<00:03:47.880> old<00:03:48.090> standby

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
that I had gone back to an old standby

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.740 
that I had gone back to an old standby
many<00:03:49.830> years<00:03:50.010> ago<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.340> did<00:03:50.550> a<00:03:50.580> tomb<00:03:50.880> kings<00:03:51.180> army

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
many years ago I did a tomb kings army

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.000 
many years ago I did a tomb kings army
in<00:03:51.930> Burgundy<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.780> park<00:03:54.780> green<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.500> that

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
in Burgundy and park green and that

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.300 
in Burgundy and park green and that
turned<00:03:56.280> out<00:03:56.370> really<00:03:56.730> good<00:03:57.560> normally<00:03:58.560> red<00:03:58.920> and

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
turned out really good normally red and

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.490 
turned out really good normally red and
green<00:04:00.270> is<00:04:00.300> pretty<00:04:01.140> unsightly<00:04:01.680> but<00:04:02.520> if<00:04:03.270> you

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
green is pretty unsightly but if you

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.440 
green is pretty unsightly but if you
skew<00:04:04.500> them<00:04:04.710> just<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.190> little<00:04:05.340> bit<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.850> choose<00:04:06.420> a

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
skew them just a little bit and choose a

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.890 
skew them just a little bit and choose a
different<00:04:06.840> area<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.830> spectrum<00:04:08.360> they<00:04:09.360> can

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
different area of the spectrum they can

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.460 
different area of the spectrum they can
work<00:04:10.170> quite<00:04:10.560> nicely<00:04:10.850> so<00:04:11.850> you<00:04:12.750> know<00:04:12.870> for<00:04:13.230> me<00:04:13.320> the

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
work quite nicely so you know for me the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.110 
work quite nicely so you know for me the
jury's<00:04:13.800> out<00:04:13.950> on<00:04:14.010> whether<00:04:14.190> this<00:04:14.580> worked<00:04:14.910> or<00:04:15.090> not

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
jury's out on whether this worked or not

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.570 
jury's out on whether this worked or not
but<00:04:15.450> I'm<00:04:15.600> kind<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:15.840> stuck<00:04:16.080> now<00:04:16.350> and<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:17.430> is

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
but I'm kind of stuck now and this is

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.260 
but I'm kind of stuck now and this is
about<00:04:17.730> 800<00:04:18.330> points<00:04:18.510> into<00:04:19.049> 2,000<00:04:19.859> points<00:04:20.270> just

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
about 800 points into 2,000 points just

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.560 
about 800 points into 2,000 points just
one<00:04:21.420> other<00:04:21.600> thing<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:21.960> wanted<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.290> point<00:04:22.620> out<00:04:23.130> is
