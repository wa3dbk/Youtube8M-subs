00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.380
 will give dear viewers today us 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:13.860
 follow up on video review on a6 2 just 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.490
 fight on this plane in then gm lost 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.910
 who are in the game now 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.490
 as you know we have this patch now 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.910
 112 but generally that is not very strong 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.480
 different from the patch at 10 11 please 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.070
 forgiveness changed a little the role of low 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.280
 created aircraft changed the role 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.980
 high-altitude aircraft and changed the role 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.090
 attack aircraft the role of the first and second to change 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.890
 so that they spent no longer lonely 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.870
 value damage up that down field 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.330
 second changed to what we have now 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.100
 for aircraft downing advantage 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.000
 reset to less than knock off and 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.190
 ground targets 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.489
 so you have to beat the plane a lot 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.409
 more intense so as not to lose by 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.750
 capturing foreplay told you now 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.339
 let's look at the fight for yourself 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.409
 what we started here in the form but at the beginning 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.970
 the battle here gained altitude under come on 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.590
 kilometer occasionally to 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.350
 engage the burzum not but because i 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.390
 Now you got that level here 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.570
 opponents fly high enough 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.549
 using generally with such tactics that you 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.790
 standing on his tail can make him 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.259
 reset height and then down already 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.189
 find out here all sorts of different 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:28.429
 opponents scatter while 6 m2 not 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.049
 saw me and calm down a long third 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.450
 here is not a particularly dangerous opponent 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.900
 because from all the suspension you saw 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.430
 flies so it 's not up to 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.440
 a small such dangerous bird 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.870
 so that here apparently our opponents 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.450
 big pile is at its base 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.130
 they are there too, and we are here in 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.220
 overall so fairly organized 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.250
 a bunch of here we cut out the plane but here 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.120
 here again then here are two frags to me 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.860
 nobody there just wants they're all evil and 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.220
 in jails are taken like this 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.790
 i am to 7 here here there is a dangerous opponent 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.820
 with frontal attacks but the plane is not 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.080
 they know that when they shoot at it is necessary 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.630
 I turn away not aircraft of course 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.850
 players who send me here 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.430
 I notice that here's a mustang flying 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.450
 I think we should have drunk a little 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.790
 shoots enter 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.650
 or stalling sur airplane yourself pro and 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.690
 stalling such gelding stop 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.910
 management feels pretty good 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.010
 but by mustang i have nothing here 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.050
 comes across because the guns 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.540
 It is not particularly large airspeed 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.910
 the projectile is not really looking fast with 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.459
 goal curve up goes up but accept 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.980
 grateful occupation shoot out 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.750
 up the mustang here resolved a little bit 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.340
 get up in the assault south oh thought he would go on 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.380
 call from a friend but he went to my forehead 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.019
 well that got off easy 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.510
 total 4 points lost strength 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.450
 I find him back here but 200 points 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.120
 cut down 300 is not a problem though there are minds 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.010
 in general catch me and reminded me 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.750
 mini ended well because i don't 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.720
 dared to have she hung there boom 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.120
 No, we are doing this here for the time being. 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.739
 I do not realize that we have left the aircraft and 3 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.870
 big enough to fly here 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.090
 group of four aircraft 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.110
 the enemy is still somewhere machine upstairs 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.100
 I come on emile emil flies here 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.800
 optimally 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.810
 guests know this because its beaches 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.420
 ease on two heads 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.700
 we twist it but there is nothing already done 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.920
 can speed lost everything lost on 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.240
 kill him guns overheat 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.610
 almost to the end 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.910
 so I shoot do not let go of the trigger 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.670
 so that at least with machine guns take off yak-1m 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.920
 here, too, does not seek to sit on the tail 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.930
 tightly not seeking somewhere in tennis 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.420
 wait a moment, he doesnâ€™t want to shoot 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.670
 finish the goal and here in general two 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.650
 one of which is our plane 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.100
 practically dying against one 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.020
 mustang mustang got caught i won't 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.850
 speak specifically about the person but in 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.120
 this particular fight he got caught 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.700
 competent for him I will not forest up 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.100
 With a little sense of it, I think that 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.800
 Now we see how to deal with 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.310
 him you me in the outside again mustang kills 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.239
 the one the plane I was with 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.430
 and nothing is left here except 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:21.280
 somehow twist how are you in kill another 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.380
 let us go I use his letter if only 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.590
 not 82 percent capture 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.600
 on which we jump here in 1721 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.370
 nothing already on here will save and 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.680
 the only chance here is the features to do 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.140
 this drink mustang in the last desperate 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.870
 I try to understand that either the pan or disappeared 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.140
 and I'm missing exactly here 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.930
 a little bit to put in the mustang I'm 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.410
 put it on though on the sides it'll climb with 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.310
 mind the key battle but not reduced as a result 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.890
 defeat it I don't know 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.630
 You can regard it as you want and given 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.020
 there was a topic on the forum 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.690
 with that title interestingly which in 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.630
 In general, I can understand here how it is 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.180
 the case when the exit war is lost the battle 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.190
 You can certainly say no to this 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.260
 installation cut you well two more 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.540
 calling which he had missed me 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.300
 and in general the energy would have him nonetheless 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.300
 would have ended sooner or later i would have you 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:22.110
 would kill if he played more accurately well 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.270
 Here are the points. What else to say? 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.290
 We will hold debriefing here 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.880
 file 2 here we broke might there 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.550
 on the ground to shoot but 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.710
 landmark that mosquito three frags by 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.860
 On - ground bargain our profile attack aircraft 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.950
 one did everything by zeros one did 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.320
 one did the other one too 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.990
 countries attack aircraft are also not very much 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.630
 let's shoot 2d 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.270
 actually 02 you made eight frags 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.840
 let's not judge 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.940
 that the realities of the current are almost such that 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.190
 there are such lesions possible 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.590
 say hurtful though really but 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.960
 Mustang did everything right so that 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.420
 share your comments on this fight
