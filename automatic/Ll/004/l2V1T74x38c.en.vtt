what<00:00:03.689> is<00:00:03.989> a<00:00:04.049> planner<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.830> this<00:00:05.430> is<00:00:05.670> actually

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
what is a planner and this is actually

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.670 
what is a planner and this is actually
quite<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.330> difficult<00:00:06.450> question<00:00:06.779> I<00:00:07.229> think<00:00:07.290> most

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
quite a difficult question I think most

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.930 
quite a difficult question I think most
planners<00:00:07.979> do<00:00:08.100> find<00:00:08.370> it<00:00:08.430> quite<00:00:08.549> difficult<00:00:08.610> to

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
planners do find it quite difficult to

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.259 
planners do find it quite difficult to
explain<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.389> their<00:00:09.510> moms<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.870> planner<00:00:11.269> has

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
explain it to their moms a planner has

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.820 
explain it to their moms a planner has
to<00:00:12.420> be<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.540> lot<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.750> different<00:00:12.929> things<00:00:13.290> but<00:00:13.769> I

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
to be a lot of different things but I

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.860 
to be a lot of different things but I
suppose<00:00:14.070> one<00:00:14.580> way<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.820> summarise<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.419> is<00:00:15.570> that

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
suppose one way to summarise it is that

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.589 
suppose one way to summarise it is that
you<00:00:16.080> need<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.320> kind<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.500> be<00:00:16.710> able<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.360> connect<00:00:18.360> a

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:18.599 
you need to kind of be able to connect a

you need to kind of be able to connect a
client's<00:00:19.050> business<00:00:19.200> objectives<00:00:20.009> and<00:00:20.279> with

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:21.239 
client's business objectives and with

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
creative communication objectives that

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.700 
creative communication objectives that
are<00:00:23.550> going<00:00:23.700> to<00:00:23.820> help<00:00:24.450> those<00:00:24.809> business<00:00:25.200> ones<00:00:25.410> so

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
are going to help those business ones so

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.769 
are going to help those business ones so
and<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:27.000> need<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> be<00:00:27.270> able<00:00:27.329> to<00:00:27.450> understand

creativity used to be able to manage
clients<00:00:31.649> and<00:00:31.860> creatives<00:00:32.630> it's<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.750> sort<00:00:33.960> of

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
clients and creatives it's a sort of

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.160 
clients and creatives it's a sort of
strange<00:00:34.290> glue-like<00:00:34.949> role<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:36.170> ultimately

strange glue-like role and ultimately

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.689 
strange glue-like role and ultimately
it's<00:00:37.469> about<00:00:37.589> coming<00:00:38.039> up<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.519> right

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
it's about coming up with the right

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.119 
it's about coming up with the right
strategy<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.390> solve<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.199> problem<00:00:40.289> so<00:00:40.859> I<00:00:40.920> suppose

strategy to solve a problem so I suppose

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.310 
out to be the same but any given day
will<00:01:56.850> probably<00:01:57.150> involve<00:01:57.390> interacting<00:01:58.230> with

creatives in some way are the briefing
then<00:01:59.970> we'll<00:02:00.120> check<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.570> how<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.750> works

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
then we'll check in on how the works

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.780 
then we'll check in on how the works
going<00:02:01.290> or<00:02:01.650> answering<00:02:01.980> some<00:02:02.190> questions<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.670 
just helping kind of mold the work there
and<00:02:04.820> it<00:02:05.820> will<00:02:05.970> involve<00:02:06.180> talking<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.260> a<00:02:07.290> client

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and it will involve talking to a client

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.550 
and it will involve talking to a client
in<00:02:07.740> some<00:02:07.950> way<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:09.239> they<00:02:09.780> may<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.050> giving<00:02:10.409> you<00:02:10.530> a

it

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
it

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.920 
it
and<00:03:08.190> you've<00:03:09.190> got<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.519> be<00:03:09.670> pretty<00:03:10.480> good<00:03:10.599> in<00:03:10.840> a

specky<00:03:39.370> geeks<00:03:39.700> you<00:03:39.879> just<00:03:40.120> kind<00:03:40.269> of<00:03:40.299> sit<00:03:40.480> in

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
specky geeks you just kind of sit in

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.839 
specky geeks you just kind of sit in
their<00:03:40.690> ivory<00:03:40.840> tower<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.260> read<00:03:41.859> books<00:03:42.069> there

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
their ivory tower and read books there

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.379 
their ivory tower and read books there
may<00:03:43.000> be<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.180> degree<00:03:43.359> of<00:03:43.540> truth<00:03:43.840> in<00:03:44.019> that<00:03:44.049> but

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
may be a degree of truth in that but

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.550 
may be a degree of truth in that but
ultimately<00:03:46.389> communication<00:03:47.079> lives<00:03:47.349> out<00:03:47.530> there

ultimately communication lives out there
in<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.889> real<00:03:48.040> world<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:49.090> if<00:03:49.930> it's<00:03:50.109> your<00:03:50.260> job

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
in the real world and if it's your job

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.259 
in the real world and if it's your job
to<00:03:50.530> spark<00:03:50.949> great<00:03:51.549> communication<00:03:52.150> in<00:03:52.239> that

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
to spark great communication in that

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.150 
to spark great communication in that
world<00:03:52.569> then<00:03:52.810> you've<00:03:52.959> got<00:03:53.109> to<00:03:53.230> be<00:03:53.349> part<00:03:53.859> of<00:03:53.980> it

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
world then you've got to be part of it

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.879 
world then you've got to be part of it
so<00:03:54.370> kind<00:03:55.000> of<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.239> more<00:03:55.419> that<00:03:55.599> you're<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:56.049> full

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
so kind of the more that you're a full

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.740 
so kind of the more that you're a full
three-dimensional<00:03:57.280> person<00:03:57.910> doing<00:03:58.329> random

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
three-dimensional person doing random

three-dimensional person doing random
things<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.169> better
