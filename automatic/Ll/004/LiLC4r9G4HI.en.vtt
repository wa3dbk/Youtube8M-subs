00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.820
 us on the pier 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.940
 Mutu center there 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.230
 and here it is two 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.110
 in most cars fleet 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.110
 such a system stood m 3d 7 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.719
 buy Tos data is transferred from the computer 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.439
 by car 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.579
 here we will have yes 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.880
 it seems to be done 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.789
 class wrote applications so 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.789
 way to lead 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.570
 I need to read the store man 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.000
 Chevrolet Lacetti car 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.210
 1 and 6 pen 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.740
 without food the eighth year here 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.000
 diagnostic connector 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.490
 Here we set 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.140
 of course the red shop caught fire 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.940
 mean go 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.810
 went power 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.730
 I think not started 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.480
 and we'll see 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.740
 here's a bargain 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.320
 percent 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.800
 so just super 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.200
 compound 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.250
 light bulbs march 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.180
 but we immediately see 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.460
 percent 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.380
 here we are adding gas 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.720
 can compare the term 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.910
 center which 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.010
 which we have so 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.740
 but small delays but it is clear 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.280
 there are cases 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.090
 on such a complex topic 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.800
 tons 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.890
 free version of the program 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.200
 for half a year 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.770
 but generally in principle on martin but 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.360
 it is here and 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.340
 specifications 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.120
 who will be interested so that someone 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.880
 find out later 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.110
 but 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.600
 but this is he start with speech 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.310
 even before the start can all these 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.680
 readings 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.210
 and he on 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.360
 percent 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.730
 You can also add your own 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.640
 Peak n but here is called screens 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.159
 i.e. arrow scale graphs 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:09.889
 compass 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.149
 air condition of the capital 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:13.380
 well yes there 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.320
 Well, our beautiful car seems not 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.899
 know how and count 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:20.449
 I still want to eat here 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.449
 digital display accelerometer 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.229
 the struggle for ecology is unknown what else 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.789
 it is 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:29.669
 clippers 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.129
 this 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.379
 the very same phone that is, and pies 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.529
 inside we don't need it 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.529
 but let's say the graphics 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:42.339
 mostly interface russian if you 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.079
 swing but then it will be 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.669
 basically he 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.669
 i.e. english earlier 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:52.649
 fuel residue 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:54.779
 I do not know the position after the flap here 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:55.969
 it is interesting 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.069
 Tatarstan is big 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.549
 that is, now I press on the gas 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.139
 see how to change position 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.139
 dick throttle is not visible 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.079
 it is understandable to give a percentage of the final but now I 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.339
 put the pedal to the floor 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:12.509
 threw the flap opened in to write 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.319
 10 percent 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.539
 also probably can be found on the temperature 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:17.599
 engine 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.079
 interesting schedule will be 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.079
 so temperature temperatures 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:28.469
 daughter acceleration 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:29.689
 it's clear that 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:31.639
 highlight green in what can 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:32.859
 read 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.169
 You can read more on the Internet 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.389
 voltage 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.389
 sensor voltage on the gasoline pump 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.379
 percentage also it is in operation that allows 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.939
 read skoda if the check engine lights up 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.289
 the panel will see the code that is 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:50.529
 diagnostics you literally in the phone 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:52.969
 but probably comfortable as what how 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.919
 statistics carry for yourself and boredom 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.039
 m but that's also interesting temperature 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.039
 coolant 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:05.009
 Well, in principle, it should probably grow 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:06.489
 but bye 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.339
 quite possibly up to fifty just not 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:09.949
 moves because here if you look 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:12.019
 need to 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.370
 on youtube tula 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.529
 there, too, appetites start 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:16.909
 but in general you can see that 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:18.250
 gradually she 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.299
 rises 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.560
 so let's show once again how it turned out 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.960
 just call Spartak called 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.699
 bargain 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.379
 but mostly better for us 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:29.870
 android 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.889
 Here the device itself shows that it points 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.050
 when blinking so long ago connected and 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.689
 transmits information tusk 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.039
 we are no 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.909
 general metropolitan exposure 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.909
 does not interfere with driving 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.099
 bought set 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.150
 but 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.150
 I bought it know the site yes x.org 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.270
 so called 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.520
 what do we call 3 2 7 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.169
 if problems encountered 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.120
 this 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.080
 when among the republics tous asked for a password 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.939
 the right to the forum was written anything 1 2 3 4 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:13.339
 or 6 7 8 9 we approached 6 7 8 9 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:15.909
 small size 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.729
 you can watch what wikipedia 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.729
 cars from which years 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.009
 has a usb connector standard connector 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:26.569
 worth this thing 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.230
 13 dollars of the help of 5 cents 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.520
 It happens the same way with the interface which 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.569
 connects the bullet itself computer cable 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:35.779
 it can also be connected 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:38.009
 computer many programs on the Internet 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:39.659
 there is a public mouth 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.740
 in Spain I'm all 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.930
 very useful thing for 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.490
 order to control your 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.470
 car on this all thank you very much
