and now I want to talk about mikasa what

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.020 
and now I want to talk about mikasa what
if<00:00:56.610> what<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.600> she<00:00:58.109> was<00:00:58.410> there<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.309> Aaron<00:00:59.820> what

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
if what if she was there with Aaron what

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.119 
if what if she was there with Aaron what
if<00:01:01.100> she<00:01:02.100> was<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.489> factor<00:01:03.470> how<00:01:04.470> could<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.979> have

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
if she was a factor how could that have

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.390 
if she was a factor how could that have
changed<00:01:05.610> what<00:01:06.479> occurred<00:01:07.020> I'm<00:01:07.770> thinking<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
changed what occurred I'm thinking that

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.109 
changed what occurred I'm thinking that
she<00:01:08.909> could<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.299> possibly<00:01:10.400> stopped<00:01:11.400> Aaron

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
she could have possibly stopped Aaron

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.640 
she could have possibly stopped Aaron
for<00:01:12.570> freaking<00:01:13.140> out<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:14.130> berserk<00:01:14.670> and

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
for freaking out going berserk and

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.200 
for freaking out going berserk and
charging<00:01:16.650> straight<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> time<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.060> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
charging straight to the time that a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.370 
charging straight to the time that a
Thomas<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.869> getting<00:01:19.650> everybody<00:01:19.830> killed<00:01:20.360> now

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
Thomas and getting everybody killed now

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.170 
Thomas and getting everybody killed now
mikasa<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> perfect<00:01:23.250> soldier<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.939> only

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
mikasa is the perfect soldier the only

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.320 
mikasa is the perfect soldier the only
thing<00:01:24.360> she<00:01:24.570> lacks<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:26.040> aaron<00:01:26.460> has<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
thing she lacks is what aaron has the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.990 
thing she lacks is what aaron has the
dry<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.920> determination<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
dry the determination that just the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.069 
dry the determination that just the
fighting<00:01:30.869> spirit<00:01:31.159> almost<00:01:32.509> but<00:01:33.509> besides<00:01:33.930> that

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
fighting spirit almost but besides that

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.679 
fighting spirit almost but besides that
she<00:01:35.040> has<00:01:35.189> everything<00:01:35.520> she's<00:01:35.939> fucking<00:01:36.509> an

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
she has everything she's fucking an

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.319 
she has everything she's fucking an
amazing<00:01:37.170> soldier<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.860> her<00:01:38.430> combined<00:01:39.150> with

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
amazing soldier so her combined with

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.600 
amazing soldier so her combined with
aaron<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> perfect<00:01:40.439> combination<00:01:40.680> because

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
aaron is the perfect combination because

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.210 
aaron is the perfect combination because
they<00:01:42.060> match<00:01:42.360> each<00:01:42.689> other's<00:01:43.079> weaknesses<00:01:43.770> i

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
they match each other's weaknesses i

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.200 
they match each other's weaknesses i
guess<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> annulment<00:01:44.850> council<00:01:45.090> doesn't

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
guess the annulment council doesn't

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.450 
guess the annulment council doesn't
really<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> weakness<00:01:45.899> era<00:01:46.770> has<00:01:47.070> something

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
really have a weakness era has something

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.550 
really have a weakness era has something
she<00:01:47.640> doesn't<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:48.060> for<00:01:48.270> sure<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.380> they

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
she doesn't have for sure so they

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.429 
she doesn't have for sure so they
complement<00:01:50.310> each<00:01:50.369> other<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.380> having<00:01:52.380> them

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
complement each other so having them

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.230 
complement each other so having them
together<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.920> same<00:01:53.040> squad<00:01:53.430> would<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
together in the same squad would be the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.359 
together in the same squad would be the
best<00:01:54.450> choice<00:01:54.630> i<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:56.130> she<00:01:56.250> was

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
best choice i think and if she was

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.179 
best choice i think and if she was
actually<00:01:56.520> there<00:01:57.259> we<00:01:58.259> know<00:01:58.439> going<00:01:58.740> back<00:01:58.860> to

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
actually there we know going back to

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.770 
actually there we know going back to

when there were kids Aaron really

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.859 
when there were kids Aaron really

because<00:05:37.250> we<00:05:37.370> have<00:05:37.490> really<00:05:37.729> seen<00:05:37.880> them<00:05:37.940> break

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
because we have really seen them break

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.240 
because we have really seen them break
through<00:05:38.750> we<00:05:39.139> haven't<00:05:39.380> seen<00:05:39.530> like<00:05:39.770> walk

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
through we haven't seen like walk

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.250 
through we haven't seen like walk
through<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:40.669> whole<00:05:41.060> of<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.450> Titan<00:05:41.810> open<00:05:42.050> if

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
through the whole of the Titan open if

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.930 
through the whole of the Titan open if
they<00:05:42.710> could<00:05:42.950> have<00:05:43.039> but<00:05:43.250> perhaps<00:05:43.490> they<00:05:43.880> were

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
they could have but perhaps they were

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.210 
they could have but perhaps they were
also<00:05:44.240> teleporting<00:05:44.780> as<00:05:44.930> well<00:05:45.500> and<00:05:45.770> these

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
also teleporting as well and these

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.760 
also teleporting as well and these
things<00:05:46.400> are<00:05:46.550> teleporting<00:05:47.090> so<00:05:47.289> how<00:05:48.289> would<00:05:48.349> what

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
things are teleporting so how would what

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.200 
things are teleporting so how would what
is<00:05:48.889> what<00:05:49.310> is<00:05:49.340> going<00:05:49.550> on<00:05:49.669> with<00:05:49.729> that<00:05:49.820> what's

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
is what is going on with that what's

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.180 
is what is going on with that what's

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
deciding that how's that going down is

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.390 
deciding that how's that going down is
someone<00:05:53.120> controlling<00:05:53.720> them<00:05:54.470> is<00:05:54.650> that<00:05:55.280> is

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
someone controlling them is that is

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.129 
someone controlling them is that is
there<00:05:55.610> some<00:05:56.030> kind<00:05:56.060> of<00:05:56.330> remote<00:05:56.479> control<00:05:56.960> some
