you two ways

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.379 
you two ways
once<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.130> hang<00:00:08.280> need<00:00:08.580> raise<00:00:08.849> gets<00:00:09.120> too<00:00:09.210> easy

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
once the hang need raise gets too easy

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.759 
once the hang need raise gets too easy
for<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:09.929> can<00:00:10.260> move<00:00:10.380> on<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.679> those

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
for you you can move on to those

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.940 
for you you can move on to those
straight<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.969> reason<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.330> love<00:00:12.509> this<00:00:12.719> exercise

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
straight the reason I love this exercise

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.580 
straight the reason I love this exercise
is<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.460> incorporates<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.780> entire<00:00:16.139> ABS

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
is that it incorporates the entire ABS

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.800 
is that it incorporates the entire ABS
from<00:00:17.130> top<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.490> bottom<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.510> even<00:00:18.600> get<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
from top to bottom and you even get a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.910 
from top to bottom and you even get a
little<00:00:18.840> bit<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.140> grip<00:00:19.320> working<00:00:19.650> as<00:00:19.740> well

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
little bit of grip working as well

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.170 
little bit of grip working as well
because<00:00:20.100> you're<00:00:20.220> not<00:00:20.310> hanging<00:00:20.730> from<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> bar

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
because you're not hanging from the bar

those knees up as high as you can and
controlling<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.660> both<00:01:31.020> directions<00:01:31.520> both

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
controlling in both directions both

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:44.450 
controlling in both directions both
directions<00:01:32.970> control<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:33.690> and<00:01:35.060> control<00:01:36.060> down

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.880 

again<00:01:45.090> when<00:01:45.270> those<00:01:45.420> get<00:01:45.630> too<00:01:45.810> easy<00:01:46.110> we'll<00:01:46.740> go

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
again when those get too easy we'll go

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.870 
again when those get too easy we'll go
to<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> straight<00:01:47.340> leg<00:01:47.990> or<00:01:48.990> extended<00:01:49.770> letter

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.920 

so<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.000> you're<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.240> squeezing<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.720> legs

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
so here you're just squeezing the legs

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:24.700 
so here you're just squeezing the legs
together<00:01:55.640> lift<00:01:56.640> them<00:01:56.790> up<00:01:56.880> as<00:01:57.030> high<00:01:57.150> as<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.510> can

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.050 

still<00:02:25.710> controlling<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.520> swing<00:02:26.820> in<00:02:26.910> both

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
still controlling that swing in both

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.240 
still controlling that swing in both
directions<00:02:27.450> now<00:02:28.260> when<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.440> start<00:02:28.740> out<00:02:28.890> I

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
directions now when you start out I

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.280 
directions now when you start out I
recommend<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:30.000> trying<00:02:30.300> three<00:02:30.690> sets<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.050> ten

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
recommend just trying three sets of ten

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.890 
recommend just trying three sets of ten
drop<00:02:32.160> from<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.550> bar<00:02:32.730> as<00:02:32.940> needed<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.570> if<00:02:33.840> you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
drop from the bar as needed so if you

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
drop from the bar as needed so if you
