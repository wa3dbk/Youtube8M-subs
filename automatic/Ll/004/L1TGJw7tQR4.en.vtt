have some things on this laptop that I
want<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.240> continue<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.750> use<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:57.850> will

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
want to continue to use and this will

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:23.300 
want to continue to use and this will
now<00:02:58.240> begin<00:02:58.570> preparing<00:02:58.990> for<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.560> install

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.420 

and<00:03:23.780> now<00:03:24.780> it's<00:03:25.140> just<00:03:25.290> check<00:03:25.620> things<00:03:25.770> again<00:03:26.130> and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
and now it's just check things again and

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.370 
and now it's just check things again and
if<00:03:26.730> we<00:03:26.850> say<00:03:27.030> install<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.959> will<00:03:28.140> begin

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
if we say install and this will begin

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.080 
if we say install and this will begin
the<00:03:28.500> install<00:03:28.800> process<00:03:29.100> this<00:03:29.520> will<00:03:29.670> now<00:03:29.850> go

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
the install process this will now go

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.790 
the install process this will now go
through<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.780> reboot<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.260> system<00:03:31.410> is

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
through and reboot the system is

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.300 
through and reboot the system is
necessary<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:34.319> will<00:03:34.440> take<00:03:34.620> some<00:03:34.830> time<00:03:34.860> so

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
necessary so this will take some time so

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.580 
necessary so this will take some time so
I'm<00:03:35.370> going<00:03:35.520> to<00:03:35.640> speed<00:03:36.120> up<00:03:36.300> this<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.870> we'll

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
I'm going to speed up this and we'll

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:48.240 
I'm going to speed up this and we'll
rejoin<00:03:38.280> once<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:39.090> install<00:03:39.420> has<00:03:39.600> completed

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479
