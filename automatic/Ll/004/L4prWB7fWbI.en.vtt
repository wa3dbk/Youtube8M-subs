is<00:03:40.400> that<00:03:40.549> you<00:03:40.639> run<00:03:40.759> out<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:40.910> ammo<00:03:41.150> pretty

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
is that you run out of ammo pretty

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.710 
is that you run out of ammo pretty
quickly<00:03:41.660> since<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.169> commandos<00:03:42.590> week<00:03:42.829> and<00:03:43.720> so
