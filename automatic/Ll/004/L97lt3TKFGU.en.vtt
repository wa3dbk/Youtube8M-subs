00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.799
 kars 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.300
 Herr carbohydrate becomes the corpse 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.950
 swear word 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.969
 yes a little wrong with me too 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.349
 mean 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.949
 body just needs carbohydrates 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.810
 to get energy to do 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.220
 without carbohydrates you would 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.680
 Joffrey dead for the market good 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.830
 carbohydrate that is important 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.119
 and especially if you do sports and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.960
 do you need carbohydrates and good ones 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.540
 fats 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.700
 so this is actually the meal you like 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.800
 should eat in hours before exercise 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.350
 yes rent with your bank for how long you are 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.850
 yes you should not be bothered by you 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.260
 food but I find some goodies and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.680
 eaten half an hour before sports 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.930
 to have 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.160
 but you have fifteen minutes in advance 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.379
 not included in the nutrients 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.270
 as no no no right to take time 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.930
 we make out the options 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.760
 healthy anyway because if eat carbohydrates 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.629
 so what you just said is indeed one 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.850
 good 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.980
 and these are the good bobbin this is one 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.409
 game process game sourdough earth even 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.909
 and that actually means just about 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.090
 is a much healthier version of bread 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.380
 then wheat bread or in order bread 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.060
 game is easier to digest 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.680
 poor and selden applies to jury this 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.060
 instead of yeast on that's better for that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.670
 the for your body 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.640

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.970
 lives that we explore yes and 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.990

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.259
