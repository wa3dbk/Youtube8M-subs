00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:14.150
 Hello Guitars station here of the guitar where I am this time to introduce 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:17.990
 fender custom shop 1968 stratocaster nos 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.630
 Master Birudobai the black color ring has been subjected to 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:26.029
 It is one of the grape Fester 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:31.279
 It's pretty plain, but I'm ordering with this spec, but this kind of plain spec 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.410
 So what is the that the ability of the person of the creator is I think that comes out in the fully 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.700
 Various a 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:41.950
 So we were working Toka closet or a relic called nos has not been subjected to 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:45.220
 But for the finishing touches on the details I really make a test guitar 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.670
 Originally example or Tei, such as making a set cat 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.500
 Be a fielder 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.740
 To one of the gravel of master beer is also quite long grape festivals error unique professional favorite 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.020
 I think it is finished 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.610
 And 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:04.330
 It is a pick-up, but the pick-up is usually Greg and Greg is a break 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:09.920
 I sometimes select different pickups like a combination . 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:15.590
 This guitar dare to output a little with a normal gray bobbin 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:19.909
 Sage eyes pickup is selected, but you can understand that it makes a sound 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.330
 The combination of the neck middle bridge is the selector combination 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.730
 for 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.750
 Without feeling the volume 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:31.320
 In addition, because I take the vibration of the body firmly, I think that the waist is also strong 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.270
 As it comes out as a character , it is like this for the player 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.500
 It is a communications dialogue 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.070
 Because this kind of degree of completion of height that it would be taken at the monitor from such places 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.280
 think 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:47.260
 And when it comes to fingerboards, it 's a selection of rose pinger boards 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.510
 But it has become a high specification of playability of 9.5 inches 6610 Go fret 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.470
 Of course 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:58.040
 Also from the person 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:01.670
 I think you can be convinced that he was also talking at the time of the line feed , but again 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.990
 Rolls and fret dresses These details have become master build specs 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.170
 Though 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.560
 Especially as this 68-year style of neck 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.490
 The grip of the neck back is quite realistic 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.010
 Where do you have a neck shape 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:19.319
 There is a copy phrase in 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:24.030
 The so-called vintage with the side roll time without having a sense of grip 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.730
 Or not than give you a taste of the feel as if crowded grip like a guitar 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:32.239
 I think 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:36.500
 You have a little bit off the travel to the neck of was this Ason but decoration of such a fine place 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:42.830
 Strike in a place even though I think that's where it can be said that in if they 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:45.720
 Since that make a plain guitar think it only play also becomes less 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.460
 Because his ability in that said so, 1 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:53.370
 I think that you may know, but especially with grapefesler 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.420
 Even the shop of the from the person of the expert 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:01.830
 If it sounds like bringing the peak somewhere if you can say the the Fender 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.610
 If you really play Fender's Stratocaster without taste, it tastes so well as it can handle the sun 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.740
 deep 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.630
 Since it say that tone comes out is I think his expectation 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.690
 I would like to check with such sound samples to such fine nuances 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.690
 I will 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.599
 4 days I 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.380
