00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.610
 disguised with something wrong and guessing 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.710
 that's why I am here today 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.780

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.369
 Monday they come online you know you 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.929
 who then can expect a video from 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.390
 today I'm going to give a few tips from 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.519
 healthy and easy in between is over 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.170
 to take to school or to work 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.089
 so you see much better running recently 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.580
 internship and therefore my life and mine 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.530
 eating pattern has changed a lot and in the past 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.629
 I was home a lot still studying I could 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.250
 organize my own time and then it was 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.559
 much easier to eat healthy though 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.489
 now because I come through a lot I am commendable 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.070
 the road 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.050
 I notice that it is much harder so me 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.340
 well thought if i have problems i know 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.140
 sure i'm not the only one 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.969
 and in this video I just go few tips 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.829
 gives for easier snacks 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.149
 as entertaining can take need 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.760
 nothing else to do 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.039
 but that still health you very well 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.690
 easy to bring a plan gingerbread 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.090
 or take a league 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.100
 or something else prepackaged but it 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.690
 The problem with such cakes is that 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.500
 it just a whole lot of sugar 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.210
 sit 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.610
 and of course it's fine to 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.520
 eat it occasionally but it doesn't 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.570
 very much for you even though 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.970
 food producers ask us how 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.409
 believe it is very healthy and true 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.869
 I crushed as very much as I do 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.299
 choose between snacks if it is something for 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.009
 my body does and that's one anyway 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.900
 little dirty physically always eating 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.420
 for ok it does something for me 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.280
 body is a good substance yes yes me 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.899
 know this is not nuts then prefer 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.610
 are there really things with healthy ones? 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.310
 nutrients and of course I take 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.560
 often bring an apple or do I take a banana 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.170
 or bring a pear for washing 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.360
 easy to take with you but me 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.189
 have to admit very much i am not one 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.479
 huge ether demand and that's why I give 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.520
 often prefer a little bit 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.490
 vegetables I often do is me 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.189
 just a bell pepper or cucumber or whatever 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.110
 Take carrots pepper cucumber slice 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.909
 in pieces I put in a container and take 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.409
 I agree there are links between citizens and 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.969
 it's very logical 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.420
 but on the other hand, I think that is whole 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.310
 very 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.540
 people thinking about taking something like that 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.220
 as a snack 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.229
 The result is that I am very sorry 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.790
 love to call vegetables and that's just why 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.750
 such a solution but if you don't have one 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.520
 a fan of ben 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.080
 add the cream a little too sick or 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.900
 add a little boys and use 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.640
 that as a dip and that is such a delicious 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.590
 combination and I always find it myself 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.090
 a super tasty snack 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.010
 unusual moment as you eat 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.319
 be bland and that couldn't pull yet 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.660
 something I always work with boskat 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.250
 am that are almonds and real almonds 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.380
 are my big friend 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.730
 I prefer to take unsalted nuts when I do 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.800
 started with 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.050
 healthier food then I really had one 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.930
 He ripped that I just need you 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.489
 not from and then I had to prefer then 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.410
 the teeth salted variant but that is 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.420
 which is not very good for you 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.030
 but surroundings are taught to anyway 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.739
 go eat unsalted dance and then find 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.209
 I actually if I am very honest 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.890
 I only think a man is nice 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.080
 so then eat it and take you too 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.730
 a lot of because even though it is healthy it 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.950
 is not very good to have too much of it 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.750
 eat because it is still rub it 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.799
 by that is faint I find indeed there 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.590
 contain a lot of proteins 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.660
 are you pretty full because i am too 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.090
 Do it often and that also helps to keep it full longer 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.859
 is that I have to move an apple 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.850
 then a few almonds and through the 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:21.660
 combination of apple and sugar 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.250
 this fit of and fibers of the almonds 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.109
 puts you much longer and keep your 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.940
 blood sugar also somewhat more stable than 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.230
 when you only eat those apples 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.940
 So perhaps still because this is 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.620
 for you there was a great friend 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.570
 from me when I'm working 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.269
 are this bowl of yogurt and these are 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.010
 trays with 0% fat Greek yogurt 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.750
 who can give your wife another albert heijn 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.900
 buy this coming on both my dirk 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.660
 from and I actually take this one 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.250
 every day and the handy part is 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.540
 it's just nice bunch of packing pull 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.819
 He was looking for South Fridge, nothing 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.410
 and I love this at work 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.720
 then there is one of those people if you have to 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.540
 do have fridge for unfortunately 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.400
 and then around the euro 4 I take this and the 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.730
 reason I choose this type of yogurt 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.730
 is the because it is full of proteins 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.959
 is not found in 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.300
 it is just because of that 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.620
 protein is good for you 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.659
 and you can only stay a little longer 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.239
 by and yes this is another one 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.430
 example of there what is in what is 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.169
 good for my body 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.010
 Greek yogurt protein and I can go there 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.570
 again 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.220
 I had students from which vegetables and 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.750
 actually I also had all of these 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.979
 have to mention namely 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.660
 tomatoes i love these things i like 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.710
 anyway tomato very tasty but this 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.360
 are follow me 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.770
 You also see real snack tomatoes this is possible 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.320
 I got all those 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.419
 and these are so tasty this is a bit 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.280
 to take a lot with me what i often do is that 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.680
 I put in about half such a thing 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.039
 pour a kind of tuff wear container and the take 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.630
 that with it and it is these are extra 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.639
 sweet the pure his throne or much 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.380
 tastier than just a tomato 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.419
 anyway then the bowl is really you 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.669
 great friend because i also very often 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.650
 doing as a snack is like me 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.780
 for example, make a reading salad or 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.820
 a different type of bean salad 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.380
 that I have some extra taste and that I 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.419
 which then again a small bowl happiness 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.740
 just small for a while as 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.240
 snack something i actually 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.340
 all my bag oh shit its end 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.710
 Drag and ensure there again before 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.630
 you are full longer than I must say 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.180
 that I really did not tread out much 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.280
 dissatisfied find it is often very cool 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.810
 enough i don't like it 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.750
 only DJ are how the face 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.599
 shop that is the smartbar that I think is the 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.450
 Caramel version tasty and the coconut 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.280
 version and it's easy is 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.060
 that I can always keep it in my bag 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.450
 have sit down 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.010
 I don't need a fridge for that 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.080
 whatever can simply eat garlic as 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.690
 and they have a bit of the amenities 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.669
 structure of a milky way 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.050
 So yes it is not up to anything itself 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.729
 of course but it can be quite one 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.160
 alternative if you normally really like it 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.780
 those candy bar money and snickers I mean 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.880
 no we have over healthy 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.440
 snacks but then I think so 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.750
 even if it is often still one 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.970
 nice something and you will like other brands 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.530
 but yes I personally think this is it 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.510
 best I hope you like these tips 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.969
