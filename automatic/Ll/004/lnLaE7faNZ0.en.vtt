we'll show you how we're doing this just
we<00:00:34.200> got<00:00:34.350> our<00:00:34.469> potting<00:00:34.890> soil<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:37.460> filled<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
we got our potting soil here filled a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.900 
we got our potting soil here filled a
cup<00:00:38.820> box<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.930> half<00:00:40.110> full<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:44.100> take<00:00:44.610> our

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
cup box with a half full and we take our

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.100 
cup box with a half full and we take our
little<00:00:45.660> watering<00:00:46.200> wand<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.930> give<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.020> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
little watering wand here and give it a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.130 
little watering wand here and give it a
nice<00:00:49.230> soaking<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:50.010> soil<00:00:50.660> make<00:00:51.660> sure<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
nice soaking a soil make sure that the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.729 
nice soaking a soil make sure that the
soil<00:00:52.379> isn't<00:00:52.590> too<00:00:52.860> saturated<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.670> water<00:00:54.739> so

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
soil isn't too saturated with water so

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.569 
soil isn't too saturated with water so
let's<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:57.920> something<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.309> yeah

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
let's see that something like that yeah

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.719 
let's see that something like that yeah
so<00:01:00.170> we<00:01:01.170> take<00:01:01.410> our<00:01:01.620> spoon<00:01:01.949> next<00:01:02.309> here<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:04.729> let

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
so we take our spoon next here and let

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:14.940 
so we take our spoon next here and let
our<00:01:05.850> plant<00:01:06.180> in

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.170 

actually<00:01:15.950> is<00:01:16.009> a<00:01:16.070> lot<00:01:16.250> of<00:01:16.430> roots<00:01:16.700> on<00:01:16.970> these

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
actually is a lot of roots on these

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.240 
actually is a lot of roots on these
little<00:01:17.390> plants<00:01:17.750> for<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:18.680> size<00:01:19.040> of<00:01:19.189> the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
little plants for the size of the

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.340 
little plants for the size of the
planters<00:01:19.850> there<00:01:20.299> seems<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.600> be<00:01:20.659> twice<00:01:20.960> as<00:01:21.170> much

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
planters there seems to be twice as much

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.870 
planters there seems to be twice as much
root<00:01:21.710> on<00:01:21.950> them<00:01:24.460> add<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.520> little<00:01:25.820> more<00:01:26.030> soil

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
root on them add a little more soil

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:39.249 
root on them add a little more soil
might<00:01:28.880> cover<00:01:29.149> up<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.539> plant<00:01:30.070> initially<00:01:38.259> just

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
might cover up the plant initially just

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:53.499 
might cover up the plant initially just
give<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.679> slight<00:01:39.979> pack<00:01:40.340> pack<00:01:41.210> down<00:01:52.179> and<00:01:53.179> we

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
give it a slight pack pack down and we

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.359 
give it a slight pack pack down and we
take<00:01:53.720> our<00:01:53.899> water<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.500> give<00:01:54.770> it<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:54.950> nice<00:01:55.130> little

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
take our water and give it a nice little

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:04.570 
take our water and give it a nice little
soap<00:01:55.759> again<00:01:58.420> yeah<00:01:59.420> should<00:02:00.289> be<00:02:00.319> good<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:03.580> free

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
soap again yeah should be good and free

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.419 
soap again yeah should be good and free
Don<00:02:04.849> and<00:02:05.299> I<00:02:05.360> think<00:02:05.630> approximately<00:02:06.439> 300<00:02:07.250> out<00:02:07.399> of

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
Don and I think approximately 300 out of

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.359 
Don and I think approximately 300 out of
our<00:02:07.670> 500<00:02:08.360> came<00:02:08.569> up<00:02:08.780> we<00:02:09.349> did<00:02:09.560> have<00:02:09.769> some<00:02:10.160> issues

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
our 500 came up we did have some issues

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.550 
our 500 came up we did have some issues
with<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:11.120> soil<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:12.019> we<00:02:12.200> purchased<00:02:14.349> we<00:02:15.349> got

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
with the soil that we purchased we got

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.940 
with the soil that we purchased we got
some<00:02:15.830> cheaper<00:02:16.220> soil<00:02:16.549> and<00:02:17.380> they<00:02:18.380> really<00:02:18.620> regret

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
some cheaper soil and they really regret

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.390 
some cheaper soil and they really regret
doing<00:02:19.130> that<00:02:19.280> because<00:02:19.700> some<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.690> bins<00:02:21.400> only

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
doing that because some of the bins only

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.650 
doing that because some of the bins only
like<00:02:22.579> 50%<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.600> our<00:02:24.109> plants<00:02:24.530> came<00:02:24.739> up<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:26.480> good

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
like 50% of our plants came up the good

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.099 
like 50% of our plants came up the good
soil<00:02:27.100> we<00:02:28.100> have<00:02:28.250> something<00:02:28.670> like<00:02:28.790> 80%<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.930> is

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
soil we have something like 80% this is

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.000 
soil we have something like 80% this is
the<00:02:30.260> good<00:02:30.440> one<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:31.450> I<00:02:32.450> think<00:02:33.049> out<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.350> 100<00:02:33.890> and

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
the good one and I think out of 100 and

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.120 
the good one and I think out of 100 and
put<00:02:34.250> 121<00:02:36.370> 121<00:02:37.370> hon<00:02:38.260> 121<00:02:39.260> like<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.530> hundred<00:02:39.980> and

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
put 121 121 hon 121 like a hundred and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.210 
put 121 121 hon 121 like a hundred and
five<00:02:40.940> came<00:02:41.450> up<00:02:41.630> or<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.049> so<00:02:42.319> that<00:02:42.709> was<00:02:42.829> that's

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
five came up or so so that was that's
