00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
at how well it's plastic I've seen

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.740 
at how well it's plastic I've seen
videos<00:01:13.760> I've<00:01:13.910> heard<00:01:14.060> people<00:01:14.150> talk<00:01:14.300> about<00:01:14.450> it

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
videos I've heard people talk about it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.680 
videos I've heard people talk about it
but<00:01:15.080> man<00:01:15.290> it<00:01:15.560> definitely<00:01:16.130> is<00:01:16.340> plastic<00:01:17.120> I<00:01:17.390> mean

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
but man it definitely is plastic I mean

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.530 
but man it definitely is plastic I mean
the<00:01:18.230> only<00:01:18.380> metal<00:01:18.680> part<00:01:19.040> is<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:19.700> insides<00:01:20.270> and

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
the only metal part is the insides and

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.090 
the only metal part is the insides and
then<00:01:20.659> these<00:01:20.810> little<00:01:21.020> adapters<00:01:21.560> there<00:01:21.740> for<00:01:21.980> the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
then these little adapters there for the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.760 
then these little adapters there for the
line<00:01:22.820> in<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.300> line<00:01:23.659> out<00:01:23.870> you<00:01:24.140> can<00:01:24.350> hear<00:01:24.560> us<00:01:24.650> I'm

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
line in and line out you can hear us I'm

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.770 
line in and line out you can hear us I'm
handling<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.310> definitely<00:01:26.300> something<00:01:26.659> that's

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
handling it definitely something that's

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.450 
handling it definitely something that's
a<00:01:26.870> little<00:01:27.050> tricky<00:01:27.620> you<00:01:27.830> can<00:01:27.950> hear<00:01:28.130> is<00:01:28.220> just

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
a little tricky you can hear is just

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.580 
a little tricky you can hear is just
just<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:28.940> handling<00:01:29.300> noises<00:01:29.659> just<00:01:30.050> I<00:01:30.320> would

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
just the handling noises just I would

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.130 
just the handling noises just I would
say<00:01:30.710> typical<00:01:31.159> with<00:01:31.280> these<00:01:31.400> kind<00:01:31.610> of<00:01:31.670> recorders

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
say typical with these kind of recorders

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.520 
say typical with these kind of recorders
but<00:01:33.140> definitely<00:01:34.330> that<00:01:35.330> battery<00:01:36.080> pack<00:01:36.260> that's

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
but definitely that battery pack that's

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.590 
but definitely that battery pack that's
gonna<00:01:36.680> need<00:01:36.770> some<00:01:36.830> gaffers<00:01:37.310> tape<00:01:37.340> on<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:37.880> and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
gonna need some gaffers tape on it and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.450 
gonna need some gaffers tape on it and
this<00:01:39.050> little<00:01:39.140> micro<00:01:39.560> SD<00:01:39.890> slot<00:01:40.220> on<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.370> side

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
this little micro SD slot on the side

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.910 
this little micro SD slot on the side
now<00:01:41.420> I<00:01:41.450> don't<00:01:41.630> see<00:01:41.870> any<00:01:42.020> reason<00:01:42.409> to<00:01:42.440> access

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
now I don't see any reason to access

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.280 
now I don't see any reason to access
that<00:01:43.100> really<00:01:43.460> you<00:01:43.640> just<00:01:43.880> want<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.150> use<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.510> USB

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
that really you just want to use the USB

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
connection it doesn't work like a live

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.509 
connection it doesn't work like a live
mic<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:27.620> can't<00:02:27.860> plug<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.159> into<00:02:28.280> your<00:02:28.370> computer

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
mic you can't plug it into your computer

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.640 
mic you can't plug it into your computer

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
and also use it like a mic you basically

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.619 
and also use it like a mic you basically
have<00:02:30.799> to<00:02:30.890> power<00:02:31.099> it<00:02:31.310> down<00:02:31.489> then<00:02:32.090> plug<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.510> in

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
have to power it down then plug it in

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.149 
have to power it down then plug it in

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
and then you can access all the audio

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.210 
and then you can access all the audio
off<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.459> your<00:02:34.909> microSD<00:02:35.840> card<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.769> buttons<00:02:37.099> are

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
off of your microSD card the buttons are

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.920 
off of your microSD card the buttons are
really<00:02:37.430> actually<00:02:37.760> pretty<00:02:38.120> solid<00:02:38.360> on<00:02:38.629> the<00:02:38.720> side

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
really actually pretty solid on the side

really actually pretty solid on the side
here<00:02:39.200> this<00:02:39.620> little<00:02:39.920> level<00:02:40.370> input<00:02:40.790> does<00:02:41.180> adjust

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
here this little level input does adjust

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.600 
here this little level input does adjust
we'll<00:02:42.110> try<00:02:42.319> it<00:02:42.349> out<00:02:42.500> here<00:02:42.739> as<00:02:42.890> you're

recording<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.180> can<00:02:44.299> adjust<00:02:44.659> it<00:02:44.840> down<00:02:45.110> so

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
recording you can adjust it down so

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.640 
recording you can adjust it down so
