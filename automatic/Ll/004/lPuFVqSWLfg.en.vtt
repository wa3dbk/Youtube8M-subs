00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
last Thursday I I was watching some

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.029 
last Thursday I I was watching some
videos<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.550> tongue<00:00:24.510> web<00:00:24.750> piercings<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.920> I

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
videos on tongue web piercings so I

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.330 
videos on tongue web piercings so I
figured<00:00:26.189> why<00:00:27.090> not<00:00:27.180> give<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.660> shot<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.340> I

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
figured why not give it a shot and I

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.060 
figured why not give it a shot and I
pierced<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.439> after<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.470> pierced<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:31.980> I

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
pierced it and after I pierced it I

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.280 
pierced it and after I pierced it I
realized<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.820> didn't<00:00:33.180> make<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.300> video<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.930> so

so right there that little pink guy I
chose<00:01:12.330> pink<00:01:12.570> because<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.040> easier<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
chose pink because it's just easier to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.429 
chose pink because it's just easier to
wear<00:01:14.729> during<00:01:15.000> work<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.659> stuff<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.110> don't<00:01:16.290> have

work because they're douchebags there
but<00:01:31.200> whatever<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:32.790> nose<00:01:33.180> real

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.740 
but whatever and then I my nose real
quick<00:01:34.110> I've<00:01:34.619> decided<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.490> put<00:01:35.700> my<00:01:36.030> 16<00:01:36.479> gauge

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
quick I've decided to put my 16 gauge

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.149 
quick I've decided to put my 16 gauge
back<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.700> quit<00:01:38.700> stretching<00:01:39.240> my<00:01:39.360> nose<00:01:40.159> mostly

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
back in I quit stretching my nose mostly

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.069 
back in I quit stretching my nose mostly
because<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.060> didn't<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.479> any<00:01:42.659> jewelry

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
because like I didn't have any jewelry

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.100 
because like I didn't have any jewelry
where<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.649> actually<00:01:44.090> show<00:01:45.090> off<00:01:45.299> my<00:01:45.630> septum

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
where to actually show off my septum

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.580 
where to actually show off my septum
being<00:01:46.350> stretched<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> four<00:01:47.549> gauge<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.149> I

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
being stretched to a four gauge so I

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.749 
being stretched to a four gauge so I
actually<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.829> made<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.159> decision<00:01:50.460> today

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
actually just made that decision today

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.600 
actually just made that decision today
so<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.180> could<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:51.780> move<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.159> down<00:01:53.250> in

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
so I could like move it up and down in

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.960 
so I could like move it up and down in
mind

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
mind

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.860 
mind
because<00:01:55.580> it's<00:01:56.580> not<00:01:56.790> closed<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.420> realize

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
because it's not closed and I realize

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.760 
because it's not closed and I realize
