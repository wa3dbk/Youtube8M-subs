allergy<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:40.079> penicillin<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.770> first<00:00:41.070> time

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
allergy to penicillin for the first time

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.000 
allergy to penicillin for the first time
in<00:00:41.670> my<00:00:41.879> adult<00:00:42.420> life<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> had<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.770> go<00:00:43.890> on

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
in my adult life so I had to go on

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.779 
in my adult life so I had to go on
another<00:00:44.450> antibiotic<00:00:45.450> called<00:00:45.960> clindamycin

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
another antibiotic called clindamycin

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.400 
another antibiotic called clindamycin
and<00:00:47.789> clindamycin<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.660> extraordinarily

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
and clindamycin is extraordinarily

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.430 
and clindamycin is extraordinarily
powerful<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.550> kills<00:00:50.879> all<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.690> bacteria<00:00:51.870> in

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
powerful it kills all the bacteria in

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
powerful it kills all the bacteria in
your<00:00:52.530> body<00:00:52.680> they<00:00:52.890> give<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.160> people<00:00:53.309> who

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
your body they give it to people who

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.580 
your body they give it to people who
have<00:00:53.760> toxic<00:00:54.510> shock<00:00:54.780> syndrome<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.410> that's

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
have toxic shock syndrome so that's

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.229 
have toxic shock syndrome so that's
women<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.070> know<00:00:56.160> that's<00:00:56.370> caused<00:00:56.610> by<00:00:56.640> tampons

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
women you know that's caused by tampons

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.080 
women you know that's caused by tampons
or<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.230> related<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.620> tampons<00:00:59.129> or<00:00:59.550> they<00:00:59.940> give

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
or it's related to tampons or they give

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.639 
or it's related to tampons or they give
it<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> people<00:01:00.359> flesh-eating<00:01:01.020> disease<00:01:01.230> so

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
it to people flesh-eating disease so

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.590 
it to people flesh-eating disease so
it's<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> very<00:01:02.280> very<00:01:02.579> strong<00:01:02.879> antibiotic<00:01:03.480> and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
it's a very very strong antibiotic and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.149 
it's a very very strong antibiotic and
the<00:01:03.780> problem<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.559> kills<00:01:04.739> all<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the problem is is that it kills all the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.100 
the problem is is that it kills all the
healthy<00:01:05.460> good<00:01:05.580> bacteria<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.119> your<00:01:06.180> gut<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.750> it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
healthy good bacteria in your gut and it

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.990 
healthy good bacteria in your gut and it
can<00:01:07.229> give<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.799> something<00:01:08.340> called<00:01:08.610> C

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
can give you something called C

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.649 
can give you something called C
difficile<00:01:09.390> which<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.380> an<00:01:11.220> overgrowth<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.150> bad

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
difficile which is an overgrowth of bad

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.450 
difficile which is an overgrowth of bad
bacteria<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.530> your<00:01:13.680> gut<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> lot<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> us

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
bacteria in your gut that a lot of us

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.330 
bacteria in your gut that a lot of us
are<00:01:14.610> carriers<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.299> though<00:01:15.930> people<00:01:16.799> frequently

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
are carriers of though people frequently

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.670 
are carriers of though people frequently
acquire<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.360> hospitals<00:01:18.960> especially<00:01:19.590> in

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
acquire it in hospitals especially in

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.200 
acquire it in hospitals especially in
the<00:01:19.770> province<00:01:20.130> I'm<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.430> Quebec<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.030> some

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the province I'm in Quebec for some

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.359 
the province I'm in Quebec for some
reason<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.509> have<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> C<00:01:21.869> difficile<00:01:22.369> problem

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
reason we have a C difficile problem

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.679 
reason we have a C difficile problem
here<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.670> kind<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.909> funny<00:01:24.090> do<00:01:24.240> sit<00:01:24.570> as

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
here and it's kind of funny do sit as

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.600 
here and it's kind of funny do sit as
the<00:01:25.080> French<00:01:25.320> word<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:25.590> difficult<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.369> don't

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the French word for difficult so I don't

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.679 
the French word for difficult so I don't
know<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:26.790> there's<00:01:26.939> something<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.450> there

know if there's something going on there
but<00:01:28.130> anyhow<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.720> my<00:01:30.720> digits<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.170> been<00:01:31.380> kind

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
but anyhow so my digits have been kind

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.490 
but anyhow so my digits have been kind
of<00:01:31.619> weird<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.460> be<00:01:32.549> honest<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.210> don't<00:01:34.140> know<00:01:34.320> it's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
of weird to be honest I don't know it's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.380 
of weird to be honest I don't know it's
kind<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> personal<00:01:34.890> since<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.700> took<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
kind of personal since I took the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.870 
kind of personal since I took the
clindamycin<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.159> did<00:01:38.490> some<00:01:38.610> research

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
clindamycin so I I did some research

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.429 
clindamycin so I I did some research
online<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.750> where<00:01:39.960> I'm<00:01:40.049> getting<00:01:40.170> at
