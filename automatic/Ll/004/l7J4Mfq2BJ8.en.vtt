00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
somebody I think it's an unnatural

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.039 
somebody I think it's an unnatural
situation<00:01:03.890> that<00:01:05.180> anybody<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.390> placed<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
situation that anybody is placed and I

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.480 
situation that anybody is placed and I
think<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.290> concept<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> show<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.460> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
think the concept of the show is to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.719 
think the concept of the show is to
bring<00:01:08.939> out<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.890> you<00:01:10.890> know<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> put<00:01:11.310> people<00:01:11.670> in

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
bring out the you know to put people in

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.730 
bring out the you know to put people in
unnatural<00:01:12.450> situation<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.290> they<00:01:13.439> react

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
unnatural situation so that they react

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.580 
unnatural situation so that they react
in<00:01:13.890> their<00:01:14.070> worst<00:01:14.280> possible<00:01:14.850> manner<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:16.049> I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
in their worst possible manner so I

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.370 
in their worst possible manner so I
think<00:01:17.280> there's<00:01:18.119> there's<00:01:18.360> no<00:01:18.630> advice<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.350> I

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.679 
think there's there's no advice that I
can<00:01:19.500> give<00:01:19.680> her<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.790> don't<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.270> what
