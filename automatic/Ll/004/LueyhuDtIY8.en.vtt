00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.550 
you can actually hear it but um as you
heard<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.060> over<00:02:01.300> revving<00:02:01.510> that<00:02:02.050> means<00:02:02.230> I<00:02:02.350> did

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
heard it over revving that means I did

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.250 
heard it over revving that means I did
it<00:02:02.680> correctly<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:03.760> is<00:02:03.820> also<00:02:04.180> called<00:02:04.870> double

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
it correctly this is also called double

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.540 
it correctly this is also called double
clutching<00:02:05.620> like<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:05.860> said<00:02:06.070> that's<00:02:06.250> what<00:02:06.370> most

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
clutching like I said that's what most

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.670 
clutching like I said that's what most
people<00:02:06.820> know<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.090> by<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:07.510> call<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.290> a<00:02:08.380> rapid

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
people know it by I call it a rapid

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.950 
people know it by I call it a rapid
shift<00:02:08.890> because<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.460> on<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.850> rapid<00:02:10.270> GT<00:02:10.690> and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
shift because it is on the rapid GT and

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.870 
shift because it is on the rapid GT and
I<00:02:11.560> think<00:02:11.800> that<00:02:11.950> sounds<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.280> little<00:02:12.370> better<00:02:12.550> like

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
I think that sounds a little better like

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.140 
I think that sounds a little better like
I<00:02:13.000> said<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.950> want<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.400> open<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.700> gate<00:02:15.850> or<00:02:16.060> you

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
I said so I want to open the gate or you

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.450 
I said so I want to open the gate or you
can<00:02:16.270> jump<00:02:16.450> over<00:02:16.630> Shirey<00:02:17.200> prefer<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.860> just

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
can jump over Shirey prefer and just

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.190 
can jump over Shirey prefer and just
know<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.700> if<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.030> lower<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.480> on<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.690> back<00:02:19.960> it

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
know that if you lower it on the back it

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.170 
know that if you lower it on the back it
does<00:02:20.410> go<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> lot<00:02:20.860> faster<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.760> lot<00:02:21.910> quicker

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
does go a lot faster and a lot quicker

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.440 
does go a lot faster and a lot quicker
but<00:02:23.170> uh<00:02:23.230> yeah<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.220> this<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.520> fully<00:02:24.820> upgraded<00:02:25.330> I

the<00:02:41.410> way<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.680> he<00:02:41.830> shifts<00:02:42.250> how<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.490> just<00:02:42.640> takes

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
the way that he shifts how it just takes

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.160 
the way that he shifts how it just takes
off<00:02:43.090> like<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.510> lot<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.690> people<00:02:43.960> are<00:02:44.020> saying

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.890 

so<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:13.220> heard<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:14.000> just<00:03:14.090> shifted<00:03:14.630> straight

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
so I heard that I just shifted straight

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.750 
so I heard that I just shifted straight
in<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.110> fourth<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:16.070> look<00:03:16.220> how<00:03:16.340> fast<00:03:16.550> I'm

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
in the fourth and look how fast I'm

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.110 
in the fourth and look how fast I'm
going

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.640 

your<00:03:19.360> plane<00:03:19.690> landing<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.260> don't<00:03:20.319> know

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
your plane landing and I don't know

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.770 
your plane landing and I don't know
where<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:20.950> is

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
where it is

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
where it is
okay<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:23.590> now<00:03:23.920> I'll<00:03:24.040> be<00:03:24.160> quiet<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.570> will

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
okay so now I'll be quiet and I will

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.440 
okay so now I'll be quiet and I will
show<00:03:26.800> you<00:03:26.860> like<00:03:27.610> I<00:03:27.730> said<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.940> just<00:03:28.210> want<00:03:28.390> to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
show you like I said you just want to

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.020 
show you like I said you just want to
easier<00:03:29.290> if<00:03:29.410> you<00:03:29.470> put<00:03:29.500> your<00:03:29.890> your<00:03:30.490> camera<00:03:30.880> down

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
easier if you put your your camera down

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.310 
easier if you put your your camera down
about<00:03:31.270> right<00:03:31.480> here<00:03:31.660> so<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:32.020> can<00:03:32.140> actually

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
about right here so you can actually

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.090 
about right here so you can actually
hear<00:03:32.800> it

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
hear it

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.680 
hear it
so<00:03:33.970> let's<00:03:34.240> go

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.570 

all<00:03:40.590> right<00:03:40.710> I<00:03:40.740> didn't<00:03:41.100> do<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.400> almost

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
all right I didn't do it that I almost

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.460 
all right I didn't do it that I almost
tried<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:41.970> get

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.560 

so<00:03:49.100> right<00:03:49.280> there<00:03:49.490> I<00:03:49.520> did<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:50.180> can<00:03:50.360> hear<00:03:50.510> it

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
so right there I did it you can hear it

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.210 
so right there I did it you can hear it
