00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hello my name is Alina and today I 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.730
 would like to show my diary this already 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.710
 the second part on my channel and plucked 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.530
 new drawings from this principle make a 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.920
 video past video i signed my 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.220
 video like am sketchbook such a tyranny by 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.740
 Alps what buryak what to find but in 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.140
 type comments have written that it is not 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.750
 sketchbook I absolutely agree because 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.820
 sketch pours from English like 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.610
 questions and I have as you know at all 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.280
 almost no sketches for mail me 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.079
 more my diary is shorter so 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.300
 choose what to call it for me 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.329
 it's just days in a flash everything is very simple i 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.239
 decided to call in everyone fun to me 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.739
 will be on many such parts because 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.309

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.710

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.629

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.000
 I always devote time to myself 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.180

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.890

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.320

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.590
 it seems you are interested in watching this 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.299

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.320

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.440
 day like the previous portrait somehow I 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.420
 inspired by some kind of not 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.770
 portraits began to draw such a technique 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.050

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.920
 there was a drawing on the side 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.110
 which I really liked and if I 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.810

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.910
 sat down to her herself such a draw and wrote 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.210
 so pretentious as always English 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.130
 phrase quote and I had such a little forest 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.040
 printed out a simple black school 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.260
 printer and somehow it looked boring 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.450
 I took just cut off such krugleshok 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.640

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.320

 well this is it I found some beautiful color 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.340
 it was a pool of some kind of advertisement and I 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.270
 made a collage here but very much here 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.230

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.540
 but I am so pretty here but 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.080
 it's very beautiful like crazy in 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.290
 the pope who drew he was 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.810
 executed in watercolor and I laid out even this 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.600

 I want to go to a photo studio to print color 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.960
