00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
adding too much much bulb to it see

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.540 
adding too much much bulb to it see
there<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.110> cutouts<00:02:25.530> lot<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:25.950> nicely<00:02:26.430> as

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
there the the cutouts lot of nicely as

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.150 
there the the cutouts lot of nicely as
well<00:02:26.730> as<00:02:27.420> as<00:02:27.990> normal<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.440> guys<00:02:28.620> thought<00:02:28.830> I'd

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
well as as normal you guys thought I'd

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.070 
well as as normal you guys thought I'd
make<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.430> pixel<00:02:29.880> thing<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.210> they<00:02:30.330> listened<00:02:30.990> to

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
make a pixel thing that they listened to

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.260 
make a pixel thing that they listened to
put<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.290> all<00:02:31.380> their<00:02:31.560> cases<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:32.970> think<00:02:33.060> this

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
put on all their cases so I think this

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.490 
put on all their cases so I think this
is<00:02:33.390> available<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:33.870> about<00:02:33.960> four<00:02:34.320> or<00:02:34.350> five

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
is available in about four or five

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.740 
is available in about four or five
different<00:02:34.770> color<00:02:35.160> combinations<00:02:35.570> it's<00:02:36.570> not

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
different color combinations it's not

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.150 
different color combinations it's not
too<00:02:36.900> expenses<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.500> obviously<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:37.860> get<00:02:38.010> the
