00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
remember who it is but I just want to

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.130 
remember who it is but I just want to
keep<00:01:35.960> know<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.350> now<00:01:37.240> there's<00:01:38.240> four<00:01:38.510> classes

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
keep know that now there's four classes

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.719 
keep know that now there's four classes
for<00:01:39.440> I<00:01:39.470> don't<00:01:39.770> know<00:01:39.890> why<00:01:40.040> I<00:01:40.070> can't<00:01:40.430> think<00:01:40.610> of

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
for I don't know why I can't think of

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.160 
for I don't know why I can't think of
the<00:01:40.850> other<00:01:40.940> one<00:01:41.119> right<00:01:41.270> now<00:01:42.369> but<00:01:43.930> this<00:01:44.930> for

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
the other one right now but this for

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.430 
the other one right now but this for
classes<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:47.119> whole<00:01:47.479> point<00:01:47.659> of<00:01:47.810> survival

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
classes so the whole point of survival

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.240 
classes so the whole point of survival
is<00:01:48.940> to<00:01:49.940> obviously<00:01:50.360> survived<00:01:51.200> but<00:01:51.770> it's<00:01:52.070> a

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
is to obviously survived but it's a

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.899 
is to obviously survived but it's a
twist-off<00:01:52.700> afford<00:01:53.360> it's<00:01:53.630> not<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.020> same<00:01:54.909> not

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
twist-off afford it's not the same not

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.550 
twist-off afford it's not the same not
that<00:01:56.060> that's<00:01:56.210> a<00:01:56.420> bad<00:01:56.450> thing<00:01:56.630> that's<00:01:57.110> actually

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
that that's a bad thing that's actually

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.480 
that that's a bad thing that's actually
really<00:01:58.009> cool<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:59.030> love<00:01:59.360> toward<00:01:59.690> and<00:02:00.310> I<00:02:01.310> love

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
really cool I love toward and I love

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.880 
really cool I love toward and I love
that<00:02:01.520> they<00:02:01.789> also<00:02:01.970> have<00:02:02.300> another<00:02:02.619> twist<00:02:03.619> to<00:02:03.860> it

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
that they also have another twist to it

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.490 
that they also have another twist to it
now<00:02:04.240> basically<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.420> have<00:02:05.539> to<00:02:05.570> defend<00:02:05.990> any

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
now basically you have to defend any

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.560 
now basically you have to defend any
hole<00:02:06.800> which<00:02:07.460> is<00:02:07.670> an<00:02:07.789> emergence<00:02:08.239> hole<00:02:08.420> if

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
hole which is an emergence hole if

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.910 
hole which is an emergence hole if
you're<00:02:08.690> not<00:02:08.780> in<00:02:08.929> gears<00:02:09.140> player<00:02:09.440> or<00:02:09.739> you're<00:02:09.769> a

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
you're not in gears player or you're a

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.710 
you're not in gears player or you're a
newcomer<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:12.519> grubs<00:02:13.519> or<00:02:13.910> locusts<00:02:14.330> come<00:02:14.600> out

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
newcomer and grubs or locusts come out

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.590 
newcomer and grubs or locusts come out
of<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:16.310> have<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.640> basically<00:02:16.820> survive

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
of it and you have to basically survive

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.090 
of it and you have to basically survive
for<00:02:17.870> as<00:02:17.959> long<00:02:18.080> as<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.380> can<00:02:20.380> so<00:02:21.380> but<00:02:21.980> you're

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
for as long as you can so but you're

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.940 
for as long as you can so but you're
defending<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.700> other<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.209> whole<00:02:23.620> which<00:02:24.620> is

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
defending this other a whole which is

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.100 
defending this other a whole which is
where<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.280> put<00:02:26.920> oh<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:29.150> put<00:02:29.360> an<00:02:29.420> e<00:02:29.570> hole<00:02:29.810> cover

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
where you put oh you put an e hole cover

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.490 
where you put oh you put an e hole cover
it's<00:02:30.410> cold<00:02:30.680> on<00:02:30.829> top<00:02:31.070> of<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.870> basically<00:02:32.870> put

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
it's cold on top of it basically put

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.560 
it's cold on top of it basically put
some<00:02:33.680> planks<00:02:33.950> there<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.519> put<00:02:34.910> really<00:02:35.329> heavy

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
some planks there and put really heavy

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.650 
some planks there and put really heavy
weights<00:02:36.019> of<00:02:36.410> items<00:02:36.829> there<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.269> start<00:02:38.540> off

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
weights of items there and you start off

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.360 
weights of items there and you start off
you<00:02:38.900> don't<00:02:38.989> have<00:02:39.200> very<00:02:39.320> many<00:02:39.530> defenses<00:02:40.190> you'll

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
you don't have very many defenses you'll

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.400 
you don't have very many defenses you'll
have<00:02:40.930> one<00:02:41.930> laser<00:02:42.200> great<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:45.049> think<00:02:45.260> that's

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
have one laser great and I think that's

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.729 
have one laser great and I think that's
honestly<00:02:45.769> it<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:47.769> failed<00:02:48.769> on<00:02:49.190> my<00:02:49.430> for<00:02:49.760> honestly

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
honestly it I failed on my for honestly

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.380 
honestly it I failed on my for honestly
obviously<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:51.769> got<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:51.980> lot<00:02:52.130> better<00:02:52.310> at<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.910> as<00:02:53.150> i

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
obviously I got a lot better at it as i

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.920 
obviously I got a lot better at it as i
played<00:02:53.630> through<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:53.989> game<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.930> play

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
played through this game but you play

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.590 
played through this game but you play
and<00:02:57.350> try<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:57.920> protect<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.549> hijo<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.360> more

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
and try to protect the hijo so that more

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.690 
and try to protect the hijo so that more
grubs<00:03:00.410> cannot<00:03:00.799> come<00:03:01.070> out<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.340> those<00:03:01.459> holes

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
grubs cannot come out of those holes

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.700 
grubs cannot come out of those holes
so<00:03:04.700> basically<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.270> couldn't<00:03:05.540> stop<00:03:05.690> them<00:03:05.960> at

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
so basically you couldn't stop them at

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.980 
so basically you couldn't stop them at
the<00:03:06.950> first<00:03:07.160> one<00:03:07.460> but<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.090> failed<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.630> do<00:03:08.780> that

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
the first one but I failed to do that

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.510 
the first one but I failed to do that
and<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.470> brings<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:09.920> another<00:03:10.070> one<00:03:10.370> where

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
and it brings you to another one where

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.370 
and it brings you to another one where
you<00:03:10.580> get<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.700> troika<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.840> get<00:03:12.020> two<00:03:12.260> gates

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
you get a troika and you get two gates

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.660 
you get a troika and you get two gates
so<00:03:15.380> but<00:03:16.130> I<00:03:16.160> felt<00:03:16.460> that<00:03:16.550> one<00:03:16.910> at<00:03:17.240> wave<00:03:17.510> eight<00:03:17.750> so

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
so but I felt that one at wave eight so

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.120 
so but I felt that one at wave eight so
now<00:03:19.670> we<00:03:19.730> come<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.060> this<00:03:20.330> one<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:20.840> this<00:03:21.710> one<00:03:21.770> is

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
now we come to this one and this one is

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.290 
now we come to this one and this one is
pretty<00:03:22.760> simple<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:23.690> get<00:03:24.230> for<00:03:24.890> barriers<00:03:25.520> to<00:03:25.850> a

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
pretty simple you get for barriers to a

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.300 
pretty simple you get for barriers to a
red<00:03:26.660> into<00:03:26.990> a<00:03:27.020> blue<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.680> red<00:03:27.710> they<00:03:28.010> are<00:03:28.040> more

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
red into a blue the red they are more

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.560 
red into a blue the red they are more
powerful<00:03:30.730> your<00:03:31.730> base<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:32.330> time<00:03:32.480> you're

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
powerful your base and this time you're

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.860 
powerful your base and this time you're
defending<00:03:32.930> a<00:03:33.110> generator<00:03:34.270> you<00:03:35.270> try<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.660> turn

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
defending a generator you try and turn

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.990 
defending a generator you try and turn
on<00:03:36.080> once<00:03:36.440> you<00:03:36.590> finish<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.100> you're<00:03:37.640> gonna<00:03:37.730> turn

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
on once you finish it you're gonna turn

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.760 
on once you finish it you're gonna turn
on<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.270> hammer<00:03:38.480> at<00:03:38.660> dawn<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.230> kill<00:03:39.500> all<00:03:39.650> the

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
on the hammer at dawn and kill all the

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.160 
on the hammer at dawn and kill all the
locus<00:03:40.130> in<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.400> area<00:03:40.810> that's<00:03:41.810> why<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.020> gotta

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
locus in the area that's why you gotta

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.500 
locus in the area that's why you gotta
defend<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.590> generator<00:03:44.200> so<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:46.730> kill<00:03:47.060> every

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
defend the generator so you kill every

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.860 
defend the generator so you kill every
enemy<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:48.260> can<00:03:48.530> until<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:50.060> enemy's<00:03:50.510> bar

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
enemy that you can until the enemy's bar

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.220 
enemy that you can until the enemy's bar
goes<00:03:51.260> down<00:03:51.670> once<00:03:52.670> you<00:03:52.790> get<00:03:52.880> 25<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:53.780> we'll<00:03:53.959> say

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
goes down once you get 25 and we'll say

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.290 
goes down once you get 25 and we'll say
five<00:03:54.500> and

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.450 

you<00:03:57.840> just<00:03:58.080> killed<00:03:58.290> those<00:03:58.470> last<00:03:58.680> enemies<00:03:59.190> and

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
you just killed those last enemies and

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.090 
you just killed those last enemies and
you<00:03:59.610> go<00:03:59.820> to<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.060> next<00:04:00.210> wave<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:01.980> have

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
you go to the next wave you can you have

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.440 
you go to the next wave you can you have
a<00:04:02.160> little<00:04:02.310> bit<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.520> intermission<00:04:02.940> time<00:04:03.240> but

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
a little bit of intermission time but

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.030 
a little bit of intermission time but
not<00:04:03.570> really<00:04:04.130> not<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.370> lot<00:04:05.520> of<00:04:05.850> time<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:07.040> you

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
not really not a lot of time and you

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.280 
not really not a lot of time and you
have<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.370> basically<00:04:08.820> just<00:04:09.390> survive<00:04:09.720> 10<00:04:09.990> ways

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
have to basically just survive 10 ways

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.420 
have to basically just survive 10 ways
it's<00:04:10.800> not<00:04:11.040> complicated<00:04:11.930> but<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:12.990> told<00:04:13.920> you<00:04:14.190> all

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
it's not complicated but I told you all

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.320 
it's not complicated but I told you all
the<00:04:14.610> rules<00:04:17.120> so<00:04:18.120> let's<00:04:18.690> talk<00:04:18.959> more<00:04:19.350> about

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
the rules so let's talk more about

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.470 
the rules so let's talk more about
what's<00:04:21.330> different<00:04:21.840> orange<00:04:22.710> way<00:04:23.180> once<00:04:24.180> you

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
what's different orange way once you

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.870 
what's different orange way once you
start<00:04:24.750> on<00:04:24.870> wave<00:04:25.080> 1<00:04:25.350> it's<00:04:25.680> mainly<00:04:25.950> tickers<00:04:26.580> and

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
start on wave 1 it's mainly tickers and

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.100 
start on wave 1 it's mainly tickers and
there's<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.090> few<00:04:27.480> granite<00:04:27.810> years<00:04:28.080> as<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:30.080> go<00:04:31.080> up

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
there's a few granite years as you go up

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.410 
there's a few granite years as you go up
the<00:04:31.320> levels<00:04:32.100> obviously<00:04:32.580> there's<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.270> new

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
the levels obviously there's a new

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.020 
the levels obviously there's a new
character<00:04:33.720> every<00:04:34.380> round<00:04:34.620> or<00:04:35.070> there's<00:04:35.850> a<00:04:35.910> new

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
character every round or there's a new

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.880 
character every round or there's a new
creature<00:04:36.440> every<00:04:37.440> realm<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:38.390> new<00:04:39.390> ability<00:04:40.050> for

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
creature every realm a new ability for

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.370 
creature every realm a new ability for
example<00:04:41.430> there<00:04:42.300> may<00:04:42.510> not<00:04:42.660> be<00:04:42.720> a<00:04:42.900> new<00:04:43.080> creature

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
example there may not be a new creature

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.730 
example there may not be a new creature
as<00:04:43.800> lower<00:04:44.550> campus<00:04:45.030> and<00:04:46.460> beast<00:04:47.460> riders<00:04:47.910> in<00:04:48.780> the
