it's a chromatic chord it is part of a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.330 
it's a chromatic chord it is part of a
melodic<00:00:25.460> minor<00:00:25.580> scale<00:00:29.320> right<00:00:30.320> there<00:00:30.590> now<00:00:31.280> the

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
melodic minor scale right there now the

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.550 
melodic minor scale right there now the
shape<00:00:31.640> because<00:00:32.270> it<00:00:32.450> does<00:00:32.689> relate<00:00:33.020> to<00:00:33.079> melodic

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
shape because it does relate to melodic

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.870 
shape because it does relate to melodic
minor<00:00:33.680> will<00:00:33.950> give<00:00:34.040> us<00:00:34.160> a<00:00:34.250> lot<00:00:34.370> of<00:00:34.400> the<00:00:34.489> colors

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
minor will give us a lot of the colors

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.700 
minor will give us a lot of the colors
that<00:00:34.910> we<00:00:35.090> can<00:00:35.239> get<00:00:35.390> if<00:00:35.570> we<00:00:35.810> use<00:00:36.020> melodic<00:00:36.560> minor

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
that we can get if we use melodic minor

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.479 
that we can get if we use melodic minor
harmony<00:00:38.020> also<00:00:39.020> we<00:00:39.470> can<00:00:39.620> add<00:00:39.649> extra<00:00:40.070> notes<00:00:40.280> to

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
harmony also we can add extra notes to

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:41.889 
harmony also we can add extra notes to
it<00:00:40.579> since<00:00:40.730> we<00:00:40.850> have<00:00:40.940> extra<00:00:41.270> fingers<00:00:41.600> to<00:00:41.780> use

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
it since we have extra fingers to use

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.569 
it since we have extra fingers to use
here<00:00:42.170> we<00:00:42.200> have<00:00:42.530> them<00:00:42.620> finger<00:00:43.100> resting<00:00:43.370> right

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
here we have them finger resting right

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.990 

now<00:01:13.979> what<00:01:14.979> can<00:01:15.130> we<00:01:15.189> do<00:01:15.399> with<00:01:15.520> this<00:01:15.700> to<00:01:15.850> make

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
now what can we do with this to make

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.760 
now what can we do with this to make
interesting<00:01:16.240> colors<00:01:16.689> and<00:01:16.930> can<00:01:17.140> how<00:01:17.500> can<00:01:17.649> we

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
interesting colors and can how can we

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.319 
interesting colors and can how can we
improvise<00:01:18.130> with<00:01:18.340> different<00:01:18.640> chords<00:01:18.939> using

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
improvise with different chords using

because<00:04:33.949> it's<00:04:34.130> no<00:04:34.250> longer<00:04:34.280> part<00:04:34.910> of<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.300> scale

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
because it's no longer part of the scale

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.800 
because it's no longer part of the scale
it<00:04:36.500> ends<00:04:36.680> up<00:04:36.740> being<00:04:36.919> a<00:04:37.010> flat<00:04:37.310> 9<00:04:37.580> we<00:04:38.210> instead<00:04:38.570> can

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
it ends up being a flat 9 we instead can

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.840 
it ends up being a flat 9 we instead can
use<00:04:40.750> an<00:04:41.750> extra<00:04:42.169> note<00:04:42.320> below<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.590> top<00:04:42.889> and<00:04:43.669> it

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
use an extra note below the top and it

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.719 
use an extra note below the top and it
gives<00:04:44.000> us<00:04:44.120> major<00:04:44.419> 7<00:04:45.820> sharp<00:04:47.050> 9<00:04:48.050> sharp<00:04:48.500> 11

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
gives us major 7 sharp 9 sharp 11

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.219 
gives us major 7 sharp 9 sharp 11
admittedly<00:04:49.729> an<00:04:49.880> unusual<00:04:50.330> chord<00:04:50.539> but<00:04:50.750> a<00:04:50.930> pretty

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
admittedly an unusual chord but a pretty

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.300 
admittedly an unusual chord but a pretty
sound<00:04:51.550> so<00:04:52.550> these<00:04:53.510> are<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:54.289> various<00:04:54.830> uses<00:04:55.160> of

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
sound so these are the various uses of

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.930 
sound so these are the various uses of
the<00:04:55.400> major<00:04:55.639> 7<00:04:56.090> sharp<00:04:56.740> 5<00:04:57.740> shape<00:04:58.250> try<00:04:58.729> to<00:04:58.789> get

and then practice finding it in these

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.610 
and then practice finding it in these
different<00:05:20.450> applications<00:05:20.690> and<00:05:21.260> I<00:05:21.289> think<00:05:21.500> it'll
