00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
before they nervous in 5.3 now the thing

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.900 
before they nervous in 5.3 now the thing
with<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.860> being<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.309> actually<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.730> really

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
with it being is actually it's really

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.369 
with it being is actually it's really
it's<00:00:51.539> really<00:00:51.690> cool<00:00:52.789> they<00:00:53.789> did<00:00:54.120> buff<00:00:54.570> us<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.050> lot

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
it's really cool they did buff us a lot

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.810 
it's really cool they did buff us a lot
but<00:00:55.620> then<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:55.890> realized<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:56.550> had<00:00:56.579> too

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
but then they realized that we had too

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.670 
but then they realized that we had too
much<00:00:56.940> rng<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.510> they<00:00:57.899> actually<00:00:58.020> posted<00:00:58.559> that

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
much rng and they actually posted that

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.410 
much rng and they actually posted that
in<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.859> comment<00:00:59.190> about<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:00.239> they<00:01:00.359> did

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
in the comment about it so what they did

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.689 
in the comment about it so what they did
to<00:01:00.719> fix<00:01:00.930> le<00:01:01.199> shamans<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.430> mean<00:01:02.609> if

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
to fix le shamans with that I mean if

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.830 
to fix le shamans with that I mean if
you<00:01:02.789> could<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.059> say<00:01:03.210> fixed<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:05.840> was

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
you could really say fixed it they was

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.840 
you could really say fixed it they was
that<00:01:06.930> they<00:01:07.020> actually<00:01:07.200> nerfed<00:01:08.010> equal<00:01:08.460> elements

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that they actually nerfed equal elements

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.670 
that they actually nerfed equal elements
so<00:01:09.420> now<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.260> only<00:01:10.439> proc<00:01:10.860> after<00:01:11.490> 4<00:01:11.700> seconds

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
so now it can only proc after 4 seconds

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.960 
so now it can only proc after 4 seconds
after<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> first<00:01:14.010> initial<00:01:14.369> Prokopenko

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
after the first initial Prokopenko

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.580 
after the first initial Prokopenko
element<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.350> know<00:01:16.470> you're

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
element so it's not like you know you're

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.929 
element so it's not like you know you're
going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.799> casting<00:01:17.189> instant<00:01:17.549> lava<00:01:17.729> burst

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
going to be casting instant lava burst

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.960 
going to be casting instant lava burst
into<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> tune<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> then<00:01:19.710> i'll<00:01:20.130> send<00:01:20.580> boom<00:01:20.790> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
into a tune and then i'll send boom you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.030 
into a tune and then i'll send boom you
like<00:01:21.150> three<00:01:21.509> instant<00:01:21.960> echo<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.320> element<00:01:22.650> proxy

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
like three instant echo of element proxy

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.800 
like three instant echo of element proxy
even<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.119> thing<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:24.689> never

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
even it was the thing is it really never

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.990 
even it was the thing is it really never
even<00:01:25.020> prakt<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.500> much<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.830> begin<00:01:25.979> with<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.939> I

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
even prakt that much to begin with but I

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.260 
even prakt that much to begin with but I
mean<00:01:27.210> four<00:01:27.390> seconds<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.930> definitely<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.380> mean

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
mean four seconds is definitely I mean

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.910 
mean four seconds is definitely I mean
noticeable<00:01:30.270> nerve<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:31.110> thing<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.710> makes

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
noticeable nerve the thing is this makes

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.929 
noticeable nerve the thing is this makes
more<00:01:32.100> people<00:01:32.369> probably<00:01:32.520> want<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.759> go<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
more people probably want to go to

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.170 
more people probably want to go to
elemental<00:01:33.299> mastery<00:01:33.689> which<00:01:33.979> would<00:01:34.979> probably

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
elemental mastery which would probably

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.219 
elemental mastery which would probably
change<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> game<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.630> well<00:01:36.720> especially<00:01:36.900> if

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
change the game as well especially if

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.140 
change the game as well especially if
you're<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> horde<00:01:37.619> shaman<00:01:37.680> I'd<00:01:38.220> say<00:01:38.400> troll<00:01:38.670> you

you're a horde shaman I'd say troll you

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.640 
you're a horde shaman I'd say troll you
intermix<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:39.930> your<00:01:40.020> berserking<00:01:40.470> and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
intermix that with your berserking and

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.910 
intermix that with your berserking and
you're<00:01:40.799> looking<00:01:41.250> pretty<00:01:41.659> now<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.619> thing<00:01:43.649> with

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
you're looking pretty now the thing with

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.740 
you're looking pretty now the thing with
shamans<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.430> actually<00:01:44.909> increased<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
shamans is actually increased the

you want to pronounce it to absorb about
a<00:01:51.180> hundred<00:01:52.430> 104,000<00:01:53.430> damage<00:01:53.759> with<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.030> totem

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
a hundred 104,000 damage with that totem

and also every couple seconds in sorting

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.990 
and also every couple seconds in sorting
like<00:01:56.579> 20<00:01:56.909> k<00:01:57.090> if<00:01:57.240> not<00:01:57.270> killed<00:01:57.659> or<00:01:57.780> taken<00:01:57.869> out<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
like 20 k if not killed or taken out and

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.359 
like 20 k if not killed or taken out and
you<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.149> actually<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> go<00:02:00.899> with<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.409> what
