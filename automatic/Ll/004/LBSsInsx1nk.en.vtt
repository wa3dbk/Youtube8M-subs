00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
Cuba enjoy but as a light burner and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.550 
Cuba enjoy but as a light burner and
someone<00:02:20.150> who<00:02:20.269> likes<00:02:20.450> their<00:02:20.720> few<00:02:20.959> loose<00:02:21.290> I

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
someone who likes their few loose I

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.400 
someone who likes their few loose I
prefer<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.310> lighter<00:02:22.519> looser<00:02:23.120> feel<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.840> v1

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.720 

so<00:02:27.410> in<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.590> end<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:27.980> comes<00:02:28.250> down<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.549> personal

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
so in the end it comes down to personal

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.979 
so in the end it comes down to personal
preference<00:02:30.700> do<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.760> even<00:02:32.000> have<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.480> talk<00:02:32.750> about

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
corner-cutting

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.340 
corner-cutting
you<00:02:34.370> know<00:02:34.519> how<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:34.850> goes<00:02:35.090> both<00:02:35.720> these<00:02:35.989> keeps

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
you know how it goes both these keeps

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
tensions the v2 cuts just a hair more

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.839 
tensions the v2 cuts just a hair more
they<00:02:44.209> also<00:02:44.510> reverse<00:02:44.900> cut<00:02:45.170> 3/4<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.099> a<00:02:46.220> QV<00:02:46.610> and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
it hasn't popped on me yet but then

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.940 
it hasn't popped on me yet but then
again<00:03:07.070> I<00:03:07.220> don't<00:03:07.400> use<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:07.880> as<00:03:08.000> often<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.950> now

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
again I don't use it as often and now

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.680 
again I don't use it as often and now
what<00:03:10.280> you've<00:03:10.430> all<00:03:10.609> been<00:03:10.640> waiting<00:03:11.150> for<00:03:11.180> the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
what you've all been waiting for the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.580 
what you've all been waiting for the
mechanisms<00:03:12.319> of<00:03:12.500> these<00:03:12.650> puzzles

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.470 

so<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.770> left<00:03:17.010> are<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.220> v1<00:03:17.610> pieces<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.180> on<00:03:18.360> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
so the left are the v1 pieces and on the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.870 
so the left are the v1 pieces and on the
right<00:03:18.660> are<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.050> v2<00:03:19.380> pieces<00:03:19.860> at<00:03:20.099> first<00:03:20.670> glance

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
right are the v2 pieces at first glance

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.210 
right are the v2 pieces at first glance
they<00:03:21.300> look<00:03:21.330> nearly<00:03:21.750> identical<00:03:21.950> but<00:03:22.950> there<00:03:23.099> are

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
they look nearly identical but there are

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.580 
they look nearly identical but there are
some<00:03:23.430> differences<00:03:24.110> looking<00:03:25.110> closely<00:03:25.349> at<00:03:25.500> the

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
some differences looking closely at the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.710 
some differences looking closely at the
edges<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.190> can<00:03:26.220> see<00:03:26.520> that<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.819> v2<00:03:27.209> edges<00:03:27.569> have

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
edges you can see that the v2 edges have

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.890 
edges you can see that the v2 edges have
a<00:03:27.750> track<00:03:28.140> not<00:03:28.560> found<00:03:28.860> on<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.099> v1<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.870> v2

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
a track not found on the v1 the v2

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.040 
a track not found on the v1 the v2
corners<00:03:31.650> have<00:03:31.860> much<00:03:32.100> larger<00:03:32.340> dips<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:33.750> center

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
corners have much larger dips the center

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.199 
corners have much larger dips the center
piece<00:03:34.260> seems<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.739> be<00:03:34.860> unchanged<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:35.730> overall

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
piece seems to be unchanged and overall

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.330 
piece seems to be unchanged and overall
all<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.810> pieces<00:03:37.050> seems<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.530> be<00:03:37.650> sharper<00:03:38.160> and

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
all the pieces seems to be sharper and

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.440 
all the pieces seems to be sharper and
more<00:03:38.370> defined<00:03:39.270> on<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.600> v2<00:03:40.910> so<00:03:41.910> do<00:03:42.060> these<00:03:42.209> my

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
more defined on the v2 so do these my

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.360 
more defined on the v2 so do these my
new<00:03:42.660> differences<00:03:43.230> fix<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.680> corner<00:03:43.980> twisting

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
new differences fix the corner twisting

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.809 
new differences fix the corner twisting
problem<00:03:44.700> from<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.060> v1<00:03:45.420> so<00:03:46.050> far<00:03:46.290> yes<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:47.069> is<00:03:47.790> a

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
problem from the v1 so far yes it is a

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.610 
problem from the v1 so far yes it is a
bit<00:03:48.090> more<00:03:48.269> difficult<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.780> twist<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.200> corner<00:03:49.530> on

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
bit more difficult to twist a corner on

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.920 
bit more difficult to twist a corner on
the<00:03:49.709> v2<00:03:49.890> than<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.550> on<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.850> v1<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.209> so<00:03:51.690> far

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
the v2 than it is on the v1 and so far

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.490 
the v2 than it is on the v1 and so far
they<00:03:52.110> have<00:03:52.230> not<00:03:52.380> twisted<00:03:52.860> during<00:03:53.130> solves<00:03:54.500> so

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
they have not twisted during solves so

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.770 
they have not twisted during solves so
what's<00:03:55.920> my<00:03:56.040> verdict<00:03:56.459> while<00:03:57.180> both<00:03:57.510> of<00:03:57.540> these

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
what's my verdict while both of these

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.840 
what's my verdict while both of these
cubes<00:03:58.110> are<00:03:58.260> great<00:03:58.530> my<00:03:58.860> v1<00:03:59.220> has<00:03:59.370> just<00:03:59.640> brought

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
cubes are great my v1 has just brought

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:12.040 
cubes are great my v1 has just brought
me<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.269> many<00:04:00.390> more<00:04:00.569> memories

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.260 

well<00:04:13.050> to<00:04:13.470> be<00:04:13.620> fair<00:04:13.830> my<00:04:14.160> v2<00:04:14.520> features<00:04:14.880> in<00:04:15.060> some

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
well to be fair my v2 features in some

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.740 
well to be fair my v2 features in some
memorable<00:04:15.780> moments<00:04:16.260> too

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.990 

but<00:04:22.290> in<00:04:22.410> all<00:04:22.530> seriousness<00:04:22.560> I'll<00:04:23.520> be<00:04:23.760> sticking

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
but in all seriousness I'll be sticking

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.760 
but in all seriousness I'll be sticking
with<00:04:24.150> my<00:04:24.390> v1<00:04:24.780> but<00:04:25.020> that<00:04:25.140> doesn't<00:04:25.470> mean<00:04:25.590> all<00:04:25.740> of

with my v1 but that doesn't mean all of
