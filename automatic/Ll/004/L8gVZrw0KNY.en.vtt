 the ark of noah and election as he 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.870
 Caprichou in Costume 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.680
 the first number of retirees 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.900
 how it is necessary to disincarnate as the former President Lula said 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.420
 at the party 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.390
 was difficult and will assimilate this idea more certain is to see who offers during 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.810
 a greater time only last week and the delayed delay 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.840
 But the week was busier. 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.160
 the agetran preparing to take me over other things pronounced him retired 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.600
 aarp in the house 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.689
 in fact it seems to have come to be well thought of in this now one thing is to think 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.790
 another thing is to run 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.320
 you never ran away 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.320
 decisions of his life but this was the most difficult 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.780
 there is no doubt foztrans was 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.470
 the harder adhesion more tax and I had to take my life 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.930
 It's been 18 years playing 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.770
 doing the same thing he the same thing with much love much passion 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.909
 and travel the world 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.180
 the world today 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.800
 family friends and 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.190
 away from my Brazil 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.060
 fortunately in this having this passage in Brazil you leave here with 16 17 years 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.640
 questioned whether with a world cup eta he 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.520
 when there was a game of the Brazilian team but this passage through 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.340
 corinthians 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.340
 It was nice for you to go back to the Brazilian reality. 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.369
 but it was a bit too much to get along with the Brazilian people 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.079
 known by the Corinthians fans who have supported me since the first 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.079
 minute until today for the program 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.649
 it is not 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:13.690
 the fans here who love me 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.830
 the avaÃ­ knew how to love me as the defects with my qualities and 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.689
 I would not have imagined sending a story in football without knowing the
