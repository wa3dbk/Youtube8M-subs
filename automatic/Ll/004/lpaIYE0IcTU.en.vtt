00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
at them for a long time was that it

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.940 
at them for a long time was that it
actually<00:00:36.090> doesn't<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.420> any<00:00:36.540> rust<00:00:36.950> paints

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950

not<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.370> great<00:00:38.579> actually<00:00:39.210> looks<00:00:39.600> like<00:00:41.450> army

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450

last<00:00:42.690> time<00:00:42.899> they<00:00:43.050> painted<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.649> did<00:00:43.739> it

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
last time they painted it just did it

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.410 
last time they painted it just did it
with<00:00:43.920> brushes<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.399> rollers<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:45.210> too

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
with brushes and rollers so it's not too

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.330 
with brushes and rollers so it's not too
even<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:46.500> if<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.649> hit<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.890> hard<00:00:47.010> enough<00:00:47.219> with

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
even but if you hit it hard enough with

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.799 
even but if you hit it hard enough with
a<00:00:47.370> power<00:00:47.579> washer<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.120> get<00:00:48.239> right<00:00:48.450> back<00:00:48.600> down

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
a power washer you get right back down

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.600 
a power washer you get right back down
to<00:00:49.050> where<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.410> camouflage<00:00:49.770> was<00:00:50.309> underneath

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
to where the camouflage was underneath

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.450

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
that's what this black spot is here so

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.459 
that's what this black spot is here so
the<00:00:53.579> body<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.910> fairly<00:00:54.149> straight<00:00:54.629> actually

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
the body is fairly straight actually

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.920

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
minor dings and little holes where the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.500 
minor dings and little holes where the
antenna<00:01:00.780> mounts<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.289> been<00:01:01.469> stripped<00:01:01.770> away

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
antenna mounts have been stripped away

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.530
