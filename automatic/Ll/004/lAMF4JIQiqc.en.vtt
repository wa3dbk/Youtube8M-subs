00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.359
 he has one of the project twinmos all work out 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:24.660
 biceps so what is the best exercise on 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.260
 biceps in my opinion something very 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.170
 simple 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.539
 lift barbell straight up straight down 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.320
 because that's all biceps do 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.350
 flexes raises the joint of the elbow joint 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.390
 up this builds a mass of biceps 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.579
 and works out the peak and the biceps 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.739
 somewhere straight neck means palm 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.289
 souvenir and during the entire execution 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:52.739
 exercise what is supination supination 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.190
 this raising this palm up is like 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.469
 keep soup in your hand a bowl of soup so he 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.250
 not spilled so souvenir palm 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.180
 up this activates your biceps peak 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.580
 building these bazookas what could be easier 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.580
 it's very easy remember this don't complicate 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.200
 hammer biceps 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.430
 what are they good at biceps two heads 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.590
 long short 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.740
 long is responsible for the size of the biceps in 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.400
 the whole size of the muscles of this with her you swing 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.850
 the size 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.250
 shake your strength a short head with the other 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.100
 hand builds a peak so if you 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.630
 Need the size of the swing you want 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.159
 pump peak work on short 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.229
 alternate dumbbell lifts are good as 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.210
 for peak so for drawing big 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.670
 plus you focus on 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.250
 supination palm up muscle good 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.470
 felt increases and peak biceps 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.869
 Also here you can take a good weight and 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.630
 since the ascent is alternate then you can 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.280
 correct imbalance and in your body on 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.110
 this exercise becomes apparent 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.710
 if one side is stronger than the other and it 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.280
 easy fix concentrated 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.280
 biceps lifts 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.060
 this exercise is the king of all exercise on 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.140
 biceps peak 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.130
 the main plus is that there is no 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.230
 running shoulder 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.820
 because it often happens when you 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.990
 doing dumbbell lifting barbell 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.690
 even hammers 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.710
 when you lift the weight up and the front 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.670
 delta turns on and helps the biceps to 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.980
 concentrated front ascents 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.920
 Delta does not do so all 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.570
 movement performs only biceps besides 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.330
 concentrated biceps lift 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.280
 there is still pouchi beat very similar 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.170
 exercise on pro centered and rises 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.210
 need only on an incline bench 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.970
 lower right in front raise 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.380
 the barbell itself shortly before here is a bit 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.510
 front delta will turn on 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.500
 but the most important thing is that the biceps will get 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.700
 full work I hope you something 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.100
 understood from this video 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.170
 because only in this its meaning be 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.930
 then the right technique or new 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.820
 exercise or motivation that go to the gym 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.820
 and make yourself these huge essentially 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.590
 love you
