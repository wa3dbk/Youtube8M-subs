fictional<00:00:39.059> states<00:00:39.329> incidentally<00:00:40.109> and<00:00:40.679> I<00:00:40.739> have

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
fictional states incidentally and I have

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.130 
fictional states incidentally and I have
to<00:00:41.070> make<00:00:41.219> sure<00:00:41.249> that<00:00:41.460> his<00:00:41.879> data<00:00:42.179> matches<00:00:42.960> up<00:00:43.109> so

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
to make sure that his data matches up so

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.569 
to make sure that his data matches up so
I've<00:00:43.350> got<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.499> few<00:00:43.710> things<00:00:43.859> I<00:00:44.039> can<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.550> can

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
I've got a few things I can do I can

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.939 
I've got a few things I can do I can
check<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.449> picture<00:00:46.050> against<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.530> face<00:00:46.710> for

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
check the picture against the face for

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.739 
check the picture against the face for
example<00:00:47.039> make<00:00:47.460> sure<00:00:47.579> that's<00:00:47.730> right<00:00:48.030> see<00:00:48.629> if

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
example make sure that's right see if

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.049 
example make sure that's right see if
the<00:00:48.870> date<00:00:49.019> of<00:00:49.140> birth<00:00:49.379> seems<00:00:49.859> plausible<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.730> it

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the date of birth seems plausible and it

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.950 
the date of birth seems plausible and it
matches<00:00:51.239> up<00:00:51.479> with<00:00:51.600> all<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.809> information

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
matches up with all that information

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.809 
matches up with all that information
I've<00:00:52.679> got<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.069> little<00:00:53.309> thing<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.670> press

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:53.819 
I've got this little thing I can press

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.790 
I've got this little thing I can press
in<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> lower<00:00:54.300> right<00:00:54.780> hand<00:00:54.809> corner<00:00:55.079> this

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
in the lower right hand corner this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.889 
in the lower right hand corner this
allows<00:00:56.069> me<00:00:56.249> to<00:00:56.280> correlate<00:00:56.819> information<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.870> I

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
allows me to correlate information so I

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.509 
allows me to correlate information so I
can<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.379> example<00:00:58.409> it's<00:00:58.920> got<00:00:59.010> no<00:00:59.129> correlation

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
can for example it's got no correlation

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:00.889 
can for example it's got no correlation
between<00:00:59.729> those<00:00:59.999> two<00:01:00.179> things<00:01:00.359> but<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.690> can

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
between those two things but I can

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.069 
between those two things but I can
choose<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.229> face<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.679> his<00:01:02.249> face<00:01:03.079> matching

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
choose this face and his face matching

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:05.959 
choose this face and his face matching
data<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> system<00:01:04.920> recognizes<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.700> he<00:01:05.909> is

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:05.969 
data so the system recognizes that he is

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:07.880 
data so the system recognizes that he is
actually<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> person<00:01:06.899> he<00:01:07.020> says<00:01:07.259> he<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.500> which

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
actually the person he says he is which

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.709 
actually the person he says he is which
is<00:01:08.040> good<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.759> date<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.939> birth<00:01:09.090> let's<00:01:09.570> see

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:09.719 
is good and the date of birth let's see

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.219 
is good and the date of birth let's see
if<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:09.899> can<00:01:10.049> tally<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.469> up<00:01:10.619> some<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.369> look<00:01:12.229> no

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
if we can tally that up some of look no

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.480 
if we can tally that up some of look no
correlation<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.920> guess<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.280> can't

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
correlation because I guess you can't

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.609 
correlation because I guess you can't
tell<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.939> by<00:01:15.000> looking<00:01:15.090> at<00:01:15.600> them<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.259> he<00:01:16.439> looks

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
tell just by looking at them so he looks

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.609 
tell just by looking at them so he looks
fairly<00:01:16.860> legit<00:01:17.659> I'll<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.990> rid<00:01:19.079> of<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.320> and

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
fairly legit I'll get rid of this and

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.529 
fairly legit I'll get rid of this and

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
a game about making yourself feel bad

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.949 
a game about making yourself feel bad
but<00:03:25.080> in<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.290> kind<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.590> cool<00:03:25.860> way<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:26.750> think<00:03:27.750> she

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
but in a kind of cool way I think she

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.900 
but in a kind of cool way I think she
looks<00:03:28.260> pretty<00:03:28.350> good<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.980> can't<00:03:29.370> see<00:03:29.519> anything

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
looks pretty good I can't see anything

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.729 
looks pretty good I can't see anything
wrong<00:03:30.030> with<00:03:30.090> any<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.900> this<00:03:31.019> information<00:03:31.620> I

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
wrong with any of this information I

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.220 
wrong with any of this information I
can't<00:03:32.720> see<00:03:33.720> it's<00:03:33.810> there's<00:03:33.930> no<00:03:34.019> correlation

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
can't see it's there's no correlation

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.539 
can't see it's there's no correlation
because<00:03:34.590> they<00:03:34.769> don't<00:03:34.890> relate<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.130> each<00:03:35.370> other

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
because they don't relate to each other

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.979 
because they don't relate to each other
but<00:03:35.670> I'll<00:03:35.790> just<00:03:35.820> check<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.180> face<00:03:36.360> for<00:03:36.570> example

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
but I'll just check the face for example

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.280 
but I'll just check the face for example
make<00:03:37.680> sure<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.580> computer<00:03:38.940> recognizes<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:40.019> is

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
make sure the computer recognizes it is

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.140 
make sure the computer recognizes it is
her<00:03:40.440> matching<00:03:40.829> data<00:03:41.010> no<00:03:41.310> problem<00:03:41.670> Dodd's<00:03:42.000> go

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
her matching data no problem Dodd's go

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.000 
her matching data no problem Dodd's go

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.509 
waited to play it on here because I
figured<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.049> would<00:04:04.170> turn<00:04:04.350> up<00:04:04.470> sooner<00:04:04.950> or<00:04:04.980> later

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
seems to tally up even though it looks a

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.180 
seems to tally up even though it looks a
little<00:04:20.010> bit<00:04:20.220> sketchy<00:04:21.200> issued<00:04:22.200> by<00:04:22.440> letter<00:04:22.830> on<00:04:23.039> D

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
little bit sketchy issued by letter on D

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.580 
little bit sketchy issued by letter on D
that<00:04:23.400> matches<00:04:23.910> up<00:04:23.940> date<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:24.810> birth<00:04:24.990> night

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
that matches up date of birth night

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.710 
that matches up date of birth night
before<00:04:25.919> that's<00:04:26.160> okay<00:04:26.730> and<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:27.360> looks<00:04:27.510> like<00:04:27.570> the

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
before that's okay and it looks like the

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.409 
before that's okay and it looks like the
same<00:04:27.840> person<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:28.699> the<00:04:29.699> issuing<00:04:30.030> date<00:04:30.180> it<00:04:30.389> has
