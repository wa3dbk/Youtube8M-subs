00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:07.760
 people are afraid of change 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.760
 cc and fear evolve 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.170
 but to evolve you have to change 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.150
 true people resist for several 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.970
 reasons for fear of losing power 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.520
 comfort position for not understanding the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.740
 Why change by disagreement on how 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.410
 is going to be carried out or have a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.170
 Methodical personality anti change 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.480
 the change is and will be constant if not 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.360
 we change to adapt and survive 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.940
 we will be exterminated by evolution 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.769
 but how to carry out the change we 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.770
 we will find some problems for the 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.450
 path that we divide into two types the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.460
 technical problems where comes a 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.920
 expert and does not solve the problem 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.110
 this generates passivity and dependence and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.180
 the adaptive problems where not 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.129
 there is a written solution and everyone must 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.199
 participate in the solution by changing 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.180
 attitudes and values is that way 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.460
 We achieve the participation of all 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.680
 involved but today as to the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.589
 direction of change what dangers can 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.690
 happen many companies have managers 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.039
 which can get the 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.530
 company will work and until the 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:13.080
 employees are happy but it will suppose 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.820
 doing very well the same as always is 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.550
 so many companies disappear 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.320
 because they will be stuck in the same thing they do 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.690
 missing leaders that make us discover 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.390
 new roads that guarantee our 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.340
 survival and evolution but what kind 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.410
 of leaders are necessary and what are 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.720
 inefficient in these times by 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.850
 Mr. example is no longer valid solution 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.640
 Hector because it is the engine but at the same time 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.130
 is the brake generates passive dependence 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.080
 Victimization and castration of talent 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.940
 leader of the future connects intelligences 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.040
 involving and holding responsible 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.750
 everyone in the change because he understands that 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.420
 only with the participation of all 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.979
 will succeed in that process but 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.500
 Beware of the characters that you 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.000
 you find in the process of change 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.710
 there are the loyal ones who will be faithful to you 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.869
 person and they will be with you from the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.640
 beginning to the end the allies that 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.619
 they will help you because they have interests in 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.450
 your change project but they can 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.119
 betray you if they see that they do not win with the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.830
 I change the undecided those who have to 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.390
 convince and not allow them to be 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.390
 dragged by those who oppose the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.489
 change opponents will try to slow down 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.620
 the changes and the enemies that 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.660
 They will try to destroy your person as 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.400
 get ahead in the change and 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.400
 evolve without dying on the road 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.910
 or not
