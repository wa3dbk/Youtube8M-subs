so like formal corporate attire that's
what<00:00:35.010> I'm<00:00:35.130> wearing<00:00:35.340> kind<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.540> um<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
what I'm wearing kind of this um the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.139 
what I'm wearing kind of this um the
only<00:00:37.649> adjustment<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.370> would<00:00:38.520> probably<00:00:38.670> make<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
only adjustment I would probably make to

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.700 
only adjustment I would probably make to
this<00:00:39.270> look<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.780> maybe<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> length<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710

it with this leather skirt which is like
I<00:01:08.850> said<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.119> think<00:01:09.210> if<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.720> was<00:01:09.840> maybe<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.380> down

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
I said I think if it was maybe just down

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.960 
I said I think if it was maybe just down
to<00:01:10.710> me<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.920> think<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.310> would<00:01:11.430> make<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.610> really

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
to me I think that would make it really

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.690 
to me I think that would make it really
appropriate<00:01:12.470> because<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:14.040> casual<00:01:14.369> Friday

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
appropriate because it's a casual Friday

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.510 
appropriate because it's a casual Friday
and<00:01:14.909> some<00:01:15.060> people<00:01:15.270> wear<00:01:15.390> jeans<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:16.110> Friday<00:01:16.520> to

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and some people wear jeans on Friday to

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.310 
and some people wear jeans on Friday to
work<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.939> think<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.750> still

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
work I think that this is still

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.380

appropriate<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.040> still<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.670> meetings<00:01:21.119> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
appropriate you still have meetings and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.710

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.440 
really high ones but I like that and I
do<00:01:50.610> think<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.390> heel<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:52.049> essential<00:01:53.450> what

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
do think that a heel is essential what

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.480 
do think that a heel is essential what
type<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.630> day<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.470> work<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.040> think<00:01:56.399> you

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
type of day it is for work I think you

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.010 
type of day it is for work I think you
should<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.729> some<00:01:57.000> sort<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.360> heel<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.780> because

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
should have some sort of heel on because

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.590 
should have some sort of heel on because
anything<00:01:58.259> that's<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.680> really<00:01:59.310> flat<00:01:59.850> doesn't

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
anything that's like really flat doesn't

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.109 
anything that's like really flat doesn't
complement<00:02:01.560> your<00:02:01.649> figure<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.250> can<00:02:02.939> look

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
complement your figure and can look

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.139 
complement your figure and can look
casual<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.990> kind<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.790> more<00:02:05.790> sloppy

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
casual and kind of like more sloppy

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.029 
casual and kind of like more sloppy
looking<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.990> even<00:02:07.350> if<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.799> wear<00:02:08.009> a

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
looking so even if you have to wear a

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.219 
looking so even if you have to wear a
heel<00:02:08.459> that's<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.209> slight<00:02:09.479> heel<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.050> not

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
heel that's just a slight heel and not

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.900 
heel that's just a slight heel and not
you<00:02:10.590> know

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
you know

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.000 
you know
not<00:02:11.000> really<00:02:11.330> high<00:02:11.540> but<00:02:12.140> it's<00:02:12.290> still<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.500> heel<00:02:12.830> I

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
not really high but it's still a heel I

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.740 
not really high but it's still a heel I
think<00:02:13.220> that's<00:02:13.370> important<00:02:13.850> even<00:02:14.150> on<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.300> casual

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750

think that's important even on a casual
