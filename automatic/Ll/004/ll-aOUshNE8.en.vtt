hint of blushing in the obviously that's

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.680 
hint of blushing in the obviously that's
where<00:01:01.980> they<00:01:02.100> get<00:01:02.219> its<00:01:02.399> name<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.449> plan

where they get its name but this plan
has<00:01:03.870> been<00:01:04.080> pruned<00:01:04.619> pretty<00:01:05.189> well<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
has been pruned pretty well that I

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.260 
has been pruned pretty well that I
remove<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.510> bottom<00:01:06.900> leaves<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.010> that

remove the bottom leaves so that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.030 
remove the bottom leaves so that

things one there's a lot of cracking on
the<00:02:53.150> fruit<00:02:53.420> which<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.750> showed<00:02:54.019> that<00:02:54.049> in<00:02:54.290> the

there's<00:03:01.489> a<00:03:01.580> lot<00:03:01.760> of<00:03:01.880> cracking<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:02.510> came

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
there's a lot of cracking and this came

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.410 
there's a lot of cracking and this came
after<00:03:02.930> three<00:03:03.470> days<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.640> rain<00:03:04.849> you<00:03:05.269> know<00:03:05.390> a

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
after three days of rain you know a

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.900 
after three days of rain you know a
couple<00:03:05.690> inches<00:03:05.930> each<00:03:06.319> day<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.519> if<00:03:07.640> you're<00:03:07.819> in

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
couple inches each day so if you're in

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.940 
couple inches each day so if you're in
an<00:03:08.030> area<00:03:08.239> that<00:03:08.450> gets<00:03:08.510> lots<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:09.080> rain<00:03:09.349> this<00:03:09.739> may

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
an area that gets lots of rain this may

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.830 
an area that gets lots of rain this may
not<00:03:10.160> be<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.370> best<00:03:10.760> variety<00:03:11.420> because<00:03:11.690> it's

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
not be the best variety because it's

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.589 
not be the best variety because it's
going<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.230> crack<00:03:12.650> but<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.430> can<00:03:13.640> see<00:03:13.970> all<00:03:14.299> the

going to crack but you can see all the

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.390 
going to crack but you can see all the
fruit<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:14.840> it's<00:03:15.140> producing<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:16.130> crack

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
fruit that it's producing the crack

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.520 
fruit that it's producing the crack
fruit<00:03:16.730> will<00:03:17.299> take<00:03:17.510> care<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.810> itself<00:03:17.989> I'll<00:03:18.320> pick

swelling and cracking are starting to
grow<00:03:27.140> perfectly<00:03:27.620> fine<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.220> again<00:03:28.790> lots<00:03:29.720> of

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
grow perfectly fine and again lots of

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.720 
grow perfectly fine and again lots of
tomatoes<00:03:30.140> growing<00:03:30.890> so<00:03:31.100> this<00:03:31.250> is<00:03:31.400> going<00:03:31.549> to<00:03:31.609> be

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
tomatoes growing so this is going to be

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.650 
tomatoes growing so this is going to be
a<00:03:31.760> really<00:03:32.239> really<00:03:32.440> heavy<00:03:33.440> producer<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.940> you

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
a really really heavy producer and you

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.289 
a really really heavy producer and you
can<00:03:35.840> see<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:37.220> know<00:03:37.310> even<00:03:37.519> up<00:03:37.640> here<00:03:37.850> even<00:03:38.150> more

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
can see you know even up here even more

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.449 
can see you know even up here even more
flowers<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:38.840> this<00:03:39.140> plant<00:03:39.620> is<00:03:39.799> not<00:03:39.950> quite<00:03:40.310> even

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
flowers and this plant is not quite even

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.490 
flowers and this plant is not quite even
now<00:03:41.090> maybe<00:03:41.359> it's<00:03:41.510> five<00:03:41.720> feet<00:03:41.989> but<00:03:42.230> it's<00:03:42.350> good

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
now maybe it's five feet but it's good

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.390 
now maybe it's five feet but it's good
to<00:03:42.590> keep<00:03:42.769> growing

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
to keep growing

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.420 
to keep growing
now<00:03:44.359> when<00:03:44.569> the<00:03:44.690> heat<00:03:44.930> comes<00:03:44.959> it<00:03:45.799> gets<00:03:46.040> pretty

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
now when the heat comes it gets pretty

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.400 
now when the heat comes it gets pretty
beat<00:03:46.760> up<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.420> that's<00:03:47.540> another<00:03:47.840> thing<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.139> take

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
beat up so that's another thing to take

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.110 
beat up so that's another thing to take
into<00:03:48.620> consideration<00:03:48.709> and<00:03:49.489> all<00:03:49.579> those<00:03:49.760> leaves

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
into consideration and all those leaves

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.770 
into consideration and all those leaves
are<00:03:50.630> really<00:03:51.200> from<00:03:51.609> heat<00:03:52.609> damage<00:03:52.819> and<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.540> also

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
are really from heat damage and it also

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.910 
are really from heat damage and it also
doesn't<00:03:54.560> take<00:03:54.910> baking<00:03:55.910> soda<00:03:56.180> spray<00:03:56.600> as<00:03:56.840> well

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
doesn't take baking soda spray as well

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.770 
doesn't take baking soda spray as well
as<00:03:57.920> some<00:03:58.670> of<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.850> other<00:03:59.000> plants<00:03:59.299> so<00:03:59.480> some<00:03:59.750> of

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
as some of the other plants so some of

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.900 
as some of the other plants so some of
that<00:03:59.959> I<00:03:59.989> think<00:04:00.260> has<00:04:00.829> a<00:04:00.859> little<00:04:01.250> bit<00:04:01.370> of<00:04:01.489> damaged

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
that I think has a little bit of damaged

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.580 
that I think has a little bit of damaged
a<00:04:02.030> little<00:04:02.150> bit<00:04:02.359> of<00:04:02.450> sensitivity<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:03.500> the

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
a little bit of sensitivity to the

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.890 
a little bit of sensitivity to the
baking<00:04:03.950> soda<00:04:04.100> spray<00:04:04.549> but<00:04:05.389> this<00:04:05.600> would<00:04:05.750> be<00:04:05.780> the

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
baking soda spray but this would be the

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.440 
baking soda spray but this would be the
case<00:04:06.170> where<00:04:06.530> when<00:04:06.980> it's<00:04:07.130> cooler<00:04:07.370> 85<00:04:08.030> degrees

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
case where when it's cooler 85 degrees

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.599 
case where when it's cooler 85 degrees
or<00:04:08.600> less<00:04:08.810> no<00:04:09.650> trouble<00:04:10.010> with<00:04:10.100> baking<00:04:10.459> soda

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
or less no trouble with baking soda

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.020 
or less no trouble with baking soda
spray<00:04:11.030> when<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.780> temperature<00:04:12.170> goes<00:04:12.350> up<00:04:13.030> 90

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
spray when the temperature goes up 90

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.170 
spray when the temperature goes up 90
degrees<00:04:14.060> plus<00:04:15.370> it<00:04:16.370> gets<00:04:16.549> damaged<00:04:17.000> from<00:04:17.120> the

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
degrees plus it gets damaged from the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.000 
degrees plus it gets damaged from the
heat<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:17.750> it's<00:04:18.109> more<00:04:18.289> sensitive<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:18.919> the

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
heat and it's more sensitive to the

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.210 
heat and it's more sensitive to the
baking<00:04:19.370> soda<00:04:19.549> spray<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:21.530> those<00:04:21.709> are<00:04:21.890> things<00:04:22.130> to

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
baking soda spray so those are things to

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.490 
baking soda spray so those are things to
keep<00:04:22.460> in<00:04:22.640> mind<00:04:22.669> sometimes<00:04:23.419> when<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.289> have

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
keep in mind sometimes when you have

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.050 
keep in mind sometimes when you have
different<00:04:24.890> varieties<00:04:25.010> that<00:04:25.580> just<00:04:25.789> because

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
different varieties that just because

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.870 
different varieties that just because
one<00:04:26.300> plant

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
one plant

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.180 
one plant
well<00:04:27.060> with<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.240> specific<00:04:27.540> spray<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:29.160> other

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
well with a specific spray the other

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.700 
well with a specific spray the other
plant<00:04:29.610> may<00:04:29.880> not<00:04:30.120> but<00:04:30.450> I<00:04:30.600> like<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:31.020> tomato<00:04:31.380> it

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
plant may not but I like this tomato it

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.550 
plant may not but I like this tomato it
is<00:04:31.980> really<00:04:32.460> really<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.240> really<00:04:34.170> really<00:04:34.410> sweet

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
is really really a really really sweet

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.940 
is really really a really really sweet
tomato<00:04:35.030> with<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.270> acidity<00:04:36.690> of<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.870> tomato<00:04:37.200> so

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
tomato with the acidity of the tomato so

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.560 
tomato with the acidity of the tomato so
that<00:04:38.190> you<00:04:38.520> know<00:04:38.670> you<00:04:39.150> know<00:04:39.300> what<00:04:39.450> you're

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
that you know you know what you're

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.330 
that you know you know what you're
eating<00:04:39.690> and<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:40.200> also<00:04:40.320> get<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.680> say<00:04:40.800> Amen<00:04:41.070> this

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
eating and you also get to say Amen this

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.610 
eating and you also get to say Amen this
really<00:04:41.550> has<00:04:41.700> some<00:04:41.850> extra<00:04:42.150> sugar<00:04:42.390> in<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.690> the

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
really has some extra sugar in it the

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.590 
really has some extra sugar in it the
benefits<00:04:44.400> of<00:04:44.490> this<00:04:44.580> tomato<00:04:44.850> it's<00:04:45.150> supposed<00:04:45.480> to

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
benefits of this tomato it's supposed to

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.960 
benefits of this tomato it's supposed to
grow<00:04:45.810> till<00:04:46.080> frost<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:46.920> think<00:04:47.610> it's<00:04:47.730> doing

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
grow till frost and I think it's doing

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.340 
grow till frost and I think it's doing
better<00:04:48.090> now<00:04:48.270> that<00:04:48.540> we've<00:04:48.660> had<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.810> couple<00:04:49.020> cool

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
better now that we've had a couple cool

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.930 
better now that we've had a couple cool
days<00:04:49.590> so<00:04:49.830> I<00:04:49.860> really<00:04:50.340> think<00:04:50.550> this<00:04:50.640> one<00:04:50.820> will

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
days so I really think this one will

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.880 
days so I really think this one will
grow<00:04:51.060> through<00:04:51.300> September<00:04:51.810> here<00:04:51.990> in<00:04:52.260> Maryland

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
grow through September here in Maryland

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.610 
grow through September here in Maryland
zone<00:04:53.040> seven<00:04:53.400> here's<00:04:53.670> what<00:04:53.850> it<00:04:53.940> looks<00:04:54.120> like

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
zone seven here's what it looks like

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.090 
zone seven here's what it looks like
split<00:04:55.620> open

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
split open

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.480 
split open
these<00:04:56.790> are<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.030> Krakens<00:04:57.510> that<00:04:57.690> you'll<00:04:58.490> run

these are the Krakens that you'll run

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.950 
these are the Krakens that you'll run
into<00:04:59.670> with<00:05:00.030> this<00:05:00.180> tomato<00:05:00.420> and<00:05:00.720> you're<00:05:00.810> just

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960

fine that's not gonna hurt your plant I

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.550 
fine that's not gonna hurt your plant I
tried<00:05:09.060> to<00:05:09.180> research<00:05:09.480> where<00:05:09.720> it<00:05:09.810> came<00:05:09.990> from<00:05:10.260> and

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
tried to research where it came from and

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.360 
tried to research where it came from and

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
it was actually two places one piece of

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.890 
it was actually two places one piece of
research<00:05:14.460> said<00:05:14.940> it<00:05:15.060> was<00:05:15.150> found<00:05:15.420> growing<00:05:15.660> in

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
research said it was found growing in

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.810 
research said it was found growing in
the<00:05:15.990> crack<00:05:16.260> of<00:05:16.500> Indiana's<00:05:17.070> sidewalk<00:05:17.610> so

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
the crack of Indiana's sidewalk so

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.840 
the crack of Indiana's sidewalk so
somebody<00:05:18.180> found<00:05:18.840> it<00:05:19.020> growing<00:05:19.410> and<00:05:20.280> started<00:05:20.730> it

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
somebody found it growing and started it

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.520 
somebody found it growing and started it
but<00:05:21.270> most<00:05:21.540> of<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:21.720> literature<00:05:21.960> says<00:05:22.230> that<00:05:22.410> it

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
but most of the literature says that it

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.040 
but most of the literature says that it
comes<00:05:22.710> out<00:05:22.830> of<00:05:22.980> South<00:05:23.100> America<00:05:23.310> so<00:05:23.930> you<00:05:24.930> know<00:05:25.020> a

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
comes out of South America so you know a

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.020 
comes out of South America so you know a
little<00:05:25.290> background<00:05:25.470> history<00:05:26.070> so<00:05:26.430> this<00:05:26.550> is<00:05:26.790> the

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
little background history so this is the

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.650 
little background history so this is the
yellow<00:05:27.300> currant<00:05:27.750> and<00:05:28.790> I<00:05:29.790> would<00:05:30.060> recommend<00:05:30.540> it

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660
