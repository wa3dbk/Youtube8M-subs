00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
plane so much more interesting because

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.830 
plane so much more interesting because
here's<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:38.950> thing<00:00:39.220> when<00:00:39.880> people<00:00:40.270> first<00:00:40.600> learn

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
here's the thing when people first learn

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.350 
here's the thing when people first learn
guitar<00:00:41.020> usually<00:00:41.590> they<00:00:42.370> just<00:00:42.400> strum<00:00:42.880> downwards

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
guitar usually they just strum downwards

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:53.860 
guitar usually they just strum downwards
with<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.630> plectrum<00:00:43.870> like<00:00:44.200> this

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.619 

and<00:00:54.500> that's<00:00:54.770> okay<00:00:55.160> but<00:00:55.370> after<00:00:55.640> a<00:00:55.670> while<00:00:55.940> you'll

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
and that's okay but after a while you'll

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:57.939 
and that's okay but after a while you'll
find<00:00:56.690> that<00:00:57.050> that<00:00:57.170> starts<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.649> sound<00:00:57.770> quite

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
find that that starts to sound quite

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.040 
find that that starts to sound quite
boring<00:00:58.309> so<00:00:58.790> what<00:00:59.180> I<00:00:59.210> want<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.480> do<00:00:59.629> is<00:00:59.780> give<00:00:59.930> you

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.810 
boring so what I want to do is give you
a<00:01:00.110> more<00:01:00.379> interesting<00:01:00.769> strumming<00:01:01.430> pattern

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
a more interesting strumming pattern

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.520 
a more interesting strumming pattern
that<00:01:01.969> will<00:01:02.090> make<00:01:02.300> it<00:01:02.540> sound<00:01:02.780> allure<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:03.350> know

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
that will make it sound allure you know

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.680 
that will make it sound allure you know
a<00:01:03.559> lot<00:01:03.949> more<00:01:04.129> alive<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:04.790> also<00:01:05.449> I'm<00:01:05.540> going<00:01:05.630> to

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
a lot more alive and also I'm going to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.930 
a lot more alive and also I'm going to
show<00:01:05.869> you<00:01:05.960> a<00:01:05.990> new<00:01:06.229> chords<00:01:06.740> today<00:01:07.130> it's<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.580> G

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
show you a new chords today it's the G

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.870 
show you a new chords today it's the G
chord<00:01:08.299> and<00:01:08.509> so<00:01:09.259> this<00:01:09.680> strumming<00:01:10.130> pattern<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.850> a

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
chord and so this strumming pattern is a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.149 
chord and so this strumming pattern is a
Down<00:01:11.180> stroke<00:01:11.860> an<00:01:12.860> upstroke<00:01:13.430> a<00:01:14.200> chop<00:01:15.200> I'll

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
Down stroke an upstroke a chop I'll

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.270 
Down stroke an upstroke a chop I'll
explain<00:01:16.550> that<00:01:16.729> in<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.940> minute<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.360> an<00:01:17.720> upstroke

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
explain that in a minute and an upstroke

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.530 
explain that in a minute and an upstroke
so<00:01:19.280> when<00:01:19.430> we<00:01:19.520> put<00:01:19.729> that<00:01:19.850> together<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:20.390> sounds

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
so when we put that together it sounds

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:35.060 
so when we put that together it sounds
like<00:01:20.690> this

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.550 

okay<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.420> see<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.020> gives<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.440> a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
okay and you can see that it gives it a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
okay and you can see that it gives it a
more<00:01:37.740> interesting<00:01:38.190> sound<00:01:38.940> because<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.360> charm

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
more interesting sound because the charm

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.680 
more interesting sound because the charm
is<00:01:40.229> quite<00:01:40.830> percussive<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:42.000> me<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.360> sounds<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
is quite percussive it to me it sounds a

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.030 
is quite percussive it to me it sounds a
little<00:01:42.810> bit<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.290> drum<00:01:43.500> kit<00:01:43.740> when<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
little bit like a drum kit when the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.490 
little bit like a drum kit when the
drummer<00:01:44.250> hits<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.700> snare<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.440> especially<00:01:46.440> if

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
drummer hits the snare and especially if

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.350 
drummer hits the snare and especially if

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.690 
3 and the little finger goes right next
to<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.510> on<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.989> first<00:02:19.260> string<00:02:19.470> at<00:02:19.590> fret<00:02:19.620> 3<00:02:20.070> so

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
to it on the first string at fret 3 so

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.979 
to it on the first string at fret 3 so
if<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.910> just<00:02:21.060> want<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.330> look<00:02:21.420> at<00:02:21.570> that<00:02:21.690> chord

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
if you just want to look at that chord

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.290 
if you just want to look at that chord
diagram<00:02:22.440> next<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.800> me<00:02:22.920> just<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.220> clarify<00:02:23.760> what

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
diagram next to me just to clarify what

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.880 
diagram next to me just to clarify what
those<00:02:24.450> notes<00:02:24.720> are<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.260> you're<00:02:25.590> going<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.739> use

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
those notes are and you're going to use

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.309 
those notes are and you're going to use
the<00:02:26.040> plectrum<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.610> strum<00:02:26.880> all<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.120> strings

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.229 

now<00:02:29.769> you<00:02:29.829> should<00:02:30.219> know<00:02:30.430> by<00:02:30.670> now<00:02:30.879> if<00:02:31.090> you

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
now you should know by now if you

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.580 
now you should know by now if you
remember<00:02:31.599> me<00:02:31.749> telling<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.109> in<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.409> last

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
remember me telling you in the last

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.589 
remember me telling you in the last
lesson<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.579> you<00:02:33.700> should<00:02:33.879> be<00:02:34.030> art<00:02:34.180> in<00:02:34.450> these

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
lesson that you should be art in these

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.270 
lesson that you should be art in these
fingers<00:02:34.870> up<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.379> there<00:02:35.590> should<00:02:35.739> be<00:02:35.769> plenty<00:02:36.069> of

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
fingers up and there should be plenty of

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.729 
fingers up and there should be plenty of
space<00:02:36.670> underneath<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.689> you<00:02:38.349> know<00:02:38.469> you<00:02:38.530> should

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
space underneath and you know you should

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.020 
space underneath and you know you should
be<00:02:38.769> holding<00:02:39.010> down<00:02:39.280> with<00:02:39.459> lots<00:02:39.579> of<00:02:39.730> pressure

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
be holding down with lots of pressure

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.330 
be holding down with lots of pressure
and<00:02:40.389> the<00:02:40.749> back<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.139> the<00:02:41.170> finger<00:02:41.739> shouldn't<00:02:42.189> be

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
and the back of the finger shouldn't be

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.399 
and the back of the finger shouldn't be
accidentally<00:02:43.180> touching<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.900> string<00:02:44.200> behind

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
accidentally touching the string behind

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.890 
accidentally touching the string behind
it<00:02:44.859> so<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.400> when<00:02:45.819> you<00:02:45.849> strum<00:02:46.269> all<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.450> all

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
it so that when you strum all the all

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.930 
it so that when you strum all the all
the<00:02:47.049> notes<00:02:47.260> that<00:02:47.500> should<00:02:47.829> sound<00:02:48.010> like<00:02:48.099> this

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.170 

nice<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:51.960> clean<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.530> clear<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.820> if<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.030> need

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
nice and clean and clear so if you need

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.670 
nice and clean and clear so if you need
to<00:02:54.210> practice<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.840> for<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.080> second<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.650> know

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
to practice that for a second you know

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.620 
to practice that for a second you know
by<00:02:55.920> all<00:02:56.070> means<00:02:56.280> pause<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.850> video<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.420> just

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
by all means pause the video and just

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.810 
by all means pause the video and just
make<00:02:57.990> sure<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.260> got<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.530> right<00:02:58.860> so<00:02:59.580> this

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
make sure you got that right so this

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.880 
make sure you got that right so this
strumming<00:03:00.180> pattern<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:01.620> we're<00:03:01.710> going<00:03:01.800> to

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
strumming pattern so we're going to

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.350 
strumming pattern so we're going to
strum<00:03:02.160> downwards<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:04.230> then<00:03:04.440> upwards<00:03:05.360> and

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
strum downwards and then upwards and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.570 
strum downwards and then upwards and
then<00:03:06.540> we're<00:03:06.660> gonna<00:03:06.750> do<00:03:06.990> this<00:03:07.110> chop<00:03:07.500> right<00:03:08.370> so

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
then we're gonna do this chop right so

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.430 
then we're gonna do this chop right so
let<00:03:08.760> me<00:03:08.850> explain<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.300> now<00:03:09.720> now<00:03:10.140> what<00:03:10.320> the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
let me explain that now now what the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.040 
let me explain that now now what the
chop<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.220> we're<00:03:12.030> gonna<00:03:12.120> use<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.510> palm<00:03:12.810> of

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
chop is is we're gonna use the palm of

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.500 
chop is is we're gonna use the palm of
our<00:03:13.170> hand<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:14.040> touch<00:03:14.400> all<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.030> strings<00:03:15.330> like

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
our hand to touch all the strings like

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.770 
our hand to touch all the strings like
this<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.380> what<00:03:16.680> happens<00:03:17.100> is<00:03:17.310> our<00:03:17.610> hand<00:03:18.480> comes

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
this and what happens is our hand comes

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.810 
this and what happens is our hand comes
the<00:03:19.320> palm<00:03:19.560> touches<00:03:19.980> all<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.190> strings<00:03:20.490> and

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
the palm touches all the strings and

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.120 
the palm touches all the strings and
then<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.780> plectrum<00:03:22.020> follows<00:03:22.590> through

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
then the plectrum follows through

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.830 
then the plectrum follows through
but<00:03:23.280> because<00:03:23.910> we're<00:03:24.120> touching<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.510> strings

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
but because we're touching the strings

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.670 
but because we're touching the strings
all<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.260> notes<00:03:25.470> are<00:03:25.650> muted<00:03:26.450> like<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.680> now

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
all the notes are muted like that now

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.050 
all the notes are muted like that now
you<00:03:28.740> shouldn't<00:03:29.040> be<00:03:29.130> able<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.340> hear<00:03:29.550> any<00:03:29.760> notes

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
you shouldn't be able to hear any notes

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.810 
you shouldn't be able to hear any notes
at<00:03:30.300> all<00:03:30.480> if<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.840> can<00:03:30.990> hear<00:03:31.230> anything<00:03:31.820> like

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
at all if you can hear anything like

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.700 
at all if you can hear anything like
that<00:03:33.060> then<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.780> need<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.080> make<00:03:34.380> sure<00:03:34.410> you're

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
that then you need to make sure you're

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.350 
that then you need to make sure you're
holding<00:03:34.890> down<00:03:35.310> on<00:03:35.490> those<00:03:35.640> strings<00:03:35.970> with<00:03:36.210> more

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
holding down on those strings with more

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.780 
holding down on those strings with more
pressure<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:37.500> they<00:03:37.770> should<00:03:37.950> be<00:03:38.070> totally<00:03:38.520> dead

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
pressure and they should be totally dead

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.040 
pressure and they should be totally dead
so<00:03:41.790> that'll<00:03:42.150> take<00:03:42.300> a<00:03:42.360> little<00:03:42.600> bit<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:42.870> practice

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
so that'll take a little bit of practice

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.680 
so that'll take a little bit of practice
and<00:03:43.680> eventually<00:03:44.490> you<00:03:44.880> can<00:03:45.090> bring<00:03:45.300> your<00:03:45.450> hand

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
and eventually you can bring your hand

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.010 
and eventually you can bring your hand
down<00:03:45.960> and<00:03:46.730> chop<00:03:47.730> all<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.210> one<00:03:48.390> motion<00:03:48.600> like

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
down and chop all in one motion like

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.430 
down and chop all in one motion like
that<00:03:52.400> okay<00:03:53.400> so<00:03:53.940> just<00:03:54.300> to<00:03:54.390> clarify<00:03:54.600> I'll<00:03:55.200> tell

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
that okay so just to clarify I'll tell

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.199 
that okay so just to clarify I'll tell
you<00:03:55.530> again<00:03:55.770> make<00:03:56.100> sure<00:03:56.130> that<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.730> palm<00:03:57.030> of

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
you again make sure that the palm of

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.790 
you again make sure that the palm of
your<00:03:57.240> hand<00:03:57.360> is<00:03:57.690> laying<00:03:58.050> across<00:03:58.260> all<00:03:58.590> those

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
your hand is laying across all those

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.070 
your hand is laying across all those
strings<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.430> effectively<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:00.690> know<00:04:00.750> killing

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
strings and effectively you know killing

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.810 
strings and effectively you know killing
the<00:04:01.320> notes<00:04:01.640> okay<00:04:02.640> so<00:04:03.150> what<00:04:03.330> happens<00:04:03.690> is<00:04:04.820> you're

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
the notes okay so what happens is you're

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.490 
the notes okay so what happens is you're
gonna<00:04:05.940> practice<00:04:06.240> it<00:04:06.660> until<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.200> can<00:04:07.350> do<00:04:07.470> it

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
gonna practice it until you can do it

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500 
gonna practice it until you can do it
like<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.890> nice<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.280> smooth<00:04:08.610> all<00:04:09.090> in<00:04:09.360> one

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
like that nice and smooth all in one

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.320 
like that nice and smooth all in one
motion<00:04:13.160> okay<00:04:14.160> so<00:04:14.220> that's<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:14.730> Chop<00:04:15.000> that's

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
motion okay so that's the Chop that's

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.070 
motion okay so that's the Chop that's
how<00:04:15.450> it<00:04:15.600> works

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
how it works

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.810 
how it works
so<00:04:16.500> when<00:04:16.650> we<00:04:16.770> put<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:17.100> into<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.459> strumming

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
so when we put that into the strumming

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.819 
so when we put that into the strumming
pattern<00:04:17.850> we're<00:04:18.540> gonna<00:04:18.630> go<00:04:18.810> down

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:44.879 

chop<00:04:22.699> and<00:04:22.940> then<00:04:23.360> up<00:04:23.539> again<00:04:24.190> sound<00:04:25.190> like<00:04:25.340> this

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.670 

okay<00:04:45.729> now<00:04:46.180> it's<00:04:46.449> easier<00:04:46.840> said<00:04:47.080> than<00:04:47.259> done<00:04:47.319> I

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
okay now it's easier said than done I

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.469 
okay now it's easier said than done I
expect<00:04:48.430> that<00:04:48.610> I'll<00:04:48.729> take<00:04:48.909> you<00:04:48.999> quite<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.240> bit<00:04:49.389> of

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
expect that I'll take you quite a bit of

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.510 
expect that I'll take you quite a bit of
time<00:04:49.659> to<00:04:49.840> practice<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:50.499> I<00:04:50.680> mean<00:04:51.069> I<00:04:51.189> know<00:04:51.280> it

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
time to practice that I mean I know it

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.159 
time to practice that I mean I know it
takes<00:04:51.699> my<00:04:51.879> students<00:04:52.360> quite<00:04:52.569> a<00:04:52.599> while<00:04:52.870> before

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
takes my students quite a while before

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.689 
takes my students quite a while before
they<00:04:53.469> really<00:04:53.830> get<00:04:53.979> the<00:04:54.009> hang<00:04:54.219> of<00:04:54.370> it

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
they really get the hang of it

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.189 
they really get the hang of it
so<00:04:54.939> that's<00:04:55.120> brilliant<00:04:55.360> sit<00:04:55.689> go<00:04:55.840> easy<00:04:56.050> on

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
so that's brilliant sit go easy on
