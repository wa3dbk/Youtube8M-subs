be able to play it but I think that's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.370

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
how it's going to go I think they're

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.440 
how it's going to go I think they're
gonna<00:01:07.500> bring<00:01:07.680> out<00:01:07.920> after<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.270> been
