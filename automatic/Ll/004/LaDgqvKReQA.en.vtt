00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.230 
what I had to do so here's the lens of
the<00:01:25.259> camera<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.770> cut<00:01:26.189> out<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> center<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.880> CD

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
the camera I cut out the center of a CD

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.660 
the camera I cut out the center of a CD
and<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.450> glued<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> around<00:01:28.400> just<00:01:29.400> right<00:01:29.549> around

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
and I glued it around just right around

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.060 
and I glued it around just right around
there<00:01:30.000> that's<00:01:30.360> why<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.229> white

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
there that's why you see like that white

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370 
there that's why you see like that white
circle<00:01:32.490> going<00:01:32.640> around<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:33.150> mean<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.229> doesn't

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
circle going around I mean it doesn't

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.929 
circle going around I mean it doesn't
really<00:01:34.500> look<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.130> much<00:01:35.310> different<00:01:35.759> than<00:01:35.790> it

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
really look that much different than it

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.390 
really look that much different than it
did<00:01:36.030> before<00:01:36.259> but<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.590> tell<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> little<00:01:38.220> bit

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
did before but you can tell a little bit

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.690 
did before but you can tell a little bit
of<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> difference<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:43.860> seems<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.549> tell

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
of a difference it seems like I can tell

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.310 
of a difference it seems like I can tell
there's<00:01:44.939> gonna<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.270> some<00:01:45.509> blurriness<00:01:46.079> going

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
there's gonna be some blurriness going

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.530 
there's gonna be some blurriness going
around<00:01:47.420> along<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:51.409> yeah<00:01:53.060> it<00:01:54.060> kind<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.360> eats

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
around along here yeah it kind of eats

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.940 
around along here yeah it kind of eats
the<00:01:54.720> purpose<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.290> lens<00:01:55.470> unless<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.920> just

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the purpose of the lens unless I just

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.510 
the purpose of the lens unless I just
barely<00:01:56.369> zoom<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.110> but<00:01:58.110> on<00:02:00.710> its<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.799> pretty

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
barely zoom it in but on its a pretty

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.149 
barely zoom it in but on its a pretty
good<00:02:02.670> quality<00:02:02.909> lens<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.500> focus<00:02:04.770> in

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
good quality lens and it can focus in

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.660 
good quality lens and it can focus in
focusing<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.390> more<00:02:07.069> as<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.429> see<00:02:08.580> you

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
focusing on this more as you can see you

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.610 
focusing on this more as you can see you
can<00:02:08.789> get<00:02:08.970> quite<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> bit<00:02:09.539> closer

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
can get quite a bit closer

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.080 
can get quite a bit closer
then<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.989> actual<00:02:14.110> camera<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.060> can

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
then the actual camera can so you can

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.880 
then the actual camera can so you can
still<00:02:16.390> kind<00:02:16.659> of<00:02:16.690> read<00:02:16.870> that<00:02:17.080> because<00:02:17.769> this

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
still kind of read that because this

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.490 
still kind of read that because this
lens<00:02:18.099> is<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.250> macro<00:02:18.790> one<00:02:18.909> like<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.180> said

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
lens is a macro one like I said

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.470 
lens is a macro one like I said
and<00:02:20.500> then<00:02:20.680> if<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.340> take<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.610> lens<00:02:21.790> off<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.330> try

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
and then if I take the lens off and try

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.110 
and then if I take the lens off and try
to<00:02:22.510> get<00:02:23.409> like<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:24.519> can't<00:02:24.730> read<00:02:24.879> it<00:02:25.000> at

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
to get like that you can't read it at

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.410 
to get like that you can't read it at
all<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.459> does<00:02:27.580> help<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.819> focus<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.299> the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
all so it does help to focus on the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.539 
all so it does help to focus on the
camera<00:02:28.599> a<00:02:28.780> little<00:02:28.900> bit<00:02:29.220> but<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.250> think<00:02:30.280> it's

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
camera a little bit but I think it's

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.369 
camera a little bit but I think it's
gonna<00:02:30.640> be<00:02:30.849> great<00:02:31.090> for<00:02:31.269> using<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:31.659> my<00:02:31.690> tag<00:02:31.959> and

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
gonna be great for using on my tag and

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.250 
gonna be great for using on my tag and
stuff<00:02:32.890> like<00:02:33.010> that
