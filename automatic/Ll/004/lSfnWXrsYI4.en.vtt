here<00:01:00.729> is<00:01:00.790> from<00:01:00.850> aquatic<00:01:01.269> orto<00:01:01.570> it's<00:01:01.869> more<00:01:02.229> of<00:01:02.290> a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
here is from aquatic orto it's more of a

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.079 
here is from aquatic orto it's more of a
balance<00:01:02.710> type<00:01:02.860> begins<00:01:03.309> with<00:01:03.549> the<00:01:03.670> really<00:01:03.970> own

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
balance type begins with the really own

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.240 
balance type begins with the really own
now<00:01:05.019> as<00:01:05.080> you<00:01:05.199> can<00:01:05.320> see<00:01:05.379> they're<00:01:05.680> both<00:01:05.710> in<00:01:06.130> their

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
now as you can see they're both in their

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.920 
now as you can see they're both in their
strongest<00:01:06.850> mode<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.479> reason<00:01:07.689> why<00:01:07.750> is<00:01:07.810> because

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
strongest mode the reason why is because

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.469 
strongest mode the reason why is because
well<00:01:08.560> it's<00:01:08.740> pretty<00:01:08.890> simple<00:01:09.270> because<00:01:10.270> since

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
well it's pretty simple because since

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.160 
well it's pretty simple because since
the<00:01:10.630> bays<00:01:10.869> are<00:01:11.619> so<00:01:12.159> so<00:01:12.400> powerful<00:01:13.030> we<00:01:13.750> decided

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
the bays are so so powerful we decided

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.870 
the bays are so so powerful we decided
one<00:01:14.409> thing<00:01:14.439> thanks<00:01:14.979> they're<00:01:15.100> so<00:01:15.220> powerful<00:01:15.400> why

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
one thing thanks they're so powerful why

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.070 
one thing thanks they're so powerful why
don't<00:01:16.030> we<00:01:16.090> just<00:01:16.270> put<00:01:16.509> them<00:01:16.570> in<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.780> strongest

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
don't we just put them in the strongest

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.890 
don't we just put them in the strongest
modes<00:01:17.470> so<00:01:18.430> while<00:01:18.670> I<00:01:18.700> just<00:01:18.970> move<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.330> angle<00:01:19.780> to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
modes so while I just move the angle to

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.679 
modes so while I just move the angle to
make<00:01:20.020> sure<00:01:20.110> it's<00:01:20.229> good<00:01:20.439> and<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:22.360> think<00:01:22.509> we're<00:01:22.600> in

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
make sure it's good and I think we're in

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.090 
make sure it's good and I think we're in
a<00:01:22.720> pretty<00:01:22.900> good<00:01:23.020> angle<00:01:23.140> let<00:01:23.740> me<00:01:23.829> just<00:01:23.979> make

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
a pretty good angle let me just make

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.690 
a pretty good angle let me just make
sure<00:01:24.540> I'm<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.600> good<00:01:25.780> angle<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:28.360> we<00:01:28.689> can<00:01:28.900> see<00:01:29.700> now

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
sure I'm a good angle so we can see now

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.520 
sure I'm a good angle so we can see now
this<00:01:31.000> is<00:01:31.270> a<00:01:31.360> good<00:01:31.750> angle<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:33.310> we<00:01:33.460> can<00:01:33.640> see<00:01:34.530> just

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
this is a good angle as we can see just

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.310 
this is a good angle as we can see just
move<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.860> a<00:01:35.890> little<00:01:35.920> bit<00:01:36.159> closer<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.900> yeah<00:01:38.140> I'm

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.530 
attacks from loop chain beyond but it
looks<00:02:20.409> like<00:02:20.530> waka<00:02:20.709> hotel<00:02:21.370> won<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:21.879> round<00:02:22.209> the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
looks like waka hotel won this round the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.910 
looks like waka hotel won this round the
score<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:23.049> 1-0<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.280> did<00:02:24.489> not<00:02:24.610> expect<00:02:24.970> that

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
score of 1-0 I did not expect that

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.369 
score of 1-0 I did not expect that
but<00:02:26.920> since<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.129> WT<00:02:27.720> w2d<00:02:28.720> has<00:02:28.870> very<00:02:29.110> strong

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
but since the WT w2d has very strong

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.380 
but since the WT w2d has very strong
endurance<00:02:29.920> it's<00:02:30.159> really<00:02:30.640> not<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.970> be<00:02:31.000> that

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
endurance it's really not to be that

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.470 
endurance it's really not to be that
expected<00:02:32.099> so<00:02:33.099> for<00:02:33.340> our<00:02:33.430> second<00:02:34.030> match<00:02:34.240> we'll

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
expected so for our second match we'll

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.160 
expected so for our second match we'll
be<00:02:34.569> moving<00:02:34.720> on

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170
