00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
division out with the fractured nature

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.100 
division out with the fractured nature
of<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.460> game<00:05:03.639> and<00:05:03.849> guys<00:05:03.969> like<00:05:04.180> Quillin<00:05:04.659> who<00:05:05.050> I

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
believe in even Daniel Jacobs who might

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.330 
believe in even Daniel Jacobs who might
be<00:05:07.060> as<00:05:07.150> mandatory<00:05:07.509> very<00:05:07.960> soon<00:05:08.259> hiding<00:05:09.190> behind

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
be as mandatory very soon hiding behind

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.369 
be as mandatory very soon hiding behind
the<00:05:09.639> Hal<00:05:09.819> Heyman<00:05:10.270> shield<00:05:10.539> he<00:05:10.719> may<00:05:10.840> never<00:05:11.139> get

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
the Hal Heyman shield he may never get

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:14.010 
the Hal Heyman shield he may never get
that<00:05:11.590> opportunity<00:05:11.650> in<00:05:12.639> Miguel<00:05:13.389> Cotto<00:05:13.750> who<00:05:13.990> I

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
that opportunity in Miguel Cotto who I

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.869 
that opportunity in Miguel Cotto who I
think<00:05:14.379> has<00:05:14.500> no<00:05:14.800> interest<00:05:15.250> in<00:05:15.370> fighting<00:05:15.580> him

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:15.879 
think has no interest in fighting him

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:17.820 
think has no interest in fighting him
but<00:05:16.449> he's<00:05:16.719> not<00:05:16.750> asking<00:05:17.259> for<00:05:17.289> ridiculous

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
but he's not asking for ridiculous

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.409 
but he's not asking for ridiculous
amounts<00:05:18.190> of<00:05:18.250> money<00:05:18.430> and<00:05:18.669> he's<00:05:18.819> staying<00:05:19.120> active

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
and by the way we've stood next to him

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.089 
and by the way we've stood next to him
by<00:05:22.210> today's<00:05:22.659> standards<00:05:23.139> he's<00:05:23.259> a<00:05:23.289> pretty<00:05:23.710> small
