00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
past this one can be driven upside down

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.660 
past this one can be driven upside down
when<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.410> flip<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.740> over<00:00:28.859> there's<00:00:29.340> another

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
when you flip it over there's another

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.880 
when you flip it over there's another
body<00:00:30.029> there<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.840> entire<00:00:30.960> vehicle<00:00:31.710> can

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
body there and the entire vehicle can

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.860 
body there and the entire vehicle can
still<00:00:32.250> run<00:00:32.520> that's<00:00:32.969> because<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.570> flat

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
still run that's because it's so flat

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.569 
still run that's because it's so flat
but<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.530> doesn't<00:00:34.829> always<00:00:34.950> have<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:35.399> that

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
but it doesn't always have to be that

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.270 
but it doesn't always have to be that
flat<00:00:35.820> check<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.809> out<00:00:37.020> now<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.040> full

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
flat check that out now it's a full

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.090 
flat check that out now it's a full
monster<00:00:38.700> truck<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.629> entire<00:00:39.960> vehicle<00:00:40.379> twists

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
monster truck the entire vehicle twists

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.360 
monster truck the entire vehicle twists
to<00:00:41.460> steer<00:00:41.820> at<00:00:42.030> both<00:00:42.629> ends<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.860> there<00:00:44.010> are<00:00:44.129> two

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
to steer at both ends and there are two

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.729 
to steer at both ends and there are two
levels<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.940> steering<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:46.170> quite<00:00:46.469> fully

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
levels of steering not quite fully

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.360 
levels of steering not quite fully
proportional<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:48.680> controller<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.980> really

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
proportional the controller is really

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.299 
proportional the controller is really
tough<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:51.270> has<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.629> bendable<00:00:52.230> antenna<00:00:52.680> so

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
tough it has this bendable antenna so

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.290 
tough it has this bendable antenna so
now<00:00:53.460> we're<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> break<00:00:53.940> off<00:00:56.030> this<00:00:57.030> button

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
now we're going to break off this button

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.389 
now we're going to break off this button
here<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.899> transform<00:00:58.379> between<00:00:58.620> flat<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
here is to transform between flat and

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.939 
here is to transform between flat and
monster<00:00:59.730> truck<00:00:59.940> modes<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> tri-band

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
monster truck modes and it is a tri-band

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.920 
monster truck modes and it is a tri-band
controller<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.210> run<00:01:03.390> up<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.629> three

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
controller so you can run up to three

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.929 
controller so you can run up to three
ricochets<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> same<00:01:04.949> place<00:01:05.220> even<00:01:05.489> if

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
ricochets in the same place even if

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.390 
ricochets in the same place even if
they're<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> same<00:01:06.270> color<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.530> charger<00:01:07.950> comes

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
they're the same color the charger comes

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.460 
they're the same color the charger comes
in<00:01:08.580> two<00:01:08.760> pieces<00:01:08.970> you're<00:01:09.750> gonna<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.320> look

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
in two pieces you're gonna have to look

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.649 
in two pieces you're gonna have to look
at<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.680> review<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.130> RC<00:01:11.460> mania<00:01:11.729> calm<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.540> what

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the second box does I can tell you this

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:28.020 
the second box does I can tell you this
it's<00:01:15.810> awesome

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.730 

the<00:01:29.030> Ricochet<00:01:29.479> has<00:01:29.689> pretty<00:01:29.990> decent<00:01:30.110> speed

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
the Ricochet has pretty decent speed

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.980 
the Ricochet has pretty decent speed
it's<00:01:31.280> not<00:01:31.460> too<00:01:31.729> great<00:01:32.000> but<00:01:32.479> not<00:01:32.600> too<00:01:32.720> slow

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
it's not too great but not too slow

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.340 
it's not too great but not too slow
either<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:34.460> has<00:01:34.640> plenty<00:01:34.850> of<00:01:35.060> power<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.079> large

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
either it has plenty of power and large

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.230 
either it has plenty of power and large
enough<00:01:36.619> tires<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:37.189> get<00:01:37.340> over<00:01:37.610> all<00:01:37.759> sorts<00:01:38.149> of

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
enough tires to get over all sorts of

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.389 
enough tires to get over all sorts of
bumps<00:01:38.630> in<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.780> road<00:01:39.049> can<00:01:39.770> actually<00:01:40.100> handle

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
bumps in the road can actually handle

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.700 
bumps in the road can actually handle
some<00:01:40.579> pretty<00:01:40.820> rough<00:01:41.060> terrain<00:01:41.470> rougher<00:01:42.470> than

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
some pretty rough terrain rougher than

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.399 
some pretty rough terrain rougher than
most<00:01:43.100> off-road<00:01:43.520> our<00:01:43.909> C's<00:01:44.179> can<00:01:44.509> today<00:01:44.869> at<00:01:45.259> least

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
most off-road our C's can today at least

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.370 
most off-road our C's can today at least
the<00:01:45.590> toy<00:01:45.740> class<00:01:46.009> ones

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.140 

the<00:01:51.380> one<00:01:51.530> bad<00:01:51.770> thing<00:01:51.800> is<00:01:52.220> that<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.520> tires<00:01:52.790> are

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
the one bad thing is that the tires are

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.340 
the one bad thing is that the tires are
really<00:01:53.780> hard

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
really hard

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.180 
really hard
they<00:01:55.070> are<00:01:55.280> rubber<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.240> are<00:01:56.360> filled<00:01:56.690> with<00:01:56.750> air

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
they are rubber and are filled with air

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.010 
they are rubber and are filled with air
but<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.340> compound<00:01:58.790> itself<00:01:59.180> is<00:01:59.450> kind<00:01:59.870> of

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
but the compound itself is kind of

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.650 
but the compound itself is kind of
plastic<00:02:00.470> and<00:02:01.400> as<00:02:01.550> a<00:02:01.580> result<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:02.150> doesn't<00:02:02.480> have

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
plastic and as a result it doesn't have

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.590 
plastic and as a result it doesn't have
a<00:02:02.690> whole<00:02:02.960> lot<00:02:03.170> of<00:02:03.200> traction<00:02:04.120> and<00:02:05.120> going<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.570> a

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
a whole lot of traction and going to a

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.720 
a whole lot of traction and going to a
turn<00:02:05.930> especially<00:02:06.410> with<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.040> way<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.520> this

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
turn especially with the way that this

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:30.980 
turn especially with the way that this
steers<00:02:08.590> oftentimes<00:02:09.590> you'll<00:02:10.010> spin<00:02:10.340> out

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.510 

if<00:02:31.990> you<00:02:32.170> don't<00:02:32.320> have<00:02:32.470> rough<00:02:32.770> stuff<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.280> drive

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
if you don't have rough stuff to drive

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.890 
if you don't have rough stuff to drive
in<00:02:33.730> that's<00:02:34.210> okay

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
in that's okay
