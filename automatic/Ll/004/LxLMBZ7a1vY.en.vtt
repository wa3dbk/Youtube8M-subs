00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 let's do the factoring of 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.340
 this binomial using the case called 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.920
 add cubes to start we must 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.230
 verify that the coefficients are 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.170
 perfect cubes is to say numbers that 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.570
 have exact cubic roots and that the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.619
 exponents of the letters are numbers 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.320
 divisible by 3 to start we take out 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.439
 cube root of each term 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.439
 out cubic root the first would give us 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.950
 the cube root of 27 would be 3 and the 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.190
 cubic root of x 3 would be x in this case 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.519
 the key is to divide the exponent by 3 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.050
 3 this video 3 gives us 1 for the 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:49.059
 next term we will also take out 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:52.900
 cubic root cubic root of 125 would be 5 and 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.780
 cubic root of ya 9 would be that at 3 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.180
 as we said the exponent is divided by 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.460
 three with these two elements we're going to 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.850
 build what is called the factor 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.399
 short and the long factor let's continue 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.789
 the next property the next 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.170
 model for a sum of cubes the model 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:16.840
 says so 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:20.740
 plus 20 xa square minus bird more than 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.350
 square the cubic root of that and the root 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.509
 cubic of this one is 20 with these two is 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.149
 then build the short factor that 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:31.360
 is a binomial and the long factor that is 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.700
 a trinomial let's see then 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.689
 the short factor in this case would be 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.640
 3x 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.970
 5 and 3 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.450
 with a plus sign because it is a 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.050
 sum of cubes and the long factor we're going to 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.119
 use a bracket to build it 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.220
 starting with the first squared that 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.910
 would then 3x all this raised to 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:04.070
 square follows signs minus this by 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:07.890
 this is 3x by 5 and 3 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:12.090
 plus the second squared 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.840
 that is to say 5 to 3 squared we closed the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.120
 square bracket 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.370
 and in the next step we are going to do the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.830
 development of operations that 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.770
 they were left 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.890
 inside the bracket then let's see here 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.390
 3x squared the exponent is 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.640
 distribute and we have 9 x squared 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:38.110
 minus the multiplication of 3x by 5 already 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:41.170
 the three gives us 15 x xi to 3 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.540
 more we develop this power the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.750
 square is distributed then we 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.530
 is 5 squared that is 25 and we 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.240
 are 3 squared it would and 6 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.110
 remember that when we have a 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.150
 power raised to another exponent 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.480
 we leave the same base and multiply 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.100
 the exponents is what happens here with 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.680
 get to 3 squared 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:13.640
 then in this way we have found 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.640
 the factorization of this sum of cubes
