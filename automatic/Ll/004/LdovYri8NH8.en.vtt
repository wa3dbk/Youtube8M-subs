make<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> hedgerow<00:00:26.990> but<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.109> one<00:00:28.260> right<00:00:28.439> here

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
make a hedgerow but this one right here

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.759 
make a hedgerow but this one right here
you<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:29.010> see<00:00:29.150> she<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.390> kept<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.779> growing<00:00:30.960> but

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
you can see she just kept on growing but

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.049 
you can see she just kept on growing but
this<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> great<00:00:32.279> big<00:00:32.430> old<00:00:32.610> made<00:00:32.790> up<00:00:32.910> layer

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
this is a great big old made up layer

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.360 
this is a great big old made up layer
right<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.620> looking<00:00:34.620> at<00:00:34.710> these<00:00:34.829> things<00:00:35.130> right

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
right here looking at these things right

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.940 
right here looking at these things right
now<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.850> think<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:37.079> time<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.410> start<00:00:37.649> doing<00:00:37.829> a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
now I think it's time to start doing a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.369 
now I think it's time to start doing a
little<00:00:37.980> bit<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.250> picking<00:00:38.960> they<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.140> filled

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
little bit of picking they have filled

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.930 
little bit of picking they have filled
out<00:00:40.590> very<00:00:40.890> well<00:00:40.950> down<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.550> those<00:00:41.700> first

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
out very well down to those first

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.020 
out very well down to those first
clusters<00:00:42.840> or<00:00:42.960> two<00:00:43.280> this<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.520> first<00:00:44.760> two

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
clusters or two this is the first two

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.630 
clusters or two this is the first two
dozen<00:00:45.420> plants<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.840> are<00:00:45.960> put<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.289> ground

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
dozen plants that are put it in ground

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.779 
dozen plants that are put it in ground
and<00:00:47.640> from<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.600> I've<00:00:48.719> seen<00:00:49.370> Rutgers<00:00:50.370> most<00:00:50.640> of

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and from what I've seen Rutgers most of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.850 
and from what I've seen Rutgers most of
the<00:00:50.850> time<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.300> first<00:00:51.539> couple<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.050> clusters<00:00:52.289> or

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the time the first couple of clusters or

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.619 
the time the first couple of clusters or
where<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> prettiest<00:00:53.820> tomatoes<00:00:54.329> are<00:00:54.480> going

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
exactly what kind of production I should

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.679 
exactly what kind of production I should
be<00:01:22.530> looking<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:23.040> maybe<00:01:23.340> 25<00:01:23.880> pounds<00:01:24.360> per<00:01:24.509> plant

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
be looking for maybe 25 pounds per plant

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.480 
be looking for maybe 25 pounds per plant
something<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.130> we'll<00:01:26.310> go

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
something like that but we'll go

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.910 
something like that but we'll go
conservative<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.360> call<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.900> 20<00:01:28.049> see<00:01:28.860> if

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
conservative and just call it 20 see if

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.090 
conservative and just call it 20 see if
we<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.159> get<00:01:29.310> about<00:01:29.729> 1100<00:01:30.420> pounds<00:01:30.570> or<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.100> out

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
we can get about 1100 pounds or so out

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.679 
we can get about 1100 pounds or so out
of<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.430> greenhouse<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.090> think<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.450> would<00:01:33.600> be

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
of this greenhouse I think that would be

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.590 
of this greenhouse I think that would be
pretty<00:01:33.930> good<00:01:34.140> I'd<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.770> happy<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.600> right

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
pretty good I'd be happy with that right

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.840 
pretty good I'd be happy with that right
now<00:01:36.630> what<00:01:37.049> I'm<00:01:37.170> going<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.350> do<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.920> see<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.759> can

now what I'm going to do is see if I can

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.760 
now what I'm going to do is see if I can

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
get a couple pounds off of each plant go

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.170 
get a couple pounds off of each plant go
ahead<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.070> pick<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> first<00:01:41.549> hundred<00:01:41.850> pounds

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
ahead and pick the first hundred pounds
