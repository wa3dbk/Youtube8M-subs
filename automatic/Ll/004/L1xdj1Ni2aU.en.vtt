example something you'd expect HP would
do<00:02:06.180> well<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.860> integrate<00:02:07.860> printing<00:02:08.399> into<00:02:09.300> all

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
do well is integrate printing into all

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.080 
do well is integrate printing into all
of<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.989> app<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.619> i<00:02:10.860> can<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.550> click<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:11.880> this

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.020 
printing icon here that will open up
this<00:02:15.110> convenient<00:02:16.110> printing<00:02:16.560> interface<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.880> i

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
this convenient printing interface and i

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.820 
this convenient printing interface and i
can<00:02:18.209> go<00:02:18.330> ahead<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.599> print<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.050> basically

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
can go ahead and print on basically

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.650 
can go ahead and print on basically
about<00:02:20.130> ninety<00:02:20.550> percent<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.180> connected

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
to be been that blast support so what's

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.400 
to be been that blast support so what's
great<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.519> I<00:03:17.639> can<00:03:17.819> navigate<00:03:18.030> through<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.750> we've

so another thing that really makes webos
unique<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:27.079> touchstone<00:03:28.079> charging<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:29.310> just

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
unique is touchstone charging so just

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.250 
unique is touchstone charging so just
keep<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.000> camera<00:03:30.389> there<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:30.750> you'll<00:03:30.870> see<00:03:31.079> the

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.620 
on the outside of this thing at all and
when<00:03:37.859> I<00:03:37.889> put<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.430> you'll<00:03:39.030> notice<00:03:39.299> the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
when I put it in you'll notice the

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.319 
when I put it in you'll notice the
charging<00:03:40.319> icon<00:03:40.739> up<00:03:40.980> in<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.430> upper<00:03:41.940> corner

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
charging icon up in the upper corner

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.809 
charging icon up in the upper corner
just<00:03:42.750> turned<00:03:42.989> on<00:03:43.200> here<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:44.519> I'm<00:03:44.639> actually

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
just turned on here so I'm actually

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.479 
just turned on here so I'm actually
charging<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.720> device<00:03:45.810> right<00:03:46.290> now<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.859> that's

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
charging the device right now and that's

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.140 
charging the device right now and that's
through<00:03:47.819> inductive<00:03:48.540> charging<00:03:49.500> technology

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
through inductive charging technology

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.250 
through inductive charging technology
that<00:03:51.150> really<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.720> unique<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.280> do<00:03:53.280> HP<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.870> to

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
that really is unique to do HP and to

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.309 
that really is unique to do HP and to
webos

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
webos

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.319 
webos
so<00:03:57.099> another<00:03:57.430> thing<00:03:57.549> that<00:03:57.849> we<00:03:57.939> can<00:03:58.060> do<00:03:58.209> is

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
so another thing that we can do is

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.910 
so another thing that we can do is
something<00:03:58.659> that<00:03:58.719> we<00:03:58.870> call<00:03:59.049> Exhibition<00:03:59.890> Mode

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
something that we call Exhibition Mode

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.879 
something that we call Exhibition Mode
so<00:04:00.819> while<00:04:01.060> I'm<00:04:01.299> in<00:04:01.480> here<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:02.019> I've<00:04:02.109> got<00:04:02.319> the

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
so while I'm in here and I've got the

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.129 
so while I'm in here and I've got the
device<00:04:03.700> on<00:04:03.909> the<00:04:04.030> touchstone<00:04:04.450> charging<00:04:04.810> dock

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
device on the touchstone charging dock

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:08.520 
device on the touchstone charging dock
we<00:04:06.099> can<00:04:06.310> load<00:04:06.579> an<00:04:06.909> application<00:04:07.599> that<00:04:07.840> only

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
we can load an application that only

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.739 
we can load an application that only
loads<00:04:08.920> when<00:04:09.219> I'm<00:04:09.310> in<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.519> dock<00:04:09.700> so<00:04:10.299> right<00:04:10.510> here

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:10.749 
loads when I'm in the dock so right here

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.379 
loads when I'm in the dock so right here
I<00:04:10.780> can<00:04:11.019> see<00:04:11.230> my<00:04:11.409> agenda<00:04:11.739> for<00:04:12.099> the<00:04:12.189> day<00:04:12.219> and<00:04:12.790> I

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
I can see my agenda for the day and I

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.379 
I can see my agenda for the day and I
could<00:04:13.569> switch<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:14.109> to<00:04:14.379> another<00:04:14.680> app<00:04:14.920> like

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
could switch that to another app like

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.930 
could switch that to another app like
like<00:04:16.389> our<00:04:16.570> nice<00:04:16.750> clock<00:04:17.199> that<00:04:17.500> we<00:04:17.650> have<00:04:17.940> so

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
like our nice clock that we have so

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.060 
like our nice clock that we have so
think<00:04:19.180> of<00:04:19.239> it<00:04:19.359> as<00:04:19.509> almost<00:04:19.720> like<00:04:20.079> a<00:04:20.109> half<00:04:20.799> of

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
think of it as almost like a half of

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.890 
think of it as almost like a half of
computing<00:04:21.729> model<00:04:21.880> when<00:04:22.360> you're<00:04:22.509> not<00:04:22.630> using

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
computing model when you're not using

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.350 
computing model when you're not using
the<00:04:23.169> device<00:04:23.410> actively<00:04:24.039> it<00:04:24.580> can<00:04:24.789> still<00:04:25.030> provide

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
the device actively it can still provide

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.140 
the device actively it can still provide
value<00:04:25.870> for<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.199> and<00:04:26.410> what's<00:04:27.220> more<00:04:27.310> they're

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
value for you and what's more they're

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.719 
value for you and what's more they're
charging<00:04:28.479> it<00:04:28.720> in<00:04:28.840> this<00:04:28.990> super<00:04:29.919> convenient<00:04:30.310> doc

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
charging it in this super convenient doc

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.909 
charging it in this super convenient doc
you<00:04:31.030> can<00:04:31.210> charge<00:04:31.449> it<00:04:31.570> in<00:04:31.750> either<00:04:31.960> orientation

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
you can charge it in either orientation

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.820 
you can charge it in either orientation
so<00:04:33.460> it<00:04:33.520> really<00:04:33.729> makes<00:04:33.820> a<00:04:34.180> great<00:04:34.530> or<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.590> really
