I<00:01:28.950> would<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:29.220> normally<00:01:29.430> do<00:01:29.759> absolutely<00:01:30.450> look

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
I would not normally do absolutely look

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.980 
I would not normally do absolutely look
it<00:01:30.720> up

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
it up

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.890 
it up
oh<00:01:31.350> absolutely<00:01:32.220> then<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.180> says<00:01:33.360> if<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.630> did

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
oh absolutely then it says if you did

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.020 
oh absolutely then it says if you did
this<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.110> sharper<00:01:34.710> cables<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.640> could<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
this with sharper cables it could be a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.240 
this with sharper cables it could be a
bad<00:01:36.360> day<00:01:36.780> now<00:01:37.049> imagine<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:37.710> you're<00:01:37.860> doing<00:01:38.040> that

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
bad day now imagine if you're doing that

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.950 
bad day now imagine if you're doing that
with<00:01:38.460> these<00:01:38.640> jumper<00:01:39.119> cables<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.720> said

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
with these jumper cables like you said

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.230 
with these jumper cables like you said
you've<00:01:40.439> got<00:01:40.619> not<00:01:40.860> only<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.130> Samaritan<00:01:41.790> you're

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
you've got not only a Samaritan you're

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.179 
you've got not only a Samaritan you're
in<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.420> high-pressure<00:01:42.899> situation<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:44.009> a

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
in a high-pressure situation it's a

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.889 
in a high-pressure situation it's a
little<00:01:44.369> bit<00:01:44.490> scary<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.000> could<00:01:45.360> damage<00:01:45.570> not

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
little bit scary you could damage not

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.080 
little bit scary you could damage not
only<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.320> car<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:47.070> yes<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.909> could<00:01:48.030> be

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
only the car but yes it could be

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.300 
only the car but yes it could be
dangerous<00:01:48.570> yourself<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.649> has<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> reverse

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
dangerous yourself so this has a reverse

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.420 
dangerous yourself so this has a reverse
polarity<00:01:50.820> warning<00:01:51.420> system<00:01:51.750> actually<00:01:52.430> only

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
polarity warning system actually only

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.740 
polarity warning system actually only
generates<00:01:53.820> enough<00:01:54.000> power<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.329> give<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
generates enough power to give you the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.770 
generates enough power to give you the
buzzer<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> red<00:01:55.770> light<00:01:56.070> does<00:01:56.759> not<00:01:57.180> hurt

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
buzzer and the red light does not hurt

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.749 
buzzer and the red light does not hurt
your<00:01:57.930> car<00:01:58.140> battery<00:01:58.350> absolutely<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.399> so

most Americans have under inflated tires
absolutely<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.010> you're<00:02:38.129> wasting<00:02:38.870> billions

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
absolutely and you're wasting billions

check<00:02:48.690> your<00:02:48.840> tire<00:02:48.989> pressure<00:02:49.109> will<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:49.829> it<00:02:50.010> but

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
check your tire pressure will do it but

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.330 
check your tire pressure will do it but
now<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.629> you<00:02:51.870> can't<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.379> having<00:02:53.069> a<00:02:53.129> tire
