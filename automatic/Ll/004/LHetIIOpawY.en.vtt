on the shirt the tie my only

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.119 
on the shirt the tie my only
disappointment<00:02:52.120> in<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.900> figure<00:02:53.290> is<00:02:53.530> just

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
disappointment in the figure is just

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.780 
disappointment in the figure is just
with<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.430> head<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:56.200> don't<00:02:56.799> say<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.489> wouldn't

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
with the head and I don't say I wouldn't

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.550 
with the head and I don't say I wouldn't
say<00:02:58.000> stay<00:02:58.420> away<00:02:58.450> from<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.989> figure<00:02:59.230> because<00:02:59.530> of

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
say stay away from the figure because of

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.750 
say stay away from the figure because of
that<00:02:59.709> because<00:02:59.889> I<00:02:59.980> think<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.310> might<00:03:00.489> just<00:03:00.519> be

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
that because I think it might just be

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.080 
that because I think it might just be
mine

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
mine

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.740 
mine
so<00:03:04.090> there<00:03:04.299> he<00:03:04.389> is

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
so there he is

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.210 
so there he is
I<00:03:05.040> also<00:03:06.040> like<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.459> fact<00:03:06.700> that<00:03:07.530> they<00:03:08.530> have<00:03:08.950> the

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
I also like the fact that they have the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.849 
I also like the fact that they have the
the<00:03:09.549> mask<00:03:10.030> not<00:03:10.510> come<00:03:10.840> all<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.139> way<00:03:11.170> back<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.530> it

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
the mask not come all the way back so it

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.619 
the mask not come all the way back so it
does<00:03:12.040> actually<00:03:12.250> look<00:03:12.459> like<00:03:12.819> a<00:03:12.849> mask<00:03:13.150> I've<00:03:13.420> seen

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
all the way to the back so I do like

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.460
