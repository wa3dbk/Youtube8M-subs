00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.580
 well this here I bring you in the 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.109
 next tutorial that is going to do 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.870
 a series of a 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.300
 of small introductions to the 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.510
 music software 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.900
 specifically towards the software that 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:24.000
 we can use the guitarists as 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:29.189
 tools of both study and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.189
 good composition let's start 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.420
 with the tutorial today that is about 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.449
 a very useful free tool for 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.489
 the guitarists are called your guitar 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.560
 here we are first we went to the menu 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.310
 start of windows 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.450
 let's go to your guitar 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.660
 we give you a click 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.870
 and there is open in principle the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.530
 interface marks some of the menus that 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.940
 we have here is how normal it is 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.950
 open save etcetera printed everything 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.530
 that we already know 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.990
 more familiar general in other programs 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.159
 like the word or things like that 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:20.200
 here we have the section of the score 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:23.979
 to be able to write music 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.260
 here we have the insertion of chords in 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.950
 the breeding area 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.300
 etcetera there are no adjustments in everything else 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.340
 good here for example in opening 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.040
 in file we can open 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:43.940
 new files the schedule of your appointments 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.220
 Supports edita pro formats 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.150
 here I will open one that I already have in the 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.930
 history of which we say sheet music 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.930
 that we have been working 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.590
 here we will have your hand then 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.240
 we give a click 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.240
 and the score appears 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.680
 now we reproduce the 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.680
 music 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.259
 and they start playing 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.820
 how can you see this repulsion not the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.820
 notes 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.780
 and good as long as we can use 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.780
 some 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.060
 Tools for 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.390
 for example show 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.080
 The mast 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.310
 of the guitar and it appears on the part of 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.650
 down 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:51.540
 look like the blue dots 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.540
 they are dialing fingering 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.000
 that is 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.700
 can help us a lot when it comes to 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.700
 be taking out a piece 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.310
 Can I have 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:16.820
 I have a moment set here this goes 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.730
 marking what fingering is now 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.440
 we have scale tools 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.860
 for example here in the master and assured 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.540
 this button that says scale opens this 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.459
 box 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.670
 and here we have different types of 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:35.359
 scales for example if yes you want 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.569
 study the scale of C major 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:41.959
 we have English encryption 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.639
 state and selected older than 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.609
 the 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:49.510
 and here he's going to put us on the mast 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.510
 positions 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.560
 the notes as they are distributed in 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.569
 our guitar 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.120
 and so on, not for example 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:03.340
 we now want to select network 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:07.750
 minor then selected d 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:11.819
 and then smaller scale shows it and there 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.629
 our new scale does not appear 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:20.100
 we have tools like a tuner 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:21.989
 guitar we have a good microphone 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.230
 here we can 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:29.670
 put the guitar and here he will score 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.840
 the note in tools we have 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.150
 transpose 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.150
 song explorer and so on 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.870
 etcetera etcetera the player we have 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.480
 a metronome 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.090
 It can also be very useful 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.020
 at the time of reproducing our piece it 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.020
 is going to listen to the metronome 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:55.259
 There we are going to an audience pac pac pac 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.259
 tac tac tac 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.420
 another thing that can be very useful is a 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:09.270
 composition and here for example we can 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:12.510
 we have what is this the time signature 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.900
 that is let's say the compass that 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.510
 we are working we have the time or 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.170
 Time to change the key you give me 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.990
 armor this repeating squares 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.820
 etcetera not for example here in code in 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.390
 the time I forgive 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:36.100
 up to 144 we can download it to study 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:39.090
 the slowest we will not put bleach 80 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.090
 more human 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.830
 a speed comfortable as selection 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.350
 to apply to all the bars we give 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.720
 to accept and the reproduction would have to 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.470
 be slower 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.470
 there they are 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:05.629
 and here we continue with our fingering 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.629
 in this part is the mouse 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.060
 very well 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.060
 we have 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.110
 good another tool that is show in 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.460
 the piano 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.490
 also for the people who are 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:25.350
 studying piano keyboard can be a 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.350
 useful tool also in your visit 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:32.210
 shows the footsteps of the keys or the 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.210
 positions of the keys 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.060
 and good you 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.370
 in question is this 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.530
 general is a tool then 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.220
 pretty useful for us the 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.220
 guitarists 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.410
 we saw a little bit an introduction to this 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:53.139
 clear program that has many things 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.409
 more than giving but at least the 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:58.830
 basic tools 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:01.529
 we just showed them and well then 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:04.060
 then antler 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:07.449
 until next time 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:11.529
 until the next tutorial 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:15.029
 we will be here little by little going up more 

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:15.029
 about musical tools
