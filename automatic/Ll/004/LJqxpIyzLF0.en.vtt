00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
pictures to the after pictures I thought

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.799 
pictures to the after pictures I thought
there<00:00:44.850> was<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> huge<00:00:45.300> difference<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.780> my

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809

difference<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.590> my<00:00:46.680> eyelashes<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.460> guess

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
difference in my eyelashes but I guess

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.250

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
you guys were so focused on my wrinkles

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.510 
you guys were so focused on my wrinkles
that<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.829> didn't<00:00:50.039> even<00:00:50.129> look<00:00:50.309> at<00:00:50.399> my

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520

the product like I said I got the free

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.389 
the product like I said I got the free
sample<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.180> started<00:02:06.630> using<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.399> within

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
sample and I started using it and within

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.080 
sample and I started using it and within
the<00:02:08.849> first<00:02:09.179> couple<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.660> weeks<00:02:09.929> my<00:02:10.670> eyelids

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
the first couple of weeks my eyelids

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.440 
the first couple of weeks my eyelids
were<00:02:12.650> feeling<00:02:13.650> funky<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.340> didn't<00:02:14.849> really<00:02:15.120> like

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
were feeling funky I didn't really like

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.400 
were feeling funky I didn't really like
the<00:02:15.629> feeling<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.290> think<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.920> was<00:02:17.040> because<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the feeling I think it was because the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.869 
the feeling I think it was because the
lashes<00:02:19.410> were<00:02:19.530> starting<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.980> grow<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.610> maybe

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
lashes were starting to grow and maybe

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.540 
lashes were starting to grow and maybe
the<00:02:21.209> hairs<00:02:21.450> were<00:02:21.690> thicker<00:02:22.200> or<00:02:22.620> something<00:02:23.310> but

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
the hairs were thicker or something but

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.690 
the hairs were thicker or something but
where<00:02:24.510> they<00:02:24.660> attach<00:02:25.019> right<00:02:25.470> into<00:02:25.800> my<00:02:26.220> eyelids

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
where they attach right into my eyelids

uncomfortable so but like I said that is

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.690 
uncomfortable so but like I said that is
over<00:03:28.620> now<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:28.769> haven't<00:03:29.099> really<00:03:29.340> had<00:03:29.519> that

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
over now I haven't really had that

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.250 
over now I haven't really had that
uncomfortableness<00:03:30.329> for<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.720> last<00:03:30.900> couple<00:03:31.230> of

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
uncomfortableness for the last couple of

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.710 
uncomfortableness for the last couple of
weeks<00:03:31.319> which<00:03:31.799> is<00:03:32.090> great<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.329> that's<00:03:33.480> what

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
weeks which is great so that's what

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.970 
weeks which is great so that's what
makes<00:03:33.870> me<00:03:34.019> think<00:03:34.049> like<00:03:34.380> oh<00:03:34.530> maybe<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:34.889> should

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
makes me think like oh maybe I should

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.910 
makes me think like oh maybe I should
keep<00:03:35.310> using<00:03:35.549> it<00:03:35.730> because<00:03:35.849> I<00:03:36.180> do<00:03:36.590> really<00:03:37.590> like

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
keep using it because I do really like

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.030 
keep using it because I do really like
the<00:03:37.980> results<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:38.819> I<00:03:39.720> guess<00:03:40.139> that's<00:03:40.290> my<00:03:40.470> cue

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
the results and I guess that's my cue

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.680 
the results and I guess that's my cue
to<00:03:41.220> stop<00:03:41.430> fiddling<00:03:41.910> with<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.180> little<00:03:42.419> brush

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
to stop fiddling with the little brush

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.069 
to stop fiddling with the little brush
and<00:03:43.880> bring<00:03:44.880> in<00:03:45.180> my<00:03:45.419> before<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:45.900> after

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
and bring in my before and after

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.530 
and bring in my before and after
pictures<00:03:46.650> now<00:03:47.069> I<00:03:47.489> think<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.359> they<00:03:48.510> are

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
pictures now I think that they are

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.809 
pictures now I think that they are
substantially<00:03:49.430> longer<00:03:50.430> than<00:03:50.639> they<00:03:50.760> were

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
substantially longer than they were

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.059 
substantially longer than they were
before<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:51.930> can<00:03:52.109> see<00:03:52.349> that<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.919> know<00:03:53.040> I

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069

there was a ton of more thickness

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.320 
there was a ton of more thickness
I<00:04:20.680> feel<00:04:21.280> like<00:04:21.430> with<00:04:21.579> this<00:04:21.730> it's<00:04:21.970> more<00:04:22.150> the

I feel like with this it's more the

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.240 
I feel like with this it's more the
length<00:04:22.600> that<00:04:22.840> was<00:04:22.990> improved<00:04:23.410> not<00:04:23.740> as<00:04:23.920> much<00:04:24.100> the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
length that was improved not as much the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.920 
length that was improved not as much the
thickness<00:04:24.610> but<00:04:24.790> looking<00:04:25.270> at<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.420> pictures<00:04:25.690> it

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
thickness but looking at the pictures it

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.690 
thickness but looking at the pictures it
may<00:04:26.350> tell<00:04:26.560> a<00:04:26.590> different<00:04:26.950> story<00:04:26.980> if<00:04:27.430> you<00:04:27.550> see

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
may tell a different story if you see

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.920 
may tell a different story if you see
something<00:04:28.030> different<00:04:28.150> that's<00:04:28.900> fine<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:30.310> you

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
something different that's fine so you

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.580 
something different that's fine so you
know<00:04:31.930> all<00:04:32.140> in<00:04:32.290> all<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.710> has<00:04:33.310> not<00:04:33.520> been<00:04:33.850> a

of it I can't and so I think I'd like to

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.400 
of it I can't and so I think I'd like to
try<00:05:36.669> those<00:05:36.910> and<00:05:37.210> especially<00:05:37.780> where<00:05:38.080> my<00:05:38.200> lashes

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
try those and especially where my lashes

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.500 
try those and especially where my lashes
are<00:05:38.800> longer<00:05:39.700> I'd<00:05:39.850> like<00:05:39.970> to<00:05:40.060> try<00:05:40.240> them<00:05:40.390> like

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
are longer I'd like to try them like

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.350 
are longer I'd like to try them like
right<00:05:40.750> away<00:05:40.900> to<00:05:41.050> see<00:05:41.380> if<00:05:41.500> it<00:05:41.710> but<00:05:42.220> I<00:05:42.430> could<00:05:43.120> just

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
right away to see if it but I could just

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.240 
right away to see if it but I could just
maintain<00:05:43.540> this<00:05:44.050> length<00:05:44.620> would<00:05:44.830> get<00:05:44.950> a<00:05:44.979> little

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
maintain this length would get a little

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.630 
maintain this length would get a little
more<00:05:45.400> thickness<00:05:46.860> this<00:05:47.860> is<00:05:48.040> a<00:05:48.070> tiny<00:05:48.340> thing

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
more thickness this is a tiny thing

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.640 
more thickness this is a tiny thing
three<00:05:48.970> milliliters<00:05:49.300> it<00:05:49.750> lasted<00:05:50.169> me<00:05:50.290> a<00:05:50.320> full

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
three milliliters it lasted me a full

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.830 
three milliliters it lasted me a full
three<00:05:50.950> months<00:05:51.100> being<00:05:51.729> a<00:05:51.760> contact<00:05:52.240> lens<00:05:52.510> where

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
three months being a contact lens where

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.140 
three months being a contact lens where
you<00:05:53.500> can't<00:05:53.830> really<00:05:54.130> put<00:05:54.490> it<00:05:54.520> on<00:05:54.700> when<00:05:54.880> you<00:05:55.000> have

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
you can't really put it on when you have

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.490 
you can't really put it on when you have
your<00:05:55.270> lenses<00:05:55.600> in<00:05:55.780> so<00:05:55.930> you<00:05:55.990> have<00:05:56.080> to<00:05:56.169> wait<00:05:56.350> to

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
your lenses in so you have to wait to

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.890 
your lenses in so you have to wait to
take<00:05:56.650> them<00:05:56.770> off<00:05:56.919> so<00:05:57.550> in<00:05:57.790> order<00:05:57.970> to<00:05:58.090> see<00:05:58.570> where<00:05:58.870> I

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
take them off so in order to see where I

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.420 
take them off so in order to see where I
was<00:05:59.140> dropping<00:05:59.410> that<00:05:59.650> little<00:05:59.890> thing<00:06:00.070> I<00:06:00.250> did

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
was dropping that little thing I did

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.610 
was dropping that little thing I did
have<00:06:00.580> to<00:06:00.669> put<00:06:00.790> my<00:06:00.880> glasses<00:06:01.180> on<00:06:01.479> and<00:06:01.780> these

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
have to put my glasses on and these

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.140 
have to put my glasses on and these
brushes<00:06:02.860> are<00:06:03.220> so<00:06:03.430> weird<00:06:03.729> they're<00:06:03.880> like

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
brushes are so weird they're like

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.350 
brushes are so weird they're like
plasticy<00:06:04.930> and<00:06:05.229> half<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:06.010> time<00:06:06.220> the<00:06:06.700> one<00:06:07.120> drop

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
plasticy and half the time the one drop

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.120 
plasticy and half the time the one drop
of<00:06:07.390> solution<00:06:08.020> would<00:06:08.200> fall<00:06:08.500> off<00:06:08.530> the<00:06:08.919> side<00:06:09.100> of

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
of solution would fall off the side of

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.460 
of solution would fall off the side of
the<00:06:09.280> brush<00:06:09.490> I'd<00:06:10.180> have<00:06:10.330> to<00:06:10.419> put<00:06:10.600> on<00:06:10.690> another<00:06:10.960> so

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
the brush I'd have to put on another so

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.900 
the brush I'd have to put on another so
it's<00:06:11.620> a<00:06:11.710> little<00:06:11.890> bit<00:06:12.070> wasteful<00:06:12.490> with<00:06:12.729> these

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
it's a little bit wasteful with these

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.120 
it's a little bit wasteful with these
brushes<00:06:13.150> from<00:06:13.510> that<00:06:13.840> standpoint<00:06:14.229> I<00:06:14.620> think<00:06:14.950> the

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
brushes from that standpoint I think the

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.950 
brushes from that standpoint I think the
one<00:06:15.340> that<00:06:15.430> I'm<00:06:15.550> talking<00:06:15.729> about<00:06:15.880> rapid<00:06:16.479> lash<00:06:16.660> is

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
one that I'm talking about rapid lash is

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.520 
one that I'm talking about rapid lash is
just<00:06:17.500> has<00:06:18.190> a<00:06:18.220> brush<00:06:18.580> inside<00:06:19.240> the<00:06:19.900> vial<00:06:20.169> and<00:06:20.410> you

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
just has a brush inside the vial and you

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.530 
just has a brush inside the vial and you
just<00:06:20.680> pull<00:06:20.860> it<00:06:20.890> out<00:06:21.070> and<00:06:21.940> you're<00:06:22.090> done<00:06:22.270> in<00:06:22.390> two

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
just pull it out and you're done in two

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.960 
just pull it out and you're done in two
seconds<00:06:22.930> this<00:06:23.470> takes<00:06:23.770> me<00:06:23.979> more<00:06:24.160> like<00:06:24.400> probably

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
seconds this takes me more like probably

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.350 
seconds this takes me more like probably
a<00:06:25.510> minute<00:06:26.350> to<00:06:26.530> apply<00:06:26.830> which<00:06:27.340> isn't<00:06:27.640> long<00:06:27.850> it's

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
a minute to apply which isn't long it's

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.000 
a minute to apply which isn't long it's
not<00:06:28.450> a<00:06:28.599> big<00:06:28.840> inconvenience<00:06:29.110> but<00:06:29.620> I<00:06:29.680> got<00:06:29.830> to<00:06:29.919> say

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
not a big inconvenience but I got to say

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.249 
not a big inconvenience but I got to say
when<00:06:30.160> I'm<00:06:30.280> really

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
when I'm really

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.040 
when I'm really
I<00:06:31.289> would<00:06:32.100> either<00:06:32.190> forget<00:06:32.610> to<00:06:32.789> do<00:06:32.940> it<00:06:32.970> or<00:06:33.479> I

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
I would either forget to do it or I

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.050 
I would either forget to do it or I
would<00:06:34.380> just<00:06:34.530> be<00:06:34.650> like<00:06:34.680> I<00:06:35.250> don't<00:06:35.520> feel<00:06:35.699> like<00:06:35.910> it

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
would just be like I don't feel like it

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.029 
would just be like I don't feel like it
tonight<00:06:36.180> and<00:06:36.539> not<00:06:36.720> do<00:06:36.990> it<00:06:37.020> especially<00:06:37.889> where

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
tonight and not do it especially where

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.249 
tonight and not do it especially where
the<00:06:38.220> results<00:06:38.729> were<00:06:38.850> so<00:06:39.030> long<00:06:39.210> in<00:06:39.330> the<00:06:39.419> incoming

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 
the results were so long in the incoming

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:42.050 
the results were so long in the incoming
I<00:06:40.289> actually<00:06:40.620> took<00:06:40.919> results<00:06:41.310> pictures<00:06:41.639> after

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
I actually took results pictures after

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.240 
I actually took results pictures after
one<00:06:42.330> month<00:06:42.509> and<00:06:42.840> after<00:06:43.080> two<00:06:43.410> months<00:06:43.770> and<00:06:44.069> I<00:06:44.160> was

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
one month and after two months and I was

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.219 
one month and after two months and I was
like<00:06:44.400> this<00:06:44.550> stuff<00:06:44.759> doesn't<00:06:44.970> even<00:06:45.210> work<00:06:45.449> do<00:06:46.080> you

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:46.229 
like this stuff doesn't even work do you

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:47.659 
like this stuff doesn't even work do you
have<00:06:46.349> any<00:06:46.530> my<00:06:46.800> lashes<00:06:47.009> weren't<00:06:47.340> even<00:06:47.520> any

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
have any my lashes weren't even any

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:49.820 
have any my lashes weren't even any
longer<00:06:48.150> but<00:06:48.660> then<00:06:48.840> suddenly<00:06:49.080> at<00:06:49.380> three<00:06:49.650> months

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
longer but then suddenly at three months

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.719 
longer but then suddenly at three months
Wow

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729 
Wow

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:54.200 
Wow
there<00:06:50.849> they<00:06:51.030> were<00:06:51.090> so<00:06:51.949> so<00:06:52.949> yeah<00:06:53.160> it<00:06:53.460> does<00:06:53.880> work

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
there they were so so yeah it does work

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.270 
there they were so so yeah it does work
but<00:06:54.750> it<00:06:54.900> does<00:06:55.080> take<00:06:55.319> a<00:06:55.349> little<00:06:55.530> bit<00:06:55.620> of<00:06:55.800> time<00:06:55.979> of

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
but it does take a little bit of time of

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.999 
but it does take a little bit of time of
course<00:06:56.520> as<00:06:56.789> with<00:06:57.210> everything<00:06:57.419> else<00:06:57.889> am<00:06:58.889> I

00:06:58.999 --> 00:06:59.009 
course as with everything else am I

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:00.950 
course as with everything else am I
going<00:06:59.130> to<00:06:59.220> keep<00:06:59.340> using<00:06:59.580> it<00:06:59.699> probably<00:07:00.599> not<00:07:00.780> I

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
going to keep using it probably not I

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.779 
going to keep using it probably not I
didn't<00:07:01.259> really<00:07:01.349> enjoy<00:07:01.560> that<00:07:01.860> irritation<00:07:02.310> I

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:02.789 
didn't really enjoy that irritation I

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:03.770 
didn't really enjoy that irritation I
don't<00:07:03.150> want<00:07:03.300> to<00:07:03.360> pay<00:07:03.449> for<00:07:03.479> another

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:03.780 
don't want to pay for another

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.550 
don't want to pay for another
prescription

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
prescription

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.920 
prescription
I<00:07:04.860> think<00:07:05.280> it's<00:07:05.430> expensive<00:07:05.820> and<00:07:06.539> there<00:07:06.720> are<00:07:06.900> a

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
I think it's expensive and there are a

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.320 
I think it's expensive and there are a
couple<00:07:06.990> other<00:07:07.349> products<00:07:08.310> that<00:07:08.340> I<00:07:08.669> want<00:07:08.699> to<00:07:09.120> try
