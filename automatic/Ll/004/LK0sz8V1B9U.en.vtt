because we are friends so we decided to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.279 
because we are friends so we decided to
make<00:00:26.250> its<00:00:26.460> one<00:00:26.760> community<00:00:27.300> instead<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.050> having

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
make its one community instead of having

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.169 
make its one community instead of having
just<00:00:28.680> two<00:00:28.859> separate<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.429> split<00:00:29.640> communities

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179

first of all you see a scoreboard with
all<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> members<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.879> our<00:02:09.149> server<00:02:09.479> here<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
all the members of our server here the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.610 
all the members of our server here the
heads<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.349> them<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
heads of them and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.180 
heads of them and
there<00:02:13.620> are<00:02:13.770> teleports<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:15.770> also<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.800> creative

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
there are teleports to also a creative

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.280 
there are teleports to also a creative
plot<00:02:17.580> world<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.030> difference<00:02:18.390> between<00:02:18.600> cue

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
plot world the difference between cue

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.380 
plot world the difference between cue
pants<00:02:19.470> Espada<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.640> plots<00:02:21.180> are

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
pants Espada this is that the plots are

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.470 
pants Espada this is that the plots are
way<00:02:21.630> smaller<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:23.010> people<00:02:23.970> are<00:02:24.060> building<00:02:24.180> stuff

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
way smaller so people are building stuff

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.000 
way smaller so people are building stuff
really<00:02:24.780> close<00:02:24.990> together<00:02:25.290> which<00:02:25.470> makes<00:02:25.709> it

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
really close together which makes it

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.130 
really close together which makes it
gives<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.520> pretty<00:02:26.730> dense<00:02:26.940> look<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.540> pretty

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
gives it a pretty dense look and pretty

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.480 
gives it a pretty dense look and pretty
interesting<00:02:28.560> but<00:02:28.680> if<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:28.890> need<00:02:29.040> more<00:02:29.220> space

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
interesting but if you need more space

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.860 
interesting but if you need more space
you<00:02:29.700> should<00:02:29.730> obviously<00:02:30.060> go<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.750> other

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
you should obviously go to the other

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.380 
you should obviously go to the other
plots<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.380> also<00:02:32.280> people<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.820> lot<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.120> people

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
plots and also people a lot of people

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.270 
plots and also people a lot of people
have<00:02:33.570> been<00:02:33.720> building<00:02:34.170> houses<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.860> just

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
have been building houses and just

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.949 
have been building houses and just
aesthetically<00:02:35.970> pleasing<00:02:36.030> builds<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.810> not

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
aesthetically pleasing builds and not

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.920 
aesthetically pleasing builds and not
only<00:02:37.140> redstone<00:02:37.709> creations<00:02:37.830> here<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:39.230> on

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
only redstone creations here and on

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.820 
only redstone creations here and on
let's<00:02:44.600> over<00:02:45.600> here<00:02:45.840> there's<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.290> survival<00:02:46.709> how

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
let's over here there's a survival how

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.790 
let's over here there's a survival how
many<00:02:47.070> worlds<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.520> this<00:02:47.700> world<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.470> well<00:02:49.470> we

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
many worlds so this world is well we

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.710 
many worlds so this world is well we
pretty<00:02:50.070> much<00:02:50.130> try<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.820> keep<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.209> as<00:02:51.330> vanilla<00:02:51.600> as

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
pretty much try to keep it as vanilla as

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.949 
pretty much try to keep it as vanilla as
possible<00:02:52.200> there's<00:02:52.410> just<00:02:52.920> some<00:02:53.100> plug-in<00:02:53.340> which

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
possible there's just some plug-in which

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.080 
possible there's just some plug-in which
