 the AC adapter then I specify I 

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:44.719
 bought him in England the wall so 

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:46.520
 it's not in French at all 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.499

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:52.639
 yves a french adapter good you there there 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.579
 is really not compatible with the 

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:57.859
 French network in short I linger we go 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.130
 to devote more to the iphone 5 is 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:08.289

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.510
 then a protective film that is 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:22.040

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.200
 did not change the room of the iphone 5 1 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.280
 I always specify the same, so on 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.410
 sides we will find the buttons of 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.920
