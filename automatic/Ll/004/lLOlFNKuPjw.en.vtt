00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.200
 the last guardian rumored for years 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.420
 rumored for months rumored by the 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.969
 last weeks for the last few days the 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.460
 last hours and the last minutes and 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.640
 final are and during your conference what 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.880
 reveals is official is 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.449
 undeniably official we will have the 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.239
 change for 2016 if it is not 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.880
 delay again a possibility of 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:34.340
 made very big because of let's say the 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.489
 experience that we have had with this 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.190
 chaotic title however apparently 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.050
 now it looks very, very safe, you can see 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.820
 more worked it is seen that the project of 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.460
 fact is in very good hands the 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.640
 project is working in a 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.300
 nice and it shows us gameplay it 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.470
 finally shows us footage 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.230
 very very polished that I can say of what 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.290
 we saw in regards to guards fabrics in 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.340
 our conference before anything much 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.140
 love 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:11.010
 I know a lot of feeling 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.229
 much at stake in all this is undeniable 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.810
 that this title feels a lot like 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.080
 shadow of the colossus or ico by obvious 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.880
 reasons is not part of I would not say the line 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.740
 chronological as such because there's even 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.240
 people who are still fighting today 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.970
 keiko days of the colossus are not 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.600
 connected despite the fact that many 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.600
 many references 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.780
 but what is the concept what is the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.640
 line of design the line of mechanics the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.270
 line of the gameplay the line of what 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.300
 it would simply be the idea by which 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.880
 all these these games are related 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.430
 is there 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.430
 in general it is present in all 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.090
 I really like what I saw is of those 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.780
 few very few gameplays that 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.479
 showed in this of 3 where there are 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.000
 a lot of programming but you do not feel 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.710
 so 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.670
 artificial in fact I would dare to say 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.440
 that only this two or three games more 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.770
 I know I even think that one or two nothing else 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.510
 it feels very organic feels a lot 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.879
 much the force with which 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.849
 the player is present in the story 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.270
 is present in what is happening is 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.610
 as 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.250
 I do not know how to explain it like that with 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.020
 exact words but you can feel 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.390
 it can feel very real you can feel 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.340
 the weight and that's something that I love 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.910
 can feel the weight of the character in 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.140
 this world in this setting and in 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.480
 as to what the story would be 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.980
 also we have not revealed much 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.180
 most people have theories 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.830
 nor gost is one of those that the most 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.080
 theorize 2 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.520
 of recent times there is danger there 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.530
 something that many people have 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.750
 I've been talking and that could be the 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.400
 duke nukem forever phenomenon that 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.390
 maybe the hype there is or is all the hype 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.660
 do not 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.569
 achieve or reach the people of what is 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.250
 this game really or maybe the game 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.580
 just do not live up to expectations 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.940
 of all this that has been worked on 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.130
 about jaime 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.820
 but I dare say that at least 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:28.990
 that was shown is an excellent start is 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.700
 an excellent path that we must 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.980
 continue and there is nothing left to wait for 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.720
 just be able to have it in your hands and 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.410
 can prove it 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.650
 As for the gameplay, I like it 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.540
 because everything feels very soft decent 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.030
 I had said it before then 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.530
 there are so many possibilities that it is 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.840
 what can be done and now with these 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.980
 two characters what would be our 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.890
 human protagonist in our 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:58.230
 protagonist 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:01.230
 said cat dog bird I do not know are very 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.940
 large do not know what the 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.890
 each other's skills we do not know until 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.490
 where possibilities can come what 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.470
 which is a good thing 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.620
 nothing has been revealed to us 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.410
 we just have something visual and a 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.430
 bit of gameplay that promises a lot and 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.259
 that I personally liked a lot 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.259
 I really do not have more to say 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.240
 honestly that what I liked a lot and 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.600
 you have to be prepared for it again 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.970
 immerse ourselves in this world again 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.400
 immerse ourselves in all this atmosphere this 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.160
 incredible atmosphere that this kind of 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.660
 wheels has brought us and you have to 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.650
 prepare to cry 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:44.009
 we have to prepare to help a lot 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.060
 because I'm sure it's very safe today 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.970
 what 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.620
 the end is not going to be very nice 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.740
 but the tour is the most important 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.650
 gentlemen so from the guards to me 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.889
 the strongest sony card for this one 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.889
