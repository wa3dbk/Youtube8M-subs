the same reasons that I hated it number

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.429 
the same reasons that I hated it number
nine<00:02:36.000> when<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.329> book<00:02:36.599> references<00:02:37.170> something

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
nine when a book references something

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.890 
nine when a book references something
that<00:02:37.769> feels<00:02:38.010> very<00:02:38.159> specific<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.329> you<00:02:39.540> an

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
that feels very specific to you an

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.259 
that feels very specific to you an
example<00:02:40.439> I<00:02:40.799> thought<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.159> this<00:02:41.310> was<00:02:41.609> trout

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
example I thought of this was trout

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.420 
example I thought of this was trout
fishing<00:02:42.569> in<00:02:42.900> America<00:02:43.439> which<00:02:43.650> references<00:02:44.219> my

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
fishing in America which references my

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.240 
fishing in America which references my
hometown<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.090> Tacoma<00:02:45.750> Washington<00:02:46.049> in<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:47.219> very

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
hometown of Tacoma Washington in a very

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.879 
hometown of Tacoma Washington in a very
weird<00:02:47.849> scene<00:02:48.209> but<00:02:48.569> somehow<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:49.260> just<00:02:49.290> feels

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
weird scene but somehow it just feels

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.330 
weird scene but somehow it just feels
very<00:02:50.040> right<00:02:50.699> and<00:02:50.969> I<00:02:51.510> felt<00:02:51.810> like<00:02:52.049> hey<00:02:52.709> somebody

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
very right and I felt like hey somebody

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.729 
very right and I felt like hey somebody
knows<00:02:53.639> where<00:02:53.909> Tacoma<00:02:54.299> is<00:02:54.599> number<00:02:55.199> 10<00:02:55.439> when<00:02:55.709> a

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
knows where Tacoma is number 10 when a

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.069 
knows where Tacoma is number 10 when a
book<00:02:56.010> makes<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.430> feel<00:02:56.699> less<00:02:57.090> alone<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.810> so

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
book makes you feel less alone and so

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.839 
book makes you feel less alone and so
many<00:02:58.379> books<00:02:58.620> have<00:02:58.829> done<00:02:59.069> that<00:02:59.189> for<00:02:59.430> me<00:02:59.549> but<00:02:59.730> the

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
many books have done that for me but the

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.490 
many books have done that for me but the
first<00:03:00.090> one<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.299> came<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.629> mind<00:03:01.019> was<00:03:01.230> notes

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
first one that came to mind was notes

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.920 
first one that came to mind was notes
from<00:03:01.709> underground<00:03:01.859> which<00:03:02.849> just<00:03:03.150> captured<00:03:03.659> so

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
from underground which just captured so

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.020 
from underground which just captured so
many<00:03:04.199> feelings<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:05.069> I<00:03:05.129> thought<00:03:05.489> were<00:03:05.730> just

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
many feelings that I thought were just

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.149 
many feelings that I thought were just
my<00:03:06.180> own<00:03:06.389> number<00:03:06.930> eleven<00:03:07.349> when<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.590> book<00:03:07.919> is

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
my own number eleven when a book is

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.000 
my own number eleven when a book is
really<00:03:08.519> hard<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.209> read<00:03:09.659> and<00:03:09.959> understand<00:03:10.680> but

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
really hard to read and understand but

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.789 
really hard to read and understand but
is<00:03:11.159> therefore<00:03:11.730> very<00:03:12.030> rewarding<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.620> book

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
is therefore very rewarding and the book

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.679 
is therefore very rewarding and the book
that<00:03:13.980> came<00:03:14.129> to<00:03:14.370> mind<00:03:14.579> was<00:03:14.909> the<00:03:15.150> sound<00:03:15.389> in<00:03:15.569> the

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689
