noticed and my husband also noticed that

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.630 
noticed and my husband also noticed that
it<00:00:15.420> seemed<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.780> be<00:00:15.929> not<00:00:16.529> flimsy<00:00:17.100> but<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.430> didn't

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
it seemed to be not flimsy but it didn't

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.000 
it seemed to be not flimsy but it didn't
seem<00:00:17.760> like<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:17.940> had<00:00:18.119> enough<00:00:18.210> protection<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.439> it

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
seem like I had enough protection and it

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.109 
seem like I had enough protection and it
didn't<00:00:20.279> seem<00:00:20.369> like<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.550> was<00:00:20.699> very<00:00:20.789> well

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
didn't seem like it was very well

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.330 
didn't seem like it was very well
supported<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.350> ended<00:00:22.560> up<00:00:22.680> getting<00:00:22.859> this

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
supported so we ended up getting this

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.849 
supported so we ended up getting this
one<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> Beco<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.869> was<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> little<00:00:25.529> bit<00:00:25.680> more

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
one in the Beco it was a little bit more

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.400 
one in the Beco it was a little bit more
money<00:00:26.039> but<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.880> think<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.300> was<00:00:27.390> worth<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.750> so

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
money but we think it was worth it so

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.380 
money but we think it was worth it so
