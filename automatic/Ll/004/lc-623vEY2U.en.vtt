hi guys the cargo drew today is the king
of<00:00:03.240> swords<00:00:03.600> and<00:00:04.049> this<00:00:04.830> car<00:00:05.069> got<00:00:05.279> me<00:00:05.400> thinking

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
of swords and this car got me thinking

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.070 
of swords and this car got me thinking
about<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.029> power<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.569> mind

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
about the power of the mind

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.410 
about the power of the mind
now<00:00:07.890> obviously<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.309> power<00:00:08.460> of<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.880> mind<00:00:09.090> can

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
now obviously the power of the mind can

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.140 
now obviously the power of the mind can
either<00:00:09.599> be<00:00:09.840> positive<00:00:10.410> or<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.920> negative<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.639> we

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
either be positive or a negative and we

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.720 
either be positive or a negative and we
have<00:00:12.480> huge<00:00:12.960> power<00:00:13.259> over<00:00:13.799> ourselves<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.460> over

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
have huge power over ourselves on over

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.779 
have huge power over ourselves on over
other<00:00:14.880> other<00:00:15.299> people<00:00:16.039> depending<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.220> what<00:00:17.640> we

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
other other people depending on what we

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.090 
other other people depending on what we
how<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.090> choose<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.510> use<00:00:18.840> our<00:00:19.020> mind<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.920> what

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
how we choose to use our mind and what

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.580 
how we choose to use our mind and what
we<00:00:20.189> choose<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.550> focus<00:00:20.760> on<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.900> what<00:00:22.050> patterns

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
we choose to focus on and what patterns

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.580 
we choose to focus on and what patterns
we<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.820> get<00:00:23.939> into<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:25.140> control<00:00:25.529> over

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
we we get into that we have control over

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.120 
we we get into that we have control over
that<00:00:26.010> we<00:00:26.099> don't<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.519> control<00:00:26.760> over<00:00:27.000> and

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
that we don't have control over and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.980 
that we don't have control over and
things<00:00:29.130> like<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:30.779> very

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
things like that and so that can very

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.240 
things like that and so that can very
definitely<00:00:31.349> change<00:00:31.679> our<00:00:31.830> life<00:00:32.009> for<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
definitely change our life for the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.770 
definitely change our life for the
better<00:00:32.489> or<00:00:32.759> change<00:00:33.000> our<00:00:33.180> life<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.540> worse

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
better or change our life for the worse

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.049 
better or change our life for the worse
we<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.290> stuck<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.980> negative<00:00:35.460> patterns<00:00:35.910> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
we can be stuck in negative patterns of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.150 
we can be stuck in negative patterns of
thought<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.570> or<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.770> break<00:00:37.950> out<00:00:38.129> of

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
thought and or we can break out of

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.900 
thought and or we can break out of
patterns<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.530> decide<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.950> fix<00:00:41.160> our<00:00:41.489> minds

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
patterns we can decide to fix our minds

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.340 
patterns we can decide to fix our minds
on<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> different<00:00:42.360> pattern<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.870> thought<00:00:43.079> and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
on a different pattern of thought and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.529 
on a different pattern of thought and
obviously<00:00:43.739> then<00:00:44.370> there<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> intellect

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
obviously then there is the intellect

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.290 
obviously then there is the intellect
and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.620> huge<00:00:46.829> range<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.489> possibilities

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and then the huge range of possibilities

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.970 
and then the huge range of possibilities
that<00:00:48.480> are<00:00:48.510> open<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.960> us<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.500> through<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
that are open to us and through the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.959 
that are open to us and through the
human<00:00:50.309> mind<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:51.320> also<00:00:52.320> feel<00:00:52.770> though<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.340> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
human mind I also feel though that it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.790 
human mind I also feel though that it
can<00:00:54.180> be<00:00:54.300> positive<00:00:54.780> or<00:00:54.870> negative<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> sense

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
can be positive or negative in the sense

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.830 
can be positive or negative in the sense
that<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> positive<00:00:57.149> thing<00:00:57.420> or<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that it can be a positive thing or a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.810 
that it can be a positive thing or a
negative<00:00:58.140> thing<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.780> place<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:01.140> lot<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
negative thing to to place a lot of

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.969 
negative thing to to place a lot of
import<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.059> lot<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.780> focus<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:05.090> your<00:01:06.090> mind<00:01:06.450> and

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
import a lot of focus on your mind and

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.830 
import a lot of focus on your mind and
how<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.220> affects<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.479> weren't<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
how that affects you and you weren't the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350 
how that affects you and you weren't the
world<00:01:10.020> around<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.520> think<00:01:11.880> sometimes

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
world around you and I think sometimes

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.030 
world around you and I think sometimes
people<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:12.930> focus<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.320> little<00:01:13.439> bit<00:01:13.650> too<00:01:13.860> much

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
people can focus a little bit too much

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.700 
people can focus a little bit too much
on<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> mind<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.850> consciousness<00:01:15.680> on<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
on the mind on consciousness on the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.550 
on the mind on consciousness on the
thoughts<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.310> they<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:18.509> feeling<00:01:19.350> on

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
thoughts that they have on feeling on

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.740 
thoughts that they have on feeling on
that<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.890> know<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.189> little<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:21.119> ego<00:01:21.479> their

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
conscious part of the mind and people

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.140 
conscious part of the mind and people
can<00:01:25.560> get<00:01:25.650> too<00:01:25.860> fixated<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.790> they<00:01:26.970> can

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
can get too fixated on that they can

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.819 
can get too fixated on that they can
feel<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.600> though<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.259> be-all<00:01:28.799> and

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
feel as though that is the be-all and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.039 
feel as though that is the be-all and
end-all<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.490> everything<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.180> they<00:01:30.329> are<00:01:30.630> just

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
end-all of everything that they are just

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.780 
end-all of everything that they are just
that<00:01:31.290> little<00:01:31.439> part<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.979> consciousness<00:01:32.610> and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
that little part of consciousness and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.219 
that little part of consciousness and
they<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:33.900> too<00:01:34.110> fixated<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:35.960> yeah<00:01:36.960> trying

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
they can get too fixated on yeah trying

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.460 
they can get too fixated on yeah trying
to<00:01:37.290> control<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.070> or<00:01:38.400> trying<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.600> change<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
to control that or trying to change the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.109 
to control that or trying to change the
way<00:01:40.560> they<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:41.040> or<00:01:41.250> they<00:01:41.520> study<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.000> other

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
way they think or they study the other

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.510 
way they think or they study the other
and<00:01:42.479> whereas<00:01:43.320> sometimes<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:44.040> important<00:01:44.490> to

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
and whereas sometimes it's important to

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.760 
and whereas sometimes it's important to
branch<00:01:44.790> out<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.149> bit<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.930> remember<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.619> we

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
branch out a bit and to remember that we

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
branch out a bit and to remember that we
are<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.640> mind<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.899> are<00:01:49.020> also

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
are not just the mind and we are also
