00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.880
 similarly warned extra golf 7 gp picks 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.590
 honestly it's almost the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.850
 Misunderstanding will monster as sees 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.060
 it is well over 500 at 165 170 ps 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.500
 newtonmeter and as I said only with 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.390
 a golf 7er camp controversial because us 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.519
 Nothing at all can not announce anything 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.120
 It goes on in the text always want 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:38.400
 more power the tracks roll more 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.339
 boost want more old print we want 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.049
 more hate in the car and usually when 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:47.809
 these names believe table is happening 

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:55.530
 what the game is about 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:57.900
 please, once is a bit small 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.100
 from the network helper network at daily always 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.059
 say very good 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.129
 this is a good country but brace 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.710
 technically and above all things 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.479
 flow box on the talks 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.820
 not a very important topic 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.979
 optimally not quite so nice 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.780
 not quite so chic because if I am the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.820
 position Young comes in then pushes only 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.009
 times never when led concrete ceiling and 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.049
 is rising here now is he can 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.869
 distribute well here in the net but if 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.490
 the box up as narrow as built here 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.329
 of course the more pressure that would be 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.100
 as well as you go with a garden 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.780
 a garden hose he is so thick and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.729
 an end of the garden 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.280
 will you times ten meters further through 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.530
 a garden hose through more pressure 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.359
 the pressure is not so cool because 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.359
 Then it does not cool so well 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.189
 I like this moment I always like 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:58.329
 you will believe them as much as I do 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:02:00.490
 what makes you so tall that you 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:05.310
 thinks more often 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.890
 yes, it is exactly it is it in any case 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.440
 once we have 50 percent more volume 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.230
 in the course of many in comparison to the series 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.690
 that's the next one we have 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.940
 ten percent more flow area 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.650
 that is also very good for it 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.390
 come that castor about me 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.370
 The air is rising here 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.519
 pure and even that is up 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.040
 shows the powerful pressure build-up 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.700
 totally the same in my work off in the 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.110
 box 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.120
 the boxes are really very important 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.860
 the failure is not alu either 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.830
 I can not take care 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.660
 Pressure loss is totally even plus 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.610
 more volume just a very high quality 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.200
 moisten 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.769
 he thinks of this giant big giant 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:52.810
 Hard is only 12 13 kilograms heavier 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.900
 as the series intercooler so now 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.880
 we have larger doorways to 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.019
 so much larger in principle 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.650
 garden hose already very good too 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.989
 describe 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.390
 all the bigger and at once yes 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.090
 do not fulfill any conditions and last but not least 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.859
 degrade because cold air is but 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.740
 even a thousand times declared to 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.930
 videos 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.450
 The lay often the more we can the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.370
 mixed with air we have more 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.720
 Oxygen can be more gasoline and 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.120
 inflict and thus have more 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.210
 performance so load air temperature below 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.010
 is getting is important but it comes 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.910
 recorded 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:32.100
 this fails in the new porsche 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.070
 the temptation awaits me and myself 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:43.080
 I expect only the intercooler 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:47.280
 from the modification to 15 ps 15 18 ps 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.380
 maybe 20 something in the area without 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.280
 a new vote 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.560
 we'll be back in a bit 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.300
 stand work with it also afterwards 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:00.440
 really funny 33 should attack it 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.120
 stage 3 is completed and accordingly 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.940
 that they can get well over because I 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.940
 this year still wants four ps 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:17.040
 I always believe exactly like me 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.640
 that's what she does so you actually hear 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.640
 more often
