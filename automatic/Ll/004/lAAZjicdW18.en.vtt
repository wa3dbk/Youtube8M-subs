younger<00:02:57.430> daughters<00:02:57.730> would<00:02:57.880> certainly<00:02:58.150> want

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
younger daughters would certainly want

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.880 
younger daughters would certainly want
one<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.510> these<00:02:58.690> things<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.170> let's<00:02:59.530> face<00:02:59.650> I'll

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
one of these things and let's face I'll

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.380 
one of these things and let's face I'll
be<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.160> one<00:03:00.220> picking<00:03:00.490> on<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.730> top<00:03:00.940> as<00:03:01.090> well

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
be the one picking on the top as well

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.180 
be the one picking on the top as well
so<00:03:01.510> would<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:01.750> let<00:03:01.930> them<00:03:02.050> hover<00:03:02.140> well<00:03:02.830> I<00:03:02.860> think<00:03:02.980> I

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
so would I let them hover well I think I

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.890 
so would I let them hover well I think I
probably<00:03:03.340> would<00:03:03.550> because<00:03:03.820> it's<00:03:04.420> incredibly

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
probably would because it's incredibly

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.470 
probably would because it's incredibly
maneuverable<00:03:05.470> it's<00:03:06.160> light<00:03:06.490> and<00:03:06.760> but<00:03:07.270> more

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
maneuverable it's light and but more

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.040 
maneuverable it's light and but more
than<00:03:07.630> anything<00:03:07.900> it's<00:03:08.500> just<00:03:08.800> fun
