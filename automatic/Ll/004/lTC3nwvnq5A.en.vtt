the same string the a string we're going
to<00:03:00.379> play<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.650> G<00:03:00.860> where<00:03:01.129> we<00:03:01.280> just<00:03:01.519> did<00:03:01.760> before

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
to play the G where we just did before

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.229 
to play the G where we just did before
on<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.989> 17th<00:03:03.500> fret<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.950> D<00:03:04.040> string<00:03:04.239> and

on the 17th fret of the D string and

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.910 
on the 17th fret of the D string and
this<00:03:05.420> time<00:03:05.659> and<00:03:05.840> that's<00:03:06.140> with<00:03:06.379> our<00:03:06.500> second

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
this time and that's with our second

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.710 
this time and that's with our second
finger<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.400> then<00:03:07.610> this<00:03:08.060> time<00:03:08.239> with<00:03:08.390> our<00:03:08.480> first

finger and then this time with our first
finger<00:03:08.840> we're<00:03:09.260> going<00:03:09.379> to<00:03:09.470> play

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.360 

the<00:03:13.010> 16th<00:03:13.460> fret<00:03:13.760> of<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.000> g<00:03:14.540> string<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:19.250> now

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
the 16th fret of the g string so now

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:29.040 
the 16th fret of the g string so now
you've<00:03:19.520> done<00:03:19.670> this

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.140 

three<00:03:29.830> ways<00:03:30.070> of<00:03:30.460> playing<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.600> same<00:03:31.870> arpeggio

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
three ways of playing the same arpeggio

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.520 
three ways of playing the same arpeggio
you<00:03:34.150> might<00:03:34.360> be<00:03:34.510> asking<00:03:34.870> well<00:03:35.050> what's<00:03:35.350> the

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
you might be asking well what's the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.490 
you might be asking well what's the
point<00:03:35.770> in<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:35.980> well<00:03:37.050> there's<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.170> hell<00:03:38.320> of<00:03:38.350> a

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
point in that well there's a hell of a

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.600 
point in that well there's a hell of a
lot<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.680> point<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.310> because<00:03:41.220> once<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.400> know

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
lot of point to it because once you know

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.880 
lot of point to it because once you know
those<00:03:42.880> shapes<00:03:43.240> you<00:03:43.870> can<00:03:44.050> take<00:03:44.320> them<00:03:44.560> anywhere

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
those shapes you can take them anywhere

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:53.850 
those shapes you can take them anywhere
on<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.250> neck<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:52.230> then<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.350> can<00:03:53.530> start<00:03:53.740> to

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
on the neck and then you can start to

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:03.690 
on the neck and then you can start to
link<00:03:54.130> them<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:02.230> then<00:04:02.890> you<00:04:03.040> can<00:04:03.220> start<00:04:03.460> to<00:04:03.670> see

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
link them and then you can start to see

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.830 
link them and then you can start to see
how<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:05.440> could<00:04:05.710> really<00:04:06.070> help<00:04:06.400> you<00:04:06.810> when<00:04:07.810> it

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
how this could really help you when it

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.040 
how this could really help you when it
comes<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.410> improvising<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:10.150> it<00:04:10.480> also<00:04:10.660> really

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
comes to improvising and it also really

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.450 
comes to improvising and it also really
helps<00:04:11.110> you<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.560> get<00:04:11.710> a<00:04:11.740> grounding<00:04:12.250> of<00:04:12.400> the

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
helps you to get a grounding of the

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:19.410 
helps you to get a grounding of the
whole<00:04:13.210> fretboard<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:15.330> that's<00:04:16.330> what<00:04:18.209> this<00:04:19.209> is

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
whole fretboard and that's what this is

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.840 
whole fretboard and that's what this is
really<00:04:19.600> all<00:04:19.750> about<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:21.220> that's<00:04:21.459> that's

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
really all about so that's that's

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.820 
really all about so that's that's
today's<00:04:22.710> today's<00:04:23.710> little<00:04:24.040> tip<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:25.680> there<00:04:26.680> is

to<00:04:57.100> master<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.700> fretboard<00:04:58.440> okay<00:04:59.440> so<00:05:00.100> I<00:05:00.130> hope

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
to master the fretboard okay so I hope

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.880 
to master the fretboard okay so I hope
that's<00:05:00.550> very<00:05:00.820> useful<00:05:01.030> to<00:05:01.419> you<00:05:01.570> and<00:05:01.750> my<00:05:02.650> last

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
that's very useful to you and my last

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.550 
that's very useful to you and my last

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
point is do not forget that these shapes

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.190 
point is do not forget that these shapes
can<00:05:08.560> translate<00:05:09.220> anywhere<00:05:09.730> on<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:09.970> fretboard

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.930 

you<00:05:14.200> know<00:05:14.350> it<00:05:14.500> doesn't<00:05:14.710> have<00:05:15.070> to<00:05:15.250> be<00:05:15.280> from<00:05:15.760> the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
you know it doesn't have to be from the

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
of the E string we can play the C major

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.130 
of the E string we can play the C major
from<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.200> 3rd<00:05:23.440> fret<00:05:23.800> of<00:05:26.460> blv<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.490> string<00:05:27.970> to<00:05:28.240> of

from the 3rd fret of blv a string to of

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:36.240 
from the 3rd fret of blv a string to of
course<00:05:29.700> it's<00:05:30.700> a<00:05:30.790> big<00:05:30.970> stretch<00:05:32.100> but<00:05:35.010> but<00:05:36.010> once

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
course it's a big stretch but but once

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.470 
course it's a big stretch but but once
you<00:05:36.430> get<00:05:36.580> used<00:05:36.790> to<00:05:36.880> it<00:05:36.970> once<00:05:37.210> you<00:05:37.300> recognize

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
you get used to it once you recognize
