in Hong Kong this is a figure that I'm

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.379 
in Hong Kong this is a figure that I'm
really<00:00:14.160> looking<00:00:14.460> forward<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:15.059> it's<00:00:15.179> going

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
really looking forward to it it's going

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.590 
really looking forward to it it's going
to<00:00:15.450> be<00:00:15.540> probably<00:00:15.780> one<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.529> my<00:00:17.340> most<00:00:17.699> favorites

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
combat-ready suit and this is a first

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.359 
combat-ready suit and this is a first
look<00:00:30.240> video<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.689> show<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.140> what<00:00:31.619> exactly<00:00:31.650> it

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
look video to show you what exactly it

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.729 
look video to show you what exactly it
does<00:00:32.399> look<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:32.880> now<00:00:33.750> those<00:00:34.290> who<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.559> seen

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
does look like now those who have seen

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.729 
does look like now those who have seen
the<00:00:34.829> Python<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.460> has<00:00:35.610> hot<00:00:36.540> breaker<00:00:36.899> legs<00:00:37.140> added

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
the Python it has hot breaker legs added

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.670 
the Python it has hot breaker legs added
on<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> Python<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.870> on<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
on to the Python and on that it's a

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.400 
on to the Python and on that it's a
completely<00:00:41.190> new<00:00:41.700> suits<00:00:42.059> that's<00:00:42.420> why<00:00:42.690> I'm<00:00:42.960> so

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.090 
completely new suits that's why I'm so
stoked<00:00:43.860> for<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.300> color<00:00:45.300> schemes<00:00:45.629> greats<00:00:46.100> now

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
stoked for this color schemes greats now

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.830 
stoked for this color schemes greats now
just<00:00:47.460> some<00:00:47.610> background<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.420> guys<00:00:48.570> now

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
just some background for you guys now

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.459 
just some background for you guys now
the<00:00:48.899> heartbreaker<00:00:49.649> has<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.309> large<00:00:51.469> unusually

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
the heartbreaker has a large unusually

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.850 
the heartbreaker has a large unusually
oversized<00:00:53.420> operetta<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:55.260> reason<00:00:55.649> for<00:00:55.800> that

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
oversized operetta the reason for that

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.490 
oversized operetta the reason for that
is<00:00:56.070> because<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.520> can<00:00:56.640> actually<00:00:56.879> generate

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
is because it can actually generate

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.410 
is because it can actually generate
according<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.010> Marvel<00:00:59.699> books<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.270> can

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
according to the the Marvel books it can

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.660 
according to the the Marvel books it can
generate<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.989> shield<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.859> force<00:01:02.280> field<00:01:02.489> around

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
generate a shield a force field around

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.240 
generate a shield a force field around
itself<00:01:03.239> as<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> defense<00:01:03.840> mechanism<00:01:04.129> along<00:01:05.129> with

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
itself as a defense mechanism along with

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.940 
itself as a defense mechanism along with
that<00:01:05.339> ax<00:01:05.400> can<00:01:05.640> fire<00:01:05.880> blasters<00:01:06.540> etc<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.470> those

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
that ax can fire blasters etc so those

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.710 
that ax can fire blasters etc so those
who<00:01:08.189> are<00:01:08.400> interested<00:01:08.850> there's<00:01:09.420> actually<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
who are interested there's actually a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.840 
who are interested there's actually a
reason<00:01:10.170> for<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.830> those<00:01:11.130> four<00:01:11.490> silver

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
reason for that and those four silver

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.929 
reason for that and those four silver
costs<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:13.049> there<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.439> hold<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:14.520> powerful

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
costs is there to hold that powerful

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.380 
costs is there to hold that powerful
energy<00:01:15.689> source<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.140> place<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
energy source in place so this is a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.020 
energy source in place so this is a
quick<00:01:18.570> level<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.900> box<00:01:19.159> very<00:01:20.159> similar<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
quick level of box very similar to the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.109 
quick level of box very similar to the
silver<00:01:21.360> Centurion<00:01:22.490> pump<00:01:23.490> back<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> little<00:01:23.939> bit

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
silver Centurion pump back a little bit

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.969 
silver Centurion pump back a little bit
and<00:01:24.360> I'm<00:01:24.450> afraid<00:01:24.750> there's<00:01:25.020> are<00:01:25.170> no<00:01:25.470> extras

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
and I'm afraid there's are no extras

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.370 
and I'm afraid there's are no extras
whatsoever<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:27.360> literally<00:01:27.720> two<00:01:28.049> pairs<00:01:28.290> of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
whatsoever it's literally two pairs of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.109 
whatsoever it's literally two pairs of
hands<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.780> repulsor<00:01:31.770> hands<00:01:32.119> articulated

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
hands the repulsor hands articulated

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.200 
hands the repulsor hands articulated
hands<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.470> fisted<00:01:34.860> hands<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:36.000> base

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
hands and the fisted hands and the base

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.760 
hands and the fisted hands and the base
now<00:01:36.540> those<00:01:36.720> were<00:01:36.960> standards<00:01:37.590> aren't<00:01:37.829> already

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
now those were standards aren't already

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.289

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.539 
accessories so just confirmed there are
no<00:01:42.479> accessories<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.320> figure<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.890> don't

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
no accessories for this figure I don't

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.130 
no accessories for this figure I don't
even<00:01:44.610> need<00:01:44.850> any<00:01:45.030> because<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.570> look<00:01:45.840> at<00:01:45.960> how

sections lift upwards very similar to

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.120 
sections lift upwards very similar to
the<00:02:00.030> mark<00:02:00.270> 42<00:02:00.720> very<00:02:01.560> similar<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
the mark 42 very similar to the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.480 
the mark 42 very similar to the
Warmachine<00:02:03.259> mark<00:02:04.259> 2<00:02:04.470> as<00:02:04.619> well<00:02:04.830> so<00:02:05.070> those<00:02:05.190> lift
