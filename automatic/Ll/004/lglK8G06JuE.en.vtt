the<00:00:04.630> squirt<00:00:04.990> stroke<00:00:05.320> is<00:00:05.500> a<00:00:05.530> stroke<00:00:05.890> that

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.100 
the squirt stroke is a stroke that

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.770 
the squirt stroke is a stroke that
allows<00:00:06.370> you<00:00:06.580> to<00:00:06.670> get<00:00:06.819> vertical<00:00:07.120> on<00:00:07.359> your<00:00:07.480> Stern

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:07.780 
allows you to get vertical on your Stern

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.110 
allows you to get vertical on your Stern
it's<00:00:08.680> a<00:00:08.830> great<00:00:09.070> stroke<00:00:09.400> for<00:00:09.670> weight<00:00:09.850> over<00:00:10.090> the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
it's a great stroke for weight over the

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.390 
it's a great stroke for weight over the
boat<00:00:10.360> leading<00:00:10.870> with<00:00:10.960> your<00:00:11.080> body<00:00:11.400> combining

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
boat leading with your body combining

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.580 
boat leading with your body combining
the<00:00:12.519> back<00:00:12.700> sweep<00:00:13.030> the<00:00:13.750> squirt<00:00:14.050> stroke<00:00:14.320> really

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
the back sweep the squirt stroke really

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.289 
the back sweep the squirt stroke really
more<00:00:14.889> than<00:00:15.040> anything<00:00:15.250> is<00:00:15.519> just<00:00:15.700> a<00:00:15.790> back<00:00:16.000> sweep

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
more than anything is just a back sweep

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.870 
more than anything is just a back sweep
with<00:00:16.540> a<00:00:16.570> different<00:00:17.230> edge<00:00:17.320> control<00:00:17.849> so<00:00:18.849> far

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
with a different edge control so far

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.760 
with a different edge control so far
with<00:00:19.390> our<00:00:19.420> edge<00:00:19.690> in<00:00:19.990> the<00:00:20.080> back<00:00:20.260> sweeps<00:00:20.560> we've

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
with our edge in the back sweeps we've

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.260 
with our edge in the back sweeps we've
been<00:00:20.920> keeping<00:00:21.070> our<00:00:21.340> boat<00:00:21.490> pretty<00:00:21.670> flat<00:00:22.000> have<00:00:22.240> a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
been keeping our boat pretty flat have a

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.450 
been keeping our boat pretty flat have a
week<00:00:22.480> or<00:00:22.900> even<00:00:23.109> leaning<00:00:23.590> towards<00:00:23.890> the<00:00:24.010> inside

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
week or even leaning towards the inside

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.269 
week or even leaning towards the inside
when<00:00:25.390> we<00:00:25.420> were<00:00:25.570> doing<00:00:25.840> the<00:00:26.020> reverse<00:00:26.980> sweep

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
when we were doing the reverse sweep

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.130 
when we were doing the reverse sweep
drill<00:00:27.609> now<00:00:28.420> we're<00:00:28.660> going<00:00:28.750> to<00:00:28.840> be<00:00:28.960> doing

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
drill now we're going to be doing

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.330 
drill now we're going to be doing
something<00:00:29.619> unique<00:00:29.769> we're<00:00:30.100> going<00:00:30.220> to<00:00:30.279> be

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
something unique we're going to be

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.140 
something unique we're going to be
leaning<00:00:30.670> away<00:00:30.850> from<00:00:31.150> the<00:00:31.570> paddle<00:00:31.930> stroke<00:00:32.169> who

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
leaning away from the paddle stroke who

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.460 
leaning away from the paddle stroke who
sounds<00:00:34.150> a<00:00:34.180> little<00:00:34.239> complicated<00:00:34.900> but<00:00:35.170> it's<00:00:35.230> not

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
sounds a little complicated but it's not

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.140 
sounds a little complicated but it's not
really<00:00:35.710> that<00:00:35.739> hard<00:00:36.129> there's<00:00:36.430> a<00:00:36.489> little<00:00:36.879> drill

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
really that hard there's a little drill

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.869 
really that hard there's a little drill
you<00:00:37.300> can<00:00:37.330> use<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:38.170> help<00:00:38.379> you<00:00:38.559> get<00:00:39.339> the<00:00:39.489> balance

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
you can use to help you get the balance

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.240 
you can use to help you get the balance
and<00:00:40.059> learn<00:00:40.239> how<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.479> do<00:00:40.659> it<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.890> just<00:00:42.129> the

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
and learn how to do it it's just the

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.860 
and learn how to do it it's just the
back<00:00:42.430> sweep<00:00:42.729> what<00:00:42.909> is<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:43.089> back<00:00:43.239> sweep<00:00:43.479> looks

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
back sweep what is it back sweep looks

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.670 
back sweep what is it back sweep looks
like<00:00:44.019> that<00:00:44.229> right

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
like that right

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.799 
like that right
all<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.100> way<00:00:45.190> at<00:00:45.309> the<00:00:45.400> stern<00:00:45.640> but<00:00:46.570> we're<00:00:46.720> going

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
all the way at the stern but we're going

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.259 
all the way at the stern but we're going
to<00:00:46.900> drop<00:00:47.049> our<00:00:47.260> outside<00:00:47.620> edge<00:00:48.059> check<00:00:49.059> this

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
to drop our outside edge check this

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.590 
to drop our outside edge check this
drill<00:00:49.510> out<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:49.780> start<00:00:50.049> like<00:00:50.229> this<00:00:50.610> rotate<00:00:51.610> drop

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
drill out to start like this rotate drop

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.250 
drill out to start like this rotate drop
your<00:00:52.809> edge<00:00:53.040> rotate<00:00:54.040> drop<00:00:54.790> your<00:00:55.000> edge<00:00:55.260> rotate

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
your edge rotate drop your edge rotate

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.039 
your edge rotate drop your edge rotate
drop<00:00:56.890> your<00:00:57.100> edge<00:00:57.250> try<00:00:58.030> that<00:00:58.239> on<00:00:58.330> both<00:00:58.479> sides

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
drop your edge try that on both sides

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.009 
drop your edge try that on both sides
rotate<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.559> drop<00:00:59.949> your<00:01:00.159> edge<00:01:00.570> rotate<00:01:01.570> drop

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
your edge rotate drop your edge I think

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.690 
your edge rotate drop your edge I think
we're<00:01:06.400> ready

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
we're ready

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.090 
we're ready
that<00:01:07.659> drill<00:01:07.930> gets<00:01:08.170> you<00:01:08.289> ready<00:01:08.409> for<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.740> squirt

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
that drill gets you ready for the squirt

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.179 
that drill gets you ready for the squirt
so<00:01:09.310> then<00:01:09.460> once<00:01:09.640> you're<00:01:10.020> absolutely<00:01:11.189> convinced

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
so then once you're absolutely convinced

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.130 
so then once you're absolutely convinced
that<00:01:12.250> you<00:01:12.430> can<00:01:12.609> drop<00:01:12.850> that<00:01:13.090> outside<00:01:13.509> edge<00:01:13.750> as

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
that you can drop that outside edge as

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.249 
that you can drop that outside edge as
you<00:01:14.250> put<00:01:15.250> your<00:01:15.280> River<00:01:15.789> sweep<00:01:16.149> in<00:01:16.359> you're<00:01:17.020> ready

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
you put your River sweep in you're ready

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.090 
you put your River sweep in you're ready
to<00:01:17.530> drop<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.950> outside<00:01:18.310> edge<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:20.039> squirt<00:01:21.039> it

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
to drop the outside edge and squirt it

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.209 
to drop the outside edge and squirt it
in<00:01:21.159> a<00:01:21.250> circle<00:01:21.640> like<00:01:21.729> so<00:01:21.899> super<00:01:22.899> cool<00:01:23.219> alright

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
in a circle like so super cool alright

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.190 
in a circle like so super cool alright
so<00:01:24.880> now<00:01:25.000> we<00:01:25.060> have<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.270> mechanics<00:01:25.810> behind<00:01:25.899> the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
so now we have the mechanics behind the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.990 
so now we have the mechanics behind the
squirt<00:01:26.500> stroke<00:01:26.829> there's<00:01:27.549> something<00:01:27.969> that

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
squirt stroke there's something that

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.760 
squirt stroke there's something that
helps<00:01:28.359> make<00:01:28.509> this<00:01:28.689> thing<00:01:28.899> easier<00:01:29.109> and<00:01:29.710> that's

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
helps make this thing easier and that's

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.649 
helps make this thing easier and that's
if<00:01:30.009> you<00:01:30.100> have<00:01:30.130> forward<00:01:30.609> speed<00:01:30.939> when<00:01:31.179> you<00:01:31.270> start

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
if you have forward speed when you start

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.169 
if you have forward speed when you start
and<00:01:31.929> then<00:01:32.530> rotate<00:01:32.979> your<00:01:33.130> boat<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.490> 90<00:01:33.820> degrees

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
and then rotate your boat to 90 degrees

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.690 
and then rotate your boat to 90 degrees
when<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.109> get<00:01:35.289> to<00:01:35.409> 90<00:01:35.679> degrees<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:36.280> oncoming

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
when you get to 90 degrees the oncoming

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.219 
when you get to 90 degrees the oncoming
water<00:01:37.030> is<00:01:37.240> going<00:01:37.390> to<00:01:37.450> help<00:01:37.630> push<00:01:37.869> that<00:01:38.049> edge

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
water is going to help push that edge

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.630 
water is going to help push that edge
underwater<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:38.890> make<00:01:38.979> this<00:01:39.100> squirt<00:01:39.399> even

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
underwater and make this squirt even

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.940 
underwater and make this squirt even
easier<00:01:40.109> so<00:01:41.109> to<00:01:41.200> do<00:01:41.409> that<00:01:41.619> you're<00:01:41.740> gonna<00:01:41.799> get

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
easier so to do that you're gonna get

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.639 
easier so to do that you're gonna get
some<00:01:42.009> forward<00:01:42.520> speed<00:01:42.850> first<00:01:43.439> then<00:01:44.439> you're

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
some forward speed first then you're

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.609 
some forward speed first then you're
going<00:01:44.799> to<00:01:44.859> sweep<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.729> 90<00:01:46.119> degrees<00:01:46.479> drop<00:01:47.380> your

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
going to sweep the 90 degrees drop your

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.989
