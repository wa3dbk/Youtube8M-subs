00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:04.810
 it's a 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.560
 and 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.960
 j-ch 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.410
 all 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.489
 the albums I made is a 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.930
 compromise I try new 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.739
 things 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.550
 work a little with their rock the 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.890
 daube step and then and this is this album 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.379
 not really listen to anyone 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.720
 am fast and eat really because 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.619
 I love music you're ready 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.770
 The way 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.180
 I realized some things and then I 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.530
 am really told this place is not going the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.080
 to do for no one but me 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.119
 and then for the slots and then is this 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.119
 as I say people are happy they 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.190
 we feel 6 cm and when I see 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.470
 anyway fans if ever the 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.020
 same song time that comes back these cats 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.819
 it's fun to have sure because 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.319
 that usually on a kind album the 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:32.600
 three singles that the world are really going 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.700
 liked the score each person in his 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.100
 song as we have been I did a 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.590
 good job 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.590
 normal is for my specific good 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.010
 she leaves 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.010
 to the summary 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.570
 Hi 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.560
 spend 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.480
 what are you saying on this album 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.830
 that they have never dared to say before it's 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.450
 what first to slim is more for 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.590
 that I never said but the way of the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.840
 say 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.640
 it's if I want to say it 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.030
 fuck board a little bit of frustration 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.319
 there in the album precisely due to the fact 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.180
 that we are stuck since these 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.640
 injustices why do not I want 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.470
 play the victim in may the e-book things 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.930
 unrighteous 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.110
 the world of music like any 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.599
 what there are gamiq cgem sas to others 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.540
 make a charbonneau commission on 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.890
 the acquired sight seeing music for those who 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.030
 know all the hearings for this 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:45.120
 that they are cliques take a little 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.650
 dream somewhere I think then we 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.790
 is not in this technique the bone is 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.819
 what do not like so we are 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.170
 marginal people we have our own 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.329
 brother we are not machines on 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.069
 is organized to files it's not 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.079
 things I've never said but that's it 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.940
 the way I say them I was really going 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.980
 said for the moment they intend to put 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.860
 understand that it's direct frozen poetry 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.629
 in metaphors so that was necessary that he 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.879
 think about understanding g didier I want 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.709
 put a dlc more raw is more 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.849
 heavy but it's not free 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.430
 what would be surprised 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.970

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.910

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.840
 in 3d animation than that to the cinema for 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.430
 all the time or even often only drop

 my friends do not want to go but 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.569
 I love little guys at once 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.700
 wise to think but it comes to break the 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.010
 character that happens to have lost my 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.180
 credibility 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.500
